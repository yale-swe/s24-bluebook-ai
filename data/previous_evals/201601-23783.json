   "comments": [
    "Basic physics class. Professor Krusberg's focus on good teaching was wonderful, but her answering every question that came up made class move quite slowly. A good option if you're not a physics major but need to take physics.",
    "Definitely! Physics is the best.",
    "You probably need to take this course, be sure to shop both sections, I am glad I switched to Krusberg's section!!",
    "Without Prof. Krusberg, I can't say much about the course. It's second semester physics. It is what it is.",
    "Can't quite give a recommendation since Professor Krusberg is leaving, and without her this class could definitely be a bit dry. However, the material covered really gives you a great understanding of how the universe works on a grand scale as well as on a subatomic one.",
    "if you took ap physics in high school (e&m, that is) then though this will not be a cakewalk it will not be ruthless. if you have only a year of standard or \"accelerated\" (but not \/really\/ accelerated, you know what i mean) physics, this will not be ruthless for you either but it will be tough, and you should prepare to take the time to really learn what is going on. doing the reading is a must. this class is a prerequisite for all sorts of things so i don't really have to convince you to take it, but this is definitely the one to take if you had limited physics exposure in high school (170\/171 are also worth considering if you're into bio however).",
    "Eh.",
    "great, yes, though be wary of which professor you get. physics 181 varies a lot",
    "Lots of interesting must-know material in physics. Not terribly difficult at all. Could be fun depending on how it's taught. Professor Krusberg's methods weren't suited to how I like to learn but many others enjoyed it very much.",
    "Don't take it for fun. It's not fun. It's fine. You'll get over it. Should've been a history major.",
    "If you can get it with zosia take it!",
    "This really depends if electricity and magnetism are your thing... For me, this was an inherently boring course; the subject matter really has no pizzazz. What was important for me was the enthusiasm and care of Professor Krusberg. I appreciated that the course wasn't completely \"flipped classroom.\" There was a good balance of some lecturing and some group discussion. I would recommend it only if you need it as a requirement. Also, I think which professor you have really makes a difference. I'm happy I chose professor Krusberg.",
    "It's a good class for those people who will be needing it for a major. I think the quality of your experience depends greatly on the professor that you get so definitely shop the class and see what your options are.",
    "Phys 181 is a typical intro physics class. It's essentially the same thing as a high school AP physics class, and it wasn't much harder than a typical high school course, at least for the class I took in high school.",
    "PHYS 181 was a great course with Prof Krusberg. The bigger class size this semester made it harder to have productive classes and to interact with her, but was nonetheless a good course.",
    "If you are looking for a good second semester of intro physics, whether you took 200 or 180, definitely consider this one! This is not a flipped classroom. The instructor explains the material so clearly that whether or not you are seasoned in physics there is always something you can take away. The collaboration among students is also strongly encouraged. The instructor (Zosia Krusberg) used her expertise in education and likable personality to the best so that students get a lot of attention. I would say it's the epitome of Yale education in intro science classes.",
    "E&M is harder than mechanics and less interesting because it's just so confusing and seems abstract. Physics is physics and this is the basic intro one.",
    "This is an excellent class. It made me love physics. Professor Krusberg was amazing. That is all.",
    "Manageable for those without any physics background, but would be a little challenging. Overall good course that covered a wide range of topics.",
    "I took 180 and this class for fun, as I was very into physics in high school, but most of you would be taking it as a compulsory course. In selecting subclasses, you should compare the teaching styles of the lecturers. Each subclass has its own material, homework, and exams. If you are looking for more challenging assignments and exams, take Prof Padnamaban's class (if he's still teaching 180). I thoroughly enjoyed it but less capable students may find it daunting. For students who feel they need more support, Zosia is your ideal teacher. She explains concepts very clearly and her class environment is more interactive and accommodating.",
    "This course is for someone who has some background in physics and who has perhaps taken it in high school. Most of the class consists of those doing it for their major and those taking it to try it out are more in the minority. Physics is a hard subject so definitely be prepared to put in a lot of outside of the classroom time.",
    "This course moves at a slow pace, and felt much like a highs school class. A lot of attention was given to telling students to be quiet; students were told to not worry about the mathematics if it seemed too hard; a lot of time was spent on students' general well-being.",
    "Harder than 180, very fast passed, graded strangely.",
    "I mean, it's Physics. It is a necessary evil. While the course can be incredibly interesting, it can also be incredibly challenging. I would only take this course if you either a) Have to. b) Have a strong interest in Physics. c) Professor Krusberg is teaching it. Oh my God, she is amazing.",
    "181 is a fine class -- it's not too much work, and you cover some interesting material. Exams are harder than the rest of the class, but very doable. The topics are also standard enough that it's easy to find extra resources online. You should have a conceptual understanding of integration (line integration, surface integration, etc.), but the actual mechanics of the calculations won't occupy most of your time. Take this class if you need to, or if you don't but want to learn some pretty interesting things about the way the world works.",
    "Be careful with the prof you're taking this with. Zosia won't be here in the future (and Yale's physics dept is really taking a hit by losing her), so read the evals carefully when you're deciding who to take this class with. On the whole, the physics dept kind of sucks until you get to upper level stuff (i.e. 260 and up), so just stick it out and you'll be fine. At the very least, the TEAL thing is sort of nice because you can bond with everyone else at your table over how lost and confused you are. But it's up to you to pay attention in lecture.",
    "I would very much recommend this to any student, STEM or non-STEM.",
    "I did not enjoy this class as much as I wish I had and as much as I enjoyed other classes from this semester, but it was required. So for a required class it was manageable.",
    "It was a tough course that was made as painless as possible by the Professor and the TAs. They worked very hard to work with us and educate us (I would recommend this to a fellow student).",
    "A pretty basic E&M course. It covers what you'd expect, nothing more, nothing less. I would recommend taking any possible class from Prof. Krusberg.",
    "only if they really really have to take it. Would recommend higher level physics if they have the background and if they don't, well that sucks for them because this class is really really hard to take if you never had AP physics in high school or whatnot",
    "Difficult class though that is typically expected of Electricity and Magnetism. Think of it as a more intensive, more multivariable calculus influenced AP Physics C. Is it doable? Yes, especially with the amazing professor and great TA's. The professor reformatted the way that the TA's help and that made this semester go a lot smoother, despite the more difficult material. Don't expect high grades without a strong mastery of the material, which I feel I was always on the cusp of and then there was a problem with a trick to it.",
    "I place to get a strong foundation in electricity and magnetism no matter what you want to end up studying.",
    "Difficult, but interesting",
    "Totally depends on the professor! Krusberg was awesome, but she's leaving next year :(",
    "You're likely taking physics because you have to, but it is a standard introduction course. If possible, try to get in the TEAL classroom as I found it more helpful for me as a learner. Professor Krusberg was a lovely professor who won't be teaching future courses, but to me, she definitely made the subject of physics more intriguing and special.",
    "Intro course for Physics. It's a good bases for many of the engineering core classes. Especially EE200.",
    "Don't take the course in a flipped classroom if you can avoid it. You would end up having to self-teach out of class.",
    "This class seemed pretty typical of an intro class. I would recommend the class to another student because I thought the material was manageable and made understandable and interesting by the professor. This physics class has a problem set every week, and study hall the night before it is due, which is a very helpful resource. There is reading every week which sometimes feels like a lot, but overall the workload isn't too much. I think this the best intro physics class to take and it still covers a very wide range of physics topics. It was engaging for me and made me want to continue taking physics.",
    "Zosia Krusberg is a goddess. Physics will never be the same",
    "It is a good physics course.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially if you find when you shop it that the teacher can handle the flipped classroom. If they can, it is really nice to have a more interactive class style. This class (and PHYS 180) made me love physics.",
    "wouldn't recommend but you probs have to take",
    "It's not great, but if you must, you must I guess. Math level is at the Math 112\/AB Calc level, though the questions on exams far outstrip high school physics (even for those with Physics C). Psets aren't that bad though. Class attendance is actually required (or was for us), so take that as you will. Pretty generic course",
    "This is one of the required courses for most people so I guess you'd have to take it anyway. My experience was I have never felt demotivated for a course as much as this one. PSets and exams were fine, but lectures just felt so tedious. That being said, professor Krusberg is pretty cool and manages to make a not so great class bearable and it is unfortunate that she is leaving after this year.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone even remotely thinking about a STEM field major. The professor was amazing and the material is easily relatable to real world problems.",
    "This course great, take it with Professor Krusberg if you can, because she makes it as painless as possible.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to. Also, make sure it's not flipped before you take it.",
    "Too bad you cannot take this with Krusberg anymore. Surprisingly this class is easier than 180, and Krusberg did not require any MATH 120 knowledge as stated in the description. It is hard to predict what the other professor will be like, but DO NOT be bullied into MATH 120 unnecessarily (like I was). You will get through, just choose a section where the professor takes time to explain concepts - not rushing through the fundamentals in fundamental to E&M physics.",
    "If you're looking to take an intro physics course, I would highly, highly recommend taking it with Professor Krusberg. She is genuinely dedicated to teaching well and helping all of her students, and her teaching style is very clear and easy to understand. Even in a class of over 100, I felt like she got to know most of us personally by the end of the semester. The classes are structured so you read the book ahead of time and fill in a pre-lecture feedback with your areas of confusion, and then she responds directly to those points in the next class and tries to make it more comprehensible. She offers lots of extra help during office hours and review sessions, as do the TAs. The tests are also very fair.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "Not bad. The course is semi-flipped classroom. You're expected to learn the material by reading the book, and each class is just a session of making sure everyone understands what's going on and practice problems. The course is not very challenging, and the workload is not overwhelming. The class can be frustrating, however, because it moves very slowly. Lectures are quite boring and unstimulating, since you spend most of your time listening to other people's questions which you may have absolutely no interest in hearing. And there are A LOT of questions. We don't cover much material each class. And Zosia's teaching style is very \"hold-your-hand,\" and this can be quite frustrating sometimes if you are the type of student who wants a fast-paced class where you're learning as much as you can fit into a course. But you're taking this probably because you're required to, so with that in mind, this class is really not that bad.",
    "It would have been the worst if Professor Krusberg hadn't been teaching it.",
    "Always bear in mind that intoductory physics at Yale tries to depend on the flipped classroom system, and physics material is very difficult to grasp by just reading them on your own before class. What I loved about this class is that Professor Krusberg would allocate class time to go over the topics that were confusing to most students, and would then proceed to solving example problems. The professor was very supportive and involved in our learning process. Physics 181 topics are quite interesting and are essential knowledge to pretty much any students who'd like to pursue a STEM field. I would recommend this course, especially if it's well taught, because it is essential knowledge.",
    "Not everyone like's Zosia's simple teaching style, they feel like it's dumbed down, but I found that by the end of two semesters I had a much better grasp of how to problem solve and think about physical problems. She's really nice and somehow gets to know everyone",
    "It is a challenging course, but the most important part is the critical thinking skills you will learn in the course of studying for it. Professor Krusberg is a great professor, and class was a worthwhile time for hearing lecture and working through concepts and quantitative problems in an active learning environment. Professor Krusberg will not be teaching it next year, but if there is an option between two sections, take the physics section that involves an active learning environment instead of the flipped classroom. The active learning part involves clickers and small group work, that at least when Professor Krusberg teaches it, is actually enjoyable and helpful to learning, and if the new professor for the class is anything like Professor Krusberg, you will not be sitting in class lost in the rush of concepts. It's a great class when a good professor teaches it, and many of the concepts have applications to the real world and many different majors.",
    "An excellent intro physics class with Prof. Krusberg. Made science interesting.",
    "You must take this section with Zosia Krusberg. It is the one course that fills this requirement that is practicing pedagogy from this century and actually puts the needs of the student first.",
    "Great course! A chill way to learn some physics if you don't think you have the time for 201 or another class.",
    "Professor Krusberg really helped change the way 180 and 181 were taught, making them much more accessible. Hopefully future teachers will continue this trend. Yale needs many more teachers like Professor Krusberg."
