    "not much",
    "It's hard to pinpoint specific skills\/knowledge gained, but the content of the course was good overall.",

    "A lot of knowledge about forest management and defining communities.",
    "Environmental justice topics for tropical forestry",
    "By taking this course, I have learned about how to use social science concepts to approach environmental problems.",
    "Different factors on social science in environmental studies",
    "Honestly, I'm unsure of the skills that I developed. But I enjoyed the conversations and it did get me to think more about the social science of natural resource management.",
    "Concept of justice, issues around community participation and engagement, development projects and the complexities associated with them especially in indigenous communities",
    "I was introduced to important concepts in environmental social science and political ecology that I had not been exposed to before. I feel that I understand more about trends that are leading to environmental problems and how they are related to the relationships among people about nature.",
    "I learned new perspectives in the environmental space. I learned about indigenous technical knowledge and how we have to think about solving problems in other ways other than win-win and optimization of win-lose.",
    "I enjoyed this as my first exposure to political ecology",
    "For a person with an engineering background who had never taken a social science class, it was an amazing introductive course. I learned a lot of concepts I would love to apply in my future work, most of them were about how to work with people and how to make projects more community-oriented.",
    "The materials are well selected to introduce deep thinking on the order behind environmental issues. Those ideas help me to view environmental issues in very different angle which contributes to achieve a more fundamental solution.",
    "systems thinking, importance of including communities while taking decisions, understanding the direct and indirect impacts of climate change, businesses on communities",
    "Analyze environmental problems from a social point of view. Think of the human dimensions of behavior, community and politics\/power as part of sustainability problems.",
    "Critical analysis of conservation and development programs through a political ecology lens Understanding of climate justice and environmental justice Participatory research and governance Multi-scalar governance"

The concepts that were introduced can be applied in any field one is planning to work in. Professors and TAs were wonderful and I truly enjoyed the process of learning.",
    "Beyond my expectation",
    "very well!",
    "Well, but some parts of the lecture were just copy-paste of the ELTI program so it feels like the instructors' logic is \"I did not prepare for the class so I am just going to teach this thing that I already have\"."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "too much content to cover in 8 weeks instructors need to change their style concepts were not dealt in detail in class. too much focus on case studies",
    "The course did a good job of communicating mostly interesting content. Very clear by breaking it up into 4 sections. Using the presentation material developed for online learning was effective - those were solid presentations with just the right amount of data. I appreciated the core concepts from the readings were covered in class. What could be improved? The essay question to exempt out of the class, or the awareness of what should qualify.",
    "I thought the course was a very effective vehicle for understanding the role of community engagement in an environmental managers profession. The course was very well-organized and followed a clear system. Would have liked to see some topics outside of forestry and involving other natural resources too.",
    "I think the class should have been more broad than just about forest management or forest restoration and more about other topics such as water, waste, land conservation, etc. The workload was manageable.",
    "If we can have more time to finish our Quiz 1 that would be great!",
    "The quizzes were a little long but amble Time was given to complete.",
    "Weaknesses: - too forestry focused - it was hard to make parallels into other fields - too international - there are many marginalized communities in the US and we did not discuss the nuanced approaches to these challenges - all the readings were very old and I didn't believe that they were still relevant to the field - essay quizzes were graded too harshly for people who were new to the social science field and not in forestry",
    "Strengths: Class participation, Instructors (both Eva and Amity) are very knowledgeable, polite and very flexible when it comes to assignments and their formats. The readings are really good and if you do not have any background in Climate justice and\/or political science this would be a good course to understand them when it comes to environment. Weakness: I was hoping to learn specific tools and techniques related to Community engagement such as Focus groups, Surveys, Interviews etc but the course does not deal with them. Maybe a class on how to facilitate and employ such tools\/techniques would help.",
    "The readings and presentations were a strength. It was rushed as a half semester class, but I felt that most of the readings were important for introducing me to key concepts. Some of the presentations about specific case studies were very long and technical, and it was easy to get lost in finding what was important. A weakness was the size of the class. With that many people, it was hard to have meaningful discussions that were not dominated by a few individuals. Many of the students were not engaged (not at fault of the instructors).",
    "Strengths: For me there were a lot of very new topics that were first time that Ive been introduced to them. Weaknesses: Some of the lectures were too much talking to us and then others were too much dependence on the students to generate conversations. I will say it is not easy thing to balance.",
    "I think this was run well as a half-semester course, my only feedback would be that the readings were quite lengthy for the time allocated for a 1-unit class which meant that I sometimes didn't make it through all the readings each week. I also wish there had been more of an attempt to find examples outside of forestry for those of us studying other aspects of the environment\/conservation.",
    "The lectures seemed to be shallower compared to the readings.",
    "strength: the class was well-organized weakness: The course should have combined the course materials to more problem-solving skills.",
    "strengths: helped develop a multidimensional perspective of environmental problems weakness: None!",
    "I like the discussions and openness to criticism in all forms. Some parts that used ELTI content are too specific to conservation and restoration practices and sometimes seem useless to students with other interests. Sometimes it also felt like \"criticizing the system\" just for the sake of it (in the form of everything is wrong regardless) instead of constructive critique with potential for devising solutions."

    "Try to exempt out - it's good content, but I'm sure you could use this course credit more effectively on your own.",

    "Plan reading schedule in early stage",
    "Definitely take it to develop a comprehensive understanding of environmental issues",
