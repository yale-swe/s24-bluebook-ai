    "This course covered a lot of ground quickly and usefully. It was nice to have such a comprehensive study of sustainability attempts in the developing world.",
    "Question 7: Ellen is one of the best professor's I've had; not only is she phenomenally well-versed and excited about the material, but she also takes interest in the well-being of her students and provided a very welcoming atmosphere in class. She's awesome.Question 10: I'm interested in sustainable urban development, and this course definitely showed me a lot of the challenges in that field. However, it's very heavy on case studies and the like, and I think it would be awesome to spend more time on proposed solutions and discussion of those solutions.",
    "I thought the material in this course was very interesting but it was not taught in the best way. The lectures seemed more to be straight facts and the same case studies were repeated. I would have enjoyed more applied scenarios and opportunities to engage in the subject matter. There was not a lot of work in this class and the readings were not helpful. There was one paper and it is unclear how excatly we will be graded.",
    "Ellen is a wonderful lecturer and a fascinating person--Temperance was also great as a TA. I think the course material is very important, and will only become more topical in the coming years!",
    "It is a great course",
    "It is a shame that the course will not be given next semester. Is a good course to learn a lot about real problems! Identify posible solutions that many cities are facing and connect this problems with best practice and sucessful projects around the world. I really learnt a lot.",
    "-the course lost structure at times, which is expected with a broad survey course but certainly introduced several interesting topics.",
    "Question 10 - The topic of urban sustainability is vitally important, and even though this instructor is poor and the class is being eliminated WE NEED MORE CLASSES ON THIS TOPIC.Question 5 - Students asked questions all the time, but I don't think any student all semester got their question out in its entirety without the instructor interrupting the student and giving a terse answer. Literally every question was interrupted.",
    "Re: Question 10This material is VERY important for students to be able to learn- there is nothing more important to the future of the environment than the sustainable development of the world's cities."

    "The wide range of topics covered was great. I also liked how the class emphasized creative solutions to the problems it raised. Ellen was a wonderful lecturer and very open to student direction in the class.",
    "It is very practical and down to the ground. It's a great course taught by experienced professor and the guest lecturers are great!",
    "The professor and the lectures; I heard the trips were good, but I could never make it.",
    "It was a course on cities and sustainability, which in my opinion is one of the most important topics in sustainability and urban design.",
    "The breadth of topics and issues covered, supported with ample statistics, and case studies.",
    "The subject matter was very interesting. Each class was a different topic that could have had its own semester long course.",
    "The lectures.",
    "It is the only course in FES and in Yale that gives an overview of the environmental chllanges confronted in the urban sphere. Its absence next year will be a grave loss to the school, and will leave a huge gap in solutions this school can provide for the most exacting problems of our times. Most environmental policy making today and in the future pertains to cities, that is where most of humanity already lives, where energy is most widely consumed, and where a change in living patterns in crucial for the sustainability of this planet. Not offering such a course is a disadvantage i'm not sure this school has any idea currently on how to overcome.",
    "Guest speaker are great.",
    "I get to know a lot about urban development in this course.",
    "-the variety of readings.",
    "I enjoyed the guest speakers we had.",
    "The subject matter -- Yale has too few graduate urban studies classes.",
    "Exposure to range of environmental issues in cities."

   "comments": [
    "There could be slightly fewer statistics in each lecture so they wouldn't have to be as rushed.",
    "More time spent discussing proposed solutions and acting like urban planner, which is what I was anticipating at the outset.",
    "The course was very survey like, and while I learned more about conditions in various parts of the world, there were few truly indepth case examples other than Singapore.",
    "The structure of the lectures and the different options of assignments. The style was a bit repetative after awhile.",
    "Nothing.",
    "I felt the class attempted to cover too many areas related to city development, and as a result the material was spread rather thinly over too many areas to really be of much benefit to a graduate student.",
    "The content is too general. More case study will give a deeper understanding of the topics.",
    "-some of the lectures tended to be tangential, however that can be expected at times.",
    "I think this course maybe needs more focus. Our readings were so varies because \"development in cities\" is such an enormous subject to tackle. I think this course could be divided into several courses.",
    "The material was presented too macro and was rather repetitive -- we didn't dive very far into specific topics or do any case studies.",
    "Lectures were interesting, but sort of unstructured. With fewer tangents and only relevant examples, time could have been used more efficiently and we could have gone deeper into each topic."
