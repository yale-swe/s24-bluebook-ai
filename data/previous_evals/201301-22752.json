    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Griffel's amazing and you'll learn more than most other classes.",
    "A lot of reading, but if you're interested in religious history, it's perfect for you.",
    "I would not really recommend Modern Middle East Studies 292 01 to a fellow student, unless they're super interested in the subject material. Even then, the course has the unfortunate tendency of going too broadly and not deeply into the material it explores.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the recent history of islam. this course is good as a follow up to professor Griffel's lecture course on Jihad and Fundamentalism.",
    "This was a great course! I highly recommend it."
