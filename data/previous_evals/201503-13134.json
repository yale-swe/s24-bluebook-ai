   "comments": [
    "Yes! I would recommend it. This is a course that is designed to talk about the other side of modernity our society has willingly ignored: that our progress has come at the expense of other groups.",
    "This course is about familiarizing students with fundamental texts of postcolonial theory and its intersection with topics, such as gender, religion, etc. I would highly recommend the course! It will challenge the way you think about the U.S.'s international relations and where our world is now, globally. It can be a bit depressing at times because you realize how messed up everything is, but we try to end with hope in what we can do about it through our own work. Love the course! EVERYONE should take it and especially those in the Jackson Institute...",
    "I would definitely recommend that every student take this course! It was the best sociology course I'd ever taken during the duration of my program, and really connected with all the students in the class. It was incredibly helpful for my work and research.",
    "I would recommend it anyone interested in or requiring a rigorous reading of POCO texts. It is not a course for those whose interests or research falls outside of its bounds - though it is a shame that such people will not be exposed to this important work.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it as it is an interesting class and is not overwhelming.",
    "Yes! This class changes the way you approach not only the social sciences, but academics in general (and even life!). Incredible class: Perfect reading list; inspiring fellow students; kind and helpful professor.",
    "A class wrestling with the problem of colonialism\/imperialism and its implications for Academic thought.",
    "yes for sure!"

   "comments": [
    "This course has helped me understand the colonial roots of theological\/epistemic violence against non-mainstream theologies and religious practices",
    "The course is somewhat geared to sociologists since the professor is in the sociology department, but this is not a bad thing. Professionally, it gets you to think about the place of a discipline and the way postcolonial theory can and should upset some of the foundations of that discipline. The course itself has certainly made me think more deeply about the categories I am using and the potential violences that may be produced from my research and how I can mitigate it.",
    "YES though perhaps too broadly and seemed to be overly concerned with a small group of students overwhelming concern with applicability to their projects.",
    "I learned of new sources to read to help with my thesis",
    "Very helpful as I thought through critique of my own discipline\/methodology. Came away with several concrete ideas on how to address the issues presented.",
    "Very needed for my professional background in policy. Crucial course. Hope to build onto it."
