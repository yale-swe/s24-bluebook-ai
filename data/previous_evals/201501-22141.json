    "FREN 150 was a challenging but rewarding class. It involves reading short stories and plays and watching movies and discussing their plots and main ideas. There is only a little bit of grammar, and most of it is review from other french courses. We wrote 4 750 word papers, took 3 tests and did two oral exams.",
    "French 150 is the fastest way a qualified student could possibly fulfill their language requirement, and probably the best way for someone with significant french background and looking to take some classes in it could start at Yale. I would tell anyone with a 5 on the AP to consider taking it. If people are working their way up the french ladder the recommendation seems pointless, they will take it if they take it.",
    "If you took French in high school and want a refresher, or feel that your teachers neglected to give you a solid grounding in grammar, or just want to develop greater facility in reading, writing, and speaking, take this class. The Yale French department is amazing, and you'll love your professor. The readings are funny, ironic, and interesting, too.",
    "This is a great language course for someone who has already taken French and wants to continue at an advanced level. You will definitely learn a lot!",
    "Lots of easy but tedious busywork, and many essays that can be hard to get through, all of which definitely will end up making you better at French. As with many language classes, not particularly fun, exciting or interesting, but worth taking if you want to improve your language skills.",
    "This class will certainly reinforce fundamental grammar concepts. If you feel like you are beyond needing step-by-step guidance through the language, however, I would suggest taking 160 instead. 150 can seem redundant if your skills are beyond the scope of the class."
