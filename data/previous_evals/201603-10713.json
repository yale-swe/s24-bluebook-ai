    "My writing skills improved so much through taking this course. Mr. Kreiner constantly challenged me to strive for more.",
    "It was interesting relating inequality to current things happening right now such as the Black Lives Matter movement. I really liked how our professor even changed up the reading mid-semester to incorporate more relevant occurrences related to inequality.",
    "The class helped with writing more concisely and clearly. The readings also were challenging, so we learned to read more effectively.",
    "By taking this course, I learnt how to effectively read academic resources and how to write academic research papers. I also learnt the nuts-and-bolts of MLA-style bibliography and in-text citation.",
    "By taking a class, I really learned a lot about the shortcomings associated with the capitalist system that make it difficult for us to attain equality. In general, the approaches and demands of many social justice warriors are not very pragmatic, and I've learned that while it is easy for us to call for equality, it is not necessarily easy to attain.",
    "Wrestling through more vigorous academic texts"

   "comments": [
    "I think that our P1 and P2s were very intensive and received lots of good feedback, however when we got to the P3, which was the most important, we received less feedback and were left to our own devices which I did not enjoy as much. Also, some of the readings were extremely difficult and made discussion the next day very hard to come by.",
    "The feedback provided by our professor and peers was extremely helpful. The freedom to choose the topic of our assignment was also great. I think there should have been more discussions of our readings.",
    "I really, really enjoyed taking this course. As someone who wasn't thrilled about taking English 114, this specific class was perfect. Professor Kreiner was fantastic and the course material was very engaging. I think the main strength of this course was the strong degree of chronological organization. To start out the course, we read Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality and then in the last unit of the course, we discussed recent events such as Ferguson and Mizzou. I think that I really gained a lot background from reading Rousseau but then being able to apply all of our early readings to current events was really great.",
    "Strengths: interesting, relevant subject Weakness: sometimes suffered from lack of class participation"

   "comments": [
    "I think this class is more and more important in our current society so I would recommend it to another student, especially one that is invested in changing some of the inequalities that are eminent in daily life.",
    "People come into Yale from very different academic backgrounds. Some schools may have prepared students well for college level writing and reading, while others don't. If you come from the former schools, you may feel that this course is redundant\/unnecessary in terms of the writing skills it teaches. However, if you come from the latter schools, this course would be very helpful to you. Personally, I took AP English classes in high school, which was not very helpful in getting my writing skills where I want them to be. As a result, I found this class very useful in improving my writing.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. No matter the students' level of exposure to academic writing, English 114 can offer valuable skills, insights, and experiences. I believe it is crucial for freshmen to learn how to write well before proceeding to other courses, because virtually every course in the humanities and social sciences will require academic writing skills.",
    "I would totally recommend this course to all students who are considering taking English 114. The course material is really engaging and for anyone who is interested in social equality of any sorts, this is a great course to take."
