    "Complex Analysis with Margulis is basically Complex Analysis with Lang, Stein, and Shakarchi, because lecture is both difficult to follow and difficult to stay engaged indefinitely the worst lecture I've been in, considering that I actually found the material quite interesting just reading through Stein and Shakarchi while doing the psets. The parts that are comprehensible are mainly copied (with mistakes) directly from Lang's book. And the practice exams were quite a bit easier than the actual exams, so be careful of that. Grading is heavily opaque, and Margulis is very difficult to approach with questions. Try to find out if anyone else is teaching this while you'll be at Yale and try to wait for that if you can, because you shouldn't let this class ruin complex analysis for youit's too good a topic for that!",
    "The class is a bit dull at times, at most times. But the subject matter can be interesting and its an important class for a math major.",
    "Pros: 1. Margulis: You don't get many chances to be taught by a Fields \/ Wolf medalist. 2. Complex Analysis is beautiful, elegant, and not particularly difficult Cons: 1. Margulis: He is not the most inspiring lecturer. Yeah... If you shop the first day you'll see what I mean. 2. I've heard the curve is brutal. Everyone is really smart so grading becomes arbitrary.",
    "!! This is easily the worst class I have taken at Yale. I have been told that complex analysis is a beautiful and interesting subject, but after taking this course, I have been put off from it. Margulis's lectures are exceedingly hard to follow (he does not motivate, mumbles, skips steps, etc). As a result, it is hard to have a good grasp of the material. I did my best to follow the lectures, but by the end, coming to class felt like a waste of time. On the other hand, for a math major, the material is very important to know, so it's not like there's much of a choice as to whether to take it or not. If you do end up taking it, you'll survive, so don't get too discouraged.",
    "Complex analysis is definitely one of the more interesting subfields of mathematics, and the content of this course reflects it. However, I wouldn't recommend taking this class with Margulis. Even though I liked the content, I learned almost all of the material from the textbook (which is very good, by the way).",
    "I strongly recommend that you avoid this course if it is taught by Professor Margulis. If you are a math major, you should teach yourself this material by reading Stein and Shakarchi, which is a good textbook, and skip to Math 315. (We cover chapters 1-3 and 6-8 word for word.) This course will actively decrease your enthusiasm for math, and will often make you wonder if you're the victim of some bizarre practical joke. Lectures are unclear and mind-numbingly boring, and exams test your ability to memorize random proofs instead of problem solving. To be fair, the tests weren't so bad, except when Professor Margulis put a question on the midterm about material he explicit told us not to study, and then wouldn't admit that it was unfair, even though literally no one in the class got it right. It's embarrassing that Yale allows such crucial, interesting material to be taught so poorly.",
    "310 is an intro to complex analysis that I would not recommend taking with this professor.",
    "It's a necessary introduction to a beautiful subject. The lecture is somewhat tricky to follow; I ended up reading the textbooks anyway. Tests were a little tricky, and sometimes involved reciting homework questions or proofs from class.",
    "I would recommend it since complex analysis is such a great subject. The course takes a big jump in technical difficulty right at the end when we cover the Riemann zeta function and some of its properties and proofs.",
    "A solid introduction to complex analysis. You can take it even without taking real analysis."
