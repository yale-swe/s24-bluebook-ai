    "In terms of skill building, the assigned papers helped me develop my ability to make a focused argument about an assigned text. This was helpful, insofar as I learned to avoid making broad, abstract claims. I read texts closely and focused on understanding the nuances of an author's argument. This has helped me develop as a writer.",
    "An ability to draw comparisons between texts and to synthesise arguments in a more sophisticated way. The heavy reading load has also improved my ability to read relevant sections in entire texts and to draw out the most important points.",
    "I developed a great understanding of postmodern thought, especially that of Foucault."

   "comments": [
    "Class discussions were a beneficial aspect of the course, because students could work through ideas together. If I were to suggest an improvement, I would suggest the possibility of sticking with a single author for more than one week. This year I found that most courses in the Anthropology Department structured reading by assigning one primary author plus a supplementary author per week. I wonder if it would be more effective to slow down and read a single book over the course of two to three weeks. One more point of constructive feedback: I have genuinely enjoyed taking courses with students in other departments and divisions of the university in the past, but, for the purposes of this particular core course which is required of first-year PhD students, I wish enrollment had been limited to Anthropology students.",
    "The course gave a great overview of the Postmodern cannon. We went into significant depth. At the same time, I had much freedom to look at the facets I was interested in."
