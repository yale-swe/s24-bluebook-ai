   "comments": [
    "I learned to read different genres quickly and effectively and to construct comparisons that take into account several levels of the bodies I am comparing. I was introduced to perspectives that I wouldn't normally have considered with regard to the works we read and the analysis of tragedy as a whole.",
    "I learned how to write linearly as opposed to in a spiral.",
    "This seminar has made me question everything I learned about tragedy in high school. Before taking this course, I didn't really see why tragedy was important. I did not understand why people regarded tragedy as so great of an art form compared to others. However, this course made me realize that tragedy is deeply related with aspects of human nature, and I began to see why tragedy is relevant to human life.",
    "The course helped me gain confidence in my writing and discussion abilities",
    "I developed a more nuanced understanding of the concept of tragedy and garnered knowledge of a general trajectory of the literary form throughout some of history.",
    "My textual analysis, along with my discussion skills certainly improved by taking this course. I also have a newly found interest in Nietzsche!",
    "All of the texts we read were new to me, which was really wonderful. I worked on clarity in my writing and the ability to engage critically with difficult texts.",
    "This course enabled me to gain a much deeper comprehension of tragedy in literature from the classical to the modern day. I think I am now much more aware of what makes a certain work or depiction of an event \"tragic\" and am better able to understand this form of literature and how it has changed over time."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I wish this course had more time to explore different genres of tragedy -- maybe less focus on Greek tragedy and more on modernized tragedies. Overall, the class atmosphere was relaxed and open to different interpretations, and it fostered unfettered discussion.",
    "I think that the professor's attitude made the class stressless. Sometimes i think that the discussions went a little bit dry. But think that has to do with my level of engagement with the text: Did I like it? Did I understand it? etc.",
    "The seminars very well structured and the progression of texts is very logical. There was some great insight discovered from every text, and it felt like that everything we did for the course had a purpose. The seminars themselves were very enjoyable as well, and there was a lot of bonding between the students.",
    "it was a really fun course that was very engaging -- it opened my eyes to what precisely a tragedy is",
    "Professor Semk is very engaging and the course material is presented quite well. I did think some of the discussion got rather repetitive; this might be ameliorated by dedicating one class period to each reading, rather than two.",
    "I believe my textual analysis itself was a strength of mine, but I had some trouble delivering my thoughts eloquently in both discussion and in writing. However, I felt that I definitely improved my skills over the course of the semester.",
    "It was an excellent course. The only way it could get better is if there were a way to extend it into more modern tragedies, but that would mean another semester.",
    "This course was absolutely phenomenal and was quite possibly the best humanities course that I have ever taken. I thought it was very well structured with a wide variety of works (plays, novels, philosophy, a film, etc.) from several different eras. It continuously engaged me and challenged me to think in new ways. The seminar format was also perfect; professor Semk did a great job of giving the class guidance and probing the discussion while simultaneously allowing us to voice our own opinions and never becoming over involved. I also thought that he structured the assignments very effectively; I really liked how the essay assignments increased in length (and were weighted more heavily) as the course progressed in order to give us opportunities to improve our writing. I also enjoyed the presentation assignment; it was fantastic to be able to choose a specific element of a text to present to classmates and to generate an active discussion. If I had to give a few minor suggestions for improvement, they would be as follows: 1) I think the first writing assignment of 250 words was a little too short (I know it was an exercise in conciseness, but, even so, formulating an idea in that little space could be extremely challenging). I think increasing the length to maybe 350 words would have made the assignment significantly easier. 2)It would have been nice to have had some kind of \"peer review\" sessions or \"writing workshops\" (either in class or with some kind of online feedback system). I think 1) It would have been fascinating to have seen classmates' perspectives on the texts in a more drawn-out written form and to have given and received further writing feedback and opportunity for revision before the final draft and 2) This system would probably make the course count as a WR credit which would have also been nice. 3)I would have liked to have read one or two truly modern tragedies (in lieu of just modern adapations). I am not completely certain of which works I would remove from the course (I really enjoyed and appreciated all of them; they were very well selected), but I do think a modern (written) tragedy or two could have made for an intriguing addition."

   "comments": [
    "Tragedy was among my favorite classes this semester. I really enjoyed discussion and loved many of the works we covered. The openness of the course allows really individualized exploration, and this freedom especially contributes to the intellectual challenge of the course but is in the long run rewarding.",
    "YES!",
    "If you are interested at all in questions of the human condition, take this course. You will learn that tragedy is much more than an arbitrarily invented art form. You will learn how tragedy ties into human nature and why we need tragedy in order to live. Prof. Semk is an amazing person, and the texts you read are insightful and shocking. Whether you're a STEM person, a humanities person, a social sciences person, or an arts person, you will find this class relevant to your life. Highly recommended.",
    "Yes!! I loved this course, I looked forward to it every week despite the walk to Whitney. I wholly recommend this freshman seminar.",
    "I would likely not recommend it, mainly because I found the substantial amount of time spent reading disproportionate to the value I gained from taking the class. (I know I just suggested basically doubling the workload, but this might increase the value reaped from the class more than it increases the workload.)",
    "Yes, this was a great first semester seminar course. The material was both intellectually challenging and interesting.",
    "Yes, it was a pretty interesting course with a wide range of classical and modern literature. I enjoyed many of our class discussions. However, a lot of what you get will depend mainly on the other students in your class since our professor generally let us control where the conversation went (of course with a few questions to prompt us here and there).",
    "Yes.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student; it is very intellectually engaging and stimulating without having too high of a workload. Discussions can grow to be very deep and abstract, but professor Semk does a fantastic job at helping the class to grapple with even the most difficult of texts on the syllabus. It was a wonderful start to my Yale undergraduate career and a course which I will truly miss next semester."
