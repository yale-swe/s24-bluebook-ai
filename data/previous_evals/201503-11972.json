    "Well this course is probably required for you if you're considering it... but I would also recommend enjoying the resources it offers and having fun with your classmates. It's been a good experience so far.",
    "Meet weekly to work through aspects of your thesis. The colloquium leaders do an excellent job at giving us assignments that will actually help us. Some light reading in the beginning. Some presentations on your progress. Overall, not a bad course.",
    "Great course. Incredibly helpful and relieves any anxiety because you have to meet deadlines. The course keeps you on track. You recover both peer and instructor critique and suggestions, and the professors want to help you do the best you can. It's been incredibly helpful",
    "Have to take it, but it's great. Just really need a lot of self discipline to get writing. Block out some time every week and actually get to work early. Will pay off."
