    "Not a pleasant experience, but not because the class itself is hard, has a lot of people hear. It's poorly taught and poorly assessed: too much emphasis on memorizing equations without understanding the concepts behind them, exams were too short to evaluate anything and psets were sort of random and unrelated to what we did in class\/what was covered in the exams. The posting of online lecture notes was a nice thing. Professor Cross is a nice and helpful person, but I think his style of teaching (old school, honestly) fits much better a more advanced class. If you want to do well in this class, study well the past exams and the easier problems in the psets and hope you won't stumble upon a random question in the test. Curve is good, from what I heard.",
    "Please don't take it if Cross is teaching it! Please! Just postpone it a year, you really won't regret. No one can be as bad as he is. This is undoubtedly the worst class I've taken at Yale. Professor Cross may be a nice man, but that's not what it takes to be a good professor. He can hardly talk\/walk, mumbles in front of himself, and is 76 years old!! Why on earth is he teaching an undergraduate lecture filled with 55 or so students? Please, Yale, you can do better. He really should not be teaching at his age. Yale disappoints once again. You come here, already knowing that the reputation of the STEM departments is a little shaky, and instead of paying some extra money every year to ensure some quality classes for its students, the chemistry department instead opts to ask someone who retired back in 2010 to come back and attempt to teach a fairly demanding class. What about all the PHDs who would kill to teach an undergrad lecture at Yale? Why put us through such a horrible class?!",
    "Professor Cross is a passionate teacher, and a brilliant researcher who is always excited to share applied chem research tidbits and experimental setups\/methods in class. Frankly, however, he isn't the best lecturer. Things were often unclear in class, and the majority of the class would learn the material on their own in the week prior to exams from the notes he posted online. The psets were fairly short, but I almost wish they were longer - we covered a lot of material, but I don't feel that I've had sufficient practice with it. Do well on the midterms, because the averages are fairly high. NOTE: the math in this class includes a thorough treatment of Maxwell relations. While it would be doable if you haven't, I would strongly recommend taking multivariable calc before this class.",
    "This class is hard and I would only take it if you have to or if you are really interested in the material. That being said, it's not impossible and can definitely be manageable. It's important to study fairly often, not just the night before exams, because there are so many equations to learn and trying to cram in one night can be difficult. There is a problem set every week, two midterms, and a final. Problem sets aren't a huge part of the grade, so the exams are important. The best way to succeed in this class is to print out Cross's lecture notes online, and work through those throughout the semester. Go through the packets and just circle every important equation and then just memorize all of them. Eventually you will have to apply some conceptual knowledge, but if you don't know all the equations the class is going to be extremely difficult. There are not equation sheets for the exams. It is not impossible to do well in this course, it just requires more effort than usual and good study habits. Remember, memorize the equations. Concepts come later, but you can get a lot of points on the tests just by knowing formulas.",
    "It's a very hard class. Be prepared to struggle and to have to learn a lot of things on your own.",
    "Do not take this course unless it is completely revised. The material is barely explained and makes little to no sense.",
    "Not particularly, but I feel that's the nature of the course. It being a very difficult class conceptually, and a requisite for the chemistry major, I think that those who have to take it will take it, and that those that don't won't.",
    "Well if you are considering taking this class, it's probably because you have to take this class for your major, or that you're insane. For one, Pchem is hard. There is a lot a lot of math involved, and a lot of formulas to memorise whose implications weren't explained well, so you don't actually know what is going on. However, if you are someone who is good at self-studying, this class can be for you, because the pset workload is pretty light and you don't need to put a lot of time into this class. I think a lot of people stopped appearing for class because it wasn't a very productive use of time in the morning, as we couldn't really hear what the professor is saying a lot of the time.",
    "The lectures were pointless as you couldn't understand the professor (very mumbly), but the lecture notes posted were good. The tests are fair but 3 questions long, so they end up being easily influenced by luck and careless mistakes. This would be horrible, and he doesn't curve as you go, but at the end of the semester, he curved an insane amount. The average was either an A or A-. It was very unexpected. Psets are easy because you can usually find the answers. Very short.",
    "Difficult to follow\/understand his lectures, but he's a really nice guy. Tests are fair and psets are not bad.",
    "This particular class was difficult to understand just from lectures, but better if you learn from a textbook well. With another instructor, the class may be much better",
    "Chem 332 is a very math-heavy chemistry course. It focuses on derivative manipulation and derivation, and should only be taken if the student has a strong theoretical background and is good working WITHOUT actual numbers. I would recommend this to a fellow student.",
    "I cannot in good conscience ever recommend this class to anyone. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Go to the DUS instead and either convince them to let you skip it, or walk out of their office and away from this major. You will be bored in this class and you should go directly to second semester. Nothing useful to be gained here. Material- If you know what delta G is, you know how to write a rate law, and that the forward rate over the backwards rate is Keq, than the only thing you will learn in this class is the notion of chemical potential. Look it up instead. Or, better yet, I have seen some of the classes out of the chemical engineering department, turns wout they are actually better than this class. Go take them instead. I am a chemistry major (though possibly for not much longer) and I am telling you to get the heck away from this class and go to another department. Grading- TFs were variable on grading Psets (multiple unnecessary points were taken off for no reason). Tests were generally relatively easy compared to material. However, testing on Maxwells relations is an either you get it or you do not sort of a deal. And on a three-question test, that is a big deal. Curve was extremely nice though. I cannot complain that my grade suffered, just my mental and emotional health. Professor- one of the worst experiences\/lectures I have had at Yale. I would not choose to take a class with this professor under any circumstance. Lectures were muddled, steps were skipped, no general context was given, and no larger picture impacts or general notions were gained (basically, the only property of a lecture that was present were equations being placed on the board and students writing them down).",
    "PChem is a science credit with not that much work, but difficult material (midterms\/final). Very generous curve at the end. Most people who take this class are upperclassmen, but this class is doable as a freshman and some people did take this class as just a science credit. There is only one pset every week with around 3 questions, and many people skipped lectures. It's quite hard to hear Professor Cross, however, so sit in the front or learn from his notes.",
    "Not quite as bad as everyone says. Psets are totally doable, and the curve is very generous. If you're taking it with Cross, his lecture notes will save you. The only really bad part is that you don't get equation sheets on exams, so you'll spend a lot of time on memorization. But all in all (to my surprise) I think I actually would recommend this class. Especially if you're more math\/physics inclined, it may actually be easier than orgo.",
    "Unless chem 332 is required for your major, I would only take it if you are really interested in the material and if it is taught by someone other that Professor Cross.",
    "The professor is very caring and knowledgeable, but speaks real low and is at times incoherent so the vast majority of us skipped most lectures. His online notes are great, and the book is okay. The homework are only about three problems, but I often got stuck on stupid stuff; like the problem not stating we should look up values in tables. The course focuses too little on derivation of the equations, and too much on memorization. On exams there are no notes or formula sheets, which is utter madness. Science should not be about memorization, but about understanding concepts. That being said, there's some cool stuff such as how the relation between entropy and energy determine whether a reaction occurs.",
    "I am a MBB major and found that this class is doable if you put a little extra time in learning about partial derivatives and derivations. I don't think this class should be taken if you don't have to for a major. There are probably other classes where you learn more useful and applicable information.",
    "Not as bad as its reputation but that's only with Professor Cross. You kinda have to teach yourself everything because Prof. Cross speaks so softly that you can't hear him. However, he is a nice guy and the class is fair.",
    "I took it cuz I was in a hurry to learn it all and move on to cooler stuff. But I would have done better if I had waited to take it with another professor. The material is really interesting, and even though the text book was a pain to read, after I got used to it, I enjoyed studying it. It's not easy and you don't get as much out of it for the time you put in as you do with other books, but it's worthwhile. The class itself, well I basically had to teach myself everything and rely on the TA to clear away any confusion, so that wasn't exactly ideal. But the questions we got could have been much harder."
