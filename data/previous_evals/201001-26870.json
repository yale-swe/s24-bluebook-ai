   "comments": [
    "Smuggling&Trafficking was a very interesting course and a refreshing change of pace from the typical lecture. It really opens your eyes to some of the most \u0093invisible\u0094 problems of the global world. I highly recommend this course to other students.",
    "Only if it's taught in a small setting - doesnt work well as a 150 person lecture.",
    "Interesting topic, but explored unevenly.",
    "Unfortunately, unless the course was revised a bit, I would not recommend it. WAY too theoretical.",
    "Its a very wide array of readings ranging from Marx to the trafficking of sex slaves throughout the world. However, it is very easy to do well in the class.",
    "I was dissappointed with this class. The subject sounds very exciting but the way in which it is taught leaves much to be desired. Lectures were dry and the professor read from her notes every class. There were way too many readings expected of us: our grade was composed of three papers, a final paper, and \"participation\" (whether you answered pop quizes in lecture). Since most of the papers were not even on the readings, the only reason for doing most of the reasons was self-interest. Unless they make significant changes in the way in which this class is taught, I would not recommend it. I had high expectations and honestly, came away from the class having learned very little.",
    "Definitely take the class. Don't worry about being too bogged down with theory at the beginning--it gets much more interesting as the class progresses.",
    "Don't be seduced by how cool the title sounds. Professor Erami has no idea how to teach, and nobody else associated with the class (students or TAs) seems to care about being there or putting in any effort. I got eight sentences of feedback total on the two papers I wrote, totaling about 60 words, and none of it was at all specific to anything I actually said. The lectures are horribly boring, but she takes attendance so you actually have to go and sit there, metaphorically (or, by the end of the semester, perhaps literally) twiddling your thumbs. One of the worst lectures I've ever had the misfortune of taking.",
    "This class is at once nauseating, infuriating, deathly boring, and pathetic, almost to the point of being funny. But in a really sad way.I spent about 2\/3 of my time in this class thinking about all the other courses I could have taken.Hands down the worst class I\u0092ve ever taken.",
    "It's an interesting class, totally the easiest class I've ever taken at Yale. I wouldn't recommend it though...Erami is very nice and smart, but she's a terrible lecturer. Her lectures are incoherent and totally disorganized. Half of the class didn't even come to lecture, and the essays are easy. Two 1,000 word papers, one PPT presentation on a movie (or a 1,000 word essay), and a final 1,000 essay. Total gut. The readings are interesting, though, and Erami has some fantastic stories. But if you really want to learn, don't take this class.",
    "The subject matter is interesting - that's probably why you want to take this class. The workload is light, with 4 short papers, all of which are very open-ended, which means you can get away with doing very little of the reading. The lectures were mostly very boring, though occasionally something interesting was mentioned.",
    "No i would not. Should be dropped. This course needs a lot of re-working and preparation before it should be offered to yale students",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if one is looking to understand the social aspect of economy. Professor Narges definitely knows what she's talking about and the work load isn't that intense if you know how to work without completely all of the readings.",
    "Don't expect to take this class and spend a lot of time learning about illicit economies like human trafficking, smuggling of contraband, etc. That's what I thought, but was very surprised. There's a lot of focus on anthropological and economic theory which I wasn't interested in. The workload sounds bad, but it's really very straightforward. The papers are short and you don't have to use any knowledge from the class really. The final exam you do have analyze five of the readings though. There were some really interesting class lectures, but most of the time I didn't really pay attention.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone, even if you're not interested in economics or anthropology. The class just gives you an overview of what informal\/invisible economies are and what they mean to modern society. The workload is not heavy and the assignments are REALLY interesting and easy.",
    "Recommended. One really learns about how the world really works. The readings are great. Take the course!",
    "this is a good class that doesn't have too much reading but gets you to think more in depth about the topics discussed.",
    "no, it was a pretty worthless class in the end",
    "This is a great class. The workload is manageable, and the papers are pretty fun to write actually. Take it",
    "Not too much work, interesting topic\/material, bad\/boring lectures. However, if you want a good class to take CR\/D\/Fail, this is it.",
    "I would absolutely not recommend this class to anyone. This course was extremely disappointing. The topic is great and presented the opportunity for a great class, but it was horribly executed. I have never had a less engaging lecture; paying attention was nearly impossible. Horrible, horrible class.",
    "I would say that this class teaches us to open our mind to the once inferior looking informal economy. It helped me to adjust my ideas of the people who operate within the illicit economy and opened my eyes to the poverty still existing outside the United States. I will, and have, recommended this class to all my friends.",
    "Not as currently taught. On the one hand, it's a complete gut. On the other hand, its not at all interesting.",
    "It looks at all underground and obscure markets, both legal and illegal. This could include, for example, both drug trafficking and pornography. I would only recommend it because it was incredibly easy and disorganized but I didn't get much out of it.",
    "In the end, Smuggling is entirely what you make of it. There is a lot of assigned reading but very little incentive to complete it. Thus there are students in the class who aregung-ho and read almost all of it, and there are also students who read almost none of it. This is pretty much what determines whether or not you learn from the class and whether it is worthwhile. Some of the readings are highly technical and academic, while some are written as interesting vignettes on organ trafficking, internet pornography, etc. The class is basically 4 short 3-5 page papers, and you could skate by and only do the readings that you need for these assignments. Or you could pursue your education, do a majority of the readings, and get a somewhat eye-opening look at black markets and invisible economies. The class has no sections except optional ones before the papers are due.",
    "The material is interesting and it's a relatively easy course. The only bad thing is the required attendance, kept in check by pop quizzes.",
    "anthro 237 is an overview of world economics kind of (you read smith and marx and talk about globalization a lot.) its useful in understanding how much the field of economics is overstated by showing how much it doesnt apply to much of the world where shit isn't as clearcut as a corporate spreadsheet or revenue statement. important class; poorly executed, unfortunately. could only get better from here on out, though, and i'm definitely glad i took it. there were many fun moments, and the class is definitely interested in showing its students a good time. take it.",
    "As it is currently designed, this course is very easy. If you do the reading, you'd probably get something out of it, but there's literally no reason to do so.Ask about financescapes.",
    "Smuggling, Trafficking, and the Criminal Act was a fine course, with tremendous potential for future iterations.Strengths: readings, assignments (four short papers and attendance)Weakness: frequent attempts to get students to participate are ineffective and awkwardImprovement: requiring reading responses for each class period would increase student participation",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless the syllabus is heavily revised or another professor teaches it. As it was, it was the worst anthropology course I have taken at Yale, and I say this as a senior anthropology major. The material could have been interesting but the lectures were dull and not engaging at all.",
    "Take it if the subject excites you. Otherwise, at some points, the class can be a bit repetitive.",
    "Good class, very easy as a lecture. Not sure how much more work the class would be if you have to do all of the readings, but as it was it was an interesting, if not overly stimulating class to take.",
    "Take this class if it's offered as a seminar. It was NOT a good class as a lecture. Grading is incredibly lenient, but lectures simply were not that interesting. I think discussions would be great in a seminar, though.",
    "no. but if you take it, its really easy",
    "Very interesting material and much potential. The teacher, however, was not very engaging and the material came across as dull. The work load is not very demanding. Not necessary to read the articles although you might want to because they are super interesting.",
    "I would take Anthropology 237 if you'd like to take a relatively easy class that doesn't require too much work. If you actually do the reading, the class is really interesting, but if not, you might not get a whole lot out of the class.",
    "This is a good class! Here's why: there's not much work involved. Your grade is based on four papers: three of which are basically topic-of-choice. You don't actually have to do any of the readings (except a couple to do the essays). She hands out attendance quizzes every once in awhile, so going to class is important, but it's pretty easy to get an A.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! The content is great, the professor is wonderful, the discussions are often interesting and the books aren't too expensive. Overall win.",
    "Crazy. Didn't make much sense. And the grades are basically arbitrary. I wrote really crazy papers that did well. Dunno.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You don't need to do the readings and yet still stand to gain a lot from the substance of the lectures. If you do decide to do the readings, however, you will learn way more.",
    "The subject matter is absolutely fascinating--think drug smuggling, human\/ sex trafficking, porn, internet rights, money laundering, etc. That said, although this turned out to be wonderful class, it was much more theoretical than I had originally thought. You'll definitely be reading Marx, Heidegger, etc. and applying those theoretical frameworks to invisible economies...so at times dry but overall engaging.",
    "It's a pretty interesting class and not too hard. You don't really have to do the readings, all you have to take care of are three papers and you're done. You should take it as a 5th class for sure.",
    "At the end of the semester, a friend and I had a conversation about how we were only about 75% sure this class wasn't a long piece of performance art, in which a lecturer tries to see just how much nonsense she can say to a Yale class before they rebel. Expect to bounce around from Dubai sheiks to Paris Hilton to 60's movies to bento boxes to misogyny to anime to something called a \"financescape\" to Dog the Bounty Hunter, often in one lecture. You can write a paper on Dog the Bounty Hunter. Or Big Lebowski. What did I get out of this class? Quotes. Friends. Stories. But, I certainly did not learn much.That said, I took it with friends and had a blast. It's super easy. (Four three page papers, and eight attendance quizzes graded for completion, of which she takes the best five. No joke.)",
    "This is an amazing course. The material is fascinating even for non-anthro majors. Unfortunately, it was taught like a large lecture course. If you're looking for an fairly easy but fascinating anthro course, this one is amazing."
