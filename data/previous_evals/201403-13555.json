    "This class is awesome--one of the best I've taken at Yale (but maybe I'm biased because I absolutely love seismology). Maureen is one of the best (if not the best) professors in the department, and she keeps this class challenging, well-organized, and fun. Definitely, definitely take this if you've had enough physics and math to understand the basic concepts.",
    "This intro to seismology class is a must take if you want to understand anything about the structure of the Earth or the ways we can tell about it."
