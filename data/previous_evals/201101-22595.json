    "Take it!!",
    "Take it if you are doing research. you get a credit!",
    "Yes, doing research for credit is great!",
    "yes if you have a lab do this course",
    "If you want to do research, this is a good way to do it. There are few requirements other than going to lab, so it's pretty chill.",
    "A good class to take if you were planning on spending lots of time in lab anyways. Not much work at the beginning of the semester and none in the middle, but get started on that final paper early or it could come back and bite you.",
    "Everyone should do research for credit before graduation in order to see scientific concepts from the classroom in a real experimental context. Just don't underestimate the amount of time this will take!",
    "Research for credit. You write a summary at the beginning of the semester, a proposal a few weeks into the semester, and a final report at the end of the semester. You also give a presentation to your lab at the end of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially if you are planning to do research during the school year anyway. The workload is manageable-you do a 2 page proposal, a lab presentation, and a 12-15 page final paper. Make sure you manage your time and keep your data organized, as it can be overwhelming if you wait until the last minute to start thinking about your presentation and paper. The presentation will help you with your presentation and powerpoint skills. The instructor in the course is more of a supervisor, so try to get feedback and help from your mentor and PI instead.",
    "Research for Credit is an excellent introduction to (or continuation of) independent scientific research in MB&B. It's a great chance to apply material that you've learned in classes in a hands-on manner to my research, and your research invaluably complements what you've learned within the classroom. I developed a much more holistic sense of the progression of scientific research. The workload is also extremely reasonable -- a 4-page proposal, final write-up, and final presentation -- and gives you the chance to analyze your research and produce a scientific paper without being stressful or being a burden.",
    "Doing research during the school year is important, and taking it for credit with this course helps you have some structure as well as helping you get practice in presenting a proposal and your results.",
    "Great way to delve into what you're really interested in.",
    "You get credit for doing research you were probably going to do anyway. You have to write a proposal at the beginning of the semester and give a presentation and prepare a 12-15 page research paper at the end--which can be quite a bit of work, so don't leave it to the last minute.",
    "Good to get credit for research you want to do anyway."
