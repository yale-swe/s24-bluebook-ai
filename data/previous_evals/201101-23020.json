   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to someone who wants a basic knowledge of Latin American history. I would also recommend that your Spanish already be pretty advanced if you don't want to spend lots of time going over things with Professor Gonzalez during office hours.",
    "Not a lot of work, two 5 pg papers, midterm, take home final, but the work that you have to do is really hard, and the readings are difficult as well",
    "I would recommend the class to another student. Professor Gonz\u00e1lez is a great instructor - his lectures are always interesting. There are 2 papers (5-7 pages), a midterm, and a final. It is not that much written work, but there is a significant amount of reading.",
    "yes, great overview of Hispanoamerican history, culture, and literature",
    "This is a great course if you are serious about reading original Spanish literature by some of the greatest and most famous Hispanic writers. This is really one of those classes that you get as much out of as you put in. Lectures can be somewhat dry so if you aren't ready to keep up with the readings (which are long and often fairly complicated) and pay attention in class you will miss out on the entire course. Sadly there is very little class discussion and also beware: this class focuses completely on literature - not culture like the title suggests.",
    "Yes, it is a good way to keep up your language skills.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Professor Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda is great - he speaks at a level of Spanish that is very comprehensible, without it seeming patronizing, and generally knows how to keep lecture interesting. He also clearly knows his stuff. The workload is manageable and most of the readings seemed highly relevant to the overall narrative of the course. In terms of subject matter, the \"cultures\" part mainly covers history and literature, as well as bits on music, dance, art, and baseball.",
    "I would recommend it but people should come in knowing that the readings are going to be difficult, even discouraging because they are hard to understand. But they really do make you improve, at least I think so.",
    "Latin American Cultures is a lecture class that covers many important Latin American authors. I wouldn't recommend this course to other students; there is barely any opportunity to practice speaking Spanish, the class isn't about culture so much as certain specific authors, and the some of the readings are quite difficult."
