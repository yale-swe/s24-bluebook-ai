    "Yes, the class is very interesting and enjoyable!",
    "Great course. fully recommend.",
    "The first half of the course was more like a lecture than anything, as Minnis went over the Franklin's Tale line-by-line in order to accommodate for the Beida students. This made it easy not to do the reading, so the second part was a surprise when it turned into a real seminar and not just looking at slides. So do the Shakespeare reading even if you don't necessarily do the Chaucer reading. Would recommend this class for those people, Chinese or Yalie, who don't mind talking.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Overall if you are interested in exploring more about Shakespeare and Chaucer, check out this class, and at the very least you'll have a good time listening to Professor Minnis. I really can't say enough about how much it was a pleasure to have a class with Professor Minnis! I had the great pleasure also of getting to travel with him in China, as a part of the Yale-PKU program, and that was also really great fun. Professor Minnis is a really nice and experienced teacher and a scholar to boot. One thing that I must also emphasize if you take this class or other classes with him is that you should be sure to chat with him generally as well, since he has lots of interesting stories to tell!Take this class if you are looking for something new, perhaps if you are not an English major, and if you want to have difficult texts explained in an expert way by areally nice professor!"
