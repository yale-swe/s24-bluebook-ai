   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student, I think it's a great introduction to the material, the period, the talented and the fabulous, etc. I would however also point out that it is sort of a disorganized course and that the student needs to figure out how to connect the material and to navigate it on his or her own. While there is a lot there, and while the professor is very engaging, the presentation is rather haphazard.",
    "I would recommend it, with the caveat that if you're not in the field, you'll learn a lot but may be bored.",
    "I would recommend this course to a person intending to study this period in depth because it gave a good sense of the moment's rich variety of literary production. I would also recommend it to a non-specialist, but with the caveat that it is very important to have a familiarity with the social, cultural, religious, and political context of the period."

   "comments": [
    "I honestly have not found that I gained any knowledge of the discipline in the course of the seminar. I read great texts and held discussions about them with great people, but in terms of professionalization, very little was accomplished. My final paper did help my research and allowed me to further my interest in an author whom I may or may not write about in my dissertation and allowed me to put some ideas out there and to see what the response was like. I think the mini-conference at the end of the course was great, but it would have been more helpful if John had expressly said that it could not be based on the 3-4 page paper written early on, since everyone ended up writing about Marvell or Donne simply because it was easier to get to the required number of pages that way.",
    "Did not. But, it did fulfill distribution requirement.",
    "As I mentioned above, this course gave me very useful exposure to literature of the seventeenth century. While the course's subject matter may not influence my dissertation directly, it will prove valuable when I ultimately teach some of this material. Also, I appreciated the opportunity to present a seminar paper, which will surely become a regular component of the development of my scholarship in the near future."
