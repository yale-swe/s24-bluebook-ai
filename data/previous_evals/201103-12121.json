   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in being an urban studies major take it. Otherwise don't.",
    "I would. Again, the essays are tough. But the reading is very interesting.",
    "Part of the reason I enjoyed this class so much was because of the people in it. A lot of your experience rides on that, given that it is a small seminar. In terms of the subject material, it's quite a bit of reading, and you are definitely expected to read and understand all of it for each class. But you will be grateful when you leave the class with a totally new perspective on cities and the theories behind their behaviors.",
    "Highly recommended. Long readings, and the concepts can sometimes seem a little abstract, but Professor Horan makes it work. She's firm, but friendly, and does a good job of getting everyone in section to participate. I would particularly recommend this course to Architecture majors - it's a great survey of key texts and authors in poli sci, and a good introduction to the policy side of the built environment.",
    "This class exercises your critical thinking skills because the paper topics are really tough! In this class, you learn about urban politics and policy issues mainly by analyzing how (and also what) scholars write about city politics and policy. It's rigorous, but rewarding if the subject interests you.",
    "A very theoretical class that should be taken by students who already know a lot about cities, or intend to; otherwise, they might be disappointed in the type of discussions that arise. The seminar is not meant to be a discussions about the city, but it is meant to provide future work with solid frameworks.",
    "You'll have a lot of reading that you'll have to read for weekly responses and two hefty papers, but you'll learn a great deal about urban politics and policy from a political science theoretical perspective. Professor Horan is great, dry and serious in class in a way that pushes you and keeps the conversation productive, but warm and engaging on a personal level. It's a great class with a lot of work.",
    "This course is a lot of work, and can be frustrating at times, but it's a great opportunity to learn a lot about urban politics. I highly recommend it.",
    "A good class to approach urban topics in a more theoretical framework."
