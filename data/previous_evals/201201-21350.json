    "If it's around and you're a music major looking for a senior seminar, you have to take this.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to other students. It is a great opportunity to learn in deeper detail the works of Bach and perform them.",
    "I would summarize the course as a wonderful opportunity to be acquainted with baroque music and historically informed performance practice. We use baroque bows and even have the chance to play on some baroque instruments. It was a great experience for me to play on a baroque violin and feel the difference between that, and my modern instrument. I would most definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. I believe that getting to know Prof. Mealy is a special and rare opportunity that should not be missed for anyone serious about music!",
    "A combination of lectures on the life and chamber music of bach with masterclasses about Bach's chamber music. Ends with a performance."
