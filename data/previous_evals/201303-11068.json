    "Professor Reymundi makes this class fun, engaging, and I recommend you take her section.",
    "It's not too much work, and I found it incredibly enjoyable.i would recommend it to everyone who's taking Spanish, even if they placed into L4",
    "If you don't take it with Reymundi, you are doing it wrong. She's so nice and helpful!",
    "130 07 is a fantastic course mainly because it is taught by Reymundi, who is the best Spanish teacher I've ever had. She is the teacher to have. The workload for this course is extremely manageable and most of it is review, so the difficulty of the material is not something to worry about.",
    "Spanish 130 07 is a great course to improve your spanish speaking, writing and comprehension skills. There is daily online homework to test grammar. The online homework, textbook activities and stories that you read are very helpful.",
    "YES!!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to a fellow student. The workload is rather light, but it is a daily commitment. Overall, my spanish has improved greatly because of the class.",
    "I would recommend it for a person who needs to solidify the spanish background before they move on to literature",
    "If you take this class, make yourself like it because it meets every single day. But if you cope with the relatively high pace you will be rewarded, i.e. you will learn a lot of Spanish.",
    "If you can get this class with Profe Reymundi, take it! She is fantastic. The class moves fairly quickly (6 chapters in a semester), but it's easily manageable. I'd definitely recommend it, especially with Reymundi.",
    "Take it, find Lissette Reymundi."
