   "comments": [
    "this is an interesting class without too hard of a workload, great if you are interested in the holocaust and need a writing credit. don't take it unless you are really interested though because everyone in the class is very into it",
    "Yes, definitely. Great topics in this class, great books to read, and a great professor to teach the material.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course for anyone who is interested in the topic or in improving their writing skills.",
    "You read Primo Levi and Primo Levi and Primo Levi. For me, this was a great leap of faith since I had no clue who Primo Levi was, (he was an Italian Jewish chemist who became a writer after a period of internment in Auschwitz) and you read almost exclusively works by Levi. I found it a little tedious at times, since some of his works appealed to me more than others, but it is a rare and valuable experience to really get to know an author in such depth, regardless of how much he appeals to your personal taste. Overall, I'm glad that I got to learn about someone who fills such an unusual but important niche in Italian literature. The writing component of the course was also quite manageable. Each week there was a writing assignment of no more than 500 words (not even a word more!) pertaining to one of Levi's works. I think it was valuable to learn to write something that is both meaningful and succinct, which is something that is not taught in many classes here.",
    "I totally recommend this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. You will learn more than you expect to learn about Primo Levi along with writing. TAKE IT!",
    "Professor Sodi is GREAT! The work in this class is easy but can be a lot. In general the readings are very interesting and the class dynamic is great.",
    "I would recommend this class 100%. Primo Levi is fascinating, and we came away with a strong understanding of his works and himself as a person. This class will also introduce you to a further understanding of the Holocaust. Professor Sodi is warm and engaging, and gives fair and helpful feedback to improve your writing. One of the best classes I've taken here.",
    "Absolutely take this class, it is wonderful. No matter how much you know about Primo Levi you will benefit from this class. Discussions were very engaging for the most part and touched on many different subjects so only rarely did it seem that comments or ideas were redundant. The reading is very interesting, and the load is very manageable. I even found myself enjoying the writing assignments by the end, as they were short enough to not be intimidating to a non-humanities student.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to another student. If you are interested in Primo Levi, the holocaust, writing or even Italian culture, this class is for you. The small seminar size and the teaching style make a very intimate experience. The books are interesting and engaging so the class does not feel like that much work. The writing assignments are fun and very helpful for learning how to get in touch with yourself as a writer. I cannot say enough good things about this class, if you are even considering it, at least shop it, and I would recommend taking it."
