   "comments": [
    "More than adequate: exceptional.",
    "NA",
    "yes",
    "Production Printers on the 7th floor need to be more reliable.",
    "Yes.",
    "There is not enough faculty teaching this class. Two professors for 65 students is too few. It should be split up into smaller sections with more faculty or some of the students with more background in architecture should be placed out of this class and into electives.",
    "Yes.",
    "The level of resources at the school are still impressive and exceed all expectations. It is unfortunate that visualization did little to allow us to learn and explore the breadth of the school's facilities--something that visualization could havealso been an avenue for but was not.",
    "Yes, they were helpful. I used software and printers.",
    "Fine",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, resources were adequate.",
    "yes.",
    "Library circulation policy a bummer.",
    "Most of the drawings were done on the school\u0092s computers and printed on the large-format printers. While everything worked in the end, the manual-feed plotters are often finicky.",
    "Yes, resources were available.",
    "This was a low-tech class. only basic software was need for the completion of some assignments.",
    "Yes, we had adequate resources available to us.",
    "Everything was acceptable, probably because Kent has been teaching similar classes for decades, however, amongst some students there was an interest in exploring the geometery from a mathematical standpoint so we might understand what a bezier curve is. Yale has phenomenal resources in mathematics, perhaps a lecturer from that discipline could give some special talks on certain geometries explored in Vis II.",
    "All the resources were above adequate, save for the speed of the computers at our studio desks. If more ram could be added to these computers there would be less crashes and our productivity and efficiency would be much higher.I also believe that integrated computer tutorials would strengthen the course in bridging the gap between hand and digital production. These two means of production should not be taught in opposition to one another but as similar or\/and mutually dependent.",
    "Resources were available.",
    "yes",
    "yes",
    "Sitting on the floor in the pit was not the most pleasant place to have class. I don't believe I've had to do that since elementary school. I would have preferred to have met in Hastings or the drawing studio for these lectures."
