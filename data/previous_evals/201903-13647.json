    "I benefitted the most from the mock negotiations as I have no prior experience.",

    "Understanding how COP negotiations worked in practice.",
    "I learned about historic multilateral climate agreements, negotiating climate agreements, and topics for COP 25.",
    "Great overlook at the history of international climate change negotiations. The course also teaches you how international agreements have evolved and changed over time. Professor Biniaz does a great job at providing this infomation and giving students annecdotal information of what happens behind the scenes.",
    "Understanding the makeup of climate agreements and how negotiations work",
    "History of climate change negotiations Practical knowledge about navigating international negotiations Problem solving during negotiations",
    "General understanding of the history of Climate Change Negotiations and how it has evolved over the years",
    "How international climate negotiations came to be, and how they work. The nuance that comes from the language of the agreements and different tactics to get there. Very interesting to learn about diplomacy through this lens.",
    "I learned about the history, strengths, and weaknesses of climate change agreements. I also learned about and practiced various tactics of climate change negotiations.",
    "This course provides a fantastic review of the UNFCCC and the history of climate change negotiations."

    "Clearer instructions on assignments would be beneficial.",

    "Have a perspective of how things work in reality; negotiations were exactly as seen in class.",
    "I really enjoyed Sue's method of lecturing.",
    "Professor Biniaz has so much experience and it was really great to hear her take on climate negotiations. For a one credit course, there was a lot to be learn from the class",
    "Interesting content but content delivery could be improved by preparing lecture slides instead of projecting sections of assigned readings on screens",
    "Sue is very engaging when she speaks, even when it's from a chair on stage. She adds a wit and humor to the topic that makes it easy to follow.",
    "I found this course interesting and practical. I especially appreciated being able to apply the tactics we learned in class to the negotiations exercise, which helped to prepare students for COP. I think it could be improved by providing feedback on assignments and facilitating a little more student engagement during lectures.",
    "This is a very balanced 1 credit course. The readings \/ homework are the right length and the lectures are fantastic. Even though the course is pass\/fail, I think it could be improved by receiving feedback on the written assignment and mock negotiation."
