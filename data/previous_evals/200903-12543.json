    "If you have an interest in law school, I'd say yes to taking this class. Not that I think this class is going to prepare you for law school, but it definitely exposes you to a wide range of issues over which the law is heavily debated.",
    "Absolutely. If you're interested in law school or social sciences or any type of research, I'd highly recommend it.",
    "Great seminar! This class really went in-depth and did a great job at combining law and social science. I really enjoyed this sociology class. The final paper was especially a great experience because it allowed us to actually consider an issue and discover how it is addressed in the sociology and law worlds.",
    "Really interesting look at how social science research can influence law and public policy, using both concepts and case-studies. Great prof (Brueckner) and TA (Michael Yarbrough)--take it!",
    "Yes it provides a good base of knowledge."
