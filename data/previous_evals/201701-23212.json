   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about the epic Ramayana as well as so much more about the Hindu and greater Indian culture, which I had previously been completely unfamiliar with. Cross-cultural analysis and close readings were huge skills that I developed in this class, as well as an increased tolerance for multiplicity and diversity of thought.",
    "The Ramayana deepened my understanding of Hinduism and also informed my personal religious views. I also learned much about different themes within important literary\/ oral traditions.",
    "I honestly had no idea how pervasive the Ramayana is in India and Asia as a whole until I took this class and its impact can hardly be limited to religion.",
    "It was very interesting to hear the different viewpoints that students from different backgrounds bring in regards to religion, culture and political affairs in India. I had an opportunity to think critically about what one of the central texts in my religion has to say. Moreover, I realized that The Ramayana has many different versions and these retellings provide meaning to very diverse groups of people. In this sense, it is much more of a \"tradition\" of retellings that has significantly influenced the history of India in many ways (religious, political, etc.)",
    "This course taught me about a religion and religious text of which I had no previous exposure to. Helped me become a more competent human of this world.",
    "I learned quite a bit about the Ramayana, of course, but also about how complex its cultural implications are. The class did not focus so much on skills like writing or discussion, but for me its main strength was in the readings we did which I enjoyed very much.",
    "Through this course, I learned how to assess, think critically, and question literature in the Ramacharimitas. I really enjoyed studying the Ramayana story, and Professor Flick was enthusiastic and very helpful.",
    "A scholarly view of the Ramayana, discussion of the epic by reading the translations as well as the works of various scholars of the topics. Note: By scholars, I mean academics from universities all around the world rather than religious scholars or \"pundits\"",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. As a Hindu interested in my past and religion, I gained a lot of insight in this class",
    "Having lived in India for most of my life, I'd been exposed to the Ramayana for many years. However, this course was fascinating and gave me a unique perspective into the different tellings of the epic and how they have shaped Indian culture.",
    "This course through the materials presented and reviewed as well as the discussions allowed me the opportunity to not only look at the Ramayana as a story and a religious text, but understand the characters in a much more in depth manner."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was great because it was the perfect balance of student engagement (by leading the class in presentations on readings) and learning in seminar-style discussions with Professor Flick.",
    "The class is great, but discussion is usually dominated by a small minority in the room. Finding ways for everyone to engage would probably improve the class.",
    "The strength of this course is in the fact that even with a low level of work, you learn a fascinating amount about the plot, characters, versions, and problematic portions of the Ramayana.",
    "Strengths - interesting readings, lots of freedom in essays, really cool guest speaker. Weakness - class discussion could have been more engaging, but that's on students more than it is on Dean Flick",
    "I enjoy that this is a discussion-based course. As always participation varies from week to week, but it's great that Dean Flick always has something to say and this often serves as interesting food for thought.",
    "Course is well structured and keeps the students engaged. I actually enjoyed the larger size seminar, allowing for a large variety of opinions to be shared. Could improve on changing up ways in which ideas are brought about, try and facilitate more discussion.",
    "Although I think student presentations can be a good way to demonstrate a familiarity with the material, I much prefer a lecture and discussion based seminar. I think the student presentations took over the class time quite often, and were often just repeating what was in the reading for the week. When Professor Flick did lecture I enjoyed listening very much, but class time was mainly spent on Powerpoints.",
    "Professor Flick facilitated interesting in-class conversations, and I really enjoyed the dialogue and questions on the discussion forum as well. To improve this course, I would suggest that students are recommended to put their laptops away during class. This would encourage them to contribute towards the discussion.",
    "Strength: Great content, excellent reading list Weakness: Lack of apparatus to make people engaged in class.",
    "Very well created course. Readings are cohesive. Sometimes they can get long though.",
    "Hugh Flick is an incredible professor who makes the seminar engaging and enjoyable. It is a small class, so you really get a chance to express your opinions and engage in debate. It is not too much work - 2 papers (one 3-5 pages and one 12-15 pages) and weekly responses. Sometimes the classes seemed repetitive, but it was very interesting overall. I also loved how there were many student presentations every week.",
    "Even though the course gave us ample opportunity to read the materials, we did not have enough time to discuss and draw insights as much as I would have liked and this was limited due to the length of the student presentations. I think Prof. Flick could have limited each presentation to no more than 10 minutes thus allowing more time for discussion."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely",
    "Take this class!!! Professor Flick is amazing and you will learn so much about Indian and Hindu culture.",
    "The Ramayana is a fantastic, laid-back class. Definitely something to look into if you are willing to learn about something completely random.",
    "Unless the structure vastly changes to focus more on the text, save a credit and read the book on your own.",
    "This is an awesome class. Students present on most of the readings, and these presentations give a great tl;dr for those like myself that didn't read every word before coming to class. Additionally, while the workload is extremely light (one reading presentation, one 3-5 page double-spaced midterm paper, and one 10-12 page final paper), I feel like I learned a lot about facets of the Ramayana that I never knew existed, like how many versions of the text exist and the problematic portions of the story. Highly recommend!",
    "Yes! The Ramayana is fascinating and it's important to have some perspective on the world outside of European traditions",
    "The readings in this course are incredible. Despite, or perhaps as a result of, coming from India, I'd never been exposed to the the rich literature of critical analysis surrounding the Ramayana. In particular, A.K. Ramanujan's 300 Ramayana's is a can't-miss. Professor Flick is delightful, and he has a fairly complete knowledge of the material at hand. He's always willing to chat before or after class, or even grab lunch, and is wonderful sounding board for essay ideas. On the other hand, some of the people who took the class with me just didn't give a damn. If it seems like there are a bunch of football-type people attracted by the lenient grading, consider taking the course another time, though you can still get a lot out of it. The engagement of other students is key, especially since students will be presenting almost every day of the course. If you're unsure, you should probably take the class while you can.",
    "Yes",
    "This class is a pure and true gut. Take it.",
    "An interesting discussion based course that can help students learn about the multiplicity in the narrative tradition in one of the central texts of Hinduism. Dean Flick is a great guy who always has something interesting to say. The workload isn't that bad at all.",
    "If you are a non-Hindu student who wants to learn something about the religion, this class of Dean Flick's other class is definitely the way to go. The fact that you are a non-Hindu will never be held against you and you will learn a lot.",
    "The Ramayana is a great course taught by an even better professor.",
    "I enjoyed the material in this course and am happy I took it. However, I did not feel challenged at all and my essays did not receive much feedback. That said, it's a class that fits well with a busy schedule.",
    "This course encourages you to ask critical questions about the Ramayana literature. Professor Flick is very helpful and facilitates interesting conversations.",
    "Yes, if you are curious about Hinduism it is an awesome course about the Ramayana and if affects South Asian culture. If you are Hindu and know about the epic, it is great to see it from a birds-eye view, the different ways it is interpreted and the different variants of it that exist around the world.",
    "Yes it's a great course.",
    "Definitely - if you have any interest in Indian mythology\/ South asian studies you should take this class.",
    "Absolutely. But more value could be derived from this course if there was more time to discuss and dissect the story line itself and the main characters."
