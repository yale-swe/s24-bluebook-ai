   "comments": [
    "Basic toxicology concepts and principles.",
    "good",
    "much too technical and expects a great deal of chemistry and molecular biology background which many students do not possess. Does not seem like an Intro to Toxicology course. Needs to be scaled way back for the majority of students to understand and keep up with the content. I understand that there are some advanced students in the course, but they seem to be the minority.Could make two distinct courses, one for Intro students, and one for Advanced students.",
    "Great course. The course is very approachable for both the beginning and the initiated. There were numerous clinicians in the class who agreed that the material was practical for their field and educational. Other students who were not clinicians but in various different majors also enjoyed and got a lot of the course. I particularly enjoyed the opportunity to have a live discussion and Q&A at each of our class sessions due to its manageable class size.",
    "Strength: Really practical and useful. Also very instructive.Weakness: The knowledge is to much sometimes it is hard to organize.",
    "One of the strengths of the course is how it is structured in that the first half focuses on the basic principles of toxicology while the second half is focused on applying those concepts to a number of past and present toxicological issues. I would say the second half of the course is more engaging and interesting. One suggestion would be directed at the lectures of the first half where sometimes the examples of the concepts are sometimes very complex. If there is any way to present less complex examples I think the lectures would be more cohesive (at least from the point of view of a student that does not have a strong chemistry background)."

    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0She is Helpful and responsible.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0All of the lectures that were given by Cheryl were very good, especially the lectures on mercury. Furthermore, her delivery is given in such a way that it was really easy to follow the material and make connectionswith other lectures. However, one way in which her teaching may be improved is if she organizes her lecture slides a little more before delivering them. She would often run out of time and had to make up for it by rushing through some of the other material.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Knowledgeable and explain the concepts and principles clearly and intuitively.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0strengths: kind and sensitive to studentsweakness: too eloquent and difficult to follow when explaining very technical and complicated processes. I couldn't imagine trying to understand lectures if English was my second language as it is for many students in the class.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak was great. He is very knowledgeable and accomplished in his field. Yet he is down to earth and approachable; one of the great feature of this course was how he was always available for office hours (extended hours - you could go and speak with him about the class and finer details of the topis at length). He was generous with his time and dedicated to teaching every class with as much packed in pearls of wisdom as possible.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr Borak is really instructive, patient and insightful.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak's lectures were great and always a pleasure to listen to. It is refreshing to be taught by a person who practices what they are teaching, as this is not always the case. One way to improve his lectures would be to address the comment above in regards to providing less complex examples of the concepts as this mainly occurred in his lectures and not the lectures given by Cheryl."

    "I would recommend it. It is really a must and great course for EHS",
    "This course focuses on the principles as well as how to apply those principles into understanding present and past toxicological data. I would highly recommend this course as it really focuses on applying the concepts to 'real world' issues which makes the course relevant, interesting and most importantly extremely useful. Also the assignments really add to the course and enrich the concepts that are learned during lecture."
