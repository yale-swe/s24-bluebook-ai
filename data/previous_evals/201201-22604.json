    "This course is similar to that of its predecessor, RUSS 130. The Russian program here is amazing, and the instructors really care about whether you learn the material. At the end, you will find that you've improved greatly since the beginning of the year, even though it may not seem like it when you're making mistakes left and right in the complicated language. You will never fall behind in the class because you have a good amount of homework every night. Because the homework is from a workbook, you can do future assignments in advance if you're anticipating a busy week. While the instructors are not crazy about attendance (unlike in Spanish or Chinese), going to class every day is kind of painful after a few weeks.",
    "Take it.",
    "Straightforward L4 Russian. Some reading, but no literary analysis (I think this is good).",
    "great class, lot of work but worth it.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "It is a continuation of L3 with the same amount of work and same teacher. Although, we do get to start reading!!",
    "Intermediate Russian--great, fun class. Everybody in the Slavic Department is great. Lots of focus on grammar and constructions, but still a lot of fun in-class discussion and exercises. Take it credit d if you've already fulfilled the language requirement!"
