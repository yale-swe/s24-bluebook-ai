    "awesome lectures, lots of reading, listening tests can be difficult at times.",
    "Absolutely recommend. You learn a nuanced but connected narrative that frames the history of western art music after Beethoven. With this narrative, you get a framework for understanding some of the best music in the world. Tests are hard, lectures are surprisingly well done. Excellent class.",
    "This has been an incredible class. As a senior MB&B major I came into the class with reservations, especially after hearing about the heavy workload, but every assignment (three listening quizzes, two papers, and two written exams) has been worth it and helped contribute to my music history understanding. Hepokoski is one of the most dynamic and engaging professors at Yale, and I literally looked forward to every single lecture. If you have any background or interest in classical music, you should definitely at least shop this class--it is great and you can definitely succeed even if you aren't a music major. At the very least, come to the first few (Beethoven) and last lecture, they're absolutely worth it. Take this class!!!",
    "Take it! It's a lot of work, but the lectures are great- Hepokoski is the best lecturer I've had at Yale.",
    "CRAZY WORK LOAD (five tests and two papers). Do not take this class 'for fun' unless your course load will allow you to invest a significant amount of time in this class.",
    "Music 352 is the best class I've ever taken at Yale, and I'm a senior who has made it his business to take all the best classes at Yale. If you have ears, take this before leaving. You will never hear the world the same again.Also, no worries on grading. I took it credit-d so I could relax, but the exams are easy if you go to class and everything else is pretty straightforward. Forget about the reading. The real magic is in the lectures.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE GREATEST PERIOD IN MUSIC THAT HAS EVER BEEN",
    "Fabulous class--top-notch lectures, great listening list, good section. Take it.",
    "This is the best class I've taken at Yale. Prof Hepokoski is a phenomenal lecturer and every single class felt like more like a feature-length movie than a lecture. There is a bit of work (especially for the listening quizzes, but the review sheets for exams are pretty lengthy, too.) All the material is interesting and necessary for any serious musician or musicology student.",
    "Amazing class. If you are at all interested in music history, you need to take this course. Hepokoski's lectures are simply brilliant.",
    "This is a great class. Although it would be helpful to have some music experience before going into the class, it isn't necessary to know a whole lot of theory to get a lot out of the class. You go from early romanticism (Beethoven) to the mid-20th century, and along the way, you'll be treated to engaging lectures from James Hepokoski, one of the greatest lecturers I have ever had the privilege to listen to. Take this class if you have any interest in music history at all. You will have even more interest when you leave than when you entered.",
    "Great course! You will be exposed to so much amazing music, and learn to understand it at a deep level. Be prepared to work hard, but learn a LOT.",
    "MUSI 352 is a great class. Take it if you have a genuine, deep interest in the historical workings of Romantic and Modern music as well as a knowledge of musical notation and\/or theory. The class is a good deal of work, but if you have the time, try to do it all because you'll get so much out of the class if you do. If you would like to learn the facts but not so much the opinions and historiographical parts, just take MUSI 131--it's the same material, covered from a different angle and focusing more on the analysis of pieces and is also a wonderful class. MUSI 352 will teach you a lot about politics, culture, music, and how to listen to music. It's an amazing class, but do leave room for the music majors, please!",
    "YES! Best class I have taken at Yale by far. At least shop it so you can experience the amazing lectures. The first week is the best!",
    "The class is an overview of the history of and analysis of the content of Western Classical Music from the years 1800 to 1960. If you have at least a basic understanding of music theory and are interested in the subject, I highly recommend that you take this course, as some of the analyses are revelatory and Professor Hepokoski is a wonderful lecturer. Even if you have no understanding of theory, and are just interested in the subject, I still highly recommend this class, though you may want to take it Credit-D.",
    "If you intend to be a music major, you have something to look forward to. If you are not a music major but are still interested in the material, TAKE IT. That being said, I would advise non-music majors to take the course credit-D: you could take the assignments more lightly and still enjoy the class as much as someone taking it for grade.",
    "Fantastic course - I was so excited by the material that I finished it and immediately had to pick up the 1950s-onward volume of the Taruskin text. This is the kind of course that you absolutely must take, not because it is so great, but because it exposes the historical underpinnings of something as personal as your own musical tastes, and to leave something that close to your heart unquestioned is irresponsible. In fact, I haven't taken any art history, and I think that except for the actual knowledge of visual arts, everything I would have wanted out of an art history course before I graduate I have gotten out of this course. The TAs were great, Hepo gives amazing lectures, and the work is not that bad - this past term was more than he usually assigns, but even then it's not impossible:-three listening quizzes [especially if you are not super familiar with Romantic-Modern repertoire, you will need to get the music from the library reserve and start studying waaay in advance by just having the music on shuffle constantly; ten hours of music is a lot to learn to recognize],- two \"factual exams\" - just look over notes and you'll be fine, essay format so just being aware of general themes and having a couple things to talk about is fine,- two papers, both pretty much the same, just comparing authors and analyzing their hidden biases, etc",
    "Music 352 is one of the best classes at Yale. The combination of tremendous music, rapidly-changing historical context, and Hepo's brilliant teaching makes for a life-changing semester. As someone who was largely illiterate of the canon of Western Music and largely resents the Western focus of the music department, I can still say that this class was phenomenal. I learned so much about so many things that will be so useful to me in my musical exploits, and Hepo made everything compelling. His investment in the material he teaches shows every second of every lecture, as he connects musical analysis to historical context to produce an historical arc with broad sociopolitical implications. The class is very demanding, but it is worth your while. Take it."
