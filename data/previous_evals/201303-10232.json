   "comments": [
    "I had a 2 year gap between Math 112 and my AB calculus load and found that while I had to pay attention in class 1\/3 of the time, the homework and exams were very manageable. If you're going to take 112, TAKE IT WITH KIMPORT.",
    "take it if you need to, otherwise no way",
    "I'd describe Math 112 as an introductory calculus class. It really is what it sounds like - it's not too difficult but also not too easy (I still felt challenged by the course). I'd definitely recommend this class and I'd DEFINITELY recommend taking it with Susie Kimport.",
    "It is what you probably expect it to be. Weekly pset, two pretty fair midterms, and a final that kicks you in the butt a little. Go to class.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class if you have already taken calculus in high school as you don't learn anything new. Even if you have taken calculus before, the material isn't taught very well so the course can get difficult at times. However, it is a pretty basic math class if you need a distributional requirement.",
    "Good class, I'd recommend if you've never taken Calc or if you did poorly in it in high school.",
    "Professor Kimport's class is a very good class to take if you need to take math 112. she is very approachable and understanding.",
    "An introduction to calculus. I would recommend this to a fellow student as long as you choose a professor that you can actually understand or relate to. Professors make the experience to be honest. If you can't understand what your professor is saying then you won't be successful. Visit as many sections are possible and choose the one that's best for you.There's no downfall to taking the class as long as you keep up with the psets and actually look through the textbook.",
    "Great start to calc in college.",
    "I had taken calculus in high school, but didn't take math for a year here and wanted to refresh and have a more solid foundation in calculus before I went on to higher levels. It was a good course and Professor Kimport was a great professor - very clear and always available to students. I thought it wasn't too hard and the problem sets were relatively painless, and it gave me a good foundation in basic calculus.",
    "Fairly basic intro to calculus, do not expect explanations of anything but the necessary.",
    "Yes... obviously a necessary pre-req but an enjoyable one at that.",
    "Yes. It is straightforward math.",
    "Math 112 was a wonderful class tot ake",
    "This course helps you understand the fundamentals of Calculus. If you are interested to expand your math repertoire, you should definitely take it.",
    "Basic intro to calc. Psets are annoying, some take a surprisingly long time. Not too difficult though if you keep up with the work. Susie is the best--she makes it enjoyable, actually.",
    "Manageable especially with prior calc experience",
    "For me, this was a good course to get my QR credit. It's just a basic calculus class up until integrals, so if you took calculus in high school, this should be a very manageable class for you. If you can take it with Kimport, definitely do it. She is extremely helpful inside and outside of class.",
    "Sure take it! It's an interesting class, not too difficult, and it gives a good, basic understanding of calculus.",
    "All things calculus. A firm foundation, clearly explaining all facets of single-variable calculus.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to brush up on calculus skills, but it's not going to be a revolutionary course.",
    "It's a good calculus class. It's not a hard class (basically high school calculus.) The Psets aren't too hard and they're usually long but not too long. The class is kind of boring, but it's still a very informative and useful class. So take it if you have to. Ms. Kimport is a very good and patient teacher. So, overall, it's a good course.",
    "Overall, I would characterize Math 112 as a fair course. The courseis well organized and if you pay attention in class, have a good TA, and put in some time outside of class to read the chapters to fill in any gaps of knowledge, I think you can do decently well in the course. Unfortunately, the final is worth A LOT of the grade and the material is taught very quickly at times but putting in time outside of class to learn the material at a pace appropriate to yourself can be very helpful. Overall, I would recommend this course.I would also recommend my TA: Susanna Kimport, as she is very approachable, and tries her best to make herself available to students both in and out of the classroom.",
    "Typical calculus class. If you need to take this or want a QR credit this is the class for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend Ms. Kimport specifically as a professor because, having shopped many of the math 112 classes, I realize that Ms. Kimport was by far the most engaging. If a student did not need to take math 112 for his or her major or distributional requirements, I would not recommend this course."
