   "comments": [
    "You learn a lot of French quickly, and you get close with your classmates and your professor. If you've ever wanted to learn a language in an immersive, supportive environment, go for it!",
    "Very effective introduction to French, although it demands a lot of work in order to succeed on weekly tests and assignments.",
    "I would strongly recommend the French program. It is one of the strongest at Yale.",
    "A very thorough and fast-paced introduction to French using the French in Action paradigm. A relatively large time\/energy commitment, but FIA really does work in amazing ways. It builds confidence so fast through frequent conversation and skit practice in class. Your section will become like a family that meets every morning, which worked out great for me (small section, amazing prof.) Madame Burton is absolutely top-notch and cares so much about her students. As advertised, intro French is a whole lot of work, though very evenly distributed throughout the weekly routine of the course. If you are a student (like me) who sometimes has problems with work ethic or struggles to put in the requisite 1-2 hours per day that the course requires, you can still stay afloat, but you'll definitely feel the difference in your speaking and writing ability. All in all, the culture and the language are just so beautiful and so much fun to speakit's really worth the time commitment.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is committed to learning French; the workload is heavy, but the payoff is really great. Remember to read the lesson objectives in your course packet every week; because you cover so much every week, this helps you focus in on what you need to study for the weekly tests and ultimately for the final. I only caught on to this halfway through and I wish I had known earlier."
