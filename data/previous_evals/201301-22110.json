   "comments": [
    "A close look at Mahler's symphonies 1,2,3. Very interesting readings, very interesting discussions, and a chance to get to know one of Yale's finest scholars.",
    "This is a class that focuses on Mahler's first few symphonies, and really goes in depth into their construction.",
    "Music 467 offers a great chance to study Mahler's early symphonies in depth. I would recommend the class to any musician, especially orchestral musicians. The course taught me not just how to better analyze symphonic music, but how to put the piece in historical and analytical context in a way that can be generalized to vocal music and beyond.",
    "This was a great seminar. We only talked about Mahler's first three symphonies and we could have spent so much more time on each. Hepokoski is one of the greatest professors at yale, so everyone should try to take a seminar with him.",
    "Take it. 'Tis all.",
    "Great class, lots of focus on form. interesting material",
    "Take it! Incredible music analyzed with one of the best minds in musicology today. Not too much work- you'll love it.",
    "This class is a must-take for anyone who loves Mahler, and by delving into Symphonies 1-3, you will leave with a greatly enhanced appreciation and understanding of the music. The course is 2 papers and a lot of weekly reading (which at times is very philosophical and difficult with Adorno), and this really supplements the course well, as Hepokoski focuses most class time to intensive analysis of the music itself with score in hand. Hepokoski is a great scholar and his Sonata Theory can be applied in wonderful ways to Mahler, and this course is a great example of the amazing course opportunities that Yale presents us with.",
    "This might not be offered for a while, but if you have a chance to take a seminar with Prof. Hepokoski you should definitely take advantage! Very interesting insight into the music, applicable to other music as well even if you're not particularly passionate about the seminar's topic, although you likely will be by the end.",
    "This course covers Mahler's Symphonies 1-3. There are two papers, both of which will require work but neither of which were as difficult as the papers for Music 352."
