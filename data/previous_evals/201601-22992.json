    "A text course in Ezekiel where issues relating to the composition, history, and text of the book are covered.",
    "This course is a helpful introduction to Ezekiel's stylistic writing with a brief overview of history of interpretation of the text. I would recommend it to any Hebrew Bible student.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in learning more about a major prophet that presents complexities worth considering. The Hebrew was rich and will give Hebrew Bible students good enough opportunity to develop on their skills.",
    "This class was a very useful introduction to Ezekiel and the current scholarship on the book. I would recommend it to any student interested in the prophets and also Second Temple students as well since there are many versions of the book in that period."
