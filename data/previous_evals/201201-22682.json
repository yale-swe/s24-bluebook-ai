   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Interesting, but gets repetitive after the third or fourth week. You have the option to work on a creative project rather than write a midterm and\/or final essay which is great.",
    "This is a class where you really get the chance to experiment and do projects that are unlike anything you've done elsewhere at Yale. If you care even a bit about futurism or obscure art movements, take this class. It's a fun class that isn't too hard.",
    "This is a great seminar about the futurist movement. Dean fabbri is great and the assignments are a lot of fun! I cooked for my final!",
    "This is a zany, fascinating, and always-entertaining intro to a very prolific and substantial movement as well as way of thinking. Take it if you want a good-natured, easy time, compelling readings, few but enjoyable writing exercises and art projects, and a general overview of one of art history's gems. If you want an in-depth, all-fronts-covered seminar, expect to go beyond the course material to hit paydirt.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "I recommend this class to art history majors. It's an easy and interesting credit. The final exam is something called a futurist evening where you can perform a song, do a painting or present a play.. it's great.",
    "A fun course that is as much or as little as you make of it-- the readings are surprisingly accessible, and not always necessary. But the class is way better when you get a lively discussion going, and Futurism is a fun, light-hearted subject.",
    "Yes definitely. It is a great class for any Art History major, as it really focuses on one movement, which is not very common at Yale. It also provides different angles of the movement other than art.",
    "Easy seminar in which you read all the writings of the futurists. Gets a little repetitive but overall pretty interesting"
