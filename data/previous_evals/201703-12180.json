    "The class was very laid back which, in my opinion, helps facilitate language learning. This allowed us all to speak freely in Czech without the fear of messing up. When we did mess up, we were corrected in a very helpful manner. The one weakness of this course would be that it was sometimes disorganized. It was hard to keep track of the order in which we were learning things.",
