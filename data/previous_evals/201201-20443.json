    "A difficult, challenging and rewarding class that will reshape how you approach academic scholarship. She has given me the tools to think more creatively and thoughtfully about my object of study for my dissertation and how to represent that scholarship. There have been few other times when I have been so intellectually challenged and learned so much in one class. I have and will continue to recoommend to every student I know that this class is a must. This class is a privilege to take.",
    "Using a number of unlikely texts, this course examines ethnography's crisis of representation and its journey beyond. A brilliant syllabus and a brilliant professor. Definitely take this course."

    "I wanted a course this semester that let me think critically about ethnographicethics, craft and theory and exposed me to some compelling examples of ethnographic product. This course was the perfect choice for me."
