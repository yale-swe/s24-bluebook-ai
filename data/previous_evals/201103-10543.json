    "I would highly recommend the course to a fellow student.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is deeply interested in ancient Egypt and\/or art history. If you are interested in either of these topics, this class provides amazing opportunities to get hands on experience with objects in a museum setting and to read and write about objects.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it, although warn them that it's not going to be a survey of Egyptian Art. The students have the wonderful opportunity to pick and object from the MMA collection and conduct a study around them.",
    "I would recommend this class, as it is a unique opportunity to have access to the artifacts in the Met, and develop techniques for interacting with artifacts."

   "comments": [
    "The course provided with a wonderful array of theories, both general and specific to the study of Ancient Egypt. As my previous knowledge of Art history was mainly from books, it was a invaluable opportunity to discuss these issues with a curator whoworks around these subjects on a daily basis.",
    "Taking this course as an undergraduate was a very good experience. I am seriously considering majoring in NELC with a concentration in Egypt, especially after taking this class. The work I did for this class gave me a great introduction to doing Egyptological research. I am interested in continuing such research, especially on my object.",
    "This course gave me practice with approaching artifacts,as well as insight into new anthropological methods, which will help in my dissertation."
