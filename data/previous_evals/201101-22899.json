    "Great class. Take it!",
    "A very good introduction to basic processing that doesn't get a whole lot of attention in the psychology department. Professor Marks a very good teacher to have--he knows a ton of information--and you really come out feeling like you've learned something. Highly recommended.",
    "I highly recommend this course!",
    "It is genuinely a really great class if you're interested in the subject matter at all. The professor is really smart and has had a hand in all the most meaningful research in physiology and psychology to date."
