    "This is a fun, slightly disorganized class. You get to practice speaking a lot so take this class if you want to do that.",
    "Yes, really fun introduction to Levantine, and you learn much more than you think you are throughout the semester. Should be willing to put in your own time though - to really learn Levantine you need to practice at home and really read the lessons beyond what the class forces you to do to get by.",
    "Better than regular Arabic. requires previous knowledge. fun.",
    "A great class! Take it if you want to learn Levantine! You learn a lot if you put in the work, and it's fun, too!",
    "Yes.",
    "I would say take it, and your ability to understand and speak the language the way it is actually spoken will improve vastly in such a short period and you will have fun doing so."
