    "Strengths: breadth of coverage, lecturers were clearly brilliant scientists, well-documented course page. Weaknesses: hit-or-miss quality of lectures, scattered organization between lecture topics, slides that are hard to study for review. This class could be improved by having some easier way of reviewing lectures, such as summary sheets, or clearer powerpoints (more text, fewer pictures)."

    "This class is essentially a lecture series giving primers on a huge range of topics in computational biology and bioinformatics. The class is almost all grad students (my year had ~3 undergrads). Section consists of reading important papers and discussing them with the TA\/group. You learn some basic concepts and terminology, but not much deeper. The midterms are fair, if a bit difficult, and the homeworks are light. Linear algebra and probability theory are not prerequisites for this class, but probably should be. I would recommend this class to anyone who needs a not-too-stressful class in MB&B or S&DS who has the background (e.g., MATH 222 and STAT 238). That being said, I would also warn that the class can feel scattered and disorganized at times, and that the lectures themselves are of variable quality."
