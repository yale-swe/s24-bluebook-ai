    "I believe, any student, with interest in French culture, or France, in general should take this course. French is similar to English, and hence it is not so exhausting to learn this new language. Secondly, as non-native speaker myself, I feel that compared to English, French seems to be easier to learn after I have the experience of learning English.",
    "L1 French is great, because you really get to learn the language, not just in terms of writing, but also speaking and listening as well (which is much harder to master). It is a lot of work though, with weekly tests and about 20 pages of workbook to complete per week. Do be prepared to put in the effort. Also, take note that French is a year long course, so if you drop it after the first semester, you will not get the credit for that semester. Think about this: are you really interested in French? Will you like it? It's a pretty big commitment, though French is very useful and interesting! Take it with Ngame!",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course. There is quite a bit of work but it is immensely rewarding and you will leave speaking French, I guarantee it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking for a solid base in the French language. The full immersion method definitely taught me a lot, including how to approach learning an entirely new language. However, there is quite a large weekly workload, which means that students have to work hard for their one and a half credits.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's tough and grading is not the best, but if you put in all the work it's doable and very rewarding. TAKE IT WITH NGAME. He is an amazing professor.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn conversational French. It is however a lot of work, and keeping up with the class and doing well completely depends on ones own dedication to practicing outside of class.",
    "Absolutely, Prof Ngame is great, you learn a lot: become better listener, reader, and speaker",
    "Professor Ngame was a great professor. I would definitely recommend taking French 110 with him.",
    "I would heartily recommend this class to others. In fact, I have done just that. It has been the best class I have taken this semester.",
    "Would recommend it! French in Action is a great program because it provides context and entertainment at the same time."
