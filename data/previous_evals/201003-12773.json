    "A great opportunity to do directed research and start your sr. project early.",
    "Take this course if you are considering a career in experimental psychology, or if you are genuinely interested in conducting real scientific research. CGSC 471 is completely what you make of it. After all, research is research: you've got to put a lot of work in, and new discoveries are hard to come by; however, there is still a considerable amount of valuable experience to be gained.Make sure you choose a lab that deals with content you are genuinely interested in, or else you will struggle to keep yourself motivated - research at this level is very much an independent endeavor.You will probably be paired with a graduate student, with whom you will work under the supervision ofa pi. Take care to find a professor and graduate student who are both patient and willing to teach you. This is the most important, because you will be fully dependent on these people to teach you the skills needed to conduct your own research."
