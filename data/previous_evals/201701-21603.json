    "I learned about game theory in this class and how to think critically about strategic actions and preferences.",
    "Game theory concepts",
    "I gained valuable knowledge into game theory and practical knowledge in how politics is conducted considering preferences and risk.",
    "I learned about how people are or are not rational in certain circumstances. I learned what it means to be rational and what compels people to act as such.",
    "Into to game theory, rational decision making in political settings.",
    "Very basic game theory and its applications to political science.",
    "I became interested in game theory of political science, theory of voting, and various strategic games. The class helped me see the connection between the economic mindset and political science. In the end, I became able to understand how people vote, how politicians act, how brinkmanship work and what the connection is between various global political events.",
    "Basic game theory introduction. Overview of strategic games related to war, bargaining, voting and other collective action problems.",
    "In this class, I gained interesting perspective on how our government works, which was especially interesting in light of the recent election. I learned how to question politics and elections and be more skeptical about our system of democracy.",
    "Broad ideas about our political system were brought to light, and it made me think more critically about how and why our government works the way it does.",
    "I learned some basic game theory and ways to analyze strategic political interactions like elections and brinkmanship.",
    "Game theoretic thinking, strategic applications to real world scenarios",
    "Basic game theory games, extended decision games, voting is dumb, democracy is a lie",
    "Learned a lot about game theory and understanding how people make decisions."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength is that a lot of the course is taught through lecture, so the learning is done inside the classroom instead of outside on your own. The instructor is obviously passionate about the subject. The weakness of this course is that the readings sometimes feel like busywork and not a lot of people take the course too seriously. The instructor sometimes wrote some math errors on the board when he was explaining concepts that ended up hurting some people on Psets. That being said, it is a fantastic course and I learned a lot from it.",
    "Super easy, kind of dry. Would make more engaging",
    "I really appreciated that the class was formatted around real world applications and fitting models to those applications. I think giving concrete examples of strategy at play made me better appreciate how pervasive strategic thought is\/ could be. A weakness is minimal assessment so the students are frequently listless during actual class time.",
    "I like how organized the lectures were, and that the slides were posted online. This was my fifth class so I was fine with the pace of the course, but had this been my fourth class I would have wanted the lectures to move much quicker and cover more material.",
    "This course is a very basic understanding of political models, due to the low level of math needed to take the class. I thought sometimes the class seemed too abstract, and I wish more real-life, current examples were analyzed.",
    "One of the best courses I have taken so far. Very well organized, concise, to the point learning. Material is interesting, yet very understandable. Professor strategically organizes the material so that we can fully conceptualize it.",
    "First half of the course was very dry. Second half was much more interesting, when the concepts we learned in the first semester were presented in political contexts. Could be improved by not simply repeating what happens in the reading during class. The problem with this approach is that it makes the reading unnecessary to do or really engage in.",
    "Strengths: Lectures and prof Svolik were incredibly engaging, interesting, and informative. They always related to our readings, were clear to follow, and it showed that prof really cared about the information he was presenting. Weaknesses: office hours were a little infrequent so prof and Ta's felt less accessible than in other courses. The readings were a little long sometimes given the amount of days we had to complete them -- I felt like I would have gotten to absorb shorter pieces better.",
    "Great breadth of topics covered for students who don't know much about politics.",
    "It has some interesting material but the course is too easy. There isn't enough material to keep people engaged during class. It could be faster.",
    "Strengths: very clear, can understand the various theories quite easily Weaknesses: not mathematically rigorous, too easy as a result",
    "Organized classes with clear points. Once we got to decision-making trees became less organized and clear, and harder to keep track of and therefore learn - for instance while doing the extra pset at the end I came up with five different ways of drawing the same game based on classnotes. All were valid (I think) but I wasn't sure after that what the emphasis of those classes had been."

   "comments": [
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course to a student, especially those who need to complete their EP&E requirements. It is an easy workload with a great payoff.",
    "Great 5th class, super easy, but can be really dry at times",
    "I would recommend this course as a good intro to game theory.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to someone who is interested in game theoretical approaches to thinking through problems, but cares more about how it applies in the real world. I thought especially the Easter Island and Redistributive Politics by Party readings were fascinating and I liked having the humanities stories to accompany the social science structure.",
    "Yes, great class.",
    "I absolutely loved this class! Prof. Svolik did a great job at combining game theory and models of politics. Lectures were clear, problem sets and exams were straightforward and readings were interesting. Definitely a must take!",
    "If you've taken a game theory class before, you won't get very much out of this. But, the lectures are clear and organized and it can be fun to think about game theory applied in political science, so if you're looking for an easy additional class this could be the one.",
    "I would recommend the course, but only if you are interested in Poli-sci.",
    "This is a super basic game theory class. It is very easy. It requires almost no studying and is highly intuitive. Professor Svolik wants to keep it accessible to everyone regardless of math background, and he said that game theory gets extremely math-y extremely quickly, so the only way to make the class broadly accessible is to keep the math super basic.",
    "Dont miss the chance of taking this amazing class. Content is interesting, the TA s are very approachable.",
    "A decent fifth class.",
    "If you like politics but don't know much about it, have some interest in game theory and puzzles, this class is for you! I think everyoneengineer, plsc, or english majorcan get something out of this class!",
    "Take this!!!! Prof Svolik is amazing and the class is so fun and easy to catch on to. You won't regret this clas.",
    "Honestly, I feel like you only have 36 classes while you're here, it would be better to chose something else that you can get more out of.",
    "Take if you are interested in game theory and politics that does not deal with math at all",
    "The information is interesting, but the level of busywork is frustrating. Expect to have to submit notes on each reading prior to class, even though the readings are often only tangentially related to the lecture. The professor is a good lecturer, but does not seem particularly interested in teaching undergraduates.",
    "As a non-political science major here (hi STEM majors! Shoutout to my electrical engineers): this class is interesting and doable, but if you are not aware of political scenarios\/situations you may struggle to draw connections to the real world.",
    "Yes I would, i had alot of fun and I learned alot about strategic decision making."
