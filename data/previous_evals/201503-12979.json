   "comments": [
    "Music majors have to take it. You guys will be fine and learn some cool stuff. Non music majors can also learn a lot if they keep an open mind.",
    "I would say it is unfortunate if you are a music major, and thus have to take this course. I would never recommend this course to another student as it stands, because it was disorganized and frustrating. The World Music requirement should be the most interesting and wonderful part of the music major, and instead 353 was the second-worst class, only 350 last spring was worse.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student, but if you're taking this, it probably means you have to. The class isn't hard, but the classroom setting is frustrating. Go to your TF's for help - grad students in the music department are the best!!",
    "Such an important course if you have any background in music - take it! You'll hear so much awesome music that you've never even heard of before and learn a lot about cultures from around the world in the process. In that sense, don't worry about it not being worthwhile - it's definitely not \"just\" a credit for listening to music, since you will end up being responsible for a fair amount of history, current politics and cultural knowledge that you are then asked to tie in to elements of the music. As such, it's not a gut - but it's a very manageable amount of work if you mostly stay on top of readings and go to lecture. Lecture is entertaining, anyway, since Professor Veal is awesome and knows about possibly every type of music in existence, as well as having a great sense of humor. And all of the material is absolutely fascinating, and not stuff that you will learn in any other course at Yale. Take it even if you aren't a music major, as long as you have some basic music theory under your belt - or take it if you are a music major and expand your horizons! It's really worth it!",
    "Much better than past years have said it is. After 3 courses on the history of Western music, I think it is pretty essential that music majors (or anyone for that matter) have at least some sense of music BEYOND the Western sphere. While I sometimes took issue with Veal's teaching methodologies\/(dare I say the different ways he treated men and women in the class...) he is nevertheless an extremely insightful and academically thoughtful professor who does an excellent job of paring down the ridiculously vast topic of \"World Music\" into a one semester course.",
    "I'm glad it's over. The only way to understand why people hate it so much is to take it, and if you're a music major, you have to. Some of the material is mildly coherent, and I found myself interested in certain specific aspects. There's a great deal of material covered. However, almost none of it is detailed enough to truly enrich the student's understanding of ethnomusicology (or add anything to it at all). The structure is lacking, and the class would benefit from half as many units discussed in ten times as much detail, and with much more application and immersion. Professor Veal is a knowledgeable professor and often cracks a joke, but students frequently spend their class time wincing in response to his comments. I'd have loved a more receptive professor, one with an interest in communicating well and efficiently. The sections were lifesaving. The only shortcomings in section were a result of Veal not making it clear to the TAs what the goal or focus of the given unit was.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student-- it's a really important one!",
    "AVOID AT ALL COSTS. If you're a music major, I'm sorry. While the class did introduce me to new ways of looking at sound. Lectures and Professor Veal were aggravating.",
    "The music is so good, and it's great to gain a footing in each of these musical cultures. It's inevitably pretty superficial, but that's fine given the breadth. Prof. Veal is deeply knowledgeable about world music--and dub and other Jamaican musics especially--and is often astonishingly thoughtful, creative, and clear in his lectures. He also led fruitful critical discussions at the end of each unit. I found that some of the units were better-organized\/structured than others, however, and that sometimes it wasn't clear what was being asked of us on end-of-unit quizzes. It seems like the organizational problems of this course are not as bad as they were in past years.",
    "Good class. I really like Prof. Veal, and felt like I was exposed to a lot of absolutely incredible music and music traditions. The class was decently coherent for a really difficult premise (to cover 4 distinct music traditions around the world in one semester).",
    "MUSI 353 is a fun, low-stress course. Professor Veal is an excellent teacher with a breadth of musical training and experience studying musical traditions from around the world (especially African traditions). The class is not challenging (just 3 quizzes and a final paper, all which are quite reasonable) and will make you think about musics youve likely never been exposed to. Veal also questions musicological methods and ideas in a challenging and engaging way, allowing for fascinating class discussionsif you dont like discussions that go all over the place, however, you might not like some of these. The class is incredibly disorganized and its never really clear what the expectations are, but thats not actually stressful cuz its clear that things will all be okay in a relaxed atmosphere like this class provides. I highly recommend the course to all and any if they can make it a bit more organized (or if youre looking to expand your musical understanding beyond the limited, western and classical-oriented scope of most of the music major courses), but Id wait until that happens before fully recommending it. Regardless, its a fun, interesting, low-stress course thatll expand your musical and cultural understanding.",
    "Prof. Veal is extremely thoughtful, particularly if you can get him one-on-one, but his lecturing style often a little disorienting. Having said that, the class really opened me up to a lot of unfamiliar musics, and the workload was reasonable.",
    "Welp, you have to take it. There are bits when it will be super frustrating. But it's also probably good that you have to learn about some stuff that isn't Western art music. Chin up.",
    "Examination of the musical traditions of India, Indonesia, West Africa, and The Caribbean. You'll love this class I'd recommend it highly for majors and non-majors alike!",
    "This was an overall enjoyable course given the impossible task of doing justice to \"world music\" in a single semester. We focused on the music of India, Indonesia, West Africa, and the Caribbean. Each unit has four lectures, a guest presentation, and a discussion before the test. Professor Veal was well organized, and lectures were lively and fun. The live demos were the best! Readings were a mixed bag--some were very well written and enjoyable and others were quite academic and dense. I felt that I gained a general understanding of the areas we studied, but also sometimes felt that the course failed to probe the post-colonial climate of these areas in a really nuanced, concrete way."
