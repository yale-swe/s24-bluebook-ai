    "Learned a lot of background about CogSci of morality. Really interesting material and great discussions.",
    "I learned how to read and discuss journal articles at a high level. I learned how to conduct my own experiment and write a scientific paper about it. I also learned how to think critically and deeply about moral issues grounded in empirical work.",
    "I learned about the literature related to the Cognitive Science of Morality, and learned how to conduct my own psychology study.",
    "I gained an appreciation and understanding for all of the different theories researchers have created to describe how humans arrive at moral judgments.",
    "I learned a lot about the different theories of morality that various philosophers, psychologists, and economists have put forth. I also learned how to engage in truly socratic dialogue.",
    "Not having a background in psychology, I learned how to read published papers in empirical moral psychology. We learned about various theories purporting to explain the source of commonplace moral intuitions in the first part of the course, and later connected some of these theories to some of the philosophical literature about meta-ethics, among so much more. As a philosophy major, it was very exiting to see philosophers rely on empirical data in philosophical argumentation. After taking the course, I believe this is something philosophers should do more often - they have a ton to learn by paying attention to developments in moral psychology!",
    "I learned a great deal about contemporary research in cognitive science and psychology on moral judgments. I was also given the opportunity to conduct empirical research on moral judgments for a final project. The course helped me to think through how empirical psychology is or ought to be significant for moral philosophy."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is cross-listed in philosophy and psychology, but in general the course felt like it skewed towards the latter. It examined what might be traditionally philosophical questions, but the conversation in general was more typical of a psychology course--this could be a strength or a weakness based on what you're interested in. The course structure (low-stakes weekly reading responses and a final paper with minimal guidelines) could also go both ways--the final project is very flexible, and can be a really great opportunity to explore something you genuinely find interesting but might also be stressful.",
    "Really interesting material but it would've been great to have a better sense of the course plan (AKA why we were learning about different things and how they fit together).",
    "This course was amazing--probably the best course I have taken at Yale.",
    "A strength is clearly Professor Knobe. He is amazing at leading seminar discussions. One weakness was that we sometimes ended conversations just when they were getting interesting, and I wish we had spent a tiny bit more time in back-and-forth rabbit-hole exploration. Another aspect that was a strength and weakness were the other people in the class. Some people contributed a lot and clearly were invested in the readings and exploring them with their peers, while others didn't hardly ever speak at all (which was a bit disappointing).",
    "This is a fantastic course. First of all, the subject matter has the potential to be intensely fascinating for anyone with an interest in psychology, philosophy or their intersection. Second, the final project, which constitutes the entire grade for the course, is an amazing opportunity to do something other than a conventional term paper. Professor Knobe offers students to \"make a contribution to the field of moral cognitive science.\" I, and other students in the course, chose to do this by running an actual experiment, collecting real data from real participants, and analyzing my results before writing them up in the format of a proper psychology article. All of this was an enormously rewarding experience and I'd recommend it to anyone who has a passion for psychological research. Finally, Joshua Knobe is simply one of the coolest and kindest professors at Yale. Like many other departments, philosophy at Yale suffers from an egregious lack of diversity, both in terms of faculty and students. However, I noticed during shopping period when more than 50 students showed up in the hopes of getting into Prof Knobe's class that the gender distribution was fairly balanced among the shoppers. I don't think this is a coincidence. Indeed, I think this has something to do with the reputation that Prof Knobe rightly has earned as a kind, inclusive, and curious professor. For one thing, Prof Knobe made a deliberate effort to make the seminar room a comfortable environment by asking us, the students, about ground rules that might make discussions our discussions more comfortable and productive. Moreover, rather than shutting down students' ideas if were incomplete or imperfectly formulated a practice that disproportionately affects underrepresented people in the discipline, who might be suffering from imposter syndrome Prof Knobe always teases out the most interesting aspect of a student's idea and finds a way to frame it as a genuine contribution to our class debate.",
    "Strengths: Every week, we focused on a different discipline and their take on morality, and having the views of each discipline build up week by week, we truly had the opportunity to explore the cognitive science of morality. Weakness: Because we only met once a week and because some readings are simply more interesting\/require more time to delve into the depths of to fully appreciate, sometimes I would leave class unsatisfied.",
    "Every class was fascinating. I think each person brought a great perspective to the table and class discussions were well facilitated. Sometimes, however, the discussions would go over my head (eg. someone would refer to an outside theory) and I would get lost. Josh did well to try to re-explain things as we went along, but it didn't always clear things up completely. Additionally, in the readings, often it was hard to guess which parts would be most relevant for class when we were reading them (in class we would only talk about parts of the readings. Sometimes we would talk about the ideas broadly, but sometimes we would talk about the theoretical methodology or the differences between the papers. We didn't know which part Josh would set as the theme for the class until we walked in). Finally, despite about three class discussions on it, we never defined morality or figured out how moral issues are different from other social issues, which made the theory behind the class feel a bit un-grounded.",
    "Strengths: Josh is an amazing discussion facilitator. I've never been in a seminar that flowed as smoothly as this one did and with as high a level of engagement from nearly every person in the room (but then again, that might be because everyone who was selected were clearly very passionate about the subject). The readings were also very interesting, and the final paper was very rewarding to do. Weaknesses: Maybe it's just the nature of this field, but there were definitely topics that I felt were more engaging than others. I also appreciated Josh incorporating some questions about the normative implications of our readings in discussion, but felt that maybe we could have devoted one week to studying exactly that (though this may be more philosophy than cognitive science).",
    "I thought each seminar was really exciting, and additionally Josh is so generous with his time outside of class. As someone not familiar with psychology research, I was very grateful when Josh clarified the readings for each week at the beginning of the class before we delved into a discussion about the concepts in the readings, another aspect of the course which was amazing. I found discussing the concepts of the readings, as opposed to the readings themselves, extremely productive. I do wish that we spent more time each seminar discussing the philosophical implications of the research we read for class - I found myself doing this in office hours instead. It seemed like the interests of students in the class leaned more towards psychology than philosophy, which was a wonderful learning experience for me, but as a result I wanted more philosophy from each class. But overall, this was an amazing course. One last minor suggestion, it would be great if students could see and respond to each other's reading responses for the week, perhaps by making a discussion thread on canvas. This would facilitate peer to peer learning more so than just emailing our thoughts about the reading to Josh each week.",
    "I think the course is an exceptional offering for students that are interested in the cognitive science of morality, and a good offering for students interested in questions about how the cognitive science of morality does\/ought to inform moral philosophy. (I'm biased as the latter). Certainly, the course is philosophical in the the sense that it poses questions about what humans are like, what motivates them, etc. But in my experience, the course (in terms of readings and discussions) is not primarily focused on what implications the empirical research may have for what is called \"moral philosophy.\" There were opportunities to discuss these implications during seminar, and Professor Knobe allows students to write final papers on the topic; the line of inquiry definitely is not discouraged, but it is not a central component of the readings nor of the discussions. I think the course would be more interesting if it included at least one week's worth of readings that focused on the relevance (or irrelevance) of current empirical research for what is called moral philosophy. Maybe the syllabus isn't structured in this way because there hasn't been much work done in the area, but I suspect that's not the case. At any rate, it seems that there are some philosophers who are writing about questions adjacent to the question of how empirical research is or is not relevant to moral philosophy: Haslanger on the \"debunking,\" aim of social constructivism, Cavell on conceptual schemas and relativism, etc. All of that being said, I think the course is very strong overall -- it might be a bit more interesting for people with interests in what is called \"moral philosophy\" if it included some additional perspectives."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but with some reservations. It covers a really interesting set of topics and is truly interdisciplinary. Professor Knobe is also an amazing scientist\/philosopher to get to talk to about this kind of work, and developing the final paper for the course can be a really fulfilling experience. That being said, here are my reservations: First, this course is hard to get into (140 people shopped it and it's capped at 20) and I don't think it's so overwhelmingly phenomenal that anyone should have their heart set on taking it. Second, I never found seminar to be the \/most\/ fulfilling. Granted, that has more to do with the students in a given semester than the course itself, but I did sometimes feel like discussion was organized in such a way that made it difficult for the most interesting or thought-through ideas to emerge. Some reviews I'd read before taking the course made it seem like the class was going to be the single most mind-blowing \/ fulfilling \/ exciting educational experience possible at Yale--and that just wasn't the case. I think this was a solid course, but I wouldn't say it was a fantastic one.",
    "Yes, it was a really interesting course and I'm glad I got the chance to take it.",
    "Absolutely. This was my favorite course this semester and probably ever. If you have any interest in psychology, philosophy, cognitive science, or morality, you should absolutely take this course.",
    "Definitely, if only to take a seminar with Josh. He is simply just a brilliant, kind, supportive, and fun professor. I learned a lot about the ambiguity of the field of Cognitive Science, which was both disappointing and insightful; I feel like I now have a much more realistic understanding of the field.",
    "Definitely! There is a reason why this is such a popular course consistently, both for undergraduates and graduates alike. Professor Knobe is a great mind who cares about nothing more than his students' intellectual growth. The readings are consistently interesting, even if you don't feel particularly sympathetic towards some of the disciplines. The final (and only graded) assignment sounds very intimidating at first --making a contribution to the field of Cognitive Science of Morality, however, if you take it seriously, you will be both very proud of what you end up accomplishing and surprised.",
    "Yes! Definitely. It's hard to get into, but definitely one of the best upper-level cog sci seminars. Each week we would learn about another theoretical framework for how people arrive at moral judgments. It's definitely theory-heavy and there's a lot of reading, but the workload is light: just a brief email reading response each week. The hefty part is the final paper at the end. Sometimes I would get lost in the class discussion, but Josh is a great professor and would periodically stop the class to bring the threads together and reframe the discussion.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in exploring what makes human morality work (whether we engage in moral dyad completion all the time, whether the moral foundations theory is true, etc) and grappling with really interesting questions about what morality even encompasses. If you're looking for something more ethics-based, this is probably not the course for you. Regardless, this class will challenge you to engage deeply in thoughtful questions that have important real-world implications. Very rewarding!",
    "I highly recommend the course. The seminar was super engaging, and additionally Josh is so generous with his time outside of class. As someone not familiar with psychology research, I was very grateful when Josh clarified the readings for each week at the beginning of the class before we delved into a discussion about the concepts in the readings, another aspect of the course which was amazing. I found discussing the concepts of the readings, as opposed to the readings themselves, extremely productive. I do wish that we spent more time each seminar discussing the philosophical implications of the research we read for class as a phil major - I found myself doing this in office hours instead. It seemed like the interests of students in the class leaned more towards psychology than philosophy, which was a wonderful learning experience for me, but as a result I wanted more philosophy from each class. But overall, this course is really a must-take for anyone interested in the potential philosophical ramifications of research in moral psychology.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about the cognitive science and\/or psychology of moral judgments and morality (considered as a psychological\/social phenomenon) more generally. If you are interested in the question of how empirical research is or is not relevant to what is traditionally called moral philosophy (and are not especially interested in learning about the cognitive science\/psychology of moral judgments), I would recommend going to office hours often with Professor Knobe to discuss this question and additional readings you could do on the topic. As the course currently exists, the readings and discussions do not primarily concern themselves with this question. That being said, Professor Knobe is extremely supportive, open to different lines of inquiry, and very helpful during office hours, and you could definitely, with his help, craft your experience of the course in a way that made it more responsive to the questions you were interested in. It would just take some additional work, I think, unless the syllabus changes."
