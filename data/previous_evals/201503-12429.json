    "I was very pleasantly surprised by this lab. The reviews I read were pretty bad, but I think the structure of the course has changed, or at least they were different for this fall semester version. Weekly labs were highly organized and the protocol really tells you everything you will do. TAs and Aruna are helpful for clarifying in lab. You need to study for lab quizzes, but definitely not impossible. Writing reports it the real sticking point for the class, because although there are only two, the first report covers material from 8 weeks of lab and is time intensive\/stressful to remember stuff done from so long ago. Overall though, I thought this was one of the more pleasant serious labs in MCDB and definitely learned useful material in a chill environment.",
