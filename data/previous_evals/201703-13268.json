   "comments": [
    "Well",
    "It was helpful because I had previously taken a few SOM finance courses and faced a steep learning curve. This class helped put things in perspective and allowed me to better understand basic concepts. Definitely took things in the wrong order but found this class helpful.",
    "Perfectly.",
    "I took the course to gain an understanding of how professionals in management positions at nonprofits and private firms do financial planning (e.g. developing budgets and projecting costs). Given the courses nature as a 1-credit, half-semester course, I didn't expect to have a deep dive into accounting and finance. In some ways the course gave me a foundation for understanding the concepts that go behind what I was hoping to learn, but I'm not sure it really met my expectations.",
    "did not meet my expectations at all.",
    "Knowledge and skills were as expected, but you also don't need to attend the classes to get the skills and knowledge. Just read the powerpoints and do the assignments.",
    "I knew going into the class that it was going to be a whirlwind of information, but I decided to take it anyways. Now I have a foundation which I can build off for future classes, which I suppose was the purpose of the course.",
    "I feel that the course aligned fairly well with expectations.",
    "This course aligned perfectly with my expectations.",
    "It aligned with the expectations and I learned some good skills out of it. It definitely could be useful in the future & I'll download those notes.",
    "They aligned decently with my expectations",
    "Fine. I was expecting to learn a little and I learned a little.",
    "I was surprised that this course didn't have more of a focus on environment. It was essentially a generic quick course in small business accounting\/finance where the company we focused on the entire time was an ostensibly \"green\" business. I thought we would learn about actual financial concepts for environmental management, like, financing conservation land deals, how to finance the specific costs and tax breaks of green businesses, etc. Instead we got busywork excel spreadsheets and calculations. Never talked about how to make accounting choices, how finance relates to strategy, or anything like that.",
    "I was disappointed with this course because we moved through the content of the course so quickly and briskly. I gained exposure to the concepts, but don't feel competent applying the content in a professional setting.",
    "Aligned well.",
    "Expectations were met. I did not expect to understand those financial concepts super in depth from this course. I only expected the quick overview.",
    "Aligned",
    "Aligned well. I thought Maureen did a very good job with the subject matter, especially for students who generally do not have much, if any, background in finance or business.",
    "Exceeded expectations.",
    "exactly what I expected and needed",
    "I was expecting something very different from the class, I did learn a lot but the material was covered too fast, so I didn't grasp much of the information.",
    "Far exceeded",
    "The knowledge and skills fell short of expectations due to the hurried nature of the course.",
    "Very well.",
    "I had low expectations from this class based on previous reviews. I could have gained more from this class if less material was covered and we got a clear understanding of the basics. I feel like we covered so much, I just know more of how much I don't know as opposed to actually knowing more.",
    "Well.",
    "Below expectations.",
    "I was not sure what to expect, but it certainly helped clarify some of the terms and concepts that I had encountered in my previous work experience.",
    "I gained the overview as I expected, but the format of the class limited by ability to really engage with the material. I think the amount I actually learned was much less than the potential.",
    "Very well.",
    "I hoped to gain a more firm understanding of the concepts covered in the class.",
    "My expectations were met.",
    "Met my expectations, if not exceeded. We learned a LOT of information in a very short amount of time. It could have almost been too much information for the time we had.",

   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: In-class exercises in groups were great. Homework assignments were also the right amount of challenging. Weakness: PowerPoints, Maureen often moves too quickly from one slide to the next so it's hard to keep up with taking notes. I feel like presenting the information on an actual Excel document might be more helpful.",
    "It is VERY condensed, it would have been better to either add a credit or take some of the contents out.",
    "I'm not really sure the utility of this class given the short time-frame and exposure. I guess it's useful for giving students a broad overview and prepping them for future classes in finance. I think it tried to accomplish too much in a short time-frame and may be better as a full semester class. Either that, or assignments should be less vigorous and streamlined. Also, the 6-8pm timing of this class is just bad. It's a difficult time to productively learn after a long day, in a classroom full of too many people.",
    "Strength: meet only once a week Weakness: Very hard to actually understand anything",
    "The powerpoints are a disaster - outdated, weird coloring, they don't format properly when you download them.",
    "The course gives students tons of information about financial concepts, and it's up to the student to determine the level of engagement with the course. The information could be presented in a more engaging way, but overall the structure was well defined and organized. I think student engagement would be higher if the course was offered in the first half of the semester rather than the second half.",
    "Strengths: Covered many topics Weaknesses: course was a blur. I would recommend focusing on fewer topics",
    "The homework assignments were absurdly long and detailed for a 1 credit course and provided some benefit, but often there didn't seem to be an emphasis on learning. I spent a long amount of time on the homework, in frustration, and often only to receive the same grade as if I had copied it and turned it in after the class lecture.",
    "I thought the material prepared was excellent and critical to the type of work that I want to do. That being said, I found that the pace was too fast to truly absorb the material. Perhaps a full semester course would be better. I would have also appreciated this knowledge in the beginning of the semester rather than the second half of the semester since I could have used it for other classes.",
    "Probably break it up into different sections so there is more individualized learning, and people can ask more questions.",
    "Strengths: - Tons of practical knowledge - in class assignments and homeworks were practical and gave me the experience using the tools that I needed. - slide decks and class notes will be used for a long time to come Weakness: - Boring - Grading was all over the place.",
    "I think Maureen does a great job. Maybe more of a focus with some of TAs to help with the homework could be useful to go through some of the stuff outside of class (or review sessions of the hard skills)",
    "Maureen Burke really cares about what shes teaching and she cares about all of her students. She gets through as much as possible within the time allotted. It would have been more helpful for me if we did more lecture work on excel, rather than on powerpoint slides",
    "Strengths are that the subject material is taught in a relatable way, and it's a quick overview of things we wouldn't learn otherwise. Weaknesses are that even though the slides are provided, they're often presented very quickly and it's difficult to take notes. When the subject matter makes sense it's relatable, but it doesn't always make sense.",
    "Very difficult to learn anything. Half the class time period was taken up with an unstructured \"in class exercise\" for which we received almost NO guidance, we were just thrown into the deep end of the pool and expected to swim. The TAs didnt help and the instructor didnt either. We were supposed to get help from each other, but if you were sitting next to someone who was slacking off or also confused, that was hopeless. In such a large room with such a variety of people, it was very chaotic and difficult to concentrate or work. The materials for us to learn from were mostly just the instructor's powerpoint slides, which had typos and errors. A lot of time was spent on Investopedia trying to get the full story on things that were not clearly explained by the lectures or readings. In addition, the instructor seemed disinterested while lecturing and was hard to hear. I think the way to improve the course would be to hire someone to teach it who actually WANTS to teach the material implied by the course title and who has the skill to lecture in an engaging fashion. Have the \"in class exercises\" be in small breakout groups with a TA leading them, instead of a big mosh pit. Assign homework and reading that have some relation to each other and to environmental management.",
    "Strengths - Got the notes for future reference. In the future, if I forget a term, I can refer to these notes for backup. Weaknesses - didn't get much feedback on homework, so don't know what I did wrong.",
    "Moved a bit too fast near the end",
    "I think it serves it purpose pretty well. I don't know if I can suggest any improvements. The materials were quite good. Maybe a little more class discussion on certain topics? I mean not just lecture discussion but group discussion, stimulate that somehow?",
    "Strengths- practical application and brevity. Weaknesses- lack of emphasis in advertising the utility of office hours for the homework assignments.",
    "More designated time outside of class for review would have been helpful, like TA sessions. Lectures and assignments were good. Also, would be great if this was at the beginning of the year to help with other classes and projects that happen later in the year.",
    "The strengths are the exercises that we did because they were very well designed. However, the professor spoke really fast and the class exercises were even faster. I wish that we could have had more time to discuss the exercises in class.",
    "Maureen's lecture notes are excellent!",
    "I felt as though lectures were a glossary of many topics, which I probably could have gained from online research or reading a book that is an overview of finance and accounting. It would be helpful for this to be full-length semester course that allows students to gain a deeper understanding of these concepts.",
    "This course is jam packed and could become a full course.",
    "Coverless material. Although this class is marketed as for beginners, the students who got the most out of the class seem to be the ones who already have taken a finance class.",
    "Well structured class. The lecture notes were very helpful. I enjoyed the in class group work. I was sometimes confused by the homework - by the concepts, but also by some wording and formats. I did not receive helpful feedback on my homework.",
    "I liked the activities, the lectures were long and dry.",
    "I would definitely recommend moving rooms the next time it is offered. It is hard to hear audience members in Bowers, so it really limited the ability to participate. People would often call out answers, which couldn't be heard at the front, which discouraged participation. Also, splitting into two smaller sections would encourage more discussion \/ questions, I think.",
    "The format of the class makes engaging difficult. With a two-hour nighttime class, the powerpoints should be more engaging. The in class exercises helped a lot, but it was difficult to pay attention in all other parts.",
    "Strengths was that it was direct, informative, and practical. Monday night lectures are tough but I don't see how you get around it with so much interest.",
    "The lecture notes are very helpful. Maureen was kind and learned everyone's name. The TA sessions were very helpful. The lectures were dry and unengaging. I often felt lost during the practice time in class. It would be helpful to go over the in-class work step by step rather than running through the answers quickly.",
    "I believe this course could be improved by using more excel from the beginning. I was confused as to why we were only using word documents for the first three classes.",
    "Very efficient, and incredibly useful information. Maureen walked through some of the exercises or content very quickly at times. The powerpoint decks have good information, but felt quite outdated.",
    "The course flies through a lot of information very quickly. I found the in-class exercises to be very helpful for working through new information and referring back to during homework assignments. However, we often went over the answers quickly, making it difficult to follow the numbers\/math\/answers on the slide deck as we went over the solutions. I appreciated the notes provided on class lecture topics, though sometimes those could be hard to follow. Nevertheless, they area very good resource, especially to review information later after the course ended."

   "comments": [
    "Definitively useful. Should be a requirement for the new business track.",
    "If you want to gain a broad overview and introduction to financial terms and applications, this may be a good class to take. If you think you will actually be in a management position or want to do finance, you should probably just take a full semester course.",
    "Do not take this course.. You won't learn anything valuable. If you want to learn finance, you will learn much more just by Googling basic concepts.",
    "There seems to be a certain level of hysteria surrounding this course. The assignments are not hard if you follow the powerpoints (which more or less tell you how to do the assignments). Don't get caught up in the panic of having to deal with excel\/spreadsheets.",
    "You'll have a basic overview of financial concepts after taking this course, but certainly not enough to master any of the concepts. It's a good place to start if you don't know anything about finance.",
    "This course is worth taking as an end of semester add on, but is fairly low level.",
    "Take this class if you need experience in finance. It is a great crash course to get you ready for internships or other courses.",
    "Take it if you don't have any of these financial skills! But if you do have accounting or other skills then it may be too basic for you.",
    "Ask questions and go to office hours if you need help!",
    "You'd get the same content at a cheaper price, and in a more understandable way, by taking a small business course at the local community college. This course is a frustrating waste of your time and not up to Yale standards.",
    "If you don't know what NPV is or how to read financial statements, this class will be worth your time.",
    "Do the homework in a group or with a partner! It helps the learning since you can discuss with other people.",
    "The course gives a very good foundation in the subject matter and should be quite helpful for anyone without a finance\/business background. You need to engage to get the benefit from it, really throw yourself into the subject matter and problem solving. Ask questions about the concepts.",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "The material is covered very briefly, however, if you dedicate enough time you can learn from it outside the class.",
    "This should be foundational for every F&ES student",
    "Take it if you have already taken a finance course. I had not, and I was mostly confused.",
    "Go to office hours if you have difficulty with the concepts - the lectures move quickly.",
    "Good introduction to accounting if you have never taken anything like it before.",
    "Don't fall behind on the homework.",
    "I believe this course will help you build the vocabulary of financial analysis, which will make further coursework in this realm a little bit easier.",
    "Would definitely recommend taking the course if you do not have a financial background. The content is quite dense at times, but felt very useful.",
    "This is an introductory course to financial concepts--don't expect to become an expert in or even extremely comfortable with any of the subject matter in just 6 weeks. Rather, take this course if you want familiarity with terms and general concepts so that you could follow along with a conversation about for-profit financial issues in a work environment."
