   "comments": [
    "A good, standard introductory German course for beginners. I have a love for Germany itself, which is why I took this course even after having completed my language requirement. I think this course is most rewarding when you are in it because you feel motivated and excited to learn German!",
    "Quite a good intro language class! If you are interested in learning German, go for it.",
    "L1 German is really great fun. You move quickly enough, and cover a lot of material in a semester, and are decent at speaking by the end. Adrian was cheerful and adorable and helpful the whole way through-- absolutely take his section if possible.",
    "I recommend german 110. Adrian is a great teacher, and it's a pretty fun language. It's harder than some other languages like french or spanish would be, but it's a fun sort of challenge.",
    "German 110 was a very fun class! It would be best to take if you like completing many small assignments (short readings most days, send 2 german emails per week, complete a mid-length homework twice a week). However, any learner can adapt to the style of the course with a little bit of hard work. The classroom environment is very positive and engaging. The beginning of the term is fun as you're thrown into a new language, and the class manages to avoid monotony even though it's taught every day of the school week. The final project is a 5- to 10-minute group movie project due before reading week, with which your instructor will help. German is not a world language by any means, but it is important. Germany is a very worthwhile destination of travel (you might also be doing business there), and many great authors wrote in German (e.g. Kafka, Goethe).",
    "Really fun, class is engaging. There is work every week but it's not much and good for practising anyway. Highly recommended.",
    "It's a really great time where you get a basic grasp of the language. If you want to learn German I would recommend it. While the class never feels absurdly difficult, you still learn a crazy amount. What could be a very stressful environment is made fun by the multiple projects, and the great teachers.",
    "L1 german is a great introduction to all aspects of German language. I definitely recommend it if you're interested in learning the language. The teachers are also great, and the curriculum is well thought-out. The workload is very manageable and the tests are usually very fair. Plus no final exam!"
