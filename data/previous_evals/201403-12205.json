   "comments": [
    "Great course-- would recommend",
    "Yes I would, but definitely would say of all three DS classes, H&P is not as strong a class.",
    "I would recommend DS Historical and Political Thought to any student, regardless of major. It is a good comprehensive combination of history and political theory from ancient Greece to the Middle Ages.",
    "Follow Smith and you won't regret.",
    "The class is challenging, invigorating, and dynamic. You'll be led by Steven Smith through some of the most fascinating and important texts of the last, oh, twenty-five hundred years. It will change the way you read the news, the way you talk, the way you think, making you more profound and more developed in your beliefs. Because when you do battle with Plato and Aristotle, you come out stronger. And Steven Smith coaches you every step of the way. Take this class. Take it. You'll love it, and join the cult following of Steven Smith.",
    "I didn't like Directed Studies particularly, but if you're doing DS, then I do recommend Smith's section for HP. As HP sections go, Smith's is definitely one of the better ones. He's one of the more complete and exciting thinkers among the HP faculty (based on what I've seen in lectures and heard from other people). In his section you'll spend a lot more time discussing large-scale understanding of each thinker as he differs from or is similar to the other thinkers we read (rather than discussing the smaller details of administrative policy or things like that), but the discussions he leads on these larger-scale questions actually end up being pretty specific, insightful, helpful.",
    "It is an intensive but extremely rewarding course which should be considered by any student in the college.",
    "Historical and political thought traces the evolution of the way that observers, sometimes removed from history, sometimes active components, view various social and political phenomenon. The course covers a mixture of observational history, whereby historians merely chronicle events, and normative history, where thinkers suggest ways to improve society. One of the most interesting takeaways from the course is that the two approaches to history are intimately intertwined. I would recommend it in conjunction with a course on classical history.",
    "Would absolutely recommend this course. I would summarize it as an inquiry into the Western foundations of historical and political issues that will always be relevant to us and should be critically examined in order for our present-day involvements in our political system. For me, the course brought history to life and made it controversial and dynamic."
