    "Q 1: no answer because no actual text or readings besides individual group researchQ6: pace of individual projects was good; pace of some of the lectures could have been a bit faster.Overall, the individual group meetings with instructors very valuable as were group review of projects. Some of the guest speakers, such as the gentleman from the Hartford, should not be brought back as they did not provide much value."

    "I thought a fair number of the lectures didn't really add anything for students from SOM who had real-world work experience. I can see how the content may have been really helpful for non-business students and\/or those without much work experience. Maybe there's no way around to develop content that's useful for everyone given the range of backgrounds\/experiences of the students in the course, but I'd encourage giving some additional thought to this issue. Maybe make lectures optional?",
    "Some of the lectures from the guest speakers as noted above.",
    "I found the classes themselves to be worthless. The few speakers who came in were not at all impressive. In fact the person who came in from The Hartford was a poor example of whatever he was supposed to be an example of. I'm not even sure why he was there. The class was not useful to completing our consulting projects, which was the purpose\/only assignment of the course. Our project had a lot to do with corporate sustainability, and it would have been useful if Dan Esty had \"co-taught\" the class rather than Brad Gentry, because Brad does not work on projects\/topics that students were dealing with in class. Why was Brad even listed on the syllabus? He never once entered the classroom or was offered as a resource.Also, our project was extremely broad, which the professor told us going into it. We figured we could deal with it because the professor had theoretically screened all the proposals. But it turned out to be WAY too much for us, or for any other 2-person pair over the course of less than four months, to do a great job on. That was disheartening. It makes me think the prof did not provide prospective clients enough guidance, or force them to be more specific in their requests. My suspicion was verified in conversations with our client, who said she didn't really know exactly what she was getting into."

I know the class was small this semester, smaller than in the past, but two was too few for our large project. I think we didn't do as good a job for the client as we could have with an additional person in the group."
