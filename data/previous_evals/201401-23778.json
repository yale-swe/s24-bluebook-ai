    "All information presented during classroom sessions was supported with very useful examples. However, there could've been a little more variety in the examples. For instance, textbook examples that involve shapes that aren't square or compact for flexure would be more realistic and, thus, more helpful.",
    "Some of the lectures skipped back and forth and were less streamlined and defined. The overall concepts were presented well, but some of the minute detail in steel got lost as we kept flipping back and forth between the appendices, backtracking, or getting off topic with questions.",
    "Mr. Schmidt is obviously still getting his format worked out, but showed improvement over the semester.",
    "Steve jumped around a lot which was a little tricky to follow, but I felt like he really took the time to teach and explain the material which was really great.",
    "The classes got much better as the term went on. It was Steves first time teaching (I think) and I understand that there is a large learning curve."

    "Workload was clearly defined in the syllabus",
    "The workload is huge. This is appropriate.",
    "A few of the assignments took 3+ hours to complete due to a huge amount if trial and error. I wonder if giving a range of possible sizes to look at would help that, without diminishing the use if the assignment.",

    "The two instructors demonstrated two different levels of confidence in their own knowledge of the work. This often lead to confusion amongst students.",

   "question_text": "Please offer additional comments on such topics as: what worked best about the course, suggested improvements, class materials, etc.",
   "comments": [
    "It was weird to have a different professor half way through and even though Steve clearly knows the material, we was very nervous at the beginning but steadily became more confident throughout the semester. I do not blame him though because if I were to teach a Sammler class with Ben Sammler sitting there taking notes I would be nervous as well. Frequently our class would nitpick on problems and \"what if\" situations that he struggled to wrangle the class back onto the planned lesson and as a result occasionally blazed through a lot of topics at the end of the lecture period.",
    "Steve has a great command of the information but would get frequently side tracked by questions. I think presenting the material in its entirety first would have mitigated the confusion.",
    "My only frustration was some of the test grading. I understand the concepts but made some math errors which drastically reduced my grade. I understand how important it is not to make those types of errors while in a real life situation because it affects the safety of people, but it still was frustrating in an academic test setting.",
    "I thought that Ben Sammler's presence was a boon to this class. It seemed as if he helped focus the class and add significant pieces of information.",
    "I think as time goes on Steve will have a way to better focus his lectures."
