    "CS490 gives you a chance to do a one-on-one project with a professor. Your advisor pretty much defines you experience for the semester so choose wisely. The advisor-shopping process is very strange and can be very awkward (think: blind dating) but you will be rewarded in the end for talking to lots of people.This class takes as much work as you want to put in. Some of my friends did very little work and rushed through it at the end of the semester. Others started early and were working on it every week.Listen to your advisor when they tell you a project idea you have is too easy\/hard. They are probably right and you ignore their advice at the risk of wasting lots and lots of time.This was one of my favorite classes at Yale because you get to do what you want to do. You program in your favorite language, you think about your favorite problems, and you work with your favorite CS professor. What could be more fun than that?",
    "It's both required AND fun."
