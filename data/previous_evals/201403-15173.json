   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you need it for your major. Don't take it otherwise- there are more interesting courses on more relevant\/interesting\/less identical poets.",
    "It's a class you have to take to be an English major. Frankly I'm not sure why you'd take it (as it is now) for another reason.",
    "125 is a great survey of English poetry. Even if you're not an English major, this is a valuable and interesting class. And Glaser is really good. He leads engaging discussions and doesn't take any nonsense. Four essays over the semester, a few smaller assignments that focus on elements of style and verse between poets (for example, a verse translation assignment of Chaucer, composition of a Spenserian stanza, etc.).",
    "Great class if you enjoy close reading, and by that I mean *very* close reading. If you don't want to spend an hour talking about one sonnet, 125 isn't for you. I personally enjoyed going into the details of the poetry we read, though I liked some authors (Shakespeare and Donne) much more than I liked others (Spenser). Professor Glaser requires students to submit blog posts (about 12 over the course), which is actually helpful as long as you don't let yourself get behind. He is very good at encouraging people to participate in section, and office hours are very helpful when planning papers. Overall, a challenging, yet rewarding course.",
    "Very close and in-depth reading of some of the greatest poets in the English language. If you enjoy bawdy humor in Middle English, and analyzing\/writing about the same (and reading court romances, Shakesperean sonnets, metaphysical erotic poetry, etc.), then take this course. If such explorations would bore you, look elsewhere. Especially great for English majors (and others in the humanities), but certainly accessible enough for more STEM-y types."
