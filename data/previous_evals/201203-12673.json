   "comments": [
    "ENGL 127 is a terrific class. It's a reasonable amount of work, but very interesting. If you can get Professor Avilez, you're in for an incredible time.",
    "It's a rewarding course that makes you read the books you should have and introduces you to some you haven't heard of. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "It's a really fun and interesting class that I would definitely recommend to anyone!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IT IS AMAZING WITH GERSHUN.",
    "The best English class I've ever taken. The discussions are super interesting and relevant and LIFE CHANGING, in a way. I enjoyed class even when I didn't do\/hated the reading for the day! Avilez is an amazing seminar leader\/discussion facilitator. He's so encouraging of everyone and tolerant of even the most outlandish ideas. The reading load is sometimes really heavy (e.g. Moby Dick), but the assignment load and grades are really quite fair. This is the only class that I'll miss after this semester!",
    "English 127 provides a basic overview of American literature with a few twists along the way. It's not a totally standard survey course as it includes movies, graphic novels and plays generally not celebrated as the paradigms of American literature alongside your classic Whitman and Dickinson. Definitely, definitely take it, especially if the thought of taking English makes you a little nervous (as it does for me).",
    "I would highly recommend this class. You will work hard, but it is completely worth it. The teacher is spectacular, the novels\/movies are fantastic, and the discussions in class are absolutely stimulating and engrossing.",
    "Take this class with Professor Avilez!!! He is a really engaging professor, and class discussions were always fun. There is a lot of reading in this course, but I found the assortment of works we read all very enjoyable. The three papers we wrote were manageable, and I think they definitely helped improve my writing. This was my favorite class yet- definitely take it if you get the chance!",
    "English 127 can be a fantastic class, depending on your professor. I had Professor Avilez, and he made English 127 my favorite class this semester. There can be a good amount of reading some days, but most of the readings are really interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Very enjoyable class, you learna lot from it and Professor Avilez is absolutely amazing!",
    "A seminar capped around 18 or 20. Only a small portion of the class was going on English Literature, but I was always impressed by the quality and insight of the comments of my classmates and learned as much from them as I did from Prof. Avilez. The course is designed to give insight into the texts studied by juxtaposing them in certain ways. I took this course to get a WR credit, but in a context that allowed me to really study literature and learn writing skills from someone in the English department. The course was a little light on writing and instruction (2 5-8 pg. essays with lots of feedback, the first with a required revision; 2 reading responses). ENGL 127 certainly hones in more on writing craft, but I liked how in this course, we were able to study literature.",
    "YES, I would highly recommend this class! A GREAT way to get a writing credit!",
    "I took ENGL 127 with Avilez, and it was one of the best classes I've ever taken. Avilez is a brilliant man, and his classes are never boring. The reading is usually manageable; Moby Dick was a lot to read, but beyond that, it's fine, and the books he chooses are really interesting. Plus, we wrote two papers (5-7 pages) and for the third assignment had the choice of either writing a paper or doing a creative project, so the workload outside of reading for class was actually very small for a writing credit. We even watched a movie and read a graphic novel. If you need a writing credit, take this class with Avilez. If you like literature, take this class with Avilez. You won't go wrong.",
    "A great class that allows you to read some classic American literature, but mixing in many alternative pieces of American literature to give a fresh perspective on the American literary tradition. I would recommend English 127 to all students. It is a very interesting and highly accessible class.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to ANY Yale student. If you're an English person, you will love this course for its amazing reading list and Professor Avilez's literary insights. If you're not an English\/Humanities person, but are looking for a writing or humanities credit, you will STILL love this course because Professor Avilez makes class discussions so interesting and engaging. The reading list is incredibly interesting and diverse--we covered many of the American classics (Dickinson, Whitman, Melville) and also dived into some more recent authors (Pynchon, Morrison). There was also an interesting focus on American immigrant authors, such as Cr\u00c3\u00a8vocoeur, Hwang, and Lahiri, which added new perspectives on the question of what makes literature \"American.\" I was also impressed by the wide array of literary forms we discussed: in addition to the standard poetry, short stories, and novels, we also read plays and a graphic novel, and even watched two movies and a music video. For a class that fulfills a writing credit, there is a relatively light workload: 2 papers, 2 shorter reading responses (and an optional 3rd reading response), and a 3rd paper or creative project. However, this class does entail a pretty hefty amount of reading--I'd estimate an average of 80-100 pages of reading per class. With books like Moby Dick, this could become somewhat onerous, but most of the books were so good that I didn't particularly mind the amount of reading we had. It's possible to get by without doing all the reading, but the reading list as a whole is really rewarding if you finish all of it. tl;dr: TAKE THIS CLASS! If you're planning on taking 127, take it with Avilez!",
    "Would definitely recommend this course. We had the opportunity to read really terrific American literature, and Professor Avilez is so engaging and supportive. The workload was manageable, and the work was rewarding. Amazing class overall!",
    "Definitely take with Professor Avilez. He did a great job of moderating class discussions and allowed us to do a creative project or a paper for the final project. All of the works that Professor Avilez added to the curriculum were great and really added an unexpected and modern twist to the class.",
    "Make sure you WANT to read the authors onthe syllabus. 127 is a lit class, not a writing class, so the majority of the work is reading. That being said, there are not that many writing assignments (2 essays, 1 final project\/ essay, 1 final, 2 response papers), so don't expect much constructive feedback regarding your writing. Avilez LOVES the class- he's SUPER receptive to anything you say and very invested in making sure everyone is having a great time. He's very easy to meet during and after office hours. I definitely fit in conferences before every major assignment and we talked through ideas. Class discussions are generally well run (sometimes he's a little scattered), and he encourages you to speak, so it's a very safe environment. Discussions I felt were occasionally stunted because not everyone did the reading, but it really depends on the class composition.",
    "Take it. Take it. Take it. Even if it has absolutely nothing to do with your major. This is a beautiful class and has everything that is good about a seminar.",
    "English 127 was an excellent introduction to American literature. The reading selection was diverse and interesting. Discussions were fun. Prof Avilez was very enthusiastic and supportive.",
    "Definitely recommend; pretty much all the readings are interesting and the workload is manageable. Prof. Avilez is really helpful and a great professor to take this class with."
