    "You get a lot of Greco-Roman history,but the course is more about historical political thought; if you want to think about how to build an ideal society and keep it under control, this is a great place to start. On the other hand, some writers have ideas that have since been pretty completely proven incorrect, and that isn't always acknowledged. There's a lot of reading, and you need to do basically all of it if you want to contribute to the class without feeling foolish.I recommend many of the works studied to pretty much everyone with any interest in history\/ancient politics, though you should take DS based on how you feel about the other two subjects, since this one gets the least overall attention, I feel, by lecturers (H+P is in some ways a literature\/philosophy course in itself)",
    "Take it. DS is hard but wonderful. And you meet really cool people. But don't expect to sleep too much.",
    "Greek political thought as seen through the great books of ancient greece and rome. I would recommend this course to anyone.",
    "Yeah, take DS, Professor L won't fail you, but there are better profs in DS that keep class discussion on track and will connect the different works more effectively",
    "The readings for H&P are definitely the most demanding, but in the end they're worth it. You read some great books that I, at least, would never have read otherwise.Lizarribar is not a bad choice. She's demanding on papers, but gives decent feedback. The class was always lively, and really fun. I always enjoyed our discussions, too, and I appreciate that she lets students take the strongest hand in where the conversation goes, instead of directing it herself (unless that becomes necessary).",
    "This is not a history class; it is, quite literally, a class on Western historical and political thought. If you're interested in politics and the way political thought has formed and changed in the Western tradition, you will enjoy this class. If you're interested in learning about historical events and people and how they influenced history, you will be disappointed with this class. Also, there is more reading than you will be able to do.",
    "DS History and Politics was my least favorite DS section, but the texts are still worth reading and understanding.",
    "Its a lot of work, but very interesting and relevant to modern life.",
    "I personally would not - I found that DS wasn't exactly what I expected, but if you're prepared for breadth of reading rather than depth, it might be for you."
