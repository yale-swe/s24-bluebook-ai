   "comments": [
    "It is a unique way to get hands on experience excavating and analyzing finds. Take it if you can commit to using your Saturdays for most of October for digs and would like to know more about archaeological analysis!",
    "Take this course if you like to dig (and aren't afraid of worms) and if you are going to need to commit a lot of time to your other three classes (don't take just two other classes in addition to this class and lab) or your extra-curriculars this year.",
    "Recommend it for anyone who is interested in how archaeology is done in the field. Also recommend it for a good Social credit if you can make the weekend trips -FUN!!! (my semester it was the Saturdays in October). The class is about Grad students so it also allows you to meet some people besides undergrads.",
    "Yes. If you want to experiment with something new, this is def. an interesting and fun course.",
    "Take this class if you are an archaeology or anthro major - very easy way to get THREE CREDITS with minimal work. Our class had 5 Saturday all-day digs, but two were rained out, so there is really no way anyone could complain about the workload for this class. Prof. McIntosh is pretty chill. Be prepared for long days in the field, but very minimal formal assignments during the first part of the semester. The field report will be prepared during the second semester.",
    "If you just need a few social science credits, TAKE THIS CLASS. It takes away some of your weekends or Saturdays depending on where the field work is being held that year, so it can be a time commitment in that sense, but it's really fun. It's one of the very few classes I know of that gives real-life experience and you get to bond with a diverse group of Yalies while you dig. Plus except for the loss of a few weekend days, you don't really end up spending that much time for the course, which allows you to take a heavier workload in your other classes. After you analyze the collected artifacts in the lab, you just have to write a section of the field report, which is not more than like 8 pages.",
    "I would recommend the class, especially to anyone interested in archaeology. It is a great introduction to excavations and field work."
