   "comments": [
    "Fantastic survey. Interesting lectures and readings.",
    "You look at some great pieces, but only about half the lectures are interesting. Additionally Professor Keizer does not give you a slide list or any kind of centralized place to find the identification information he requests, so preparing a study guide for the midterm and final took about as much time as studying for the final did. It was very frustrating. Also the two papers are not on the syllabus - know that they exist.",
    "Great class if you have any interest in art history.",
    "Great summary of major works in Italian Renaissance Art. It is an Art History class so there is a required amount of memorization for the midterm and final but nothing unreasonable.",
    "Great class! Especially for non majors this is an easy and interesting course if you are at all interested in art history!",
    "Great class. Learned a ton.",
    "I would definitely reccomend this course. It's not hard at all and really engaging and interesting material. TAKE IT IF YOU ARE AN ART HISTORY MAJOR!",
    "I'm a science student, so I should start out by saying this is biased, but I think that if you have interest in art, you should definitely consider taking this course but understand that the format and way to study for this course is very different from other more science-y or math-y courses. There are two exams and two papers throughout the course. I had little trouble with the papers, but the exams involved a lot of memorization, and you need to do the readings to get full points for some of the essay questions on the exam. The readings are usually ridiculous (~40 pages per class), so I never really did them, and my exam results suffered as a result. I think that I enjoyed the class because it was a really chill class that I could listen to or do other things in if I needed to catch up, and I definitely got a strong grasp on the Italian Renaissance form of art. However, my grade in this class is honestly probably slightly less than satisfactory, due to the fact that it came from only a few assignments\/exams and we were given little help in preparing for them. Keizer is a quiet, nice guy and a good professor for this class. Workload for this class is practically zero if you don't do the readings, and probably decent if you do.",
    "Yes definitely. I enjoyed this class very much, even though I am an economics major. It's a great way to learn about renaissance art. Has a good combination of breadth and depth.",
    "Learn about great artists, and fun!",
    "Fantastic class if you're interested in gaining a cursory knowledge of the subject and very accessible to non-majors. Great class to take before leaving Yale.",
    "You learn about a bunch of Italian artists from the Renaissance and the work they did, but also about the biographies of the artists and their works. Professor Keizer places much more emphasis on historical and biographical context, and less on super-in-depth iconographical analysis of works of art. In this manner, it was different from several art history courses in a refreshing way.",
    "I would recommend it. It gives a great survey of all this wonderful art and teaches you to look at it with a critical eye, and it's just an entertaining course in general. I was able to take it without any prior experience, if you're willing to make an effort the class gives back.",
    "Take this class! As an Econ major, I was new to this field, and I took this class because I was interested in the art of this period. Professor Keizer is absolutely fantastic! His lectures are clear to follow, and very engaging. He is approachable and accommodating. His slides are well organized, and his passion for the subject is palpable. He also has a wonderful sense of humor! His class is well structured, and the assignments, while sufficiently challenging, are straightforward. Workload: a midterm and final (IDs, comparison questions, and essay questions based on readings); a 2-3 page visual analysis paper on one YUAG artwork (I had no experience doing this - but Professor Keizer led his section through the process wonderfully); a 5 page research paper. Take this class if you're interested in the period - the art is absolutely beautiful, and the artists are worth knowing about.",
    "This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale, and one of the best art history classes. I would recommend it to majors and non-majors, because Professor Keizer's lectures are so interesting and accessible. You will learn a great deal about several 16th and 17th century Italian artists, and you will be aware of most of the issues going on in that period of art in general.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was a great way to learn about a specific period of art history really well, and I found every lecture extremely interesting. The readings could be a a bit long, but it wasn't necessary to do all of them. The two papers were very manageable, and the midterm and final were both fair.",
    "I recommend this course with reservations. The topic of the course is terrific\u2014you will study the masters of Italian renaissance art and learn to think about their work from an art historical perspective. However, the course was not particularly well organized. Lectures were generally engaging but lacked an overarching narrative structure and certain basic logistics of the course like section sign-up and assignments for papers were not well managed. I was really excited to take this course after taking a different Art History course last semester but was a bit disappointed by it even though I think the subject itself is fascinating."
