    "Highly useful introduction to the main questions and texts covering the history of the early Republic, particularly the political history of the time period. Was crucial for my own early research in terms of introducing questions around class and rank along with a broader look at the ways in which early American identity has been debated by historical actors and scholars.",
    "Great orals prep. And just interesting questions to think about!"
