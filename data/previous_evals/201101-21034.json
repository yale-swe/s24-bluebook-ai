    "Studies in Grand Strategy is perhaps the best academic experience you can have on any level nationwide. I am blessed to have been selected for this course, as it has made me a deeper thinker and a more thoughtful person. Put in the time completing outside readings, mediate deeply over the papers, and fight to get to know each professor and practitioner. The teaching of grand strategy requires a reciprocated effort from both student and instructor. Rest assured, the GS professors will provide.",
    "This is a unique course, and its been honed and refined a number of times. The strengths are the three main professors, the material, and some of the other students.there are, however, significant problems, the biggest of which is a certain vacuousness, a sense that through all the bluster not very much is actually being taught, and that what is being taught is simply being repeated and not developed. there are three of four main themes in the class, and they all come back again and again, and the professors say the same things about them, and by the end of the fourth class a perceptive student will have picked up on them and have gotten bored. this intellectual stagnation was demonstrated most starkly when Prof. Adam tooze came in to co-teach and just rocked the house. the complexity and depth of his engagement was astonishing, and the contrast it drew with normal class was clear to all of the students. I remember a number of us remarking that we learned more in those two hours than we had the whole rest of the semester. not a good thing.this stagnation encourages a certain type of declarative grandstanding among both professors and students. the intellectual movement is always towards stability and the end of the discourse. comments frequently end with some kind of platitude that is meant to wrap it all up nicely in a little bow. students pick up on this, and the result is often frustrating frustrating: they take an incredibly complex world-historical phenomena and presume to opine about it with the authority born of precisely the vacuous, platitudinous discourse that so often reigns in GS.One problem specific to this year: peggy noonan, who embodies this kind of discourse perfectly. now, peggy seems like a wonderful, perceptive person and a great speechwriter; I've really enjoyed the interactions I've had with her. But she hasn't demonstrated the depth and subtlety of understanding necessary to be teaching a college course, let alone a course as advanced as GS styles itself to be. Every comment is an adjective-laden platitude.Also, I'm not sure where this complaint can be lodged best, but hosts of students have been complaining about the fact that peggy generally doesn't comment on the papers she grades, and the comments she does provide (usually about word choice) give no evidence that she has actually read the paper. This may just be inexperience with the norms of paper-grading in academia: it would be good, though, to let her know that students generally want to know why you gave them the grade that you did. it helps us improve.These remarks have been geared heavily toward the negative, and in a way I'm underselling GS's strengths. There are a lot of wonderful things about the class, and I've learned a lot. The chance to spend time with the professors and the students is probably the best part, and GS builds in a lot of ways to do so. Plus, I haven't seen the second semester, which is apparently very different. Overall: frustrating but rewarding.",
    "Fantastic course! Helps students to think in strategic terms.",
    "I think GS is not a course for everyone. Those who are especially interested in the material and the professors are those who will do the readings, contribute both inside and outside of class, and as such get the most out of the course.",
    "I don't think GS lives up to the hype, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great class. I went into the semester purposefully treating this course just like any other and found myself really enjoying the experience. I'm looking forward to the second semester.",
    "A really great experience if you are interesting in the concept of 'grand strategy' and the history surrounding it. The workload is extremely heavy if you take it seriously, and the class discussions are only fully worth it if you've done at least some of the reading, so: do NOT take this class for the wrong reasons. If you approach it with an open mind and awillingness to dedicate a lot of time to it, it is a very rewarding class.(The dinners are also really fun!)",
    "Readings can be interesting but are not discussed in any specificity in class, so they are ultimately very frustrating to have completed. Class discussion does not involve students in a meaningful way and more often tracks a lesson or big idea that the professors are determined to convey. Papers receive little to no evaluative feedback.",
    "GS is unlike any other course offered at Yale. It is a fantastic experience for some people, and less so for others. If you are considering taking the course, talk to current students and see if it's for you. I've loved the first semester. When else do you have the opportunity to read such important works of history and strategy and discuss them with some of the world's foremost historians and thinkers.",
    "Great!",
    "Lots of excellent reading, but sometimes the ideology is a bit odd.",
    "Well, the application process is pretty competitive, but if you do get in, GS is an experience worth your time. Granted, if you do all the reading, this course represents an extremely large amount of time, but choosing your readings ... erm... strategically will allow you to get the most out of the course while balancing achallenging schedule.",
    "The early sections were my favorite. The readings are all very interesting, but they just get longer and longer as the course progresses."

    "Grand strategy certainly deepened my understanding of international history. I would encourage faculty to push for this course to fulfill Hu and So distributional requirements for undergraduate students.",
    "Significantly increased my understanding. Simply experiencing the interaction of the professors and the practitioners has greatly increased my knowledge base.",
    "GS motivated my summer experience and has given me tremendous connections as I look forward to a career in public service. Anyone with similar inclinations would do well to apply for this course.",
    "I am an undergraduate, so this class was most helpful in merely exposing me to different perspectives from the professional world: through regular dinners, and the teaching of the 'practitioners' every week.",
    "great readings",
    "I loved the readings. I had always wanted to read the early works of the semester. I did not like the later readings."
