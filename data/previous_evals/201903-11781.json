   "comments": [
    "When I started this class, I could not read a word of Hindi. I can now read and write lengthy stories which is just incredible.",
    "learned how to read and write hindi, different genders and pluralities and how they match up in sentence structure",
    "I gained experience in Hindi comprehension through the fully Hindi-medium class discussions. I also learned grammar and practiced writing and vocabulary.",
    "reading and writing hindi!",
    "Gained a pretty good knowledge of basic concepts in Hindi grammar, as well as reading and writing.",
    "At first, I thought the course moved really quickly and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to keep up -- I'd never been exposed to the Devanagari script before, so I was initially very worried about the weekly quizzes. However, they actually helped my learning so much and I am so impressed that I have gone from being completely unable to read and write Hindi to now being able to answer questions, write stories and read articles. I also learned a lot of grammar that I was unsure about -- I think the quizzes are actually a great way to facilitate learning and make sure I'm absorbing the material every week.",
    "Reading and writing",
    "The course starts out with teaching Devanagri (Hindi) script pretty quickly, and from there she just goes through Usha Jains Hindi grammar book chapter by chapter. She teaches some of the tenses and new vocab and is mainly ironing out students errors since most students have at least a decent knowledge of Hindi going into it.",
    "Hindi reading, writing, conversation",
    "Hindi language and culture",
    "I improved my ability to speak in Hindi, learned the Devanagari script for reading and writing, and learned many grammar concepts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Class is really engaging and facilitates learning in a great way but could use a more specific syllabus so students can complete assignments ahead of time and come prepared to class.",
    "felt like a lot of being talked at and not actual talking",
    "The class is collaborative and everyone is in it together. The quizzes can be very difficult, although they aren't a large portion of the final grade.",
    "very well taught and pretty logical in terms of the order that content is taught. kinda a lot of work though, tests should be half as long. an hour a week is a loooooot.",
    "I thought conversation sections were pretty effective in honing my speaking abilities, but I wish more classtime was dedicated to that. I enjoyed the times we did exercises in class as I thought those were helpful.",
    "I think sometimes speaking more slowly in class -- not because I don't understand, but because I'm not sure of many spelling because I don't know the correct\/exact pronunciations of many words.",
    "The class starts out super quickly, which can be a challenge for some students, and occasionally gets boring as she covers new grammar chapters each class. However, Swapna Ji is nice and the class is fun because of the class banter and conversations. Its a fun way to satisfy your language requirement in a chill, low-workload setting with friends!",
    "I really enjoyed the course!",
    "Weaknesses - feedback was hard to get",
    "The strengths are the instructors, Swapnaji and Anukriti are very helpful and supportive."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!",
    "if you speak or understand some hindi and would like to learn how to read and write it and actually formulate sentences, then yes",
    "If you have moderate Hindi exposure and are comfortable listening, if not speaking, Hindi, then this course would be a good opportunity.",
    "yes! if they can even basically understand any hindi, take it.",
    "If you have a previous basic understanding of Hindi, definitely. Just be aware that you'll be in a class with people who speak Hindi pretty much fluently, so if you're not at that caliber, I'd reconsider and opt for L1 instead.",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "Definitely! Accelerated Hindi is super fun, especially because of the people you take it with. Its a pretty social environment, and Swapna Ji and Anukriti do a good job of promoting that atmosphere. Id say you should be at a pretty good point in being able to understand Hindi and hopefully be able to speak (like even if its really slow and full of grammatical errors). The course starts off super quick and she pretty much expects you to know the alphabet within a couple weeks, but after that, it slows down\/chills out a bit. Hindi is great if you understand it, but cant read and write since its phonetic so once youve got the letters down, its just a matter of practice to get to a quick reading\/writing speed. I even text my parents in Hindi now and then, which is fun!",
    "Yes, it is an engaging and fun course!",
    "It is a nice language credit",
    "Yes, if you are able to understand some Hindi and speak at a moderate level, take accelerated. Swapnaji is great and the class community is amazing!."
