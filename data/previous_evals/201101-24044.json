   "comments": [
    "The resources available were adequate.",
    "yes",
    "It is absolutely absurd that the Art Library closes at 5PM on a Friday during finals week. The regular term Art Library hours are perfectly reasonable, but MUST be extended during finals week.",
    "The library was a good resource for all the needed materials.",
    "Yes",
    "Change the library book one-day checkout policy.",
    "n\/a",
    "Usual complaint: it was very challenging to carry on sustained research given the library's weekend hours and one book per day policy.",
    "Resources are never a problem at YSOA.",
    "Yes, readings were accessible on v2.",
    "The library, as always, is difficult to use due to the limited hours on weekends and one-day check out policy.",
    "Yes, yet the one day policy in the library is difficult to uphold as some of us do not have laptops and can therefore not work on our papers in the library.",
    "yes",
    "The arts library's terrible circulation policy made it very difficult to do research for the final paper, and resulted in a great deal of money spent on photocopying.",
    "Not being able to check out books is a bummer when one has a theory paper to write.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, despite this class' many problems, resources like the readings was always available. Whether the readings were comprehensible and worth my time to read is an entirely different story.",
    "For the most part. I did have difficulty at the end of the course during finals with the limited library hours that were not clearly advertised. Luckily I was able to borrow books I needed for my research paper from friends who owned them, but simply relying on HAAS and the one-book-one-day policy I would never have been able to write my paper properly."
