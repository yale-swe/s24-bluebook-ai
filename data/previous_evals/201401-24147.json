   "comments": [
    "This course is very well designed. Lecture notes and clear and easy to follow, and tests are graded fair. Guest speakers were great as well. I felt I had a strong understanding of immunology by the end of the course.My only issue with the course is that there is not enough time in class for lectures. As a result, Peter Krause lectures very fast and it can be hard to keep up. This is made worse by the fact that slides often aren't posted until after class, as it is not possible to take notes at the pace that the class goes. The course would benefit immensely if it were a half hour longer per week.",
    "great course. taught well and easy to understand the concepts. fair midterm and final. not much weaknesses or much to improve on.",
    "The strengths of this course were the slide presentations and the way they helped to explain immunological concepts. It was also great to have guest lectures. It was very useful that we had the paper discussion sessions as a way of learning about the practical aspects of immunology and also engaging everyone in the topics discussed.One thing that can be improved about the course is to make the discussion groups smaller to enable everyone to contribute equally during paper presentations",
    "While I do think immunology is critical to the EMD track, this class is not particularly well designed nor well taught. The textbook was great, but I didn't get much out of lectures, as Dr. Krause normally just sped read off the slides. Discussions were not particularly useful either, as the 45 minute presentations were usually poorly prepared and presented with little time for discussion. More interactive discussion sessions (and lectures) would be more useful and conducive to learning. In addition, I think weekly or bi-monthly homeworks, whether problems or short essays, would help as periodic check ins to make sure the class was keeping up.",
    "I really enjoyed this course, although it felt very fast-paced at times. As someone who struggles with this subject, spending more time on concepts may have been very helpful.",
    "Love the format of the course.",
    "I really liked the overall class and learned a lot. I now feel able to read papers referencing immunological terms and data and interpret it to some degree.My biggest suggestion for improvement is not to change the overall content of the class, but perhaps to see if some of the bonus topics at the end of the semester could be interwoven with some of the topics a bit earlier in the semester (though I understand certain basic concepts have to be covered before any of these lectures can be given).In all I really loved this class though and felt that it was a very important part of my EMD education. Please do not get rid of it. Basic Biological understanding of infectious diseases and the immune system is important.",
    "Strengths: combination of class lessons and article presentations made for a dynamic course in which the concepts learned could be immediately explored through current research analysis of student presentations.",
    "Good course. Each lecture was like a race for time--a LOT of information, but understandable given that everything was important to know.",
    "I liked the course. It gave a good overview of important concepts in immunology. The weekly papers provided some insight into the concepts that we were learning although sometimes they were outside the scope. The exams were appropriate although it felt more memorization-based. The guest lectures were diverse and interesting. In particular I enjoyed the one on HIV\/AIDS from Dr. Pantisil. The paper provided us an opportunity to explore the concepts we had learned in class in greater depth.",
    "While I can appreciate the need to understand immunology, the class was overwhelming. The accelerated initial schedule was completely overwhelming and I couldn't keep up with the readings or the lectures. This was frustrating and resulted in a lot of catch-up work.I suggest moving through the first few lectures, then alternating between traditional lectures and the guest lectures. In addition to spreading the material out over time, the guest lectures are what really cement the knowledge of the traditional lectures. These could be seen as \"case studies\" that really help us move past a cell biology class and into an applied course.",
    "Slides were too wordy",
    "I love Peter Krause and I think he is one of the most interesting and genuine and intellectually curious ppl at YSPH. He always asks great questions at seminars. But. I didn't like his style of teaching. He pretty much read off slides and the slides were WAY too text heavy. He should try to incorporate some videos or something.",
    "This course was a great introduction to immunology. I learned so much in this class, and I feel that this knowledge has really enhanced my understanding of infectious disease. I liked the mix of hard science in the beginning of the semester and the guest lectures on practical applications in the second half.",
    "The lectures were dry at times but I actually think a chalk talk would've been more interesting. I always enjoyed the professor's insight on the subject and he was very good at explaining the difficult topics"

    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Peter Krause did a great job with the class- I have no complaints with him.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Read off the slides a lot, but was helpful because reiterated the important concepts of each lecture.Teaching was good and he knew his stuff.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr Krause is very knowledgeable about immunology and he brings a lot of experience to the class. I like his style of teaching the course and the way he explains immunological concepts to the class.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0I do not learn well with his teaching style. He basically reads off of very dense slides as quickly as possible. While extremely nice and knowledgeable, his teaching would be greatly improved if he were to add some interaction into his lectures. Also, longer classes (1 hour and 15 minutes) would probably greatly improve lectures, so he could actually explain and teach instead of just read off slides. He also gave little feedback on exams, just a grade with no explanations to wrong answers.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0One of my favorite professors at YSPH! He really cares about his students and is very approachable.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Excellent teaching style. Too much information crammed into one lecture. Perhaps remove one or two lectures from the syllabus and stretch out the information.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Other than a tendency to talk very quickly during lecture, I though that professor Krause seemed very knowledgeable and eager to answer questions. I enjoyed being in his class. He also always took the time to meet with students outside of class and was very responsive toemails.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause is a helpful and resourceful instructor who was readily available through any concern or question regarding course material and assignments. His presentations allowed for very complex subjects to be dissected and clarified. His introduction of a few faculty presentations dealing with current immunological research allowed for further exploration and examples of the impact of the immune system and interactions with infectious diseases.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Great professor--very smart and also caring towards his students. Really listens to his class. Makes hilarious jokes.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause is a nice, understanding guy. He's very approachable and very knowledgeable. He's always curious to learn more as evidenced by his questions during the paper presentations. Sometimes his lectures had a lot of information and it was hard to keep up by taking notes. But overall, I liked him.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0He is really nice but he needs to allow for enough time to really explain the concepts. Also, not everyone is a visual learner, so quickly flipping through text to a diagram is not helpful. Perhaps some of the slides can be reworked to include short captions?",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0The course should have entailed more visual effects for visual learners rather than just being subjected to reading wordy slides",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0See what I wrote above.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause was a very good lecturer. His slides were clear, and they were very helpful when studying for exams. He did a good job making exams clear and going over the concepts\/answers when we got them back. He is very approachable, and I enjoyed being in his class",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Wonderful teacher. He really cares about his students and is an interesting lecturer"

    "Very useful for getting a good grasp of immunology, even if you don't come from a background of microbiology or physiology. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested.",
    "learn immunology and then see it from an epidemiological perspective. greatway to apply the sciences.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student especially those interested in pursuing a career in medicine or clinical research.",
    "Hopefully this class will be improved for next year. A necessary topic but a tough class to get through, not particularly well designed nor well taught.",
    "A great intro to immunology!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It is a great overview of basic immunological concepts that is advanced enough to adequately prepare a student for studying infectious diseases. It is an immunology course with a strong focus on epidemiological topics at the end of the course.",
    "Immunology for epidemiologists provides a thorough view of the impact of the immune system in infectious and chronic illness helpful for first time students and as a refresher course. It should certainly remain a mandatory and primary course within the EMD curriculum as the concepts and factors of immune response to disease will be applicable in almost every other departmental course.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get into research.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a great intro to immunology and gives you some insight on epidemiological perspectives. Professor Krause is a great guy and the classroom is an intimate environment to learn about an otherwise challenging topic.",
    "This is a required class and the first part of the class will probably be overwhelming. Try to do the readings! If they take you too long (like 10 hours per chapter too long), try a short supplemental book so you can at least get the basic concepts down.",
    "Good course but lacks excitement",
    "Yes I think you will definitely learn immunology. I loved the speakers and I thought the tests were good and hard, forcing you to recall the information and differentiate between picky details. I learned a lot. thanks.",
    "This course is a good introduction to immunology. The content presented here is very relevant to other classes in EMD, and I have a better understanding of how the body responds to infectious diseases.",
    "Great class and very useful"
