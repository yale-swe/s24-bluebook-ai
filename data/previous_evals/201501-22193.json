    "German 140 builds nicely off of 130 and the expectations for the course are generally the same as in previous levels.",
    "I took a few semesters of German at Yale and this was by far the worst of them. Unrealistic expectations, the professor raising exams when handing them back so others could see what grades other people got, giving lower grades in every single assignment for no particular reason or for reasons that no one could understand etc are just examples of what this class was. We could never argue against our grades either, because there was clear favoritism in giving grades and that meant that any complaint would lead to a worse grade in a following assignment. The workload was way beyond what any German class should ever have. L3 was incredible, L4 ruined it, and I hope never having to take another German class at Yale. In any case, Steimer is never teaching at Yale again, so you should be fine if you want to take L4.",
    "german 140 is an advanced level german class, with an expectation that you have a fourth level knowledge of german. if you're taking this course, it's probably because you want to expand upon your german writing\/conversational skills. i feel it's a lot more writing intensive than speaking intensive, although there are enough opportunities to speak in class. the entire course is taught in german (with exceptions for more general class\/technical instructions) which i felt was helpful and allowed me to expand my listening comprehension overall. i honestly feel like the book was really unhelpful when it comes to grammar. it goes in with the assumption that you've already covered the subject in a previous course (which in some cases wasn't a wrong assumption to make) but the book wasn't particularly helpful as a refresher, which was a big problem. lots of busywork\/small assignments, and i feel like the final project wasn't particularly helpful. if i had to take the course again i would probably pick another section however. i found herr steimer to be inconsistent with his grading, and some of his comments on my writing assignments weren't particularly helpful.",
    "This course is worth taking it will definitely help you grow in German, if even just from the daily practice."
