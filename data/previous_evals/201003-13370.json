   "comments": [
    "Great course!",
    "strength: broad overview of many topics, the instructor is so knowledgeable and eloquent, really engages youweakness: not enough depth of any topic!",
    "Good. My only problem is that the course doesn't deliver much that I wouldn't have been able to learn on the job. The course content could be updated to include learning skills like how to write a legal memo or information on the role of legal advisers in healthcare organizations.",
    "The course was lecture-heavy and could benefit from more discussion. Overall, it's a very interesting topic and solid course.",
    "The subject matter was interesting but I thought it was presented in an uninteresting fashion. Much of the course was lecture based where I thought discussions could have been more interesting, granted this requires students willing to discuss things. You could tell that the professor had more interesting things to say but I think he held back due to our lack of knowledge in the law setting.",
    "This course provides a great introduction to health law. The topics covered in the class are interesting and important for those who work in healthcare settings to know and understand.",
    "This course is great. It teaches the fundamentals of health law, and should likely be a required course for HPA as it is for HMP.It could be improved by not having 1 single final that determines the student's entire grade.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. It was a moderately-sized class but the set up (both the physical space and lecture style) made it feel cozy. The instructor knows just about everything concerning health law and is able to answer questions well. The text was also a great choice! I enjoyed the lectures once a week, and definitely liked the 10-hour take-home as constituting our whole grade (honestly). I would recommend better outlines for each class to facilitate note-taking on our part.",
    "I think a midterm or a paper in the middle of the semester would have been nice instead of a final worth 100% of our grade.",
    "This course provided a wonderful introduction to health law issues. The material covered was fascinating, and studying it through case law was novel and exciting. Professor Ruger did a great job of making this material engaging and relevant. I haven't taken any other courses like this at YSPH--I highly recommend it.",
    "An excellent introduction to the legal principles and precedents that underpin U.S. healthcare. It was very good in building a picture of how the courts and legislatures interact to build policy over time. This is an area of policy which is too often neglected and it was good to see it given an airing in such an organised way.",
    "very intersting topics presented in very organized fashion",
    "This course is a great introduction to law that applies to public health and helps shape policy today. The weekly lectures are great and grounded in the weekly readings from the law casebook.",
    "i enjoyed the case studies and it's a great way to learn health laws."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Well thought out discussion. Interesting topics. Listened to the class",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0fantastic. engaging. brilliant. so knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Great, thanks for making us not feel dumb for not knowing much about law. Wonderful teaching style, very approachable.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Great at answering student questions but didn't always seem prepared. It would be helpful if he could provide PowerPoint slides or handouts to make it easier to follow along with the lectures.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Ruger is obviously knowledgable and familiar with the law but his lectures were not all that inspiring. He put up an outline but rarely stuck to it and kind of came across ideas as he free-styled based off of his knowledge. I think that more structured lectures to begin class followed by discussion of topics from students would be more productive. If students were required to maybe argue mock cases or develop and voice their own opinionsthis class would be more valuable.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Professor Ruger is very knowledgeable on the topic and did a great job teaching.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0He's so smart than I think he may find it hard at times to \"dumb it down\" for non-law students. He's insanely knowledgeable, very open to questions and just a pleasant man. He's definitely the right instructor for this class.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Great instructor",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0I liked the fact that this class had a good combination of lecturing and discussion. My only criticism would be that I'm not sure one final exam is the best way to grade the course. I think perhaps two exams--a midterm and a final--might help students adapt to studying law and interpreting cases.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0I thought Ted made the course material seem relatively straightforward, when it could easily have been overwhelming. He managed to avoid treating the students as legal trainees who needed to understand the legal principles in detail, and allowed us to be health trainees who needed to know roughly how things work so we would, when the time comes, know when we needed the advice of a trained lawyer and have some idea what questions to ask him or her.Very good in class, helpful in responding to emails, Ted did a great job of getting the right level of simplification of legal material. This course felt less demanding than some other courses I've taken, but that's entirely down to the high quality of the teaching.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0great instructor. very knowledgeable and cares about whether students were able to understand law concept without legal background",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Theodore is a great lecturer probably one of the best while I have been at YSPH. Being a full time law professor at Penn helps him bring a more concrete law background to class and spur discussion around the applications and implications of precedent established by passed laws.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Prof. Ruger's lecture is very informative and passionate, and he covered a wide range of important topics in health care laws."

   "comments": [
    "Amazing!",
    "You'll learn how law is made and how it is implemented as policy. The ethics and legal issues raised are very important for anyone in healthcare to know, especially for managers. Good stuff, just please add more to deliver practical skills.",
    "It provides a good introduction to health law. The material is interesting, yet the workload is not burdensome. Good just for some background, good as a 6th course.",
    "I think the general statement that the course consisted of interesting material with poor presentation would sum it up pretty well.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "This course is great and I would recommend it.",
    "Definitely take it if you're interested in the history of health care law. It doesn't focus on reform, but provides a base understanding of health law in our country. The final is not so bad. Keep up with the reading, summarizing each case briefly in a master sheet to use during the final, so you don't have to read it all at the end and so you can ask questions throughout the semester.",
    "Great course",
    "Really great introduction to contemporary health law issues. I highly recommend it for anyone who may be dealing with health law in the future!",
    "If you're planning to do policy this is a must-take course. It spans every element of law relevant to healthcare without drowning you in more detail than you can handle as a non-lawyer.",
    "very interesting and light workload.",
    "This course is a great introduction to law and its cross sections with the health care system today. The class introduces students to reading casebook law and building arguments and opposition to implications of pass law which shapes policy today.",
    "yes, i would recommend this course, the materials are essential for students in health management and policy.",
    "A great course for the introduction of health law. If a student is interested in health industry or hospital management, this class would be a great overview of the issues involving patient care."
