    "Take it if you are interested in migration and related issues.",
    "Classic lecture. Very interesting material. A few short paper responses. Very reasonable midterm and final. Strange final group project.",
    "In lecture format, a pretty good course with too much reading that isn't really necessary. The last project is kind of confusing, so make sure to get on top of it. Exams are straightforward, but do require you to know a lot of material.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially if you're interested in law. Its a really good overview and the readings are well chosen. Its more historical and conceptual than current affairs based. Also make sure you've done an introductory political science course first, otherwise you're going to be caught out by some of the concepts in the exam questions that are assumed and not necessarily explained in lecture.",
    "I really enjoyed this course! The material is interesting and very well-taught; readings are detailed and connect to a number of different disciplines, including refugee law and economics. Generally, workload is on the heavier side for an introductory-level PLSC lecture (midterm, final, four short summary\/reaction papers, and a long written group project, as well as longish biweekly readings) but it's easily manageable with a bit of focus and planning. If the subject interests you at all, this is highly recommended -- you'll get a solid foundation in a really broad, interesting, and constantly evolving area of policy."
