    "3 hours or so, reading and filling out discussion questions usually. On weeks where assignments were due, it was more, between 5 and 7 hours."

   "comments": [
    "Overall, a good course. The class size was small enough to have meaningful discussions. The book club was a great assignment - an excellent opportunity to do some non-academic reading.",
    "The course was disappointing. it focused almost exclusively on racial and ethnic disparities in health, and the majority of lecture and discussion was focused on documentation of disparities and VERY LITTLE was on strategies to address them. I was often frustrated by how little we addresses actual successes and failures of interventions and policies. I doubt anyone took this course without some knowledge of existence of disparities, and I do not feel like I left with any useful information or insight.",
    "It's great to have such a small group - that's different from most of my courses to date. On the flipside, with so few people sometimes discussion would lag and then it seemed a little forced. Most people have the same general opinions and ideologies, but every once in a while there would be mini debates which was interesting.LOVED the book club. Definitely keep that in the syllabus. You realize disparities are EVERYWHERE.",
    "The course is interesting by nature. It was presented in a clear and logical way. With a small class though, the majority of the course was dependent on student partipication and if people did not feel like talking, the content was somewhat lost and boring.",
    "Great course.Strengths: clear, organized lectures with slide handouts at beginning; all readings were relevant and useful to discussion; format of course was great - short lecture at beginning, followed by discussion of week's readings; diversity of assignments was very appreciated as well (short weekly assignments, discussion lead, book club assignment [REALLY appreciated this assignment], class presentation, and final paper); the classroom environment was very relaxed and participatory, allowing all student voices to be heard.Weaknesses: none really",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course; I felt that the mix of readings and assignments were well-balanced and covered a great variety. Dr. Jones was always very flexible and receptive to suggestions, which made me feel like I was really involved in the course. As far as improvements, I think that discussion worked best when we had discussion questions to answer beforehand, so more of that would be good. I wish we would have included a discussion on elimination strategies throughout the course instead of just at the end. Otherwise, the book report, paper and presentation were great assignments to complete."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Beth Jones is a very kind and knowledgable professor - she cares for her students and in the quality of the work they produce.",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0While I think Beth is a pleasant person, as a discussion leader she is not very competent. She all too often takes over discussion and leads it down her own predetermined path, despite there being students assigned to lead the discussion to what they have determined while preparing a reading guide. Additionally, Beth posts each individual weeks readings separately, not with one concise syllabus at the beginning. It would be understandable if the readings were very current, but they're often not, so waiting on the readings made me much less likely to complete them. Lastly, Beth clearly has a political and social view which makes discussion of many issues uncomfortable, especially when Beth injects herself into every thought.",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Beth is great - very warm and open but also intelligent and opinionated. She made people feel comfortable talking and expressing their ideas, but didn't shy away from challenging our assumptions or playing devil's advocate.",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Dr. Jones clearly cares about the topic and her students. She is opn to new ideas and challenges peoples' thoughts. She is flexible with deadlines and provides timely feedback. One suggestions would be to make student participation mandatory to facilitate better, more engagin discussions.",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Beth was a fantastic instructor who clearly cared about the students and the course. She was well organized and well prepared for all lectures - providing handouts and a short lecture at the beginning of each class.She gave timely and sufficient feedback on all assignments and was very responsive to all emails\/questions.She even provided baked goods, fruit, tea, and other snacks on presentation days.She made the classroom a comfortable learning environment - she was great at keeping discussions flowing and great at providing questions to consider when discussion slowed.",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Dr. Jones was excellent; clearly very knowledgeable and passionate about this topic. She planned the course very carefully and tried to make it as relevant as possible. She always listened to suggestions and made the class environment comfortable and dynamic."

   "comments": [
    "This course is disappointing discussion of racial and ethnic disparities in specific health outcomes. There is no focus on interventions or strategies. I would not recommend this course",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. There are so many health-related disparities out there, and it is easy to assume why they persist. But it is so important to provide empirical evidence to prove these assumptions so we can put our time and energy into efforts that will make a difference.",
    "I would recommend this course to students of all divisions with an interest in health disparities. One of the biggest strengths was the small class size, which allowed for an intimate classroom environment and good discussions. Great professor, interesting material, and a diverse set of assignments.Again, course strengths include: clear, organized lectures with slide handouts at beginning; all readings were relevant and useful to discussion; format of course was great - short lecture at beginning, followed by discussion of week's readings; diversity of assignments was very appreciated as well (short weekly assignments, discussion lead, book club assignment [REALLY appreciated this assignment], class presentation, and final paper); the classroom environment was very relaxed and participatory, allowing all student voices to be heard.",
    "Excellent overview of current issues in health disparities research; while no answer is provided, it is thought-provoking and allows you to look deeply into your own areas of interest via a final presentation and paper. The professor is very receptive to feedback and very knowledgeable about the topic. She's wonderful."
