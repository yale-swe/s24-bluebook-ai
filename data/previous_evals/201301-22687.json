    "Sure.",
    "yes i would recommend this class",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale. It's super low-key--you basically just get together and chat for a bit 3 days a week. Plus, the topics are all relevant issues to today as opposed to just literature.",
    "Conversational Spanish is a course focused on the art of conversation. While the professor will correct your grammar, it is certainly not the point of the class. The majority of the homework consists of readings, but you will have 5 short written assignments. The topics discussed in class are interesting and relevant. I would certainly recommend this course to another student who wants to improve their confidence and fluency in Spanish.",
    "I would summarize it as having a productive class environment which provides ample opportunity for self-directed growth in the language. I would recommend it to a student who is already fairly proficient in the language who would like to improve his\/her speaking capacity and fluency.",
    "I think it was great but I would love to see at least one day a week devoted to grammar cause its hard to keep your grammar so on key when you don't review.",
    "Interesting readings about controversial topics - good conversation. Fun movies. Take it."
