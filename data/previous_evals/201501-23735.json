    "I think that this course had a large, but perfectly appropriate amount of work. For those who did work week to week, and met with their groups in a timely and recurring manner, the work was never overwhelming. Also, the work was enjoyable. For our project specifically, since there were so many different pieces to it, you had a variety of different things to research and tasks to accomplish, so it was never repetitive or boring.",
    "This course required extensive work but it was an appropriate level given the subject matter and the structure of the course.",
    "I enjoy the time when I am taking this case. Everything about this class is in a good pace to me.",
    "The structure of little work at the start of the semester and a very large project at the end is unusual - at least in the theater management spring calendar. The variety makes for good balance, as long as the group is good about starting early and working consistently. If they do, there's enough time to do good work despite everyone's conflicting schedule.",
    "The assignments were very fun! The assignment was large, but manageable and a fun way to build relationships with my colleagues.",
    "No problem- we scheduled a lot of meetings and a lot was done in between times. As an artistic director, my load was lighter in terms of prep time.",
    "I really found this class to be manageable if you had a group of flexible and giving people. It would have been a nightmare if people hadn't taken the project seriously."

    "Loved the guest speakers. Was a great way to get us more information and perspectives and to break up the class.",
    "Materials were readily available and easy to access. I greatly appreciated the binders and the tool that helped us navigate the various union websites. I learned a great deal in finding the information on my own, but I did not feel thrown into the deep end and left to fend for myself! This course contributed a great deal to my professional knowledge and confidence.",
    "The course was well organized in terms of flow. I would, however, liked to have more guest speakers in the class. I enjoyed James Bundy, Ben Sammler, and Gordon coming in to speak to us. I think the class could have used even more guest speakers.",
    "The class is well organized over the course of the semester, which helps groups hit the ground running on their seasons. However, sometimes it is difficult to know what the summary or take-away is from an individual class. It might help if the goals of the day were announced at the top of each class as an introduction. This might help give a little more structure to the valuable experience the students absorb from the instructor and visitors.",
    "I had a great time in this class- Vicki is a terrific, energetic force and I really enjoyed working with my outstanding team.",
    "It was well organized. The build up of info to help with the project made a lot of sense. I wish we had had a planning work day in class to work with Vicki as we tried to wrap our head around all of the components so that she could have answered things as we talked through it. It wasn't crucial but a work session all together would have been helpful just to get the ball rolling."

    "Vicki is fierce. No further comments needed.",
    "Vicki and the TAs are all very busy, but were always available and accessible, which made me feel supported. I was initially overwhelmed by the work required but I soon realized how much was in place to help me succeed.",
    "It was honestly really inspiring to hear Vicki connect all the \"nuts and bolts\" of season programming and budgeting to real people, plays, and stories. I have a much greater understanding of what a Managing Director is, what she does, and how season programming works. I am just so glad that I was able to step out of discipline and take this course, and to get to know Vicki more before leaving this program.",
    "I love Vickis teaching style! She is so cool and so special! Shes always understand students and willing to communicate with us. I never feel pressure in her class. More important is that, Vicki is very professional and experienced. She taught us a lot of knowledges and skills that relate to the field directly. I believe the the things I learned from Vicki will greatly benefit to my career in future.",
    "Vicki's the queen. She knows her material back to front and was fantastic at presenting it in a way that all members of the class, not just theatre managers, could understand. I never had trouble following her, and always felt able to ask for clarification if required.",
    "I thought Vickie was a good instructor. At times, the conversation and dialogue of the class seemed a little all over the place, but all in all, we seemed to be heading in a good direction. We certainly covered a lot of material and I was exposed to many ideas and concepts that were new to me, which I appreciated.",
    "As above- Vicki was so constantly enthused and switched on she was an inspiration.",
    "Vicky's enthusiasm for the material was contagious.I learned a lot despite having little interest in the subject matter at the start of the class."

   "comments": [
    "Visitors were incredibly helpful in developing course.",
    "Loved the producing guest, as well as Long Wharf team.",
    "I felt we had very interesting visitors. I am always a fan of incorporating guests into the classroom to broaden our exposure to ideas.",
    "I enjoyed all the visitors. I found Gordon and Josh particularly interesting... and hilarious. I learned a lot just by seeing their personal dynamic, and hearing them discuss their personal struggles with the New Play world.",
    "All the Visitors are amazing!",
    "Although some were more interesting than others, all the visitors had valuable and focused contributions and were extremely generous with their time.",
    "The visitors, in my mind, were the highlight of the class. I really enjoyed James Bundy's take on the Rep, Ben Sammler really opened some students eyes in terms of production, and Gordon Edelstein is bat shit insane (but highly entertaining and passionate!). I think even more visiting speakers could benefit the project-- perhaps Jennifer Kiger talking about the Binger Center would be useful for a class period. Also, I think another managing director of a different scale theater would be useful (think Katie Liberman maybe?). It would be fantastic if another managing director could be brought in who runs a theater with a budget roughly the same as our class project budget. This way the class could ask real world questions about how you make an organization run on a smaller amount of money.",
    "The many visitors in this class are all highlights.",
    "I really enjoyed all of our visitors. They helped to keep the class enlivened and engaging. It also was a clear example of how many different talents it takes to run a theatre.",
    "Maybe a bigger range of organizational structures' representatives might have been exciting to witness."

    "This was probably my favorite class this semester. It was extremely useful but also fun. I acquired necessary practical knowledge and skills that will serve me at YSD\/YRT and beyond, and I did so while working closely with colleagues and current and future collaborators.",
    "I have gained a more comprehensive understanding of organizational structure, programming, budgets, and contracts. I feel that I can use this knowledge in my work in my personal field, and I also feel confident that I could take on tasks or leadership positions beyond my discipline with this course work as a foundation.",
    "I learned professional knowledge and skills about the field from this class. And those knowledge and skills will help me to establish my ability quickly.",
    "Of all the classes I've taken, the learning from this one feels most relevant for my future in the theatre.",
    "While familiar with many of the concepts presented in the class, I appreciated the depth at which I learned about them. I certainly understand a lot more about what it takes to put a season together. The process of working with a group of various individuals across departments was the most challenging part, but I learned a lot about myself and I learned a lot about the expectations I have for other people (some positive, some negative).",
    "I enjoyed the challenges of working within a model that I have never worked in- and I was enjoyably surprised at the ease with which the team formed a common language and set of goals. My learning was fortified and sped along by the relationships with my teammates, who helped me understand and get inspired by the parameters and challenges of the course.",
    "This was really an excellent learning experience for me. I enjoyed having the responsbility and taking a leadership role. I would gladly do the project again."

   "comments": [
    "I feel that the specific course outline could be better defined but I also enjoyed learning about how different groups functioned to accomplish a similar goal.",
    "As noted above, I think more guest speakers would improve the class. Additionally, I think we have a systemic problem with directors in the Drama School not understanding how to put a show together. I bring this up only because it negatively affected our group project work. While they as a collective group are strong in rehearsals and actually directing the play, the aspects of working with designers and production leaves a lot to be desired. This was no different in this class as it is for SRP's and thesis shows when the directors don't know how to discuss artistic ideas with designers and have no concept of how a production budget works. I believe having a little bit more information about production in this class would benefit them, as well as making them taking Ben Sammler's production planning class.",
    "Briefly introduce the artistic budget and then go over it in detail after the project planning has already started. It would be nice for the seasons to be sort of planned so that we could come in with our budgets already pre-populated with number of actors and then we could start thinking about all the details of how it would actually work rather than just looking a Rep example.",
    "Sometimes during the course I was not sure how to differentiate between Yale Rep practices and best industry practices, since almost no theaters outside of educational institutions can afford to sustain some of the principles and activities we discussed. I wish there had been more focus on the real world and less on the Rep."
