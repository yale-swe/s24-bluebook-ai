    "This course is straight up amazing. Inspirational. Transformative. Its strengths: it teaches concrete tools for analyzing and specifying the story of the play (plot, emotions, and world), it teaches you to connect to a play on personal levels you'd never think were possible, it helps you hone the ways in which you think about plays, and actually gets you to direct your own scenes and have them evaluated. No weaknesses, really - I just wish it could have been longer. And Toni Dorfman is an amazing teacher and a wonderful person - she has done all of this stuff herself in the professional world for a long time, and she knows how to teach it.",
    "An absolutely amazing course that if you are involved in theater in any way you MUST take. A lot of work when done right, but the work is incredibly rewarding in the end and you will be grateful you took this course.",
    "YES. Toni is a phenomenal human being, and I learned a tremendous amount about life and directing from her class. Take it if you care about theater, storytelling, and life in general.",
    "This is a fun class and a great opportunity to get some hands on experience with directing. Sometimes it was a bit frustratig because there wasn't a ton of feedback, but it was definitely worth while"
