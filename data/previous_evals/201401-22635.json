    "I will recommend it to other students!Our seminar is really helpful. It facilitates me with an understanding of early Chinese texts, new ways to conduct research (distant reading, for instance), presentation skills and writing skills. And I enjoy it more and more. Previously, I could say literally nothing in class. But I believe I am doing better and better.",
