    "110 CONTINUED but a little bit more fun and less stressful",
    "This class is very difficult. However, you really do learn the Chinese language and are able to become proficient in the language. If it is your first time taking Chinese, this class can be very overwhelming. Most people who take this class have taken Chinese before.",
    "Great course! Would highly recommend if you're willing to put in the time.",
    "Chinese 120 is a great class to take. I think however that there is a disparity in the level students come to the class in. Some students are very good at chinese from having past classes in it, and to me who has never taken chinese, I feel at a disadvantage. Sometimes people will be very good and that is discouraging to the rest of us who are learning everything for the first time. With that said, Chinese 120 is still an amazing class to take.",
    "A demanding course, very much like CHNS 110. However, the course is absolutely rewarding. It is a great class and the teachers are all wonderful.",
    "This Chinese 120 course is a great one if you are trying to create a solid foundation of the language. I am definitely going to continue after taking this course",
    "Chinese is one of the most difficult course at Yale. Most of the students who take Chinese have some sort of background (eg. they have taken in the previous school, one of their parents speak Chinese etc). For those who have no background, this could be really tough. You meet every day, and start your class with a quiz. But, you have a great opportunity to go to Beijing in the summer as a Light Fellow.",
    "CHNS 120 is essentially just as good as 110. The professors are the same, the textbook series is the same, etc. If you liked 110, you'll like 120! I loved both!",
    "If you've already taken CHNS 110, keep going! Definitely worth the work."
