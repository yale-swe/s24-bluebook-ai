    "I'd recommend this to graduate students interested in philosophy of language, mind or epistemology. I would only recommend it to exceptionally advanced undergraduates due to the challenging nature of the content.NB in my answers to question 4 below, I have selected appropriate because I think the work load, pace and difficulty level were all appropriate. But they were also in a sense (respectively) light, slow and hard (compared to other classes). Nevertheless, I thought that they were not *too* light, slow, or hard, and that these things were justified and profitable, as indicated in previous answers."
