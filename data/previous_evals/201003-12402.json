    "If you want to continue Japanese at Yale, you don't really have a choice!It's a fun class, though maybe not as fun as the previous years.",
    "At first, I felt like my Japanese level was stagnant throughout the class because I wasn't ingraining the daily kanji and my speaking skills were sliding. But in the midst of taking the final, I realized how much I had actually improved my reading and writing. It's not as structured as the lower level classes, so you may feel like you're not gaining anything, but the improvements you make in Advanced Japanese are more subtle. That being said, I think it's also helpful if you do more than what's required in class - following up on new vocabulary you run across while doing the readings, using the new grammar in your essays, reviewing kanji, etc.",
    "Take it! It was a great way to continue my Japanese studies after a summer in Japan. Your speaking skills won't improve a lot (probably because you just spent an entire summer in Japan and spoke on a daily basis), but your listening and reading will be noticeably better. Class was never a chore to go to, but the workload was not light (but more manageable than lower levels, so I've heard).",
    "JAPN 150 is a very rigorous course in the first \"phase\" of advanced Japanese. You should know, however, that the course load is very manageable. Kanji quizzes are taken every class, and memorizing ten to fifteen characters a quiz will become routine by about the third class, so don't worry too much about this. There are only three tests throughout the year, with the third \"test\" counting as the final (it is definitely longer, but almost identical in construction to the other two tests). There are many opportunities to do well in this class, such that achieving a bad grade will take effort...seriously. Just make sure you cover the class material as often as possible, and start studying for tests early! Overall, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "There are many practical reasons to taking Japanese 150; however, since I am sure you are aware of them already (major requirements and the like), I will go withthe more fun ones:1. Well, it is fun. Much lighter workload than beginning levels, and meets only three times a week for the same amount of credit (1.5). That said, there is also very heavy focus on reading and writing, so you may find it more challenging in that respect than previous classes.2. You won't forget the Japanese you learned last year\/over the summer in Japan, and will possibly have a better chance of applying for the Light Fellowship (again, in some cases).",
    "Great third-year course that is enjoyable most of the time, unless the class size gets too large.",
    "Really great class that I would definitely recommend for anyone taking Japanese as a serious course. Reading and kanji can be hard, but it was worth it for me.",
    "Japanese 150 is the third year of Japanese language instruction at Yale. Like the beginning and intermediate Japanese courses, this course involves a lot of homework and outside work, but all the work greatly helps you improve in the language. Grammar isn't formallly taught anymore, and reading and watching various Japanesetexts and videos are the primary focus. There are daily quizzes, but since the class meets three days a week instead of every day, it is pretty manageable. This is a great class if you want to continue improving your Japanese."
