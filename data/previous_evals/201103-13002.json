    "Great class... there really isn't much 'busy work'; all of the work usually has a purpose and is great practice. The only warning is that the class can be very 'back heavy' as you have to prepare your visual and oral presentations at the end of the semester (which can be draining if you have other end of semester commitments). Besides that, awesome...",
    "It's spanish 4. If you've taken another level class, then you can expect roughly the same. However, the difference between L3 and L4 is bigger than the difference between L2 and L3.",
    "I took this class to fulfill my language requirement, and got a lot out of it. My Spanish improved, and class was just fun every day. I heartily recommend it, especially with Cividanes.",
    "Great course \u0097 I think it is a natural culmination of previous spanish courses. In this class, you will read a novel, which is extremely helpful in terms of improving spanish comprehension. It is also very fair, probably even more relaxed than previous levels, and extremely well taught. The exams and quizzes are all very fair. Class is also very fun and enjoyable!",
    "Shmeh. It's Spanish. Take it if you need it or if you want to learn the language. It's in no way mind blowing.",
    "This class is great for strengthening your speaking and listening skills. Prof. Cividanes is incredibly easy to understand, and she really emphasizes conversation in pairs or groups - she constantly changes the people you're talking with so you can actually use your Spanish to practice real conversation. She would usually correct speaking mistakes immediately, but her corrections were always be encouraging and never demeaning. By the time you get to reading the novella at the end of the semester, you'll probably be pretty impressed by the fluency with which you're able to read it. This class is wonderful even with a really busy schedule - the homework was usually very simple and straightforward, and it was easily my favorite class this semester. Take it!",
    "Take this class with Professor Cividanes. She is the best.",
    "All I can say is: Ame Cividanes is an angel. One of her reviews last year said, \"Her teaching is as good as her fashion, and her style is impeccable.\" It's definitely true. She's helpful, funny, intelligent, interesting, and overall a wonderful teacher. She also doesn't get mad when you make mistakes in speaking, and is very flexible about deadlines and things like that. She's the DUS for the department, so you know she prepares you well for tests. I wish I could have taken all of my Spanish classes with Ame. Definitely if you have to take L4, do it with her.L4 itself isn't bad at all. Pretty much like L3, except you do a partnered 5 minute oral presentation about art, and a partnered 15 minute oral presentation about some historical\/literary topic. You also watch a movie and read a novel. Pretty enjoyable.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROF. CIVIDANES! She is, beyond a doubt, an excellent Spanish professor and she will ensure that you are prepared for exams\/presentations and that you will grow as a Spanish speaker.",
    "It is a lot like L3. You just work on more tenses. I liked it more than L3.",
    "Further advancement in Spanish mastery"
