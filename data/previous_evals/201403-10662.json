   "comments": [
    "Astronomy 500 is a required course, so I don't think my suggestions to take the course would be very useful. I would say that, in the current structure of the course, I would hope that incoming students know at least a little bit beforehand on each of the topics covered. The work is not overwhelming, but I'm afraid the course is on the verge of being spread too thin in terms of time to cover all the material sufficiently. That being said, I wouldn't have serious warnings for any student who is planning to take this course.",
    "The course offers a general overview over many topics in theoretical astrophysics. However, it only touches the surface of each topic discussed. Thus, I recommend the course to students who are willing to spend additional time on each topic.",
    "This was a good class for a brief survey \/ overview of the physics knowledge needed for astronomy. I would recommend it as these are important techniques to know for the future.",
    "ASTR 500 is a good review of material that you have likely already learned, I'd recommend it for anyone that feels even the least bit shaky about their ability to remember physics from a few years back.",
    "It is a course where you race through practically every application of physics in astronomy subfields, primarily in order to expose you to them. The workload is reasonable and Priya is a fair grader and cares about your understanding. It can be easy to get lost in lecture sometime because it moves pretty fast, but if you take careful notes you should be fine. Priya will tell you what will and won't be on the test, so just be sure to study.",
    "Astro 500 filled in a few gaps I was missing from undergrad and was very useful for me going forward. I think it's very important that we continue to offer a class like this.",
    "This is a great course for getting students up to speed with the math methods they will need for grad school. It's necessarily difficult to find the appropriate level for a course like this, because students come from such a variety of math and physics backgrounds, but Priya handled it very well. The only time I felt a little lost was in the last few weeks when we flew through tensors and GR in an effort to get to cosmology before the end of the course, but it was still good to get a taste of it -- enough to make me want to take Priya's cosmology course next term!",
    "Yes it brings you up to date, and is a good revision class for those who have done them already."

   "comments": [
    "To be perfectly honest I did not learn very much from this course. This is mostly due to having seen the topics covered here elsewhere and at a slower, more comprehensive pace. It was at times a decent review, especially for fluid dynamics, and the course is certainly interesting.",
    "This course will be very helpful for my future profession. The information presented in class is vital to almost every branch of astronomy.",
    "It considerably increasing the breadth of my astronomical knowledge, and I at least feel like I have some slight background in a variety of fields I previously knew nothing about. As a first year, I'm unsure how it'll eventually affect my research.",
    "This was definitely a useful course, and I think it will serve me well going forward.",
    "I cannot tell yet."
