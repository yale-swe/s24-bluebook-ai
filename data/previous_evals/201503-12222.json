    "Yes, if you're interested in exploring collective memory.",
    "An interesting review of memory studies. Was very heavily focused on theory which made things a little dry at times.",
    "I'd recommend this class if you like theoretical history.",
    "Absolutely. TAKE THIS SEMINAR. This is one the best (and hardest) classes I've taken at Yale. Overall, this course was fantastic. The course introduces you to the study of historical memory via several theoretical frameworks. Adding the lens of memory, history seems much more dynamic and ever changing. Professor Allen is brilliant. She leads great discussions and will give you incredibly detailed feedback on everything you submit. That said don't expect to get an A. Your writing would have to be completely flawless.",
    "The readings were great but very long, discussion brought up interesting points, and the exploration of modern French and German history was insightful. Content could end up feeling nebulous, and can be hard to pin down at the end what you learned.",
    "Yes, take this class. Historical memory is incredibly interesting and important to the study of history. The class is divided up in a thoughtful way where for the first part you learn about the theory of historical memory and the second is then composed of applying those skills to specific events in history. Allen leads great and thoughtful discussions and really helps improve your writing throughout the semester."
