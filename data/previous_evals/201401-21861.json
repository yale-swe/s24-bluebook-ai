    "Don't let ARBC140 stop you learning Arabic. It's not a super exciting course, but you do learn a lot of vocabulary and your reading will improve a lot. Plus some of the grammar is kind of cool. The drawback is that there isn't a whole lot of speaking. Professor Aziz is a good teacher, but he doesn't stick to speaking Arabic in class all the time, which I didn't like (although some people might find that good). It won't blow your mind, but it's a fine class.",
    "Lots of vocab from Al Kitaab. Weekly quizzes, but it's manageable.",
    "i would definitely recommend taking the class if the student wants to continue learning Arabic. It is, however, a lot of work, with homework every day and quizzes and tests every week, so the student should be prepared to spend at least an hour a day, possibly more.",
    "I recommend the Arabic language program and this level and professor of it as well. One will make the most of this course if one has two hours, at least, per day to commit to course preparation. I will note that this is rather a challenging requirement (if not sometimes impossible) for a graduate student in her last semester of a terminal Master\u2019s program."
