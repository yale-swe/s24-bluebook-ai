   "comments": [
    "Weakness: another typical undergraduate course. Unnecessary in a graduate program.",
    "I feel like it covered the same things that I learned in undergraduate classical mechanics. Perhaps I should have passed out of the course, but were I to take it again, I would have preferred more difficult topics to be discussed.",
    "This course was very well-structured and mostly clear. I wish that there was more of a connection made between some of the later topics (like Hamiltonian dynamics and canonical transformations) and why they would be useful for any real physics problems; that weight was very much lacking. There were also times that we spent a lot of time on a topic that seemed outside of the scope of the class, though, and I wish that we had talked about these topics less and talked more about later topics that were barely covered (completely integrable systems and chaotic motion in particular).",
    "Out of all the courses I have taken at Yale, this is by far the one most connected with my professional work. Though I did not particularly enjoy the heavily theoretical basis for each class, I now have a much better appreciation for how these tools were developed and the important work of the theoretical physicists.",
    "The material at the end of the course (i.e. the Hamiltonian formulation, canonical transformations, Hamilton's principle function, etc.) is a little rushed, and I didn't fully understand it.",
    "The course is well designed. Would be better to have a better context\/outlook about Jacobi theory.",
    "I wish we had more discussed on chaotic system."
