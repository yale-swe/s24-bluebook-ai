    "I learned how to use research techniques in basic science to solve biological questions.",
    "I learned so many lab skills, how to communicate through presentations, etc.",
    "Taking this course was one of the best decisions I made at Yale. Ioved my entire experience and the people I worked with. I learned so many more basic science techniques and most importantly how to critically think as a scientist would. It made me read a lot of papers and taught me the diligence, patience, and grit needed to succeed in science. In addition, making me present my work at a poster session and oral talk was extremely helpful for developing my science communication skills. Finally, writing my research journal made me learn how to wrote like a scientist. I am very grateful for the fruitful intellectual experience I had.",
    "I learned much from my year in the Blumenfeld lab in conducting original research and writing up reports of my findings."

   "comments": [
    "This \"course\" is very dependent on your relationship with your PI and your ability to stay on task. I enjoyed my research, but I was also almost entirely independent because I had worked in the lab for three years already. I really appreciated the break-down of the class. It was useful to have to learn how to write a grant proposal, a research paper, a poster, and a presentation.",
    "This question is hard to answer because it all depends on the laboratory a student chooses. I was happy to be in good hands and work with a fantastic group and wonderful mentor.",
    "The strengths of this course are obvious; long time in the lab allows you to work more on research and develop your research skills rather than take another class. The weaknesses are the assignments.",
    "I feel like we didn't have enough contact with the other students or the research coordinators in the course. It would have been nice to have more meetings to discuss the research and our own progress.",
    "The structure of the 495\/496 was helpful, as it gave us the opportunity to experience different aspects of the scientific process (proposal and grant writing, the poster presentation, etc.).",
    "I think the course is run very well."

   "comments": [
    "I feel like my recommendation matters little in the decision to take this course. If you are willing to put in the time, it's really rewarding and you will accomplish far more in research than you would in the lower level courses. Not to mention it's 2 credits so you can take fewer courses senior year. However, it is a LOT of work and you have to be willing to put in what you want to get out of it.",
    "Intensive is a LOT of time (and for me, was often more than the 20 hours per week), but your project is more likely to be substantial and publication-worthy if you devote more time to it. If you have the time, I'd recommend going this route above the 10-hour 485 model, which I did in the fall.",
    "Really depends on the lab, but I had a great experience. Would recommend over 485. 2 credits is great, and you get substantially more work done",
    "Taking this course was one of the best decisions I made at Yale. Ioved my entire experience and the people I worked with.

    "I would recommend this course if you have already covered all the required courses of your major by junior year. It allows you to focus on your research and spend your semester worrying less about homework and more about attending lab and getting results.",
    "Yes, this is a great course to get experience in conducting actual research.",
    "Please take this as your research course! Spending 20hrs\/week in the lab your senior year is definitely work the effort!"
