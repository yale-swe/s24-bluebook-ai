    "I was able to learn more about the underlying concepts that make for successful and, unfortunately, unsuccessful animal welfare\/rights legal claims. I was also able to delve into the theoretical notions of animal law, which are essential for anyone interested in pursuing a career in this field.",
    "This was a tremendous course. I learned more than I knew before about the existing framework of animal protection laws and policies, about the challenges of \"standing\" and \"legal rights\" for animals, about the historical and philosophical treatment of animals, about how animals are considered in the law by judges\/ lawyers\/ politicians\/ campaigners\/ activists etc. and in the field thanks to many illuminating anecdotes by Professor Lovvorn. In addition to gaining knowledge, I also gained inspiration from this class. The combination of Doug's unusual thoughtfulness and Jon's practical work and experience made for a truly moving educational experience. It was my favorite class at Yale.",
    "I learned about some of the ethical quandaries that are inherent to the management of animals and the natural world. The class has already had an impact on how I frame scientific research questions.",
    "Learn to read and review law cases"

    "My expectations were completely fulfilled throughout the course. I was able to learn more about the theory underlying animal law, the challenges with animal welfare\/rights legal claims, and real-life examples of their application.",
    "This class far exceeded my expectations. Bravo to Doug and Jon. I hope they continue to co- teach courses. I would love to be their student again.",

   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The major strength of this course was the heavy focus on student participation. Through this participation, the class was able to really expand on ideas discussed in class. It was also really great to be able to discuss real examples and their application through our guest speakers.",
    "Doug and Jon are an extraordinary teaching team. I thought the fact that this course covered, by necessity, far more than just \"law\" was a tremendous strength. It bridged the intersection of law, animal intelligence science, literature (including the brilliant final class with the discussion of JM Coetzee's The Lives of Animals), and more. I think it successfully brought up new questions and helped advance everyone's thinking about what it means to be a good human animal. The guest speakers were excellent. The small group student dinners with the guest speakers also helped build a sense of community among students that I think made the whole experience even more rewarding. On a few occasions, I think the cases reading load was too heavy and could be streamlined without losing much educational value. I would also have liked to have learned more about how other countries beyond the U.S. consider animals in law.",
    "I thought that the most interesting discussions we had involved the professors outlining the topic and the cases we read for that topic, and then opening the issue up for general discussion. There were a couple of classes - particularly at the beginning of the semester - that were almost all lecture and therefore less engaging."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "My advice to prospective students is that this class is essential for broadening the way a person views environmental issues. It pushes students to think about topics that most would rather ignore. However, we need to pursue these ideas and topics in order to gain a broader knowledge base for environmental problem solving and taking this class will help with that.",
    "Doug and Jon are an extraordinary teaching team. I recommend this course with great enthusiasm. The course was tremendous. The combination of Doug's unusual thoughtfulness, Jon's practical experience and insights, and the topic of animals and the law -- a topic that quickly reaches the deepest questions of what it means to be a good human -- made for a truly enriching and inspiring educational experience. It was my favorite class at Yale. Bravo to Doug and Jon."
