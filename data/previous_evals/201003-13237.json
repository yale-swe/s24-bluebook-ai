    "I would absolutely, without reservation recommend this course to another atudent. You seriously don't have to know anything about the structure of poetry or even have an initial interest in African American poetry in particular. Professor Stepto is your golden ticket to an amazing semester. The workload is more than doable, and the projects and papers you take on in the class are all completely self-developed--you take this class and get out of it exactly what you want to; but trust me, you walk away with so much more than that with which you came into the class.",
    "This is just a happy class. I loved it. The reading load is very light for an upper-level seminar. You write two 12-15 page papers, and they're both very open-ended. Professor Stepto is WONDERFUL -- his teaching style is very relaxed, and it's really cool to hear about all the experiences he has had with the authors on the syllabus. He's an expert, and you shouldn't miss the chance to take a class with him. I would have liked a little more of a reflection on how the poets of this course related to the larger movement of Modernism, but overall, I'm extremely happy with it. Take it!! You'll encounter so many amazing poems and poets, some of which you are familiar with, some new.",
    "Definitely!",
    "At the end of this course, though I am not particularly knowledgeable in the subject, I have acquired a very strong familiarity with and appreciation of the material. Though I did not take any English courses prior to this one, I felt that Professor Stepto made the material and ideas very accessible. Also, the professor's extensive knowledge and experience made this class really special and worthwhile.",
    "Sure! It's a fine class with a good reputation.",
    "Yes! Relaxing introduction into African American poetry. Prof. Stepto does a great job of contextualizing and bringing to life the material. The class itself is enriching... Only issue is the two 12-15 page papers throughout the semester. Rather long, but doable. Overall very much worth the effort.Take it!",
    "Take it!"
