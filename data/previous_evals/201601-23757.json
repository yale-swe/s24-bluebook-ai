    "This course is a must-take for anyone looking to explore the Bible in a non-religious way. It helped me to think differently and take a critical lens to a text I had always accepted. Looking at the Bible through an ethnographic filter is no easy task, but Professor Martin is an incredible guide. One of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "The Bible as Ethnography is a course I would recommend to someone interested in trying their hand at ethnography. It is a challenging course that is relatively time intensive, not because of volume, but because the mode of thinking can be difficult to adopt at first. I'm not sure if it is a class that everyone would like because of this, and because the focus is so intently on one document for much of the course, but I loved it.",
    "Would not recommend. Better ethnography classes to take. Better history classes to take. Better theology classes to take. Find what specific angle you want and focus on that.",
    "Probably would not recommend as is. It really is so different from other Yale classes that I can see it getting frustrating rather than refreshing. V slow paced, lot of redundancy, v hard to connect back to cultural relevancy. Could maybe see it becoming more streamlined and perhaps having a thesis of the class or something that can contextualize everything and help aid classroom discussion.",
    "A course about what the Bible can tell us about the culture of Ancient Israelites, as well as how different modern interpretations of the Bible affect ongoing discussions around various issues."
