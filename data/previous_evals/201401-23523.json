   "comments": [
    "If you are at all interested in either the history of Britain or the United States, take this course. Professor Pincus is a stellar historian who has developed a unique and fascinating thesis about the development of the British Empire. Know that the class is essentially Pincus making his case, but don't let that deter you\u2014it's a ride well worth taking.",
    "Yes.",
    "HIST 238 is a great course that provides a very interesting and intriguing argument for the rise of the British Empire. Professor Pincus is very knowledgeable and has very informative lectures. But, be prepared because he speeds through lectures a lot and provides some irrelevant details. The assignments (one paper and two exams) are very doable; section just counts for a slightly ridiculous amount (30%) of your grade. Also, the reading load is quite heavy for a lecture but it provides good context for the lectures. If you're really interested in British imperial history or colonial history of America and India, this is a great course and I'd highly suggest you take it. Just be ready for the large amount of information and get a great TF and everything will be fine.",
    "This class is about the growth of the British Empire ranging from post-Elizabethan England (late 16th century) to the American revolution. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about England, the empire, and hear some interesting views and learn about new evidence that might just prove your high school textbooks wrong.",
    "Take it.",
    "If the subject matter is interesting to you, and you are not searching for a gut, take this course.",
    "I would definitely suggest this to any history major as a preindustrial credit. It is very interesting and helps in putting modern history into perspective. It does have a heavy reading load but besides that is not an overwhelming course.",
    "Yes if your are interested in the subject but sometimes there are a lot of readings for one week.",
    "Hist 238 is an incredibly engaging lecture that lays out a controversial but compelling narrative of the time period. It is a must take for students interested in British or American history. If you take the course, make sure to stop by Prof. Pincus' office hours; he's brilliant!",
    "Take it if you're interested in the rise of the British Empire",
    "Definitely would recommend"
