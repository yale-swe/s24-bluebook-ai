    "This class makes you work for the 1.5 credits, but Xu Laoshi is wonderful and makes it so enjoyable. You still have to put in the work though.",
    "This is a very straightforward class. Your Chinese will improve in reading and vocab. The grading is also fairly easy to navigate.",
    "A pretty good class for heritage learners. The class is fairly fast-paced, and that, combined with our somewhat larger class size, meant that it was a bit difficult to get speaking practice in class, and sometimes it was easy to drift off in class. However, I felt like I did learn a lot of grammar and new vocab, and my Chinese has definitely improved. Xu Laoshi is also super nice and amazing.",
    "Do it!! Xu Laoshi is the best. If you got placed into this level and have taken Chinese school in the past, definitely try it through Shopping Period; despite the frenetic pace of the very beginning, if you find like I did that as a result of early schooling, Pinyin comes more or less naturally and characters are relatively easy to remember because of long-ago learned stroke order, this is the right level for you. Daily quizzes mandate that you stay on top from a day-to-day basis which can be at times inconvenient, but there is a huge payoff to be had, and it can be fun! At the end of this semester my parents have marveled at how much my speaking has improved.",
    "Yes. As someone who never went to Chinese school, it was challenging, but ultimately doable if you don't have too many other difficult classes in your schedule. I would probably limit the number to 1, at most 2.",
    "Just do the homework and study hard for the tests and you'll be fine. Consistency and staying on top of things is the key.",
    "Great for anyone who knows some Chinese but wants formal training",
    "If you're feeling intimidated by keeping up in a Chinese class, don't be. You start out at a very, very basic reading and writing level designed to warm you up for the first few weeks, and don't start learning more difficult vocab and grammar until about halfway through the semester. Xu Laoshi is also a wonderful teacher.",
    "Depends. How much of your happiness are you willing to grind away to learn a language? This is a very good class in that it's possible to go from being at kindergarten level to reading the paper in two semesters (152+153), but it's also a very, very work-heavy and tedious class. Take it if you've got a strong foundation in oral and\/or written Chinese and a good memory. There are daily quizzes and about an hour and a half of work per day; this is not a class with weekly work that can be crammed into one or two days. You will need to do Chinese every night, no matter how much else you have going on, and it is hard to catch up if you fall behind. The professor is understanding, and the teaching is fine (neither incompetent nor great) but the teaching is pretty much irrelevant; this depends entirely on the effort you put in.",
    "It's a great class that will most certainly improve your chinese skills. Be prepared to work and you won't regret taking this class.",
    "Weekly homework, daily quizzes, unit tests, and a final. Lots of work but you do learn a lot.",
    "This class is a good way to review Chinese for native speakers, but don't expect a dramatic improvement in your ability to communicate with your relatives. It's a good opportunity to review Chinese characters and vocab that you might hear on the news though."
