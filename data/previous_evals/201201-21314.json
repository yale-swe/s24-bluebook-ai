   "comments": [
    "Yes, it's a great course to learn about abrupt climate change and its impact on societal collapse. The course provides a comprehensive overview of the development of the field and then delves into case studies of collapse with student presentations. Professor Weiss is fantastic and will really bring the class to life. Sometimes the reading is a bit heavy, but overall, the workload is manageable.",
    "Prof. Weiss is a true expert in his field. It was an extremely amazing and intellectually stimulating experience being in a research and discussion seminar with him.The class overall has a substantial workload which is though really interesting. Definitely take this class or consider taking it before you graduate.",
    "This class is great for people who are not typically interested in humanities courses and want something that is different from other classes at Yale. The class is flexible in that you can explore what you are interested in for the final topic and presentation, which is a significant portion of the course.",
    "Take this seminar!"
