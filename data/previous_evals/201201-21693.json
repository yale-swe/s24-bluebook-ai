    "a good course. i would recommend it",
    "Survey of Buddhist Art, you should take it if you are interested in Buddhist Art. Since I am, I thought it was very good.",
    "Just an all-around great class. Seriously, you get a lot out of this class, regardless of your major. We had a great mix of majors: art history, art, religious studies, architecture, and a few premeds too. The professor (we all call her by her first name) is wonderful and very understanding. She knows the subject inside and out. Take the class if you want a more intimate intro art history lecture. You don't need to do all the reading, which isn't that bad too begin with. The midterm and final are both very laidback. The term paper needs to be around 12 pages, but you can write it on basically anything.",
    "A relatively small lecture class with short readings and memorization.",
    "Good basic knowledge and intro course to a more specialized topic within art history.",
    "Yes, take it! If you have any interest in Buddhism or East Asia or just want a different art historical perspective from the Western-oriented majority of classes offered at the University level, this class is fantastic. The lectures are entertaining, the workload is very reasonable, and it is a lot of fun learning about the different art forms and Buddhist ideologies. My favorite was probably the Zen section, though esoteric Buddhism is also fascinating.",
    "Wonderful course. the lectures were packed with beautiful images of Buddhist art and architectures from across the world, best of all taken in person by Professor Mimi herself. the 12 page paper was a pleasure to write on any topic and the exams were straight forward and fair."
