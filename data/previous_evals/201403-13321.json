   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend it. Covers what you'd expect it to, Prof. Trivellato is a good lecturer, and it's not too much work. The one paper we had to do was interesting because it involved data from the Catasto (Florentine tax records), and we could chose what we wanted to explore subject-wise. Other than that, there's a midterm and final that are pretty straightforward.",
    "Take it. It's a different class than you're used to at Yale (especially if you're not a history major). Professor Trivellato is a great lecturer and you learn a lot about a famous period of time. It includes all of the big topics - literature, politics, art, family dynamics, etc. Worth it for sure.",
    "A class that focuses mainly on the political and social history of the Italian Renaissance--the 13th-16th centuries. Not what one would typically think of when one thinks of the Renaissance (before this class, I would have said the 16th-17th c.). Professor Trivellato is a really interesting professor, though, and the class taught me so much about the many changes in Italy during this time period. Really interesting readings that I feel have made me a more educated citizen and that I will actually remember.",
    "This class is an absolutely fantastic lecture. Professor Trivellato is a great professor! I hope to take a seminar with her soon and would recommend her for any class. Take this lecture if you are able. She also assigns a very reasonable amount of readings that really add to the class.",
    "This is a good class that provides a different approach to studying the Renaissance than you probably have ever encountered. But only take it if you are interested in the topic, or else doing the readings and the paper will probably be miserable for you. There is a midterm, final, 6-8 page paper, and section participation, each worth 25% of the grade. It's a well organized class with a really interesting selection of primary sources. The reading is usually pretty manageable. A solid class overall.",
    "It is a great overview of the period and you learn a lot that you never expected to learn in this kind of class. It does not focus on the things you think a renaissance class to focus on but overall it is very interesting and not too hard. You should take this class for a nice, interesting, history class.",
    "I would summarize HIST 223 as boring, abysmal, and horribly taught. I would not recommend it to anyone lest they have an excess of energy or enthusiasm for the topic that they seek to reduce markedly. This class took the word bad, to new heights and in my four years at Yale, Im not sure Ive ever had a worse time. In true Freshman introduction style, the entire course is tightly regulated. If youre someone who gets a kick out of parroting back the ideas that someone repeats literally hundreds of times, then this is the class for you. If, however, you wanted to learn about things in a more self-oriented way, or express creativity in your assignments, think again. All attempts at ingenuity will most assuredly be punished. The TF (though Im hopeful, for future generations, that shell never teach this class again) was nightmarishly bad. Section was both exceedingly boring and highly irrelevant. All in all, I would call this a failed attempt at a Yale College course and would recommend it only to people I really hated in the hopes that it would ruin a semester of their lives as well as it did mine. No stars.",
    "Take this class. Not a terrible breakdown.",
    "Yes! It's a great class.",
    "Hist 223 is a very interesting course which is not difficult. The reading is lighter than in most history courses and there is only one 6-8 pg essay."
