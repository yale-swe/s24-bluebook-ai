   "comments": [
    "This course is an excellent primer on the application ofmodern genomic methods for ecology and evolutionary biology for those who are not well versed in the current methods. A variety of topics were discussed, all of which were interesting to beginning students who are trying to determine a research topic for their dissertation project.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in getting a sense for what research is being discussed and explored in evolutionary genomics. The almost completely student-led format might not be for everyone, but it definitely has its advantages (exposure to other levels, diversity of experience, the challenges and experience of preparing a presentation, etc.). It is definitely a class worth looking at and Professors Moran and Ochman are really great.",
    "Although it was a very interested and thought-provoking class, this isn't the typical course, even for graduate students. It is certainly geared towards those with a background in evolutionary biology, but Professors Ochman and Moran are very understanding to students new to the field. Homework consists of weekly readings of journal articles and discussions in class, and everyone has to give a presentation with a partner.",
    "It is a good primer to start thinking about genomic methods through reading papers that used these methods. I would recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "A journal club for genomics papers through the lens of evolutionary biology. Great survey and discussion course"

   "comments": [
    "Being a beginning graduate student, I learned a great deal about other fields of inquiry within the greater field of ecology and evolutionary biology. This opened my mind to the great variety of questions being asked at various different levels of biological organization and in different organisms.The methods that were discussed in the course helped broaden my knowledge on what methods I could use in addressing questions I am particularly interested in addressing with my dissertation research. I was able to see which methods were more appropriate\/effective in answering different questions.",
    "It definitely opened my eyes to the world of genetic sequencing, and helped me realize what issues need to be considered in genomics.",
    "This course was interesting in terms of becoming familiar with genomic methods and how the can be applied to answer evolutionary questions. I'm not sure it will be directly applicable to my dissertation, but it was still very helpful."
