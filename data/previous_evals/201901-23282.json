    "How to think holistically about environmental issues, and question the ability of technocratic solutions to solve environmental problems",
    "We talked a lot about power, types and sources of knowledge, justice, problem conceptions, and academic approaches and frameworks.",
    "I learned how different disciplines approach environmental management. I loved the guest speakers, especially Coen and Sabin.",
    "This class provided insights as to what managers should consider when talking to various groups of people. These insights go beyond discussion of people's political affiliations or religion, into topics like scientific knowledge versus indigenous ecological knowledge, anthropology, and values. This class also discussed how management can be interpreted differently based on different value systems. I was introduced to a lot of different topics that I had not previously thought of for managers."

   "comments": [
    "The discussion sections of this course are truly excellent--most of the lectures were also very compelling and fed well into the discussions. It was nice to have lots of guest speakers, but it also would have been nice to have a few more explicitly integrative lectures by Ben and Amity regarding what we've learned and how to unify it.",
    "Strengths: I liked the lecture\/discussion format of the course, and the required reading journals. Weaknesses: Although the number of viewpoints that were brought in were very diverse, others that could be included: sociology, psychology",
    "I really appreciated the structure of the course with guest lectures on Monday and class discussion on Wednesday. It would've been interesting if the lecturers could join on Wednesday, too, but I imagine most wouldn't have time. I appreciated also that our instructors gathered mid-semester feedback and made some changes related to who was leading discussions in class.",
    "The strengths of the course are the guest speakers and the discussion session. I really felt like I was able to speak my mind freely during the discussion section.",
    "The amount of reading involved each week was pretty hefty, but that seems to be the norm with social science courses. The majority of reading topics were also interesting. I felt like the style of reading journals that the professors chose did not really help me to better understand or absorb the reading material. But after the midterm evaluations, the professor was receptive to students' inputs, and gave students the opportunity to choose a different reading journal style if they preferred. I enjoyed the various topics and speakers that were brought into the course, but I wish some had spoken a little slower, and I'm not sure if we had access to all of their powerpoint slides after the lectures took place. Class discussions were really good though. The professors also offered a lot of help and feedback to students when it came to picking topics and fleshing out ideas for our final paper."

   "comments": [
    "Take this class even if you don't think you're going to be working in the social sciences--it provides a great window through which to look at problems you may not have even known existed.",
    "Lots of grappling with abstract ideas and time given to develop\/articulate your viewpoints",
    "Come with questions based on our reading for the guest lecture on Monday since that will be your only chance to ask them during class time.",
    "Try to be open to new ways of thinking",
    "The readings may take a long time, so it may be advisable not to take this class with another that also has a heavy reading load. And if you have any uncertainties about the reading material, or about anything that the lecturers' had said, ask questions. Even if you don't feel comfortable asking them in class, the Dr. Doolittle is very approachable."
