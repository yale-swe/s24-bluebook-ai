    "Survey course of Catholic tradition in the past 2000 years. Although it's broad, it is integral to understanding Western culture, especially if you didn't take DS. You get the opportunity to hear many brilliant lecturers and you will hopefully walk away inspired to continue to read about the Catholic tradition.",
    "Take this class if you are really interested in the history of Christianity.",
    "Lectures twice a week, with five guest lecturers spread throughout the semesters. These were some of the best lectures I've ever attended (both the guest ones and the ones led by the course instructors). HIGHLY RECOMMENDED whether or not you are Catholic\/religious, since the Church has affected the world in history, culture, art, etc. TAKE IT!!!",
    "It sounds like they're going to start offering this every other year since there was a sharp drop-off in the number of students in the class, and hopefully they find a less popular time slot, because way more students should be taking this class. If you're Catholic or not, this course serves as a great overview of of one of the most important and formative intellectual traditions in Western civilization. Lectures and themes can be disjointed at times, but it all ties back together at the end. As for structure, it's very similar to a DS course, which means an abundance of assessments (midterm, final, three papers) but hey come at you steadily, so there's never an overly intense week or two as far as this course goes.",
    "This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. It perfectly encapsulates what it means to study intellectual history. The reading was reasonable, the instructors and guest lecturers were phenomenal, and it was clear every week precisely how much thought the three professors had put into perfectly tailoring the material. The only thing I regret is that it isn't two semesters long, it is such a shame to have to move so quickly through such dense material."
