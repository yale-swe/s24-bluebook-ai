   "comments": [
    "This course provided a strong foundation of knowledge about the history of anti-slavery, abolition, and emancipation in the Atlantic world. It provided an equally strong base in the major debates of the historiographies that have explored and expanded our knowledge in this field. The course interrogated the historical methods and practices that historians have used to understand the histories of abolition, and also directed students to investigate the politics of studying abolition from different vantage points and theoretical frameworks. The course provided indispensable insight into historical debates about slavery and freedom, Anglo-centrism, liberal notions of personhood and citizenship, and the causes and effects of social, societal, and economic change.",
    "I gained a picture of slavery and abolition in the Atlantic world over a long time period, which gave me wonderful context for my historical research.",
    "I learned so much from this class. My understanding about Abolition was limited to Jamaica and the United States but taking this class has expanded my knowledge to the larger Caribbean including the French, Spanish, and Portuguese Empire. I also began to learn about Second Slavery and the way that the destruction of slavery in the British and French empire allowed for slavery to expand and flourish in other locales.",
    "Conceptually, this course was very well put together.",
    "I broadened my ideas associated with the term \"abolition.\" I challenged the periodization of British abolitionism. I developed deeper insights around what abolitionism means in the Atlantic when new forms of labor exploitation developed in post-emancipated societies like Antigua, St. Vincent and Jamaica.",
    "Got a great synthesis of different historiographical traditions covering abolition."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There were many strengths of this course. The co-teaching by Professor Echeverri and Professor Rugemer was an asset to the course and to the level of discussion we were able to have. The syllabus provided a very rich and varied picture of anti-slavery and abolition, and the participation of all students in the discussion made for a very energizing and edifying intellectual space. The level of work in the class was at times a barrier to fully engaging with the deeper questions and problems raised in the historiography. The high reading load was necessary to cover the breadth of the topic, but it was challenging to thoroughly read everything and write a coherent response each week. If we had read slightly less (or been directed to read particular sections of books closely) I would have felt more able to spend time identifying major concerns and questions. Additionally, the final assignment (annotated syllabus or historiography) was difficult to complete in addition to the already extensive reading on the course syllabus, and there was little time allowed at the end of the semester to devote only to the final assignment (just about 4 days). The final assignment could have been given more space and time and added more to the class if working on it had been incorporated into the structure of the class throughout the semester.",
    "Strengths - seminar discussions were guided well by instructors, challenging readings, methodologically diverse readings, interesting group of students with quite diverse ideas. Weaknesses - There was a fairly heavy workload, which in itself was a strength as it forced us to work harder and familiarize ourselves closely with texts, but it would have been useful to get some feedback on the weekly discussion posts and presentation (even just brief) so we could improve.",
    "Strengths: Most of the syllabus was very strong; I sensed a strong arc that scaffolded my learning about a new field. The presentation\/review assignment facilitated a deeper understanding of course themes. The instructors were very engaged, helpful, and knowledgeable. I appreciated the ideas they had for extra reading and future research. I appreciated when the instructors were part of our class discussions, guiding the conversation while being open to the many directions it could take. The \"free-for-all\" discussions did not work as well, because students in the course had different relationships with the materials (for some, it was their primary area of study, while the information was brand new for others). Weaknesses: The workload was very high and I felt overly monitored re: class assignments. Not only did we have weekly response papers that were due 24 hours ahead of class time, we were required to include each weekly reading assignment in our papers, which led me to err on the side of shallow summary-type responses rather than deep engagement with the texts. At this point in my academic career, I hope professors can trust me to come to class prepared to talk about texts and not \"check up\" on me through punitive assignments. The readings (especially during the first two-thirds of the course) veered heavily toward the metropole; I wish we read more about slavery in the colonies. Furthermore, many of our texts favored structural approaches to this history. The reading list in general felt very conservative.",
    "I loved that this class was co-taught. I think that the expansiveness of the region under discussion required professor familiar with the field who have focused on different regions throughout the Americas to teach it. This allowed for each professor to lead and inform the class in the areas they knew so that we got a some what complete understanding.",
    "There was a lot of material, a bit too much to grapple with on a weekly basis in a meaningful way. There was not enough class time to engage with the material",
    "The strengths of the course were definitely the high levels of knowledge of each instructor, as well as the fruitful class discussions. One weakness of the course was that at times the work load was excessive.",
    "Course was a very robust, very original seminar. Benefited immensely not only from the complementary expertise of Prof. Echeverri and Prof. Rugemer, but from the specialized knowledge of many classmates. The weekly comment was a great device for encouraging reading and connection-making between readings. Both professors very accessible, and ready with helpful feedback. Two constructive criticisms: 1) meeting, with readings assigned, during reading period was less than ideal. The final wrap-up discussions in that session were good, but it was difficult to do the reading justice at that very busy moment in the year. 2) We seemed to spend surprisingly little time on post-civil war U.S. abolition, though maybe that was intentional; could also be that having Prof. Jaynes (which was great) cut down on general discussion time on that topic."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student interested in the history of slavery, of the Americas, or of histories of empire, democracy, and Liberalism. The course provided a crucial foundation in the interrelated histories of slavery and abolition across the Atlantic world, and challenged many assumptions about the unfolding of abolition across the long nineteenth century. I would advise students interested in this course that the workload is very high (occasionally prohibitively high) and that it is a history course that is not deeply interdisciplinary.",
    "Absolutely. I always looked forward to the seminar, to hearing my colleagues' comments on the text, to hearing Prof. Echeverri's and Prof. Rugemer's insights from their field of expertise, and to reading challenging, methodologically diverse publications from the North and South Atlantic. I hope the course is offered again, as it's a really unique kind of class that brings together students with quite diverse interests. I learned a lot from my colleagues in African American studies and Latin American history. I felt the instructors complemented one another by offering different ideas and critiques, while they created a seminar space for honest, intense, intellectual discussion.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student with the caveat that it has a high workload and the instructors were a little unnecessarily strict.",
    "Yes I would. I think anyone working on Race and Slavery (no matter the region) should take a class like this.",
    "Sure",
    "I would definitely suggest this course to another student! It is incredibly crucial to anyone looking to study Atlantic slavery and forms of Atlantic emancipation. Although at times I found the work load excessive, I still learned a great deal.",
    "Emphatically yes."
