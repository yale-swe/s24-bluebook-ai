    "Greatly improved my knowledge of the authors read, and the general contours of the Renaissance epic tradition",
    "An excellent class in classics and Renaissance literature that covers very broad ground and offered an accessible introduction to many important works of literature.",
    "Knowledge of wide range of epics. Skills in keeping them all in mind to cite and flit between, and insights on the epic form and genre and reception.",
    "acquired a sense of epic genealogy from Virgil to Spenser; a useful immersion in the \"techniques\" of intertextual allusions among epic poets;",
    "I learned a lot about the history of epic poetry in the Western tradition, from Vergil to the Renaissance. Besides Vergil and Dante, all of the texts that we read in the class were new to me. It was enlightening to see how several different late medieval and early modern authors used and responded to the classical Latin epic, especially the Aeneid but also Lucan's Pharsalia. I found our discussions on topics such as the theory of epic and the differences between epic and lyric poetry to be useful for my other work and the texts we read resonated with texts that I have encountered in other classes at Yale."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: overview of the European epic tradition through readings of exemplary texts, taught by true experts with deep knowledge. Weaknesses: not always entirely clear what we should have focused on in the readings in order to participate in class discussion",
    "I really loved the way this course thought about epic and its discontents across different periods, cultures, and geographies. The breadth of the course is also in some way its greatest challenge, since the volume of reading sometimes made it difficult to focus our discussions. I wonder if we might have benefited from shorter selections and more close reading, rather than discussions of intertextuality and allusion (interesting and informative conversations, certainly, but hard for everyone to participate as a large group--and somewhat alienating for those who don't have the same background in classical languages, for instance).",
    "Strengths: the thoughtfully organized syllabus with coordinated secondary readings; the quality of teaching and the availability of the professors Weaknesses: the one week episodes on entire texts (Lucan, Camoes); lulls in conversation (particularly during those classes)",
    "The team-taught structure provided lively and fruitful models for literary discourse. I often wished we could simply listen to conversation between Professors Quint and Tylus at greater length. Size did make it difficult to move quickly through texts at times. I think the large enrollment made it awkward for many students to respond even to basic questions; in that respect, lecture-like aspects were sometimes more time-efficient modes of engagement. On the other hand, I did feel that by the end we had created a warm classroom community, and it was good to bring students of so many different programs and backgrounds together. The professors' ability to grade a large volume of response papers quickly and with detail is remarkable. Many of us came in especially enthusiastic about reading Spenser, and I wonder if in the future he might come earlier in the sequence.",
    "Reading was enormous and ambitious and not entirely Renaissance, not by a long shot, which I suppose we knew going in. Criticism was in general good and fair, though made conspicuously an afterthought by assigning certain people to do it. More direction on the important scenes in particular epics (as we got with Spenser and Camoes for instance) would have been helpful. On the topic of the reading: the Aeneid is important, but when we spend more time on it than on Spenser, it's not clear what it's doing in a seminar on the Renaissance epic. And the huge amount of reading, copped to on the syllabus, was totally cheapened by the way that so much of seminar could turn into a kind of trivia game the answers to which would come from texts we hadn't read either for that meeting or, worse, for that semesterwhen, at the same time, we had just read hundreds of pages of poetry, the majority of which we would never discuss as a partial result of time taken on the trivia game. Unequal distribution of speaking time between the two professors, which is quite frankly a shame, and this extended even to texts very fully in the wheelhouse of one or the other. And such a huge portion of the class never or rarely spoke, including tons of smart people, which demands something of a pedagogical answer. Zooming-in on particular sections of the poem while in seminar and dwelling with those in a close-reading fashion could have closed this knowledge gap.",
    "strength: combination of literary and historical perspectives; weakness: insufficient attention paid to secondary literature assigned;",
    "The course was great in terms of learning, but it did not feel like a seminar because we were not encouraged to talk about the readings.",
    "This course had several strengths: it integrated a variety of epic and epic-like poems from many different times and places into a cohesive curriculum, demonstrating that texts within a genre like epic can speak to each other across great divides of culture and historical development; team teaching by two experienced professors lent the course greater diversity of thought and perspective than it might otherwise have possessed; and the course emphasized expressing one's ideas both in discourse and writing. The course had a couple of weaknesses: not everyone participated regularly in class discussions, as it was a large class, and discussions tended to alternate between professors and students rather developing into a Socratic seminar-style exchange; and there was perhaps too much of a good thing in how much reading and writing was assigned per week. For instance, extending the course into reading week took time away from working on the final paper, especially considering that the due date was moved forward a week to accommodate the large class size. Spending three weeks reading and discussing the entire Aeneid seemed somewhat excessive, so a week could be saved by skipping parts of the Aeneid. Were there more time, it might be useful to supplement with readings from Lucretius, Statius and other influential epic poets of the classical period, but then the course would undoubtedly contain too much material for a single semester. Overall, I think that the course needs little in the way of improvement, except perhaps a slight reduction in the amount of reading so that the course does not require a surplus class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, provided they are willing to devote a substantial amount of time to the primary and secondary reading. This course is very rewarding, given effort.",
    "Like it says on the tin, Renaissance Epic is an excellent way to read some of the greatest epics in European history, from Virgil to Spenser. I can see it working quite well as an audited course for a third-year, or anyone who approached it as something like a directed reading. The discussions could feel somewhat disorganized, perhaps because the volume of reading and size of the class made it difficult to focus our conversations; those discussions could also sometimes pivot too much on intertextual allusion for my taste. Significant tangents dwelled on texts we had not been assigned to read, which could seem counterproductive, especially when we were trying to attend closely to an already large set of texts. On the other hand, we had some wonderful discussions on wandering and pilgrimage--many led by Jane Tylus, who is a very gifted teacher and who for me brought out some of what makes epic so compelling: its themes of exile, alienation, and loneliness. A worthwhile class, if you don't mind a large volume of reading that might not all make it into the discussion.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in the target authors; in future years I might caution students to be wary of such a large seminar, as the number of students did seem to detract from conversation",
    "Yes, with enthusiasm.",
    "Yes",
    "Would recommend to students with a classical background or with an established relationship with the professors. The more classics you have read, the better, and the more familiar you are with texts already assigned, the more ready you will be for this kind of seminar.",
    "affirmative; indispensable for a general grasp of Roman and Renaissance epics; (would've been great if Milton was included)",
    "I would, with some cautions.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in epic poetry, classical reception or Renaissance literature in general. It provides a worthy introduction to these three subjects and also constitutes comparative literature, since works from five different linguistic traditions are considered. However, I would not necessarily recommend it to someone taking a heavy course load because it requires so much reading and writing."
