    "Yes. The drafts allowed me to try new techniques which I could later revise and refine. This class will make you think about yourself and the way you express your personal view of the world. Sharing that with other students in the class is fun as well.",
    "Take it! It's an English class that is writing-based instead of literature-based. You will learn a lot about yourself and your writing -- this class necessitates a lot of self-reflection. This is a must-take class at Yale!",
    "Take it with Ball he is pretty good.",
    "ENGL 120 is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. I would recommend taking it with Mr. Ball is you get the chance.",
    "This is a good class--it is fun to write about yourself and fun to get to know the other kids in the class. Mr Ball is a fine teacher to take it with--not life-changing but still good.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Papers are due each Friday, and it is usually not feasible to get started on them early (because we learn things on Wednesday that we will use in the paper), so Thursdays should be recognized as a day during which you will have to work for this class a good deal."
