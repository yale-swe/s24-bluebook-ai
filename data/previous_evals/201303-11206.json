   "comments": [
    "It's probably a required course for you but I took it just to see if I wanted to continue being MENG. I thought it was a manageable class and am definitely still considering MENG!",
    "If you have to take it, do. It's not all that bad, but sadly you won't learn much. Even though the material has great potential. A better teacher and teaching style would help. So if you have the choice, I wouldn't reccommend it. But if you have to, you'll survive just fine.",
    "It's not a bad class, but it ends up being more difficult than most people expect it to be. The information is very useful and can definitely be applied to later classes (especially classes concerning design and material choice), but I wouldn't say this is a super easy class to take as an elective.",
    "Aaaaaaah. It's a MechE class. If you are ABET, then you likely have to take it. The class is basically where MechE and ChemE overlap, so if you are MechE and took AP Chemistry or any other equivalent class then you will probably do fine, especially given that you are going to need to end up teaching yourself most of the material.",
    "The lectures were relatively interesting and the material is fairly applicable. There are fun things passed around the room a lot. The midterm and final are kind of hard and you don't get a lot of comprehensive feedback.",
    "Great class to take as an elective or intro into materials science. Interesting topics and Professor is very good. Homeworks are not too time consuming.",
    "A chill but informative introduction to materials science. I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested - it is a pretty small investment for a lot of interesting material.",
    "It's a requirement for MechE and it's a pain to get through. If you're interested in chemistry, the material will probably be interesting. Some of the applications are cool and it's good to have some overlap with some other engineering courses. Problem sets are easy but the exams are ridiculous. It's not meant to be that hard but they expect you to know random information that doesn't matter in the bigger context.",
    "This class was alright. I took it for a Sc credit, which was a mistake. Definitely a challenge for me because it's for engineers, so it's assumed that everyone has had chemistry recently (I haven't in 4 years) and is sharp with their dimensional analysis. I learned some pretty cool stuff, though.The homeworks weren't super well done, though, and the tests were way harder than the homeworks, or at least the midterm was.",
    "Only if you want to be ABET, need and Engineering elective or take it Credit\/D",
    "This is a fine introductory class, although the lectures are straight out of the textbook. Udo Schwarz is a nice professor but the TF was awful.",
    "Easy ABET elective for a ChemE. All class notes posted on Classes V2, I never took notes. He passes around material samples all the time, super fun to touch stuff! I went to class just to hold the things he handed out, and to make myself do psets for other classes. But do read the textbook, that's the best way to study for the exams.",
    "The midterm was brutal and the final is difficult. Neither are very similar to homework problems.",
    "Overall, I would recommend intro Mat Sci if you have any interest in material science or how materials work. First of all it's not a very difficult course. The problem sets are very manageable, and if you keep up with the readings you don't really even need to go to lecture. Udo is a good professor, but he teaches almost exactly from the book (plus some cool anecdotes). I'm glad I took the class.",
    "This class is a survey course of polymers metals and ceramics. Not much time was devoted to polymers. The homework was tedious but then the midterm did not really relate to the homework questions.",
    "Very chemistry heavy. You have to take it as a mechE major. There are better classes if you want a cool science class. Strength and deformations teaches you half the same same material and is a better class overall",
    "A pretty interesting class, though the midterm and final were ridonkulously difficult.",
    "Overall an enjoyable course. Lectures are taught by powerpoint, which isn't my cup of tea, but Professor Schwarz is nevertheless an obvious expert in his field."
