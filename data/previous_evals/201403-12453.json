   "comments": [
    "Take it! But there's no reason to if you don't want to major in EE or EECS.",
    "I hope you like math, because this course has a lot of it. As a math fan who is probably just CS rather than CS\/EE, I enjoyed the course. Sometimes Sehkar and the lecture gets lost in the math, so ask if you don't remember why you're doing something or what the symbols mean. You cover lots of cool topics like signals, codes, and some basic stats, if you don't have a familiarity with basic stats\/linear algebra\/calculus you'll certainly have that by the end which is a nice bonus, but can also make the class pretty obtuse at times if you don't know them. Labs are all matlab which I was super into, and the exams are trivial.",
    "EE202 has extremely interesting content and is a fairly easy class to do well in. It is math heavy, not science heavy. Many of the lectures were fascinating to listen to and Sekhar is a great professor.",
    "If you were to take one EENG class, take this one.",
    "If you want to see what EE has to offer other than circuit analysis it is good. It would help greatly if you knew some linear algrebra the psets kind of vary in difficult so some take no time at all and others require you to learn some things on your own and take a good amount of time.",
    "EE 202 is a class where you will learn a lot of new and good things about data compression, networks, and fourier transforms\/series. I would highly recommend taking it.",
    "Excellent class. Final is a little hard though, but take it!",
    "Just like EE201 was nothing like EE200, this class is totally different from both. In theory, the material is very interesting and useful. In practice, the math is difficult and the concepts are challenging. I suggest you have a strong background in statistics and physics before you take this class.",
    "A great survey course. We learned about compression, error correction, encryption, network architecture, routing algorithms, Fourier analysis, and many other topics. All very interesting. The professor has a quirky sense of humor, but he really does care about us students. He has all his lecture notes typed up and put on classesV2; reading these before lectures makes most of the topics easily understandable. I highly recommend this class, even for non-EE majors if the material sounds interesting.",
    "Good overview course. Well taught. Decent workload. Some sections are more interesting than others.",
    "An overview of many fields within EE, on the opposite side of the spectrum from circuits. Networks (the Internet), systems (convolution), etc. Pretty math intensive but everything is taught. You have to take this if you're going to major in EE but I would recommend it if you are interested in these subjects."
