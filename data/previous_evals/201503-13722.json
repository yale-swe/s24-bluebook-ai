    "Yes, it will give you the confidence to produce the kind of writing that you actually would want to publish somewhere (he made us find website we would want to pitch our final papers to like LARB, Slate, etc.) and helped me understand the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the people who fight in them",
    "Take this class! Very interesting overview of modern war memoir.",
    "This is by far the greatest class I have taken at Yale. Not only were all the readings fascinating, but the assignments allowed us to go beyond the traditional college essay and think about contemporary forms of writing. The class atmosphere was stimulating without crossing any lines, and everyone disagreed with finesse. Mr Bonenberger was an incredible instructor. He directed conversation without dominating it, and he allowed us to draw on the expansive nature of both the readings and society. If he ever returns to offer this class, TAKE IT!!!!!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! three papers - totally manageable and really interesting to write. The readings are super interesting. I would read them anyway even if they weren't part of the class. Professor is great! Really knowledgeable and approachable if you ever feel you need help. I looked forward to class every week!",
    "An amazing course. TAKE IT!!! You will not regret it. Adrian is an amazing night teacher and Afghanistan vet who is so smart funny and inquisitive. The books and articles you read are so poignant. Take this course if you want to understand soldiers and war better or if you want to be a better global citizen. I hope he offers the course again so more people can take it. Be ready to take risks and get in heated discussions.",
    "An ICONIC class. I cannot recommend it enoughthe material, discussions, assignments, professor, and overall environment were near perfect. Though the title suggests a focus on analyzing war memoir, expect to explore Americanism, patriotism, gender, race, sexuality, heroism, and more. Memoir and the War on Terror will push you to develop both your individual writing style (not your strictly academic style), and your value system as a student, man, woman, civilian, veteran, citizen, visitorand however else you may define yourself. A necessary course for all those who have wondered where they fit in in war culture."
