    "I recommend this class for anyone who is interested in taking an art course. I believe that color is usually a relatively weak point in an artists skillset, and to be able to focus on improving that skill and understanding how color interacts is a great opportunity to become a better artist.",
    "Definitely take it. One of those classes you actually enjoy. Assignments were interesting and fun, and class time often consisted of looking at others' assignments and commenting. Field trip to Albers' Museum was fun! I gathered a whole new appreciation for color theory.",
    "Yes! If you have any interest in Color, this is a great introductory course. The work and readings are super interesting, without being an overwhelming amount of work. Definitely worth taking, even if you are not an Art major.",
    "Yes, take it!",
    "Color Practice definitely requires thought and care, but the work is not overwhelming and is fascinating (to those interested in anything having to do with visual aesthetics, from visual artists to costume designers).",
    "Multiple perspectives on the idea of color. What is color and how can you think about it?"
