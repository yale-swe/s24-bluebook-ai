    "An interesting class. Your grade is largely based on a presentation so make sure you have a good partner and prepare well. In general the work load is low (4 PS and a bit of reading).If the students presenting weren't good at presenting it could get very boring however.",
    "No paper, very manageable workload. Professor does not add much to the class, you will learn what you want but can get by doing very little.",
    "Econ 480 was my first Econ seminar, so I can't rate it against a peer, but compared to lectures, it's a much more interesting and enjoyable experience.",
    "Yes, it's a good senior seminar",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to learn about the analysis behind current macro topics. It can be boring, but you do learn quite a bit and its not a lot of work at all.",
    "Not that many assignments. Really hard, but you can be done with the majority of your grade rather soonish in the class meaning you're only responsible for participation and problem sets. Seminar in the 400's and more relaxed grading.",
    "Yes, it was a great class",
    "Very interesting but very challenging. There is not much work but the assignments that you do get require a strong math and economics background. You can get through it with a bit of struggle, so no worries if you do not have that kind of experience.",
    "A good class to take if you like reading paper and doing a little math.",
    "Take it! You get to learn a lot in this seminar with minimum stress.",
    "Take this course - you learn a lot from fellow students. It just has one presentation, and if I were you, I would select the presentation on the financial crisis.",
    "i would not recommend, you don't learn anything"
