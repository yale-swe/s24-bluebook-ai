    "A good continuation of French. I took it after French 4, and the readings\/movies are still kind of depressing but it is still fun. Madame Schneider is great and really knows her stuff- take it with her if you can.",
    "If you're interested in continuing your study of French and would like to become fluent, but still need some work on your grammar French 151 02 is the way to go.",
    "As long as you place into it and know it's a good level for you, it's a worthwhile course.",
    "Take it -- it'll force you to improve your writing, and the texts and films you read and watch, respectively, will not only further your understanding of France and French culture but also make you a more acute reader. I'd recommend it. Watch out for the homework, though. It seems like a lot at first but you get into the groove of doing grammar exercises and short writing responses fairly quickly.",
    "You need to take this class to get to the 160 and above classes. I think it's a good class overall but a lot of work."
