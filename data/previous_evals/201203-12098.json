   "comments": [
    "It's interesting, but grading is tough, and you have to study pretty hard for exams to do well",
    "Mental Lives of Animals and Babies goes through several cognitive abilities that show animals and babies are not as different from adult humans as we may think (and previous psychologists originally thought). This is a great 5th class -- the workload is manageable, the lectures are a joy to attend, and the material is interesting. Of course I would recommend this class, especially if you haven't taken intro psych already.",
    "Very fun class. To do well, you HAVE TO DO THE READING. It makes up a significant portion of the midterm and final. However, as a Cr\/D\/F (how I did it) there was not a ton of work and you learned a lot!",
    "Yes, it is a fun class, though the tests were fairly challenging.",
    "Just like the title, it teaches you what you would want to know about psychology of babies and animals. Quite a lot of overlap with other psych classes, but you'll get that regardless of what psych class you take. This is probably the most interesting spin on the basic psychology classes at least in my opinion.",
    "I was ultimately disappointed by this class, but there was interesting content.",
    "There is a lot of information, but it is all really interesting. Anyone who likes babies and animals and wants to learn about how they think should take this course. But, there are a lot of readings that do actually need to be done for the exams, so it is a lot of work.",
    "Definitely an interesting class - entertaining and interesting material. Professor Wynn is enthusiastic and makes class enjoyable. Two tests for 35% and 3 papers each worth 10%. The papers took some thought - not as straightforward. No final during finals period.",
    "This is a great class if you are really interested in infant and animal cognition. Honestly I would mostly recommend it for psych majors or those who have taken Intro Psych. It's definitely not a gut though - be aware that exams are 50% based on the readings so you have to do your homework.",
    "This was a good class. 3 papers, 2 midterms, no final. Lectures at the beginning of the year kinda sucked but the lecturesat the end got very interesting. Prof Wynn puts all the powerpoints online which was very nice.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Wynn is an engaging, funny lecturer. The material is interesting. There are three papers throughout the semester, all on fun\/interesting topics. Just beware if you have already taken developmental psychology or sexy psych. I had taken both, so this class ended up being a lot of review.",
    "Topic is all in the name - probably wouldn't recommend if you've taken Sex, Evolution, and Human Nature (and maybe Developmental Psych, but I never took it so I don't know exactly) because there was a lot more overlap than I expected. Interesting but not really mindblowing, not a gut.",
    "While the material is fun, the exams and paper assignments are difficult. I personally found the first exam extremely challenging as a psych major. There are also a lot of reading assignments, which are 50% of the exam content. Lectures though sometimes involve funny video clips of babies and animals.",
    "This class was fairly interesting, but honestly pretty basic. It's an easy 5th but I wouldn't take it if you can find something more legit (no point in wasting a credit).",
    "Not what you think going in. The material is very easy but the tests are unfair and difficult for no reason.",
    "There are better SO credits. It's interesting material, but if you're interested, take it cr\/d\/fail. It's not as easy as it seems, and you have to do the readings, which are not always very digestible.",
    "I recommend it.",
    "I would take it. It's really really interesting and you get to look at lotsa pictures of babies and baby animals. It would be to your advantage to stay on top of the readings as much as you can though. She tests readings and lecture material about equally and it's not fun if you end up leaving all the readings 'til right before the midterms. Trust me. Don't go there.",
    "This course is a good overview of the cognitive skills of babies and animals as well as teaching you about different types of experiments and just basics about psychology and cognitive science. It's weaknesses are that at times it can get a tad repetitive and the midterms are kind of difficult. It's strengths are that Karen Wynn is awesome and the material is interesting and instructive, teaching us about our developmental origins and really how amazing humans are. I would take it, solong as you like either babies or animals.",
    "I probably would not recommend this class. THe lectures are unbearably long, and the connections made between babies and animals is not a concrete one. Nothing really went in depth, and it was very repetitive of other psych courses.",
    "Lecture twice a week, two midterms, three 1500 word papers, and weekly reading (about 3-6 articles per week). I find child& animal psychology to be fascinating as a broad subject, but not every single nuance. For that reason, some of the lectures were less than attention grabbing, but most of the material was interesting and I generally enjoyed the class. If you're not interested in the subject, though, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Not nearly as gutty as the title would suggest, although it's still not a lot of work (the curve was harder than most psych classes). The readings are really important for the exams and lectures are less so(prof more or less reads slides during class).",
    "It's an easy class to follow and interesting as well. Lectures can get boring though.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, regardless of whether you've taken Intro Psych or CogSci before. Professor Wynn is great, and lectures are pretty interesting. The readings can be a little dense, but the material is interesting and relevant.",
    "Summary: BABIEZZZZZWould I recommend it?: BABIEZZZZZ",
    "PSYC 304 is an investigation of what we can learn about human psychology through the study of babies and animals. I would definitely recommend this to other students interested in psychology, evolution, or related topics.",
    "Makes a decent 4th or 5th course (esp if you've got some Credit\/Ds you've been saving up and need to use). The 3 essays weren't absolutely horrible but they definitely were a pain in the ass. The 2 midterms weren't rocket science but you definitely needed to have shown up for lecture and at least gave the readings a semi-decent look-over. But I mean it's an entire class about babies and furry animals. Take it.",
    "So with the title of the course you probably think this class is a gut. Surprise, it's not that easy. Class is alright, but I was expecting a few more videos of cute babies and animals #disappointed. Tests are split equally between topics covered in class and the readings, so take detailed notes on the readings as you do them so you have something to review for the midterm and final.",
    "YES. Moderate workload, the exams asked fair questions, the papers had interesting topics and were not too difficult, and the lectures were pretty interesting for the most part.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you like babies and\/or animals. Prof. Wynn is very entertaining and a great lecturer. The grading is based on 3 essays (about 1500 words) worth 10% each, a midterm and a final. Because the midterm and final have a lot of weightage, you should start studying for them ahead of time.",
    "Pretty good class. Fun, easy enough, and interesting topics.",
    "Lovely course, but definitely definitely not easy! Unexpectedly the only course whose grade I worried for in this class...and I'm a science major!!",
    "Good class. It's basically developmental psychology with a funny name. Warning: do not take this class if you're looking for a gut because the midterms are not a joke and you do have to do all of the readings. But, if you keep up with the work and do the readings sometime before the exam you will be fine. I took this class Credit\/D and really enjoyed it that way and would recommend it if you're a psych major (as you can use two Credit\/D classes towards the major). Otherwise, just do the readings and pay attention in class and you'll be fine!Overall, easy workload though. 3 short papers, 2 essays and essentially no homework. The ideal Credit\/D class that you'll enjoy and can potentially learn a lot from and use towards the psych major.",
    "Don't take this class if you are just interested in Babies and Animals and care about your grade. If you wanna take it, take it CDF. It was really stressful and the essay grading was tough. Also there are only two tests with 12 questions so it barely tests anything you know but if you don't remember something specific they're asking about you're screwed.",
    "Yes, this was a good course. The papers and exams aren't easy, but you'll do well if you put in effort and ask questions when you're confused. Overall, it was pretty interesting.",
    "Yes, good course and much will be learned",
    "I wouldn't recommend it if you have already taken Sexy Psych. It's basically a worse version of Laurie Santos' class. It has a lot of overlap. There was lots of reading that you needed to do for the tests.",
    "Take it if you need an easy 5th credit. It grants a lot of insight into human nature, and our relationship to animals too!",
    "Yes. However, only take it if you are really interested in the topic, because it is not a gut. The title says it all. You examine all aspects of animal and infant cognition: representing number, emotion, consciousness, etc. \"Babies and Animals\" makes it sound all innocent, but it is NOT. It's definitely more work than I thought it would be and the tests are NOT easy. 50% readings, 50% lecture. So definitely do the readings. It did not take up a lot of my time, but it was surprisingly difficult to try to get a relatively good grade. I repeat: NOT A GUT.",
    "This was a great class! A comprehensive survey of the fields of comparative and developmental psychology, taught by one of the most famous names in developmental psych! The material was taught in a fun, fascinating way. I highly recommend it; however, I will say that the name is horribly misleading. Despite containing the words \"Babies and Animals,\" this class is definitely not a gut.",
    "There are better psychology classes at Yale, but it is definitely interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class to others. It's a great way to build a foundation for other psychology classes, and if you've already taken social psych or intro psych, it's a good refresher that helps to integrate everything together.",
    "Yes I would! However keep in mind that this is no gut. The tests are very challenging and the papers are not graded leniently.",
    "Don't take this course unless you have to. Subject matter sounds interesting but this is deceptive. In a sentence, the course just tells you that babies and animals know a lot more than you might initially surmise.Exams are difficult and it is hard to know what to take out of the many readings of various (dry) psych studies. Lectures are well-organized but not particularly engaging and slides are not posted online.Weak course. Three TAs and you're stuck with the one you get for all three essays, which can seem like a pretty horrible draw if you get a bad TA. No oversight in terms of essay grades.",
    "It's a cool subject matter, but sometimes it doesn't quite live up to how awesome it seems like it would be. The lectures unfortunately get a bit tedious, BUT I think with some simple tweaking, it could be that awesome class it seems like it should be.",
    "If you're lookingfor a light psychology course that isn't too dense or full of work, I'd take this one. Overall, this class was pretty interesting. A lot of the information is intuitive, so I don't think I came out of the class with a wealth of information, but several lectures still piqued my interest. Professor Wynn is a funny and engaging lecturer, so the class is never dull!",
    "I would recommend this class only to juniors and seniors who are psychology majors because being a freshmen was very difficult in this class.",
    "Psych 304 is a deeper look at the mental functioning and capabilities of various animals as well as human infants. Throughout the course you look at various studies and build an understanding of the animal and infant brain. Ultimately you realize that both babies and animals are capable of much more than people generally give them credit for.",
    "I would tentatively recommend this class to someone, just because the lectures and material were really cool, but the logistics of the class, i.e. tests\/structure of tests, readings, and papers, made it a huge pain that I sort of regret taking, or at least not making Credit\/D.",
    "it was interesting at times but boring at others. more work than you would expect. i would recommend it to people very interested in pysch, especially developmental pysch. otherwise, you shouldn't take it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend that anyone interested in infant and animal psychology take this course. It is an upper-level psychology course, so the exams are difficult and the papers are graded harshly. However, Professor Wynn is a great lecturer and her passion for the subject is evident.",
    "I would recommend this class as an interesting social science. The test and essays were pretty straightforward, but you definitely need to do the reading and go to lecture.",
    "This is an interesting class that was not extremely difficult. Dont need a background in psych. Take if the material sounds interesting, otherwise you will get bored and will not be motivated to study the necessary amount. Study hard on the readings and lectures before the tests and you should do relatively well. I would recommend if the material sounds interesting.",
    "I'm a psych major and I basically needed another psych credit, so I chose this as it seemed mildly interesting and easy. Mistake. I had to take this Cr\/D because I didn't care about this class enough to go to lectures, thus making it extremely difficult to study for the tests. Also because the readings piled up and I never did the readings when they were meant to be read. This is a problem for me in most classes, however. I noted the size of the class was much diminished on normal days, with all of the seats filled up on exam days. So others obviously agreed with me. There are also 3 essays, so its a decent amount of work. Karen Wynn just wasn't an engaging lecturer - she's kind of quirky, but that is not enough to make lectures interesting. The class is also 1 hr 15 which makes it basically unbearable. I could NOT sit through the whole hour without dozing off or going on the internet or something. And it isn't even an early class. Some material is interesting, but it also overlaps with a lot of other courses, so think carefully before taking this class. Very very average. would not take again if i had the opportunity.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Dont be fooled by all the adorable pictures when you shop it...those are there throughout the course (which is great) but it also has a lot of substance. Karen Wynn is a fun and interesting lecturer. The class definitely broadened my sphere of thinking. In addition to learning lots about the behavior and mental experiences of animals and infants, you learn about related debates and controversies, which are so interesting. If you're at all interested in psychology, biology, babies, pets, or other animals, it's worth shopping.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone interested in the brain's capabilities. It's a well-organized mixture of comparative and developmental psychology through which you see how the adult human brain is unique. There is a lot of history of psychology and of different fields of study, as well as a lot of information from individual studies. Some test material does come from the readings, and not all readings are discussed in class, so that's definitely something to be aware of. In general, the course is very interesting, but don't be fooled by the name of the class because babies and animals, as cute as they are, are pretty important to understanding the human brain, too.",
    "This course is ok, but as a non-cogsci and non-psych major, I was a little disappointed. I thought it would be very interesting (who doesn't love babies and animals??) but it turned out not to be and I found myself dreading going to lectures. The professor is very nice however and she is definitely approachable if you run into any serious problems with the material. The exams were more in depth and specific than expected so if you are like me and aren't used to psych lingo and style, then you will probably need to put more work into studying than you think."
