    "piecey. make sure you read the book and understand all the material . only 45% of the material is mentioned in class.",
    "if you have taken calc before this class is fairly easy.",
    "essentially Calc AB again but fewer integral related questions and also moves faster as there is only one semester to get all the info in. tarik himself is great, speaks english very clearly, energetic and friendly, very smart, however if he gets confused in a problem his teaching becomes very unclear",
    "It's like high school math all over again.",
    "A lot of theories and very little math.",
    "i'd definitely recommend it- not stressful at all.",
    "standard calculus class. not too demanding.",
    "The course teaches basic calculus but at an accelerated rate with more involved strategies and questions.",
    "It is a good overview of calculus.I would recommend it if they want to go further in math.",
    "If you need to fulfill a requirement take it, if not don't bother.",
    "Math 112 is a good course for students interested in taking calculus. If you had very little exposure to calculus in high school, it will probably be difficult and require lots of work. THe problem sets are very manageable, but the exams are hard. I would recommend this class to students because it is not overly time consuming and the exams are fair with the questions they ask.",
    "It is a basic math class. Study, and you should do fine.",
    "I would recommend this class if you just need to satisfy the distributional requirement. However, this class is very easy, so if you took calculus in high school and are looking for something more challenging, you should probably look into taking 115."
