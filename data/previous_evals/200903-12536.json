    "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Let's get first things out of the way: this is not a history course. This is not a typical political science course. This is not really an English course. This is not a typical lecture course. This is not a course in which you can learn the material based on the reading alone. And this is NOT a course to be taken lightly.What is it? A thoughtful and provocative discourse on the intellectual history and ramifications of our first and only philosopher-president, as lectured by two of Yale's finest professors: the inimitable David Bromwich and the unsurpassed Steven Smith. The lectures are engaging and remarkably insightful. More interesting still is the back and forth (some may call it argumentation) between Bromwich and Smith, who frequently disputed the other's interpretations, and who frequently asked questions during the traditional question period in an attempt to rebut the other. What better way to spend an hour than to watch such a thing?A relatively difficult course, if done right. The reading is fairly substantial, and the three, 6-7 pg. papers seem to follow right on top of each other.There are those who skimped on the reading or on the lectures. What a waste of time and money. If you're offered the chance to take a course with two of Yale's finest, you owe it to yourself to put in the work.",
    "Yes, if you are prepared to take a class all about Lincoln and know your Civil War history reasonably well.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are ok with studying the speeches of one man for14 weeks. If you can't handle that, then don't take the course. That being said, it was interesting to see the two professors' takes on Lincoln-- oftentimes they differed.",
    "So there's a lot of reading, but only 3 5pp. papers and a final. Interesting lectures: smith and bromwich are quite a duo. I've never quite experienced a class like this one.",
    "A solid class with a fair amount of interesting reading, the only problem was that spending an entire semester on Lincoln got a little tedious by the end. Supplementary readings from the likes of Calhoun, Whitman, Garrison, Douglass, and others make for a refreshing change of pace, but unfortunately, the professors did not talk about them as much as I would have liked. Still, Lincoln is fascinating, as is that time in American history, and the subject stays interesting even when the lectures don't (as indeed they don't sometimes).The reading load is heavy - be prepared to spend a long time on certain weeks' assignments, such as when you cover the Lincoln-Douglas debates. The papers are short, but the topics were very restrictive - there are between 5 and 7 choices, all very specific in terms of what you must argue. For English majors, keep in mind these are history papers - it's a substantially different experience than standard textual analysis.The final is solid identifications, meaning if you don't keep up with the reading and take good notes in class, you could be in serious trouble.I'd recommend it overall, but it's not a perfect class.",
    "Definitely take this class. Not only is it a good introduction to the civil war period, but the readers are also pretty incredible. Lincoln's speeches and letters are a joy to read.",
    "Yeah--go for it. Definitely interesting.",
    "I definitely recommend taking this class. Regardless of whether you go to lecture, you will learn a great deal from the reading alone. If you're at all interested in Lincoln, this class will give you a unique perspective of him as a politician and as a thinker.",
    "This was an excellent course in almost every respect. Probably my favorite one of the semester. The lectures between Bromwich and Smith could have matched up a bit more, but even in divergent directions they were great.",
    "Do not leave Yale without taking the class.",
    "Definitely take it if you're even remotely interested in American history OR political philosophy.",
    "If you're interested in learning about Lincoln, take this class. Two excellent professors, and it's great reading and writing about all of Lincoln's speeches.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. There is a lot of reading, but it is interesting and manageable. The professors are great, and Lincoln was a fascinating president. This class does make a better seminar I would imagine, but it still works quite well as a lecture.",
    "Yup, it was awesome!",
    "It's too academic, but learning about Abraham Lincoln makes it worth taking.",
    "This is a phenomenal course overall. Bromwich and Smith are both brilliant in their own ways. Take it to learn about a man whose political thought has had a deep influence on American history. The readings, which mostly consist of Lincoln's speeches\/writings but do include supplementary texts from his contemporaries, such as Whitman, Melville, Emerson, etc. are all well chosen. The papers were very fair and the final was a breeze. Highly recommended.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if it's ever taught again. If you love language and its public uses, if you're interested in the foundations of this country, if you're curious about what really set Lincoln apart, it's for you. They're two of the best professors at Yale.",
    "This was the most disappointing class I have taken at Yale (I'm a senior). There are some classes that you know you won't be excited about (a required QR or SC, or maybe a class that you need to take for a major or a prerequisite that you aren't actually interested in). This was not one of those: its an entire course dedicated to Abraham Lincoln!The professors really killed this course. Their lectures would often be about abstract philosophical concepts or english poets - there were some that had little or nothing do with Lincoln at all! Many times I would sit through a lecture wondering what the professors were talking about. I feel like any number of professors at Yale could have made this into an incredible and engaging course, Professors Steven Smith and David Bromwich did not. There were undoubtedly some students who worshipped the professors and enjoyed it, but I am sure that they were in the minority.The syllabus was great however: Lincoln's speeches and letter are sometimes mind-blowing, and the Charnwood biography and McPherson's \"Battle Cry of Freedom\" were both good reads as well. My TA, Craig Fehrman, was also good. And the course itself is not a ton of work: three short papers and an ID final. But if I had known what the lectures were going to be like before going in, I wouldn't have wasted a Yale credit on this course.",
    "This is a course that exposes you to Lincoln's speeches and writings as curated by Professors Smith and Bromwich, meaning you'll get a very close look at Lincoln as a political thinker, politician, man and writer that you would never get from any American history class (though you get some American history as well). And Lincoln turns out to be really, really brilliant, subtly funny and concise. There is a fair amount of reading and work, though - three papers and a final - and for some reason it's a writing credit, though I don't think most people were using it for a writing credit. This, more than most other classes I've taken at Yale, really made me feel that I had learned something, or many things - about American history, political philosophy, the abolition movement, the politics of the period, and Lincoln. Section and lecture were both lively, thought-provoking and engaging. Smith and Bromwich are both brilliant and good lecturers, though they sometimes disagree. That resulted in some dissonance in the course's teachings, but I felt that only helped me take charge of my own learning more rather than just accepting everything the professor said.",
    "Take it. Do the reading. Understand why Lincoln and America rock. Feel important.",
    "Lincoln at 200 is the best course I've taken at Yale; Lincoln is one of the great philosopher statesman of America and you get to explore his thought with two of the best professors at Yale.",
    "Yes if you want to read every great speech Lincoln's ever written. But it's kind of a vague course and doesn't go into detail in anything aside from Lincoln's person. Which is sort of overstudied to begin with. But really good insights into our best national leader.",
    "Yes! Do the reading. The Lincoln reading. That's the best part of this course. You won't forget some of these speeches.",
    "Lectures were not always engaging, but the subject matter is very interesting. If you enjoy Lincoln, then you should take it!",
    "The lectures were great and one learns quite a bit from the readings, but the TA's made the class unenjoyable formany.",
    "Awesome class. Take it if you can!!!!",
    "Better as a seminar. Smith's lectures are interesting; Bromwich's, incomprehensible. Section is a farce and only worth attending to manage your TA. Despite some errors in presentation, the material is excellent: unabridged highlights of Lincoln's writings and speeches. Worth getting the books even if you're not taking the class.",
    "A very good class with fascinating material and excellent lecturers. That being said, the class lacked direction - it couldn't quite make up it's mind what it was. It really shouldn't have counted for an English credit, although it provided a nic change of pace for English majors. I would definitely recommend it, but with some reservations.",
    "I would only recommend this class to another student if they were really interested in Lincoln. I found myself getting bored with the subject material, as I only had a slight infatuation with the subject. Do not take this class if you would just like to learn more about one of our great American heroes.",
    "It was a very interesting course that I am glad I took. I wish that the lectures were more geared towards English majors and less towards thosewho have a background in political philosophy or history - they were, at times, extremely hard to follow. However, the class was worth it. The stuff here should be required knowledge!",
    "Best class I have taken at Yale. No questions asked. If you are remotely interested in politics, philosophy, American history, or 19th century literature and writing, you should sign up for this class and never look back.",
    "Mixed bag - take the course if you want to read Lincoln, but you'll have to endure some pretty philosophical lectures that don't really stick to the syllabus.",
    "What can I say? I came into this class knowing virtually zero about Lincoln and left it with a new role model. I know some people might complain about the overwhelmingly positive rep Lincoln gets in this class. But Lincoln really was unusual as a moral reflective politician, and Bromwich and Smith don't see any reason to pretend otherwise. If you're willing to be open, you'll be impressed. The two complement each other very well; each brings his distinct personality and sensibility to the material, so you get two very different approaches to the material. It's good. The material itself, focussed mostly on Lincoln's own speeches and writings, is excellent. You'll get terrific insights into Lincoln's remarkable thought and personality as well as a good overview of the 1800's-Civil War period in the USA. It'll change the way you feel about yourself as an American and ground you again in what actually is or can\/could be special about this country. Well worth it.",
    "While I enjoyed reading and learning about Lincoln (particularly the McPherson), I think this course was poorly planned in a way that spoke to the amount of preparation the professors put in. Though both are clearly very knowledgeable, their lectures were often rather biased, and redundant. I would recommend it only for its investigation of an obviously worthy man, and its exposure of some of his less appealing policies (despite the lecturer's efforts to show only his best). If you're going to take the course, DO THE READING--both primary and secondary. It's undoubtedly the best part, and it's not worth taking for other reasons.",
    "If you think it would be valuable in and of itself to read all of the important speeches and letters Abraham Lincoln ever wrote, then you should take this class. Otherwise, realllly consider whether Bromwich's and Smith's lectures will keep you awake and engaged for an entire semester. If you find yourself browsing the internet during shopping period, I promise you that you will spend the entire later lectures checking your email, and your time would probably be better spent elsewhere. No one really understood why this was an English\/PoliSci cross-list, because it didn't really seem like either. That said, at the very end I do feel I have a very strong understanding of Lincoln (not his historical context), for whatever that's worth. Watch out for the final--the lectures topics are distributed ~90% Lincoln readings, 8% background, 2% secondary readings, but the final is 33% on each.",
    "Do you want to spend a semester studying the philosophy and history of one of America's greatest public figures? If yes, then there is no better class than this. Taught by two of Yale's finest minds, each with radically different views of Lincoln, no lecture is safely able to be missed. Can you top that?"
