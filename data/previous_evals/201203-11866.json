   "comments": [
    "This is a great fifth class. Only 4 essays throughout the semester.",
    "4 papers, lectures aren't really necessary, pretty chill class.",
    "This is a good class but not necessarily a gut. You do not need to go to the lectures to do well since there are only papers not any tests, but the papers are not graded easily.",
    "I would absolutely take this again. The material is completely interesting, sometimes disturbing and always relevant. Professor Trumpler has created a truly wonderful class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to fulfill an english requirement.",
    "Really, really interesting class. Has a reputation for being a gut, but if you don't treat it like one you'll get A LOT out of it. Half the class is hard core feminists, the other half are varsity athletes who facebook the entire lecture (if they even bother to show up).",
    "Take this class! It's really interesting, it allows you to develop a different kind of paper-writing skill, the issues it addresses are crucial and becoming even more so over time, the professor is excellent, and the workload is somewhat easy.",
    "I would especially if you want a relatively easy writing credit!",
    "Writing course not a gut.",
    "A very enjoyable course at Yale! Take it!",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is looking for an easy class or a chill 5th class. You don't really have to go to lecture, as long as you go to section. If you are't really interested in Women's Gender& Sexuality Studies don't take it because it isn't super engaging.",
    "Yes, yes. A very do-able course that you'll love and do well in. Don't go through Yale without taking this class.",
    "This class is great. Very easy, and only 4 papers 5 pages each that are actually pretty fun to write.",
    "Sure it's easy, but no. Don't take.",
    "Great fifth class. Essays are fun to write. Section is super entertaining. Probably one of the easiest classes at Yale though 4 papers is kind of a lot. No question, take this class.",
    "This class is fantastic! Absolutely take it! If you want it to be a gut, sure it can be, but if you go to lecture and put even a little effort in you will gain so much out of it. The professor is amazing and the optional activities are so worth taking advantage of! Definitely take it as a writing credit if you can. You're writing will improve and the papers are a lot of fun.",
    "Take this class if you're looking for a 5th class or a broad overview of women's gender studies. The material discussed is somewhat general, but I did end up learning a bunch of interesting things in lecture and through the readings. It's worth noting that the 4 paper assignments have nothing to do with the lecture topics.",
    "You learn about the roll of women in food production, consumption and preparation. It is eye opening. Also, you learn how to use different sources as the basis for essays and research. Pretty cool",
    "It's a broad survey of topics related to women, food, and culture. You won't come out of the course knowing facts, but you'll learn to think about things you'd otherwise probably not think about. Take a WGSS course before you graduate because learning how to think this way is very important. This would make a good 5th class.",
    "DON'T TAKE THIS COURSE. It's too dull to be a gut, it's boring to the extent that the papers take days longer than most interesting, albeit slightly harder classes. I would strongly discourage anyone from taking this class. The topics are irritating and it feels like a waste of time. Get something deeper from your Yale education.",
    "Good class, not too much work. Would recommend.",
    "YES YES YES. OMGEEEZ IZ THE BEST.",
    "4 papers and no test means section and no lecture. Make that move.",
    "Fantastic course! Everyone should take it! It will teach you to look at food in entirely new ways and introduce you to incredibly important issues in our current world with regard to food practices. The papers are fun and thought-provoking, plus Professor Trumpler is a great lecturer and overall wonderful resource for anything food-related!",
    "Pretty light workload but pretty useless. Almost feel worse off after taking it.",
    "Women, Food, and Culture is a great course for anyone who loves food and wants to learn more about women's involvement its production, preparation, and consumption. It's a really fun class that covers a wide range of topics regarding food.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for someone looking to get a pretty superficial overview of how women's relationship to food has changed over time. The lectures and readings are interesting (but you don't really have to go to lecture or do the readings). And the paper topics are fun!",
    "I would suggest it, but only if they were interested in the topics being covered.",
    "Yes. Brings up new and interesting points.",
    "Women, Food, and Culture was an interesting course that opened my mind up to new ideas about gender. The course spanned all the way back to neolithic communities and the history of agriculture, and then moved forward to issues of food today, including anorexia and shrimp-farming. I would recommend WFC because it covered interesting topics but was a very low-stress course. There was a manageable amount of reading every week with an associated reading response, and four papers in total. I actually really enjoyed writing the papers because the topics were fun and interesting.",
    "This is a great introductory lecture course. Professor Trumpler is a wonderful lecturer, and if you can get into a writing section, the papers are fulfilling assignments intellectually and connected well to the course. It is not a lot of work...definitely a \"fun\" class.",
    "yes its a pretty easy credit on an interesting subject",
    "Good class",
    "An easy WR class if you can manage to get into one of the writing sections. Only have four papers, none of which are based on anything from lecture so all you have to do is the reading responses for section and the papers.",
    "Go to section",
    "Great class. Not very much work, and the papers were pretty fun to write.",
    "Easy fifth class if you don't want to have to do much. The papers are kind of annoying, but section and lectures are easy going. A decent way to get a writing credit without having to take an English class.",
    "I would recommend it ONLY as a 5th class to complement a hard course load. This class is super gutty. The lectures have little to do with the four 5-page papers you will have to write for this class. Section was a bit more related, but discussion will really depend on who else is in your section. My section had a strange mix of athletes and people who are super into WGSS so discussion was a bit awkward at times. The readings were fairly short and actually somewhat interesting so I recommend doing the readings even if you don't got to lecture. I also took it as a writing credit, which didn't have a different workload from the regular sections. I think we were just graded a little harsher on writing style.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The workload is light, and the assignments are actually fun. You learn a lot about the relationship between women in food in general, but also view topics (i.e. \"not eating\") from an array of viewpoints, making even popularly discussed topics seem novel.",
    "Humans used to eat bark, and artisan cheese is made with non-pasteurized milk. There you go--that's everything you would have learned in this class. Now you don't have to take it! (unless you want a social science credit...)",
    "I would, its a good introductory course for wgss especially if you are unfamiliar with the major like myself.",
    "I would summarize the course as a class with a fascinating subject matter but a class that didn't involve a lot of work.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone looking for a creative writing credit. I took this class as an easy writing class, and it turned out to be a fun class. The workload is obviously much less than other classes, but grading can be harsh depending on your TA. The introductory lectures were very boring, but they soon became interesting, especially towards the end.",
    "Class is completely different whether you are taking a writing intensive section or not. Easy A if you do not take it with writing otherwise it really depends on your TA. Make sure you are willing to talk about feminist issues and be exposed to a extremely femininst point of view and expect to support it or your grade may suffer. If you do not feel this way 95% of the work for this class will be a struggle.",
    "Take this class as a senior. You'll really enjoy the assignments.",
    "I loved this course. I am an engineering major and will probably never take another WGSS class but I loved having this introduction to the field of gender studies. Every class felt like a master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tea on a really interesting subject; either Prof. Trumpler was talking about a really interesting aspect of women, food, and culture that I had never thought about, or we had a guest speaker (such as Mary Miller or Claire from Claire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s!). There were no midterms and no final exam, so I could really just enjoy each lecture. A lot of people chose not to come to lecture because they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t responsible for the material, but I came because I thought it was so interesting! The four papers were easy and fun to write. I would really recommend this class \u00e2\u0080\u0093 easy and interesting writing credit!",
    "I would definitely recommend thisclass, especially if you have never before taken a WGSS course at Yale. Take it for a WR credit; its writing assignments will challenge you as a writer and encourage your utilization of the wonderful resources Yale has to offer.",
    "Easy writing credit, but the most boring class I have ever taken in my life. Although it was nice not having to go to lecture, because your grade consists of 4 essays (5 pages each) and your section grade which is about the readings, not lecture.",
    "Good.",
    "Definitely take it. Great class if you like discussing food, your mom, and the places you come from.",
    "Be warned that this is not the same gut it was once rumored to be! All my friends took this class the previous two years and said it was the easiest A ever. From what I've heard, this year the TAs decided to be tougher, and a lot of people got Bs on the papers. Who knows what the final grades will look like, but it is definitely frustrating that for me this class grade will probably end up being lower than the other much more difficult classes I had this semester. Not having to go to lecture is awesome, and you totally don't have to since you're not tested on any material at all. Some lectures are fairly interesting though, just to sit in on. Papers seemed ok but were kind of a pain to write, and the grading was very frustrating (depending on TA). I'll be a bit warier of \"guts\" from here on out though. Section wasn't bad at all (at least mine wasn't, I took it not for writing credit - heard the writing sections were not as fun).",
    "For a gut, it's a lot of work. Four essays (which were kind of a pain to write, except the last one which was fun), and weekly section assignments. If you're looking for a super chill 5th class, don't take this one. That being said, the material is actually incredibly interesting, so if you're willing to put in a little extra effort, you can learn a lot from this class!",
    "I would recommend this class. The paper topics are interesting and the sections are engaging.",
    "Great class. Easy to do well if you work hard on the papers and participate in section, though this does depend on whom your TF is. Lectures are really interesting, and you learn a lot just from listening to Professor Trumpler.",
    "Creative writing course.",
    "Looks at women, food, and culture in a feminist light. I would recommend it because it's interesting and it's a fairly easy writing credit.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class. It was very interesting and discussed topics that I had never previously thought about.",
    "Would recommend to others",
    "The class is comprehensive and encompasses everything from farming to the food pyramid; there is lot of variability which allows for anyone to find a topic in which they are interested. Additionally, because they essay topics are not related to the lecture topics there is room for variability in written assignments as well.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it! You will enjoy it and be interested by every single lecture and reading. It is not too challenging or pressurized, but you still walk away from the course having learned a lot.",
    "The class attempts to cover too much, and the paper assignments are not well constructed. The class's reputation as a \"gut\" means that it is very large and filled with students who don't really care about women OR food.",
    "Professor Trumpler is an amazing lecturer and incredibly nice. You will learn so much in this class without needing to put in crazy amounts of work. I'd take it just for her lectures. And section was fun. Definitely take this class!",
    "Yes. This class is very interesting and fun to be a part of.",
    "Would recommend. However, a few warnings. Lecture and section are almost completely divorced from each other. That being said, don't skip the lectures, as some are very interesting. However, I didn't walk away from the class with a very different outlook on life, since many topics are very much glossed over. You won't get much out the WR sections (although it may also depend on your TA) because each paper is extremely different and feedback is not given until after the papers are submitted.",
    "Very different from a standard class, interesting to try as something completely different to the rest of your schedule",
    "GREAT! TAKE IT ONLY IF YOU HAVE A GOOD TA",
    "I would recommend it if you're looking for a relatively easy class and if you're genuinely passionate about agriculture, food production, and gender studies relating to these topics.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the course material. Fun class, but depends on your TA."
