    "I gained a lot of insight into Spanish language and culture, and really was able to improve my grammar and speaking ability.",
    "This courses genuinely helped me improve my ability to speak Spanish and carry on unscripted conversations; it also helped me gain insight into the culture surrounding the language. It was super helpful in increasing my confidence while speaking the language.",
    "i developed knowledge of grammar, vocabulary, listening, speaking and writing skills, and culture, history, and art in Latin America."

   "comments": [
    "I think that the course does a really good job of presenting a variety of materials with which to engage in multiple different formats so lots of different learning styles are covered. I wish that there was more agency for the professors to do what they want, because it seemed very constrained by the Powerpoint. Also, Supersite was more busywork than actually useful exercises, and was a very large and unavoidable cost.",
    "I think the online homework assignments became very tedious at points because it repeated material we already learn and the website was very picky with the answers, so it felt less like I was learning something new and more of having to do a certain assignment.",
    "The course was super engaging and I absolutely love the professor; she was always super easy to get into touch with and explained things very well. I never thought there was an overwhelming amount of homework. The only weakness of the course that I can think of is that the online homework seemed to be a bit unnecessary at time (and also incorrect in that it would take points off for things that weren't really mistakes) but this is specific to the course as a whole and not just the professor.",
    "strengths of the course are all the practice that we get in class and out, along with the willingness of the professor to take student feedback. it was well organized and i liked that every activity could be viewed in the course planner. another strength is that the way the class is taught allows students to talk with one another and understand different points of view in another language. also great feedback from the professor that allowed me to gear my learning toward things i needed the most improvement on. it could be improved by posting notes rather than power points."

    "I would recommend this course if it was taught by Professor Baffi! She is a very caring instructor who really tries to engage in her students' lives and cares about students as people.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their ability to speak Spanish; it's incredibly helpful and informative!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is struggling with speaking spanish. It helped my speaking skills improve drastically and I'm really glad I chose to take the course. It was manageable even after being out of a spanish class for over a year."
