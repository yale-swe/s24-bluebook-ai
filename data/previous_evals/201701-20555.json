   "comments": [
    "Taught me to think about the issues behind the scenes and look at things from a different perspective.",
    "An understanding and ability to apply the policy process.",
    "This course is a real hidden gem at Yale. In fact, it's been absolutely life changing. Even though the course is ostensibly about the plants and animals in Yellowstone, it's really not. It's so much more. Professor Clark teaches you to think about the world and about life. She challenges you to deconstruct your thought processes and your inherent biases and to put yourself back together in an interdisciplinary way. I am a more fulfilled person as a direct result of this course. The best course I've taken, hands down.",
    "This was a wild class. It is very much like EVST\/Political Science\/Philosophy\/something else entirely. There's nothing else like it offered at Yale. Early on it's very hard to understand what the class is about, but your sense of this develops as the class progresses. It teaches you to think broadly about how you conceive of problems and goals. It makes you think about the way that your own experiences shape the way you approach and judge issues. You learn how to approach issues more comprehensively, critically, effectively, and empathetically.",
    "I learnt a lot about policy making and was given concrete tools with which to identify and classify stakeholders goals, views, and actions. I also learnt how to give a good presentation, and write a proper research paper. This class taught me about philosophy, natural resource management, and epistemology. I was lead to question my own perception of the world, the values I held deep, and the way in which my standpoint affected how I studied and partook in the world around me. I've become much more confident in my ability to ask valuable questions, and have meaningful conversations as a result of this course. The trip to Yellowstone gave me a life experience that will most certainly stick with me and gave me exposure to people who thought differently than me, people who had invaluable lessons to give surrounding professionalism and facilitating complex relationships, and people who were doing things that they loved and really making a difference. I left this class with an abundance of knowledge about my chosen final research topic, lessons about policy and professionalism, creative inspiration, and a better understanding of myself.",
    "I learned how to understand the creation of environmental policy based on the standpoints and values of the relevant constituents, and I had the opportunity to see how Yellowstone National Park is managed and what environmental and political challenges the park faces."

   "comments": [
    "The trip is an amazing experience and really helps solidify some concepts discussed in class.",
    "The greatest strength of the course is that it's a truly immersive experience. You will be a changed person by the end of it if you give 100% to it. One of the only classes at Yale that teaches you how to think about the world and about life in an interdisciplinary way. One of the only courses that teaches you an interactive, interdisciplinary problem solving process to make a real impact. The all expenses paid trip to Yellowstone is a once in a lifetime experience and make the most of your instructors and classmates - Professor Clark, the TA, and your classmates are all wonderful, lovely people.",
    "This is a fresh, interesting, engaging class that teaches you things you would never learn in another class. If you have a good, fun class it is incredibly enjoyable, but I could totally see how this could affect the class dynamic\/experience if classmates were not so outgoing. It's unclear throughout the course of the class how explicitly we were supposed to be using the policy sciences to address these issues, and how much we could just use them as loose guidelines. A lot of the class was spent in awkward\/fun\/good-natured confusion.",
    "The trip to Yellowstone absolutely makes this class. It is so amazing to talk in the classroom about issues and important people in the Yellowstone arena and then go meet with them and interact with them on a personal level. The mental change in perspective this incites is something that can only be gained by the hands-on learning and real life experience afforded by this trip. I also think the way in which this class successfully integrates aspects of other disciplines into its study of Yellowstone and policy make it unique, invaluable, and durable. This is a class that not only furthers your academic career but teaches you about life. That being said I wish that the classes that occurred before the trip were more seminar based. I also think that the time spent on overarching presentations about Yellowstone towards the beginning of the semester could be condensed to make more space for time to discuss readings. I thought the readings we did were motivating and engaging, but we lacked time to discuss them, and that led me sometimes to feel that the effort I was putting into finishing the large amount of reading was often unrewarding\/irrelevant.",
    "Susan pushed me to think about the policy process in a new way and consider my own standpoint and interest in conservation more thoughtfully. Josh was an incredible TA who pushed discussions forward and brought the class together. The trip was an invaluable hands-on learning experience."

    "This is the best course I have taken at Yale. You will learn some facts, but you will also learn a lot about how people think and act in regards to nature and the environment. You will gain insight into the 'why?' and you will be able to apply the thought process to other classes and adult life. This class uses Yellowstone as a case study, but you do not need a background in Yellowstone. There is an application to get in, BUT IT IS WORTH IT. Susan is great and untraditional. Learning is done through conversations and interactions within the class rather than by drilling readings and information into your head. Susan knows a tremendous amount about Yellowstone and is willing to meet and discuss anything. She is a wealth of knowledge and this course is a true gem. If you've read this far, apply and go to class. you wont regret it.",
    "This is a very unique class. It basically uses Yellowstone as a case study in how we understand complex policy challenges and how to make the best possible decisions. It isn't a typical environmental studies class, but a combination of a bunch of different fields of study. It can be a little overwhelming at the beginning trying to understand all of the policy process material being introduced, but by the end of the semester you will have a good grasp on it. This class also does a lot of philosophical thinking about what is nature and how are we connected to it. The field trip is far and away the best Yale experience I've had, definitely make the most of this opportunity. A great class to mix up your schedule and gain a different way of looking at problems. The lessons can be applied to any part of the real world.",
    "AAAAAA --- okay, this should be near the top of an alphabetized list of reviews. Anyway, the class was absolutely fantastic! Try your hardest to keep a flexible spring break, because the field trip is outstanding! I really loved this class and have good bonds with my classmates. This has been one of my favorite classes ever at Yale, and I have taken eight semesters' worth of classes. Please take it. It also helps you become an organized and philosphical thinker.",
    "Yes take it. It is a fun course that makes you think about things in a way you may not be used to. Also, the trip is awesome and you should definitely go if you can",
    "Take this class for the Yellowstone Field Trip over spring break - otherwise, it's not worth it.",
    "Take this course!!! I can't recommend it strongly enough. It's a once in a lifetime experience, do it or else you'll regret it. I don't know where I'd be if I didn't take this course!",
    "This was a pretty wild class. It is very much like EVST\/Political Science\/Philosophy\/something else entirely. There's nothing else like it offered at Yale. Early on it's very hard to understand what the class is about, but your sense of this develops as the class progresses. It teaches you to think broadly about how you conceive of problems and goals. It makes you think about the way that your own experiences shape the way you approach and judge issues. You learn how to approach issues more comprehensively, critically, effectively, and empathetically. There are no other professors at Yale like Professor Clark. She purposefully approaches teaching in a different way. This can be difficult because there's no easy way to acclimate to it. She asks hard, pointed, sometimes personal, often slightly uncomfortable questions. Her teaching style is not for everyone and can be offputting. That being said, if you stick around and try hard and push back on the things she says you learn a lot and have a lot of fun. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This class is a class more about life and less about Yellowstone. If you are interested in learning a lot about the history of Yellowstone be forewarned that that is not the main focus of this class. This class will give you an extremely deep understanding of the current contentious management issues in Yellowstone by way of the amazing field trip, along with some serious lessons on how people work and how to live your life. Though issues in Yellowstone are used to sort through ideas of the policy sciences, a lot of the readings done for classes are about philosophy and psychology. You will be asked to sort through the various positions on bison management and wolf depredation in Yellowstone. You will also be asked to answer the question 'what is the meaning of life?'. That being said, this class gives you so much more by virtue of being a class that is more than a surface level survey of America's first national park. The field trip furnished me with lessons that will stick with me for my entire life, and afforded once in a lifetime experiences to meet with wildlife experts, as well as to spend time interacting and engaging with locals in Montana and Wyoming. Professor Clark can be hard to understand sometimes and is often confusing, but the questions she asks are important, and the way she pushes conventional ideas of learning, progress, and policy are mind opening. This class creates a unique environment in which you get to know ALL of your classmates extremely well and create a real community---something that is so rare at Yale. You are forced to learn a lot about the world, along with a lot about the way you think and your self. If you are not completely turned off by Prof Clark teaching style, stick with this class. It is most definitely worth it. It will teach you many lessons that will last far belong the classroom.",
    "An unorthodox and incredible course. The class has an informal vibe and pushed me think about environmental policy in a completely new way. The field trip is an amazing time, and the class vibe created a really cool community. The focus is on policy, not scientific or ecological concepts."
