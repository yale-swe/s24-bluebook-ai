    "I would not recommend this class unless you are very interested in the technical aspect of music. All you learn in this class is how to memorize scales. The homework is just repetitively rewriting variations of scales and chords over and over - it's incredibly time consuming. The good thing is that, even though there is a lot of ear training, Prof Raz doesn't let it affect your grade too much if your ear isn't that great. Also, the book work isn't necessary to read because she pretty much goes over everything in the homework in class.",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. If you want to understand the basics of Music, this is really the way to do it. Youtube videos, worksheets, class discussions, powerpoints, and practice practice practice are the bulk of this straightforward class. No surprises here.",
    "A great introductory class if you've had little or no exposure to music theory. If you've been singing or playing an instrument for awhile and are looking for a challenge, take 205 or 210.",
    "Great class to take for someone with no background. I took it to take higher level music theory and lessons for credit later on"
