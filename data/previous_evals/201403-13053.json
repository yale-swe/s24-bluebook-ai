   "comments": [
    "If Neeman it teaching this class I would probably not recommend it. The class is mostly him reading proofs out of the textbook. However, the tests are mostly computational problems that have often little bearing to what was done in class and are worded incredibly poorly. His few lectures from his own notes are very interesting and he is a very smart guy. Psets were not bad, but you are probably just as well off taking 121.",
    "You better be into theory because it really is just about the theory. Proving things we accepted in intro courses so we can have a clear conscience and then slowly forget how we proved them.",
    "If you're some kind of economics major who likes math or is considering graduate school in economics, take this course.",
    "A very weird course. The class and problem sets don't really prepare you for the final. The review sessions sort of gave me an idea of what might be on the test, and everyone was on their own to prepare for the final. Problem sets were only graded on effort. Lots of smart people in the class. Curve was generous. If Neeman isn't teaching the course though, this might all change. Awkward, because testing on the theory would be very difficult. Although the questions on the test probably would be easy if you had seen them before, they were never covered in the problem sets. I looked at the problem sets for Econ 121, and their problem set questions looked like our test questions. That being said, it was really interesting to see microeconomics built from an entirely theoretical framework. Gives you a good background for how you can use mathematics to build microeconomic theory, building up from axioms and using deductive reasoning to make conclusions. Gives you a good idea as to how they treat the material in graduate school. The problem sets were very challenging, but only graded on effort.",
    "Take it if you're looking to major in math and econ or econ and like math.",
    "YES, YES, YES, TAKE THIS CLASS. IT IS THE BEST CLASS AT YALE. I was a bit scared coming in, having read past evaluations, but this class is awesome. It does need some mathamatical reasoning, but I didn't come in with a very intensive math background and was fine. The problem sets are graded pass\/fail; the midterm was computationally tough but grading was lenient, especially for computational errors. The final was mathamatically much easier, and actually a really fun exam to write. The Professor is great at explaining stuff, and the TA is awesome. The class follows the textbook quite closely, which is good because you can focus on understanding the lectures and not on taking notes. The curve's a bit steep becasuse everyone's smart, but it's set as leniently as is permitted and I think no one got below a B on the mid term. The material is SO interesting, and I love econ so much more now.",
    "I don't think Zvika is teaching this course anymore, so most of my feedback is not relevant to you, prospective ECON 125 student. I would say, however, that the class is extremely self-selecting no matter the professor. Yet it is graded in the same way that the standard intermediate course is graded. This makes it MUCH more difficult to earn an A-range grade, since you're competing against 20 other students (all of whom are very good at micro) rather than 120 other students (some of whom are EP&E majors who are not great at math). The material itself is interesting enough, but micro isn't really my thing.",
    "If you are very interested in the theory behind econ, with very little applications, take this course. I would also recommend that you have a very strong background in math (especially proofs).",
    "This was a hard class with a lot of mathematical proofs on the homeworks, but the exams seemed similar to intermediate micro in style.",
    "If you LOVE theory and proofs, take it. I chose this course because I like math a lot and wanted to understand the math behind economics, but I was a little disappointed. The textbook is not good, the instructions was fair at best, and the proofs were just plain hard to follow. I kind of wish I took the application based intermediate economics course, since I hear it is still quite a challenge. As of now, I am afraid I don't have the basic application-based skills to progress down the economics road because this theory class did not give me enough practice.",
    "ECON 125 is an intensive look at consumer and firm theory. It is absolutely a class in which one will need to put in much time to even begin to understand the topics taught in class. It is nevertheless really rewarding to begin to develop the ability to think about the complicated assumptions and theories that make up the study of economics.",
    "I found this to be a solid course. If youre interested in seeing microeconomic theory developed from its foundations from a mathematical perspective, I would recommend it.",
    "If the student was thinking about an economics major or were interested in microeconomics and had a background in real analysis, I would recommend this course.",
    "This course is best with a decent math background; it basically takes general ideas from introductory microeconomics and puts them on solid mathematical footing, in the process introducing actual quantitative tools to use to work with economics problems."
