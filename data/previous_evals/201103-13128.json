   "comments": [
    "There is a lot of work involved; but, if you really care about getting to know the language or the author better, this should be the course for you. You can expect that the class will attract the brightest students in the classics department, leading to very rewarding classroom discussions. I would recommend the class to anyone, whether you need a language credit or not.",
    "My feelings about this class are somewhat mixed. I really liked a lot of the readings, but discussion often seemed to drag. If you're looking into it, be prepared for some very lewd poems too--let's just say I learned a lot of Latin vocabulary that I never expected to pick up!",
    "Latin 431 was a stretch for me to take, but throughout the course I improved my translation abilities greatly. I don't know that I would recommend it to somebody who didn't have significant experience in Latin, though. It was by far my hardest class and I had a 5 on the AP exam coming in.",
    "Probably really fun if you're a Classics major, less so if you're just trying to get that language rec. At least Catullus is usually fun to read.",
    "This course was pleasant, as is the material. Watch out for high enrollments. Also recommended if you are interested in learning more about commentaries on Latin texts. Professor Peirano is wonderful to work with.",
    "Catullus is great, and Professor Peirano is fantastic. Definitely take this or any other Latin class with her if you get the chance."
