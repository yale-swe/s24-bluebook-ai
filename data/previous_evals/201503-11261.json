    "A great course for anyone who is looking to be more socially aware. ANTH333 touches on a lot of cultural issues and how language complicates our lives, which I think is a good outlook for any student in today's globalizing world to have. I would recommend ANTH333 to another student, but I might actually suggest you take it pass\/fail if you can help it because it's really up in the air on how you're being graded.",
    "Yes! I would highly recommend you start the class with a clear topic for the independent research project (which constitutes 70% of your grade).",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The class allows you to take a research idea related to bilingualism and really flesh it out in a research paper. The seminar readings are very interesting and Errington knows how to guide the class to make it an enjoyable experience for all students.",
    "Very cool class- learned a lot, especially from the other students' presentations. The class is structured around one paper\/project that you work on the whole semester (ideally). really think carefully about your project, because you'll be putting a lot of time into it. can be a lot of fun if you already have a topic in bilingualism that you're really excited about. the only assignments were a midterm presentation and a final paper -- so very light.",
    "I would. You learn so much about bilingualism and anthropology through this class. Keep in mind that the final paper makes or breaks your grade, however, and that may be a turn off to some people.",
    "This course is a good way to learn about language use. The readings are interesting for the most part and the class discussions are well guided. The course also allows you to research a particular topic that interests you.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class if you are interesting in the politics of language and in having a conversation with your peers that goes beyond linguistic theory."
