   "comments": [
    "We continued to learn vocabulary and grammar while also developing speaking, reading, and writing skills.",
    "Furthered my ability to communicate and write in Arabic. Expanded my vocabulary significant.",
    "A great continuation of MSA with a focus on reading authentic texts, learning grammar, and perfecting vocabulary. I also loved the presentations!",
    "I was extremely impressed with the quality of teaching we received from Prof. Bousty. Throughout the year, it was very apparent that he knew his material extremely well and explained the concepts in a super engaging and accessible manner. He worked tirelessly to ensure that we all understood the intricate details veiled under the Arabic language. What makes him stand out from any other teacher I have had at Yale was that he was more than a teacher to all of us and filled the role of a personal mentor as well. Even when he was forced to be abroad to help coordinate the summer programme, he ensured that we compensated the missed material via skype.",
    "I improved my arabic skills through this class this course was almost entirely taught in arabic and it was highly valuable to be exposed to the language every day."

   "comments": [
    "I like the overall structure of this course--the textbook is good, and there are lots of good in-class activities. The weekly presentation of news articles was an especially great way to practice reading comprehension and conversation. I also think that my speaking skills improved dramatically through the emphasis on class discussion. The main drawback, however, was the amount of class that was cancelled--we only got through about 3.5 chapters out of the 5 that we were supposed to cover.",
    "It is fantastic!",
    "Less is more. The number of small assignments, videos, journal entries, daily presentations, and so on was at times overwhelming. The sheer number and frequency of small activities I think prevented students from getting meaningful gains from any one activity. I would have liked to have less busy work and more time to just sit with an Arabic text and try to understand it. A strength of the class is Professor ElBousty and the use of class time for practice listening and speaking. Class was enjoyable.",
    "Mr Bousty remains to be the best Arabic teacher I have ever had even after having lived in several Arab countries. His mastery over the language is unbelievable and there was not even one morning where he delivered the material without being extremely passionate about it. He is very flexible with the content taught and it is apparent that his priority from day 1 was that we understood the material clearly, rather than brushing over the concepts swiftly. Right from the beginning of the year, he gave us a schedule which contained a rough guide of the material we will be covering on a daily basis which helped us prepare for classes accordingly, but even then he never followed it prophetically and made sure we understood the concepts in hand before moving on. Apart from the textbook, he gave us numerous charts and visual aides to help us better understand the material in hand.",
    "This class is very strong and is taught based on the textbook al-kitab 2. I think it is taught excellently and there is not much room for improvement. The course deals with the challenge that Arabic L4 is filled with students of many different knowledge levels and experiences, and Elbousty does an excellent job making sure many different students are learning at once."

    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to improve speaking and reading skills.",
    "Great course to continue learning Arabic with.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend any Arabic course taught by Mr Bousty. This course specifically gives you a great grasp over the Arabic language and you will leave it being able to handle a decent Arabic conversation with a native speaker. You learn a variety of important vocab and nearly all the necessary grammar you will need in Arabic. All of it is taught in a very engaging manner by Me Bousty!",
    "I would recommend this class to any student serious about learning arabic. Because the requirement for graduation ends after L3, this course is filled with students who are devoted to learning the language and enganging with the language. It is very difficult, but also very beneficial and very rewarding."
