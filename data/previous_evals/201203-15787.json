    "If you already have experience with spanish, this class will be pretty easy. If you want to learn the language, you don't have many other options though...",
    "Demand an intensive section if you think you're a quick language learner! I didn't, and felt stuck. But regardless, the class is a hoot and not demanding and Portuguese is a gorgeous (and sometimes hilarious) language.",
    "A good language to take. This language can be a challenge to pick up at first, but by the end of the semester you will be able to speak basic Portuguese.",
    "Portuguese 110 is one of the easiest courses you will take at Yale, which was unfortunate, because I think intro language courses need to be challenging in order to be useful. The atmosphere in class was lively and fun, and Marta is quite a character. There is very little homework and the tests are super easy. Because of this, unless you are a real self-starter, you may have trouble actually motivating yourself to learn the material. Particularly if you have taken Spanish before, you can probably get by without studying much at all. If you want an easy course, this is for you. If you want to actually learn to speak and read Portuguese well, you may want to hire a tutor.",
    "I would definitely take it again. It was a fantastic course and my professor, Nathalia Jabur, was amazing!",
    "You learn the basics.",
    "Portuguese is fun! It's not a terribly demanding class, but you do learn a lot.",
    "Yes."
