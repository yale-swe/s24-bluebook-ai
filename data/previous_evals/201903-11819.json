    "I learned how to speak Spanish.",
    "I learned more about the Spanish language, grammar, literature, culture, and vocabulary.",
    "I improved my ability to speak Spanish with more confidence and fluency, including more varied and specific vocabulary and verb tenses. I learned about the culture of the Spanish-speaking world and about regional differences in the Spanish language.",
    "I feel a lot more confident with my speaking skills. It was something that I didn't really practice in high school, but that I definitely wanted to improve on. I also loved the strong cultural immersion aspect of the class."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: passionate teacher who is well engages, relevant activities to further understanding Weaknesses: Online VHL homework was strenuous and unhelpful",
    "This course is very demanding and the structure is very rigid. This makes for little flexibility when it comes to reviewing things students find difficult. On the other hand, this is also good because students finish the course with a very specific skill set.",
    "There could be a study guide for tests.",
    "The strengths of the course include a wide array of vocabulary, grammar tenses, and class activities. However, the class does tend to move fairly quickly through vocabulary and grammar tenses.",
    "The use of the textbook does not improve the quality of the course. Besides the exercises at the ends of chapters I rarely if ever looked at the book itself. Its very expensive, so if the course could be adapted to include similar exercises without necessitating the purchase of the book that would be great. Strengths of this course included its interactive design, with presentations and roleplay activities that facilitated engagement.",
    "Even more presentation speaking opportunities or activities like El Juicio could be good. Overall, the class was very good. More tries on the online textbook activities could be helpful."

    "Yes, gives a good grasp of language if you utilize the skills acquired through this course",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is subjective though because most students who choose Spanish as their language would have to take this course.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone interested in learning Spanish.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn more Spanish. It provides you with more knowledge about vocabulary, grammar, and culture.",
    "I would! I think I personally would have had more ~intellectual challenge~ in Span130, but I still felt like I learned a lot from practicing every day and in following a well-designed and engaging curriculum.",
    "Yes; very helpful in refreshing my skills and fluidity of language production."
