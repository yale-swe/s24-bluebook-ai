    "A investigation into certain aspects of Arabic culture including politics, political speeches, poetry, comedy, and current events. It interweaves many of these topics in an interesting way. For instance, we listened to Osama Bin Laden's speeches and analyzed them as poetic and ideological expression mixed together.",
    "If the professor is Hala Nassar, expect an intense, but brief weekly meeting. She is high-energy but really fun, if you can stick up for yourself. This course isn't a great course standing alone, because it does not meet frequently enough and so you forget your Arabic. I would recommend it for people who are serious about improving their listening and speaking abiities (in aamiya and fusha) and are willing to put in some effort, and preferably are doing other Arabic activities at the same time.",
    "YES. Take anything with Hala Nassar if you're ready for a healthy challenge",
    "I loved Hala. Her class is intense, but probably the most enlightening arabic course i have taken. She consistently strived to improve our pronunciation, reading, and writing skills. She is an amazing instructor and will literally stick by you until the very end, with whatever you are having difficulties. I definitely recommend her course to anyone who is interested."
