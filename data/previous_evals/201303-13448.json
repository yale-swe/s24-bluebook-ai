    "If you love Psycho take this class!",
    "A lot of reading, but it is a lit class so it is to be expected. I really enjoyed the variety in films and literature we read. The discussions were super chill as well. There was opportunity to lead the discussion where we wanted as a class, but it never went so off topic that it became annoying. Overall, a pretty good class.",
    "Uncanny was a fascinating class that covers a huge breadth of really amazing literature, and some very interesting film. In this iteration of the class, the film was a smaller part of the overall material, but the section on American Horror Story and the conversation with the lead writer of the show were definite highlights. The discussions were very free-form, which was sometimes good, but occasionally left me feeling like we hadn't gotten deep enough into talking about a book or film.",
    "This class is fairly mild and enjoyable. The books are films we read and watched were really interesting. I wouldn't say that anything we saw was actually 'scary,' so don't be deterred if you don't like horror movies. Pretty light workload-just two essays and 'group projects' which for our section ended up being just preparing discussion questions. If you like American Horror Story the class is awesome-you get to skype with one of the creators.Lectures can be slow occasionally, especially when it's obvious that no one's done the reading.But generally it's a great, fun class. Take it if you don't mind reading Freud with a grain of salt.",
