    "Really good class for people who can read treble and bass clefs and know the basic types of scales and chords (i.e. if you've taken 110 you're set). Kevin Koai is an awesome professor - I've never taken a class where I've done so little work yet learned so much. Really chill, really flexible, and runs an engaging and interesting course. It's good to shop a lot of sections because each professor tailors the emphasis of the course to his\/the class's interests (Kevin focused a lot on dictation and ear training, as opposed to, say, counterpoint and composition.)",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in music. Even if you don't intend to take other theory classes, it will help you appreciate music in a new way.",
    "If you are interested in composition or in majoring in Music, this class is a must. If you are simply a musician looking to improve your musicianship skills, this class will definitely be interesting and will help you to be more knowledgeable about the music you are playing (which is always good), but I don't imagine it will improve your musicianship skills nearly as much as the Musicianship courses or private lessons.",
    "It's a really good course if you aren't sure about moving on with the more advanced stuff, but you still want to learn a good deal about music.",
    "Music 205 was a really interesting course, and Kevin was an absolutely amazing TA! Take it.",
    "A wonderful high level introduction to understanding music from the chord to the sonata level. No composition is done, but I left feeling I really understanding the basic mechanics of music on a large scale."
