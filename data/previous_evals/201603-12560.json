   "comments": [
    "I gained an introduction to the language and literature of Anglo-Saxon England.",
    "I developed a better appreciation for Old English prose and poetry in addition to learning about grammar and vocabulary. The selections were both entertaining and heartbreaking-- the Wanderer and the Wife's Lament in particular.",
    "The course systematically builds knowledge of Old English as a language, and incorporates elements of the study of Old English poetry and Anglo-Saxon history as it goes. The focus on translation helps with the building of knowledge and vocabulary; Roberta's patient approach allows students to spend what time they need building their language skills.",
    "This course was amazing. I learned to read Old English comfortably (more so than any other language I'd learned from scratch before). I also found afterwards that the course has actually improved my ability to retain vocabulary and grammatical constructions while studying other languages.",
    "I gained a new language which was an incredible opportunity. Due to this new skill set, an entire fresh body of literary work has been made open to me. I thoroughly enjoyed and connected to Anglo-Saxon poetry and hope to incorporate my new knowledge in my future teaching."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The early part of the course on grammar was especially effective in preparing me to read and translate Old English. By the end of the course, I was surprised by how much I'd progressed. I wish the translation assignments had been supplemented by vocabulary and grammar lists, exercises, or worksheets. It was difficult to anticipate which words were important to learn\/memorize and which appeared only once in the Old English corpus. It felt impossible to learn every single word that appeared in the assigned texts, but it also wasn't obvious to me which words were most important to learn.",
    "The course is excellent, it engages students with the language and at the same time gives back ground and historical context to the text being read. If anything, the course could benefit from more homework or memorization of grammar patterns to really make the language sink in. However, in it's current form, the course is still excellent.",
    "Although I may be alone on this account, I would prefer to have more frequent quizzes on the material.",
    "The strengths of the course are in the gradual way in which the texts and Roberta's instruction introduce concepts, vocabulary, and information regarding Old English literature. By reviewing our earlier translations in detail, we were able to gain knowledge of the language; by reviewing later translations we additionally gained insight into the conventions of Old English poetry. I think it is important to emphasize to students how crucial the class readings are; perhaps ensuring that the class has an opportunity to ask questions about the language concepts introduced in the Baker earlier on would more fully ensure all students were on the same page, though Roberta took care to ascertain that this was the case. The building of vocabulary might also be improved through a few quizzes (whether graded or not), as the \"click and define\" online Baker can prove too much of a temptation, making it hard for vocabulary to stick! Though evaluation makes people nervous, more regular review of vocabulary could be helpful, I feel.",
    "The strengths: It's impossible to over-emphasize the benefits of this course. It presents a wonderful and inclusive overview of what the extant Anglo-Saxon texts have to offer, and Professor Frank does a singularly spectacular job of making the material both accessible and fascinating. Class discussions were very friendly and insightful, and the structure of each class, where we would take turns translating around the table, ensured everyone would have a chance to read aloud\/translate. Potential points for improvement: Weekly vocabulary quizzes would have helped me (or perhaps weekly reminders of what vocab words to look out for). I think more regular reminders about AS culture and history, even 5-10 minutes at the start of every second class or something like that, would also have been helpful.",
    "Strengths: gaining a new language skill is one of the greatest strengths of this course followed quickly by the exposure to poetry and prose that has not been accessible to me before. Weaknesses: I think more time could be spent on the language basics. At times, it felt like we were rushing through translations without a true firm footing in the language foundation. I personally wish that we could add one additional hour a week to the course as I think the issue is a lack of time to cover the material in the appropriate depth."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! This course is a great deal of fun.",
    "Yes, I certainly would. There is much to be learned from the content of Old English literature, including developing insights into modern English and way in which grammar can shift considerably overtime.",
    "Roberta provides a wonderful introduction to Old English, and I would recommend this course to both people interested in the period and those who simply wish to get a taste of earlier English literature; I would certainly recommend that they take both parts of the course together.",
    "I can't recommend this course highly enough. Old English was, for me, a slightly easier language to learn than others I've studied, because it's similar to modern English in many respects. That said, one also has to put in alot of work on one's own to pick up the vocabulary and acquire a better grasp of the relevant texts -- especially toward the second half of the semester -- since many of them were translated only once in class. All in all, I can't imagine a better introduction to OE than this.",
    "Yes! I thoroughly enjoyed this course and think it is critical for teachers of English Literature. Even though it is a language course, it is so much more! The exposure to Old English poetry and prose opened a new realm for me, one that I hope to pass on to my future students."
