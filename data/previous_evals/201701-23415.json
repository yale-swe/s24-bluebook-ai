    "This was one of my favorite courses that I have taken at YSPH. The small class format made it easy to discuss the critical issues at hand, which was essential for this particular topic. Further, the development of a research proposal is a very useful skill to have, particularly in this field. The content of the course also varied from sampling methods to use in conflict to health diplomacy and gender-based violence. Overall, I would recommend this course to any student across the university who is interested in this topic.",
    "Great class! Good feedback in a small class. Great visiting lecturers. Interesting subject where there isn't a lot of coverage at Yale.",
    "Awesome course - I wish more non-public health students would take it.",
    "This course was a great introduction to the chaos that is public health in violent conflict. Topics are interesting and guest speakers are incredible.",
    "The course was a great way to explore how conflict affects health, there were many interesting speakers from the field and Dr. Khoshnood is very knowledgeable about the subject. I think the course could have been improved by making it a bit more structured, I feel sometimes we came up with questions beforehand about the readings but we didn't end up discussing the readings too much.",
    "strengths: seminar style of the course weakness: reading reflections (don't really think it adds much value to the course...feels like busy work)"

    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh is an incredible professor. He brings a wealth of knowledge and passion on the intersection of conflict and health. He is also very happy to help students succeed outside of the classroom by recommending internships, jobs, lectures, etc.. Kaveh also has many connections with professionals and academics in this field. He brings these colleagues to the classroom through Skype or in-person visits, to really provide a comprehensive understanding of conflict and health.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Great attentitiveness and personal attention to students. Thank you for a wonderful semester!",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0This was my favorite course mostly because of Kaveh's enthusiasm and knowledge for the subject matter.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Dr. Khoshnood was an excellent professor, he is very knowledgeable about the topics and knows many talented individuals in the field, some of which spoke to us. It would be helpful if Dr. Khoshnood provided more critical feedback about the research proposal.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Awesome! Hands down one of my favorite professors at YSPH. He genuinely cares about his students (both academically and personally), and he also really cares about the plight of refugees and other marginalized communities affected by violence."

   "comments": [
    "This course provides a general overview on several topics related to conflict and health. From research methods to content knowledge, this course covers it all. In addition, the student must develop a research proposal related to conflict and health throughout the semester. The course brings in several guest lecturers who provide expert insights on a particular topic. We heard from people from Lebanon to Uganda. Overall, a great course that is highly recommended.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Yes. It's nice to take a course that is strictly for learning and discussing important topics, rather than worrying about tests."
