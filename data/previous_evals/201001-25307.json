   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you want an easy high mark.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any other student. It is very interesting, gives perfect and organized knowledge in each aspect of the Hispanic world, gives a wonderful knowledge of Spanish and the specific places it is spoken, and helps each specific student gain a greater knowledge and greater passion about Spanish.",
    "Yeah I would, its a lecture, but its interesting and you learn a lot. Its a fair a bit of work and the quizzes suck, but aside from that it is is a good class.",
    "The professor is very friendly and accessible, but the many powerpoints used to teach may not be the most effective strategy.It's a pretty relaxed course, probably one of the least intensive in the department, and very interesting particularly if you are interested in Latin American studies. Some of the assignments are much more involved than they seem on the surface. Exams and quizzes are graded leniently, but can actually be difficult.",
    "Take it. Workload is not overbearing and you learn a lot. The material will be surprisingly interesting and the research fun.",
    "The subject matter is interesting and useful if you have any intention to continue studying Spanish or anything related to the Spanish-speaking world, or if you plan on traveling in the area in the future. Lecture can be a bit dry at times, but Prof. Reymundi cares about her students and does bring interesting videos, anecdotes, etc. to class. As long as you're interested in Spanish or language in general you should be engaged. The workload is minimal: in-class activities, 2 quizzes and a midterm based entirely on class (no outside reading), and 2 papers. The papers require some outside research but they're more like reports or investigations than arguments. You have to present your last paper to the class, but this is not difficult and involves no work besides making a powerpoint. You're done before reading week even starts, which is nice.In short, a fun\/interesting class with minimal work. You'll learn some interesting stuff if you pay attention, which I recommend.",
    "Definitely not an easy credit, especially just coming from L4, but it's lots of fun.",
    "This class is mostly lectures with a little bit of discussion. There are two research papers, nothing too difficult. If you are interested in the Spanish language, I would definitely recommend this class, but don't expect to practice your Spanish much. It was a great class, but if you're not interested in linguistics, it might get boring.",
    "Being an L5 Spanish student and a big fan of linguistics, I was really excited to find this course. You basically go through Spain and Latin\/South America and see how each country differs in their pronunciation and grammar. It's great knowledge to have under your belt if you ever plan on visiting other countries. The workload is pretty light: No textbook, the syllabus had a lot of reading on it but we were rarely given it, two ~10 page papers (that you get to make corrections on), and a couple tests\/quizzes. The grading is fairly generous on the papers and Prof. Reymundi tells you what will be on the quizzes so you know what to study. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in foreign dialects and\/or linguistics.",
    "yes, a good spanish class that has some real world applications and a manageable workload with a good professor",
    "This class is interesting, especially if you're planning to travel or want to understand the differences between the dialects of Spanish. Can get a little repetitive, but it's not a lot of work."
