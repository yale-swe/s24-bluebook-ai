    "How to conduct myself when taking doctoral level courses.",
    "The course strengthened my appreciation for questions of genre in theology, and I am much indebted to the instructors for the way they encouraged us to engage this question with reference a wide variety of materials from across the sweep of the history of Christian thought. I had started the course thinking it would be another exercise in adjudicating the legacy of systematics; though this is important, I left the course feeling we had arrived at a different line of inquiry, concerning the relations between form and content, the material conditions under which theology is produced, techniques of theological writing, and so on. This very helpfully implicates systematics while also inviting us to a different conversation entirely.",
    "Reading textual construction and sociopolitical situatedness as instructive for how to read theology.",
    "I thought about the genre and form of theological writing. I learned to pay attention to the author's motivation for choosing particular genres and form, notably in terms of the authority that particular genres leverage. We also considered critiques of genres and methods of composition.",
    "Presentation of new material to fellow students in a way that would elicit interest. Opportunity to explore areas of personal interest in greater depth with feedback and discussion.",
    "Understanding the basic pathways of graduate work in religious studies.",
    "I gained a better sense of the shape of theological discourse, some of its major and minor practitioners and genres, and a sense of how I might be able to fit into all of it. I think one of the most important elements of the course was the social aspect of it. It was a huge privilege and blessing to engage regularly with Profs. Starr and Tanner and the cohort of students. It was perhaps the best learning environment I've experienced at Yale and YDS."

   "comments": [
    "Class was wonderful. Thanks to Profs. Starr and Tanner for putting this together for us. It was great fun!",
    "The overall structure of the course, organized around a series of student presentations each week, seemed to generate very interesting conversation; Professor Starr did an excellent job steering that conversation week-to-week, and Professor Tanner's own deep engagement of the materials spurred on our exploration. My only suggestion is that the course could have used something of a summary session in which insights from the whole were aggregated and shared with the class; without this, we were left somewhat to draw our own conclusions, and though beneficial in its own right, I wish I had some sense of what others were making of the course as well.",
    "There were no weaknesses. The major strengths that I think pervaded all aspects of the course, were the collegiality and rigor with which the course was facilitated. I was committed to the course, in part, because I cared about my colleagues and professors. And that care, I believe, deepened my level of engagement.",
    "Exposure to stimulating material that called for further discussion that was unfortunately hard to manage given time constraints and class size. Dual perspectives from the two faculty were very useful.",
    "A bit more clarity on expectations for presentations would be helpful. The strength was the interaction of a small, highly selective group of students.",
    "It's informality was a strength and weakness. I think I was a bit panicked at moments when I wasn't quite clear at what was expected of me, but we communicated and cleared things up as needed. It was a strength because it lowered our proclivity to perform in the classroom, I think."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!",
    "Yesit was a unique opportunity to learn whilst simultaneously developing a sense of intellectual community. If it is possible to do it again, I think it will be an incredible opportunity for any students involved.",
    "This was one of the best doctoral seminars I have attended so far.",
    "Absolutely",
    "This is a required doctoral seminar. I would recommend the course to a doctoral student in another department or subdivision of Religious Studies if their interests matched the content of the course.",
    "For students for whom reflecting on theology as a discipline is important, this fills a very necessary gap.",
    "Absolutely - it was a terrific experience to study and share in a small group.",
    "Definitely. I do think its success depends hugely on the makeup of the students taking the course. Hell, I'd take it again."
