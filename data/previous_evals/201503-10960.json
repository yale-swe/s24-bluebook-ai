    "Not at all. Not useful",

    "Yes, you'll learn a lot!",
    "It is required by first-year Econ PhD students. Highly recommended for those who want to study or research in related areas.",
    "It establishes the fundamentals of economics.",
    "The material is important, even for an SOM student like me. However, I think the department should realize that non-Econ students have very different backgrounds",
    "This course is a requirement for first-year graduate students in the Economics program, and is an introduction\/review of key concepts of demand, and market theories. Undergraduate students with strong mathematics and economics backgrounds should be able to handle this course as well.",
    "A must take."

    "This course gave me a broad introduction to advanced microeconomics and, although I had already seen some material , I learnt new things as well.",
    "The course evolves from decision making of individual to that of the whole economy. Thus it deepens my understanding of connection between microeconomics and macroeconomics.",
    "I could learn techniques frequently used in solving problems in economics.",
    "This was a required first-year course and I learnt a lot.",
    "Yes, it is required",
    "Since I came in with little knowledge, the course was challenging. However, it laid down the foundation for further coursework.",
    "Given that I am studying accounting, it is unlikely that I will use this material in my research",
    "It was a combination of review and learning new models. The materials in the course are fundamentals for an economist, but I would not say that it has a direct contribution to my dissertation and\/or research.",
    "It is indispensable for my research."
