   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Having no art exposure, it was interesting and caused me to think about art ways I had never even considered",
    "I would recommend this one especially when you want to start your college career strong in terms of writing. The topic can be interesting too.",
    "this class was a weirdly art-centered way of learning to write an essay and make a claim.I would recommend it to anyone looking for a writing credit and if you appreciate art and can ARGUE about it then that's better.",
    "I would recommend it to those looking for a class to improve their writing. Also it is good writing practice for other courses.",
    "Take this class if you like beauty and art. If you do not want to discuss beauty, do not take this class. Many people thought it was misleading because the course title had them thinking it was about other peoples' points of view or whatever. Anyway, Prof Jones leads nice discussions, but she grades harshly, so watch out.",
    "It is a good class to take. Not too work intensive but you need to identify early what exactly the teacher likes in papers. I would recommend it but it is not as focused on developing your writing as originally though.",
    "If you enjoy writing and would like an introductory course then I would recommend it. For this section in particular, make sure that you enjoy talking endlessly about art and beauty and thatyou enjoy critiquing and going in circles about both. Otherwise, I would stare you away from this class.",
    "This course focuses a lot on art. It is very relaxed but the writing topics can sometimes feel repetitive and dull.",
    "I would recommend it as an into course.",
    "English 114 is mostly about art, but the topics discussed (beauty, vision) transcend this subject and really delve into all corners of life. Class time was usually spent discussing the readings we did for homework or work shopping essays. The workload was light compared to some of my other classes: super interesting readings and reading responses each week and 4 papers--three were 5 pages and one was 10 pages. I would definitely recommend this class, especially if Ms. Jones is teaching it. She is wonderful, the readings are wonderful, and the writing I did really transformed my thinking. What's more is that we got to spend a lot of time looking at art on and off campus. We went to the Yale Art Gallery a couple of times in and outside of class and traveled to New York to see the de Kooning exhibit at the MoMA."
