    "Yes.",
    "Thinking about rivers and dams, and their human and environmental consequences. Many interesting ideas, although after the third or fourth week every theme just started repeating itself. We had James Prosek, a Yale alumnus and author, come in to talk about his book on eels - way cool!",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "I thought this course was fantastic. However, my assessment has a lot to do with how much the course opened my eyes to a whole new way of thinking about the environment and world. Professor Scott is a treasure and the reading list is fabulous. Discussions struggled in class, but if you use the course as an opportunity to have discussions with Professor Scott and other students about the material, the course is well worth your time.Do the reading. This course is very much about what you put into it is what you get out of it.",
    "take it! it's an unexpected class with an unexpected syllabus and an amazing professor. very refreshing!",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is truly fascinated by rivers, and is an environmentalist. The books we read provide a selection of case studies of rivers and projects in which humans intervene in rivers around the world. Very early on in the class, our class concluded that human intervention in rivers was extremely damaging. We didn't move very far past that conclusion throughout the rest of the course. So make sure you're prepared to talk about the same subject for 12 weeks--otherwise they'll feel long.",
    "An interesting forum to discuss political\/social\/moral issues surrounding man's interaction with nature.",
    "If you have any interest in the natural environment, take this course!",
    "I would recommend the course without reservation for anyone interested in the subject. Much reading and incumbent upon the students to lead the discussions but very satisfying, informative, provocative and insightful material.Great course and great subject which was both wide ranging and thematically coherent.",
    "It's a good class with an amazing professor (Professor Scott's work has influenced a lot of areas of political science), though the class isn't very technical (this isn't an environmental science class) and most of the reading is anecdotal. It makes for interesting discussions that look at pretty much every possible way to understand rivers, particularly looking at man's responsibilities to nature.",
    "Yes i would. My colleagues were very inightful and hard working",
    "Great class, very poetic, the concept of the river becomes a diving off point to issues of human rights, indigenous land rights, how man knows nature, what is our responsibility to our environment? to engineer it completely? is it a wild beast to be tamed? is it something we should try to co-inhabit rather than dominate? This year it was it's first year being taught, so there was a certain amount of redundancy, yet that redundancy was a way for us to continually delve deeper into the issues. This is a seminar: you read (1 book a week, but your encourage to scan it rather than pick it apart), you discuss (student lead discussions), and you write (final paper at the end is large majority of the grade, and there is large amount of flexibility, I made maps for my final project, another did a literary analysis on some novels that took place on the Mississippi, someone did a analysis of the swamp people in Mesopotamia, possibilities abound.)"
