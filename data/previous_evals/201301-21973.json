   "comments": [
    "Take it. Low input, high returns. I couldn't imagine being a history major and not taking this class.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "yes!",
    "Definitely a fun history credit!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. However, take note that it requires a deceptively large amount of work to get an A--a B+ is definitely possible with minimal work, though.",
    "Great class! Merriman is a really funny guy and entertaining lecturer. Tests and paper weren't too hard and it's cool to get a different perspective on a lot of events America was also involved in (mainly WWII).",
    "Yes! Not only will your knowledge of French history improve, but you will also learn a lot about the study of History. This course was a great decision.",
    "Yes, this course is a must take. Merriman is very opinionated but his opinions shed light on the major themes in French history from 1871 to the present. This course is about inequality, anarchism, socialism, French identity, anti-semitism and so much more. Definitely take this course if you are interested in French history even if you have never taken a french history course before!",
    "Highly recommend this class. It's extremely interesting, and who would of thought France since 1871 ever would have been. The teacher is the best there is. He is always open and available to speak with you, and will make any accommodations for anything that comes up.",
    "This was an excellent course! I very much enjoyed Merriman's lectures, the required readings and films. It provided an interesting and in-depth review of a segment of French history that is generally overlooked in european history survey courses.",
    "TAKE IT. Interesting, relaxed, easy. You can get by not doing the work, but you should do it because it adds to the experience, there's not much of it, and it's rewarding. Merriman is hilarious and fabulous, and Aner is the best if he ever TFs it again.",
    "It's a great general history with classics as assigned reading. Definitely recommend.",
    "Yes, awesome course, Merriman is uniquely the MAN",
    "I would recommend the class. It's interesting and fun.",
    "Great insight into French history",
    "Definitely! If you have any interest in French history at all -- or just want to hear John Merriman give awesome speeches about anarchy -- then take this!",
    "The readings range from captivating and inspiring to kinda dry, but the workload is very reasonable. Professor Merriman is notorious for the tangents he goes off on in lectures, but I found this pretty enjoyable. Shop his lectures and see if it's your style. The material is interesting and leads up to modern-day France.",
    "Lectures are enjoyable but rambling. I only ever learned by reading the text.",
    "Great history course, definitely take the first half of the course too (whatever comes before 1871).",
    "yes yes yes! honestly, merriman is amazing and french history is exciting and fascinating. as a non-history major, the course was very accessible and interesting. we covered everything from military history to art and culture. loved the course so much that im planning on studying french history even more!",
    "Merriman is awesome, and lectures are decently fun, but unless you're willing to actually do the reading and put in the work, you really won't get much out of this. If you're looking for an easy class in which you can get away with doing almost nothing though, this is it.",
    "Take this class, especially if you took European civilizations with merriman and liked his style."
