    "You get to do independent research with a faculty mentor- its a really great way to learn about the research process. I used Peabody museum collections, which I highly recommend- the curators and collections managers are AMAZING, have hundreds of awesome research ideas, and let you design your own project and really take the reins. (Particularly, vertebrate and invertebrate zoology and vertebrate and invertebrate paleontology -- these happen to be the fields I have studied.) Chris Norris and Leo Buss were the people I worked with, and they are really brilliant and helpful with the research process. Analysis is based solely on your final paper, which isn't a big problem since you work on it for the whole semester."
