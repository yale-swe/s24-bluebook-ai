    "I learned about general machine learning principles. I learned about many different kinds of neutrals nets and their applications.",
    "It introduced me to deep learning",
    "some familiarity with current techniques and architectures in deep learning. experience with tensorflow and keras",
    "I learned how to use tensor flow to make neural networks. I was not very familiar with tensorflow before this course, but it is a great skill to have learned. It is not used very much in deep learning research, because it is fairly low-level, but it provides an excellent foundation in thinking about how deep learning models are graphical. The other skillset you will learn is the theory behind neural networks. Smita covers a range of deep learning technologies, and you will not become an expert in any one of them, but you will have a good idea of how they work at a high-level. This is really useful as the field evolves very quickly. Many people working in the field are software engineers who don't know a lot of the math and theory behind how deep learning works. In this course you will get a foundation in deep learning that will be enormously useful as the field develops and provide a critical advantage in your career. For instance, I was able to read and understand most of deep learning papers after taking this course.",

   "comments": [
    "There were possibly too many topics discussed. I would have liked to have had more structure in the requirements for the final project. Also, the homework assignments should have been graded with comments before the next homework assignment was due. There should have been multiple graders for this class.",
    "Strength: Very robust introduction Weakness: Sometimes the instructor can be clearer",
    "course should go into greater detail of theory - more rigorous explanation of math and statistics concepts to give better intuition for how things actually work",
    "Strengths: - The lecture slides are great and are a very helpful resource. - Course covers most of the most important topics in deep learning - Most important strength: course provides an excellent balance between theory and applications - Workload very manageable - Problem sets provide good balance between understanding how neural networks work and computational exercises - Final project is a great opportunity to explore a field you are interested in - Matt is an awesome TF and Smita is a good professor Weaknesses: - This is the first year the course was taught. As a result something were a bit rough. They had trouble finding a grader for the course and as a result we did not get grades back on our assignments until much later in the semester. - The requirements for the final project were unclear. Having a rubric would be helpful. - Having one more problem set would be helpful to get more experience",
    "Modern material.",
    "Good course, good hw good everything",
    "strengths: All techniques I've learned from this course are state of the art. weaknesses: Sometimes they are difficult to understand. Plus the course is a little bit boring.",
    "The fist homework wasn't evaluated till nearly the last assignment is due, so we don't know what we can improve in the homework.",
    "The instructor is not very good at explaining complicated concepts. She might consider spend more time on it.",
    "Lecture could be more interesting instead of relying too much on sides which is not clear.",
    "deep learning",
    "The class covered a lot of basic concepts in deep learning like generative models, supervised learning, autoencoders, etc. However, while the content of the course was interesting, there were not enough TAs for the amount of people in the class and so there was rarely any feedback on any of the PSETs or the final project. Also, the professor was not always very engaged with the class",
    "The course was not very well-structured and the problem sets were not well aligned with the material being covered in class. Being more deliberate with the topics that are covered and selecting problem set questions to match would improve the class, in my opinion.",
    "I thought most of the material was just taught off of slides, I wish class had been more engaging with interesting tutorials and examples.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is how, even though it covered a wide range of topics in deep learning, I still felt like we covered each one with enough depth that it was more than a surface-level overview. I took this course because although I had previous classes that touched on machine learning, I wanted a more comprehensive understanding of the field, and I definitely gained that. The course could be improved by being more timely about giving student feedback, since it took a while for us to get grades on the problem sets back, which made it difficult to gauge how you were doing.",
    "Strengths: lecture slides are very clear and informative, problems sets are well-written to facilitate student learning, final project gives students a great opportunity to challenge themselves and apply what theyve learned in the course to a real-world problem, exam is fair Weaknesses: very little availability of office hours compare to other CS classes. In particular, there is no ULA for this class. Problems sets are graded many months after they were turned in so you have little idea of how youre doing in the course.",
    "good studying materials",
    "a lot to learn",
    "Nice overview of topics",
    "I thought that the number and variety of neural nets covered was definitely a strength. I liked that the homeworks forced us to use low-level TF, which made sure we understood the TF graph. I do wish we would have had a few more homeworks, and maybe used TF Keras some, because that is pretty common in industry.",
    "This course covers a good range of topics. Some of the readings were somewhat disconnected from the lectures. More practice assignments could also have been helpful.",
    "topics are high level, homework does not have guiding questions, couldn't learn hands on programming skills for neural network",
    "Good Teaching Styles",
    "The instructor's style of teaching could be more lively.",
    "The strengths is that it has wide coverage of popular neural networks. Most of the topics are very new and the recommended reading is very helpful to get deeper understanding.",
    "This is a good introduction to the subject of neural networks, for it brushes on many different types of network architechtures for different problems, and many design principles for neural networks. However, I think it would be perhaps more desirable to focus more on a few types of network and maybe break this into 2 courses. Finally, I think some more class time (maybe regular office hours at a set time and date during the week) could have been devoted to walking through some tutorials in tensorflow. I was able to learn a basic usage of Tensorflow by practicing with the homework assignments, but I do not feel profficient enough to code from scratch in the end of this course, without using some of the codes presented in the class as a template.",
    "The course seemed very strong at introducing many key topics in the artificial intelligence field. I think it stayed up to date with the cutting edge technology here as well as provided a good understanding of when to use one neural network architecture vs another. One major weakness was the assignments. They lacked a consistent thread and made executing an assignment more difficult. While the content of the assignments were not easy or too challenging, the manor in which they were presented to the students was very convoluted at times. For instance, an incomplete piece of code was given to us and we were told to complete it with some objectives in mind. This piece of code would be deprecated, out of date, and ultimately difficult to read. I think a better assignment would be to ask the students to do a task, defining objectives along the way, rather than providing them an out of date cryptic piece of code."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, Although the material was somewhat rushed, it was good to get an overview of several different types of neural nets.",
    "Yes",
    "kinda. i definitely learned some interesting stuff, but i found the lectures were really surface level",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It provides an excellent overview of deep learning and strikes the optimal balance between theory and application. Smita is a good professor, and the lectures are focused. You will learn most of the most important topics in deep learning and be prepared to learn more advanced deep learning techniques and go on to graduate school in the field (if you are an undergrad). At the end of the course, you will be able to understand deep learning papers and write tensorflow code.",
    "Probably.",
    "Yes",
    "It is worth taking if you are interested in deep learning and have the basic knowledge of it.",
    "Deep learning is an important topic for us to learn about, but I don't think I learnt enough of what I wish to learn from this course.",
    "I would recommend the course if the students want to know some basics about deep learning.",
    "Yeah, if you are interested in deep learning.",
    "yes",
    "Not in its current form. The material was very high-level, the kind of stuff that you can gather from any number of blogs or other online resources. The problem sets were not very informative. The final project was useful, because it forced you to actually work on a significant application of deep learning independently.",
    "Definitely, it was tough and not the most engaging course, but the material was very interesting and we covered many state of the art network structures.",
    "I would recommend this course. After this class, I feel like I have a much better understanding of the theory behind machine learning as well as the programming skills to apply that knowledge.",
    "Yes. You learn a lot in the class, though you need to mentally prepare yourself that you would have no idea about your grade throughout the semester.",
    "yes, this course could be a good start for students who have some basic understanding of statistical learning and want to move on to learn something about the deep network.",
    "Yes, if he\/she wants to learn deep learning",
    "Yes because it was a helpful overview.",
    "I would say that this course is definitely for anyone who wants to learn a lot about deep learning. If that were one's interest, then I would definitely recommend it to them.",
    "a good intro to deep learning, but after the semester I still don't know how to use tensorflow, guess neural network is something you can master only by taking multiple courses.",
    "Yes. Very good course",
    "Yes. Good deep learning overview for beginners.",
    "Yes, I will recommend to those who would like to learn more about deep neural networks.",
    "Yes as a first introduction to neural networks, as even though the slides used in class weren't the best, the homework assignments and the suggested readings were very good, and you can get a good sense of what basic methods are available, what are some principles you should follow when designing a neural network, etc. But I think more courses are necessary for one to be able to have a solid grasp on the subject.",
    "I would recommend this course, but considering the quality of the assignments, I would only recommend as an audit."
