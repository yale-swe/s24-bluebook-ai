    "Richard Burger is a pioneer in Andean archaeology, and it was an honor to take a class from him. Somehow despite knowing enough to write volumes of books about the area he is able to offer a challenging yet still accessible class about the Andes. He is always thoughtful and keeps an anthropological perspective about everything he does. Even though lectures are long due to the longer class, he still provides fascinating material which keeps the class interesting throughout. Take this class before he goes back to Peru!!!",
    "It's a nice archeology credit and not too much work.",
    "Very interesting if you know what you are going into from beforehand. Professor Burger keeps the lectures exciting by bringing authentic archaeological pieces and by making the lectures very visual. At the same time, he goes through a lot in great detail which you need to be on top of."
