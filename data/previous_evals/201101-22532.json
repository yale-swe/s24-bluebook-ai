    "Fascinating approach to religious studies, taught by an incredibly passionate professor.",
    "Overall, Defining Religion was an amazing class. It constantly made me think and it is one of those classes where you find yourself applying the things you discuss in class outside of it as well. I liked that it was such a small class, but that did create some discrepancies as it was a sort of half seminar and half lecture. However, that will probably change as this was the first semester that it was taught. Professor Lofton was a wonderful lecturer and always pushed us to take our thinking to the next level.",
    "Take this if you're interested in religion and it's relation to society and culture. You get to read some pretty interesting works, including Professor Lofton's book Oprah, Marx, Weber, etc. It's a lot of work but very rewarding!",
    "It's a lot more reading than any other class I had taken, but I really liked the material and loved lectures! Take it!",
    "This course is incredible. The readings seem to be the core of the RLST canon, and they are paired insightfully with modern case studies that bring out their essential messages and teachings. The assignments force you to isolate the major themes of the readings and apply them to cultural, religious, and social formations in the world. The class is best if you do all the reading, but the reading is totally mangageable so it should be totally fine!Professor Lofton is an incredible lecturer, plans a master syllabus, and is always available to meet one-on-one when you request. She seems to try to make the classes as meaningful for us students as possible, and thus always is able to bring class conversations back to our lives at Yale.",
    "study the different definitions of religion.",
    "I loved this class--it's one where I really felt like I learned how to think better, and ideas from the class have kept popping up in my normal life. Be prepared for many small assignments (6 reading responses over the course of the semester) and you'll definitely get more out of it if you keep up with the reading. Take it! Or anything else with Professor Lofton, she's incredible.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It is interesting, reasonably structured, and unbelievably informative.",
    "Great class. Take it if at all interested in the subject. Be prepared to contribute on a daily basis though and stay on top of your reading"
