   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this seminar over all other seminar's I have taken. It facilitated fabulous discussion, and the grant writing process was actually helpful unlike other seminars taken. Also, the group projects were a creative and fun way for students to review the course material they had learned over the semester!",
    "It can be intimidating at first, but definitely worth the work to learn how successful investigators think about immunology on a theoretical and practical level.",
    "I highly recommend this course! You can gain lots of information on the development of T cell field, and have a chance to read almost all the historical papers and newest findings! Really interesting!",
    "very good course for update on current standing of T cell field. I really enjoyed how it progressed from basics to more nuanced and controversial topics in the field. I would recommend this seminar.",
    "T cell seminar, T cell differentiation, function, and plasticity. Additionally, how T cells can contribute to disease. Went over techniques used for T cell research.I would definitely recommend this course, particularly to students interested in T cell research. The direct feedback from the amazing faculty is what makes this course.",
    "This is a good course if you are interested in pursuing research in the field of T cell biology. Yes, I would recommend this course to other students.",
    "A good class to take to gain a detailed understanding of T cell differentiation. Also good practice for writing grants. Yes if he\/she is interested in T cell differentiation.",
    "This course provided good background in T cell biology and differentiation. I would recommend this course to students who are interested in learning more about T cells.",
    "This class dives in to T cell development, in the deep end first. You learn a lot about the major T cell phenotypes and their development through reading the major seminal papers. Its definitely a lot of work, so prepare for that.",
    "Regarding the topics discussed I would recommend it, but I think I would be much more enthusiastic if the format was changed to student presentations of papers."

   "comments": [
    "I feel like a more fully understand the area of T cell development, which I only had a cursory knowledge of when I started the course. I also feel like a better understand the history of immunological techniques in the T cell field.",
    "This was one of the more stressful courses I've taken at Yale, but it's hugely deepened my understanding of t cell biology. I feel better equipped for my research and especially more confident discussing the immunological aspects of my work with peers. Glad to have had the opportunity for this.",
    "This course focuses on the field that I want to persue my research in the future, and it really helps a lot!",
    "while not directly relevant to my work, it was a great way to get updated on T cell immunity, and helpful to keep it in mind during my project. Also a good way to continue to learn how to be critical about literature, and the grant writing process was greatly improved over previous seminars. Professors were involved in reviewing aims and gave critical feedback on final grants. Would be nice to still have a chance to make alterations to grants post feedback. Also, minor issue in that professors claimed students should not write on their or other related projects (lab projects), and should write on something novel to them, but this did not seem to be enforced (when it could have been at the aim review session) in all cases. This approach remains somewhat unfair for students who do not work in a field related to the seminar course.",
    "This course was particularly applicable to my research, thus it contributed immensely. I even used some of it in my prospectus. I learned of techniques that previous T cell researchers used in their papers, and how I could potentially use that in my research. I also learned a lot about the history of T cell research to current day research, and that added to my understanding of the field.",
    "Great practice for writing grants and useful for gaining a better understanding of T cell differentiation",
    "It definitely helped me learn about T cell development that was relevant to my PhD.",
    "The course did not specifically apply to my research but did help me think about how cell fate decisions can be made, and I found this interesting."
