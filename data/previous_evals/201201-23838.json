   "comments": [
    "This course was excellent. This course was a nice complement to the very first policy course that we took in the fall with Professor Schlesinger.I was quite impressed how this course was altered in response to last year's class who had several complaints. I really appreciated that I was able to choose my own topic for the final project, as opposed to the writing on an assigned topic.",
    "This was a very good course. I learned a lot about politics and health policy in the United States. Mark clearly knows what he's doing. Some of the examples we use in class are completely outdated but I understand the purpose of why we use them. I do wish that we got to spend 1-2 classes talking about hot topics in health policy and debating them in class, which I feel would prepare us for our jobs out of school. I especially appreciated that Mark took the time to do the practice interviews with us, it was quite useful. Some weeks have excessive amounts of reading, which should be scaled back. It would also be good if there were a no-laptop policy, which I know has its drawbacks, but overall is probably a good thing.",
    "Great Course!",
    "Great course - a good send off.",
    "The course is taught in far too an abstract manner with minimal sensitivity to the changing health environment and the type of work we all will be doing post graduation. For example, in practice majority of us will never be able to present briefs that are longer than 3-5 pages, yet in the course we were asked multiple times to write longer papers. In addition, we were asked to write multiple press releases but never an actual policy brief. Provided that most of us will not be going into communications jobs I would have gotten a lOt more out of an opportunity to practice real world skills. In general I found everything to be too abstract with little practical application.",
    "I liked how the class was set up based on modules that followed a logical order. I also thought the introduction of the 3 policy models was nicely carried throughout the semester. I thought the first group project was very reasonable. The two individual projects were very lengthy and involved, which is fine since this is a capstone course afterall, but they really did come one after the other, which made the end of the semester very hectic. I think this class could be improved if we could get a bit more practical skills somehow. We learned about writing press releases, for example, so more exercises like that would be nice, as opposed to 15 page papers. Also, I would have liked a class on health care reform. We briefly tied it in to the incremental\/non-incremental discussion, but I would have liked to review the details of it and actually discuss what was happening in the Supreme Court.",
    "I imagine some people would find this class too high level and too theoretical, and it did certainly focus more on understanding policy analysis than on doing it. However, the assignments, the press releases and the video session allowed for some practical learning. I think what is missing really, is a class on writing for policy, one that goes into the different styles of writing that are needed for different purposes. All the job specifications I've seen for health policy ask for strong writing skills - not just the ability to write academic essays. The Capstone class helps, but it shouldn't be the only input on writing skills.",
    "The course was useful in thinking about the way to frame an issue\/agenda and the role that your audience plays in policy success. However, for a final course I would have liked the class to be structured around a final project lasting the entire semester. The final paper somewhat resembled this, but I think I would have benefited from this paper being the primary focus of the course and having more time to dig deeper into the issues.",
    "I thought the course was interesting. There were some concepts I think could have been discussed in more detail for greater clarity. The class writing assignments were challenging. I think the reading list could be updated for more current applied readings.",
    "I wasn't too excited about the course in the beginning but after a few weeks I grew to like it a lot. I think the material and discussions were compelling and useful. The assignments were challenging but helped you learn a lot. Only one thing - I wish there was more room to do more beyond domestic policy."

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0One of Professor Schlesinger's greatest strengths is his feedback. He is the only professor I have had that has given such detailed feedback on an assignment. His thoughtful comments and critiques have been extremely helpful in developing my writing and analytical thinking skills.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0See above. Mark was very good. He clearly knows the material exceptionally well and cares that students are paying attention and are being challenged in the right ways. My only suggestion would be to go the extra mile in terms of career mentorship especially since this is a capstone experience.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is absolutely fantastic.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is awesome!",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is extremely passionate about this class. Most weeks, I think the class discussion was pretty good but I wish he could have done more to engage some of the quieter students to participate so that it wasn't always the same handful of students talking. I appreciated his flexibility with when assignments were due, especially given the length and multiple parts of the two individual assignments. I also thought it was nice that the mock interview was optional because the exercise was not applicable to what many students in the class are looking to do. Mark does a great job at providing very detailed feedback on the assignments.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark selects very good reading materials, runs a tight class, and gets discussion going well.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0While the instructor is thoughtful and supportive of student feedback, I would have liked to hear more from him on his knowledge of the topics under study.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a wealth of knowledge and an asset to YSPH!",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is really excellent and super dedicated to teaching and helping us all. I think he was very engaging and patient with us which was necessary given the demands of the last semester."

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "Given the specific nature of the course subject, I would not recommend this course to students outside of the policy track or those whose have not taken previous policy courses. This course is advanced and requires a large time commitment.Nonetheless, I think this is a great capstone course for the policy track. Having a strong understanding of how articulating policy from a particular narrative or perspective can greatly affect how it is perceived and accepted is key. This course builds upon previous policy courses and provides an opportunity through writing assignments to think critically about a few health policy issues.",
    "You'll learn a lot about health politics and policy in the American system and why things are the way they are. You will not learn the current issues facing our health system or basically anything about health finance or economics. I would recommend it for somebody interested in policy, but not administration.",
    "Great course. I don't believe that other students can take it, otherwise I would certainly recommend it.",
    "Since health policy students have to take this course, I would say that it succeeds at covering a variety of topics. Each week has a set of conceptual readings and application readings, so there is a significant amount of reading but at least it's an attempt to pull in some real-world examples. I wish some of the application topics were a bit more relevant and exciting, but maybe Mark will change them up next year.",
    "This is an excellent high level class on policy - but you should also try and find some classes that deal with health policy at a more practical.",
    "This course is designed as a culminating experience of the policy track. It primarily focuses on the framing and presentation of policy recommendations.",
    "Required for HPA students.",
    "Yes - but then again, it is a requirement so students will have to take it anyways."
