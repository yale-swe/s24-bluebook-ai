    "I learned a lot about intellectual property and law. I struggled a bit with reading and understanding law cases, but it was definitely a skill I was able to develop over the course of the semester.",
    "Learned a lot about intellectual property law! The difference between copyright, trademark, etc..",
    "Knowledge of IP-related case law and important court cases.",
    "I learned so much about copyright, patents, and trademarks and how to effectively read court cases! I learned a lot about the difference between law and philosophy, and how the law is often behind on a lot of subjects.",
    "Solid knowledge of intellectual property law",
    "This class provided a great overview of IP. It helps you better understand what can be protected and how.",
    "Coming into the course without any idea of what intellectual property is, I learned a lot more about Intellectual Property and its applications in the modern age, where data transfer is so easy. I learned how to read legal papers and analyze them, and I learned a lot more terms and concepts of law."

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the discussions we had based on the law cases. I also appreciated that we didn't only read law cases, but also news articles about pending law cases or suits.",
    "It's very discussion based, which means the quality of your class depends on everyone else in the class, but the prof was very good at steering and sprinkling in proper info",
    "Wished I had more clear guidelines on what they were looking for in response papers, and more guidelines on how to approach reading about the law.",
    "Fascinating cases and content with a very engaging professor. The seminar setting with a diversity of majors made it very engaging.",
    "Strengths--very small and great discussions, extremely interesting readings, and the professor and TA!! Weaknesses--two hour long class, maybe could've met more often than once a week.",
    "Very interesting and not overbearing workwise. Seminar style is good for discussion but gets repetitive with no mix of in class activities.",
    "There were very few weaknesses in the course. One thing that could be said is that the syllabus is not very well structured. The student are just given examples of reading responses and final projects instead of a rubric; the professor also never goes through the assignments in class. This gives lots of freedom for creativity in writing responses, but leaves the student more lost."

    "I would definitely recommend this course. I had such a great time every Thursday and discussions were extremely rewarding (especially if everyone does the readings).",
    "Yes, fun class",
    "Shop it and see how you like it, I think the course underperformed relative to my expectations",
    "I am not sure if this course will be offered by Prof. Tang again, but it was wonderful. Take it if you hope to just learn about IP law, or want to go into entrepreneurship.",
    "One of the best seminars I have ever taking. Light on work, super engaging and the topics are very interesting. If you have any interest in intellectual property -- do take it.",
    "I most definitely would recommend this course to another student! It's a very good look into what IP law entails and I always looked forward to coming to class!",
    "Yes! Great fifth class.",
    "Yes! Professor Tang is excellent in teaching, engaging students, and overall being humorous in the course. If you want to learn about law, or reading basic legal papers\/court opinions, take this course for a slightly mind-blowing result."
