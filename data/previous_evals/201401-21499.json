   "comments": [
    "This course is a must-take. It will introduce you to the general topics of computer science, with manageable, and even fun, programming assignments on the side. Professor Angluin is an extremely kind person, who is approachable and fun.",
    "Compsci 201 is a great intro course, not impossibly difficult, but not easy either. Do the homeworks and study, and you'll be fine in the course.",
    "Everyone thought this course was bomb, but I thought it was alright.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The base understanding of computer architecture and hardware, as well as data storage, assembly language, boolean algebra, etc.... it's just a great basis for computer education taught by an incredible professor. Don't miss out.",
    "If you don't have very much experience programming and want to progress further I would recommend it. It isn't all that applicable to real life if you have some project and want this class to teach you the skills it will not. However, I still recommend if someone is considering possibly majoring in CS.",
    "This is a great class. Take it if you are looking to learn how a computer works, from the logic gates all the way up to the RAM and CPU. You will also learn about computational time and other interesting topics. DON'T take this class if you are looking to learn a useful programming language - the class is taught in a variant of Lisp, which is not really used for anything at all. It's still an interesting language though.",
    "Worth taking if you want an introduction to some of the more theoretical aspects of computer science. The use of Racket (or Scheme) can be a little limiting, but it does help you think about recursion. Prof. Angluin knows how to teach this course, though sometimes she can be a little slow\/boring.",
    "Good course, but don't expect to gain practical skills.",
    "This course (with Dana) is an excellent, challenging, and enjoyable class.",
    "While 112 introduces you to programming, this course gives you a deeper understanding of what is actually going on when you program, the theory of computability, etc. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, even those not using it towards the major. Problem sets take 6-10 hours per week. Lectures were very interesting.",
    "CS 201 is a wonderful class. Absolutely take it. It works well both as a QR, although it is a little heavy if you're just looking for a gut, and it won't immediately make you a dramatically better programmer. But the topics and the concepts you learn are fascinating. Take it, even if you never take another CS class (which I almost certainly wont).",
    "Good interesting class. Great to take credit d",
    "Awesome class! Not as hard as people say and great material. You'll learn alot about what comp sci really is.",
    "Yes absolutely",
    "If you plan on majoring in CS, you don't have a choice. But for all others: It's a good introductory class that covers many different aspects of the field of computer science rather than just a pure programming class. If you want to take a class just to learn to program, take 112, but if you want to get more theoretical, take 201. Definitely take it with Professor Angluin if you can. She really connects with her students. Some advice for the class - definitely start the psets early to avoid some very frustrating nights. Overall, I feel like I came out of this class as a more logical-minded individual. Definitely try it out if you're interested in CS.",
    "If you have any interest in computer science, take it! I really enjoyed this course. It gives you an excellent survey of all sorts of computer science topics. Not too much work and lecture is enjoyable. I recommend it highly.",
    "Great class. Learn a lot about how computers actually work.",
    "An absolutely amazing class that I could not recommend more highly. Professor Angluin is wonderful - and runs one of the best lecture classes I have ever seen because she knows everyone's name and expects participation from the people who are willing. Although I was never exactly sure what I would be learning each day, because occasionally we would skip from topic to topic, I always learned a lot and was very interested. I took this instead of ENAS 130 - I think this was a good choice because I learned a lot about Computer Science itself and so it will be a lot easier to pick up some of the engineering programs when I need to do so.",
    "CPSC201 is a well taught class that goes over interesting theoretical topics such as recursion, Boolean logic and computer architecture. The workload is very manageable and fairly light (6 hours a week) and the exams are fair but more theoretical than the homework (though the second midterm is a bit long). If you work fast on the exams, you'll be fine. There is also ample support and help available. However since it seems like the peer tutors didn't get much business, most people found the homework fairly straightforward and accessible. The lectures are very clear and engaging. Additional detailed lecture notes are posted online as well. Overall, I would definitely recommend this class to majors and non majors!",
    "This is a fantastic course! I would recommend it to anyone. I'm a bio major, and I found it actually gave some great insights into material I was learning in other courses. It's full of really interesting material and different ways of thinking about problems. The problem sets were long - 8-12 hours - but really enjoyable, and there's a lot of support if you need it. Professor Angluin was incredible, she's a great lecturer.",
    "Highly recommended. CPSC 201 is certainly a challenging class -- the problem sets take upwards of 8-10 hours each week and the exams are tough. That being said, the material is fascinating and Professor Angluin does an awesome job engaging the students. I'd highly recommend this class for anyone interested in computer science (or even those who aren't!)",
    "201 is a lot of work, but a lot of fun. Psets took me 10\u201315 hours, but they were addicting and highly enjoyable. During this class, you learn the basics of how a computer works from the ground up. You also learn some really interesting topics in CS theory. Dana is a great teacher and makes lecture a lot of fun to attend. She makes an effort to actually learn your name, which is a nice change of pace.",
    "I took this class CrDF and I'm in Bio. It's a very interesting class and Prof. Angluin is a really good instructor (definitely one of the best). I feel like all Yale students should at least give this class a try. P-sets took around 7 hours on average per week.",
    "Would recommend",
    "Take it. It will probably consume more of your time than any other course but it is so worth it.",
    "A good introduction to CS, balancing practical application and theory."
