    "Music 205 is a divided course...the first half of the semester is dedicated to tonal harmony, and the second half is dedicated to form (tight-knit themes, sonata form, etc.). The homework is very manageable and often fun to do because it involves listening to famous pieces that are useful for any musician to know. I would definitely recommend Music 205 to another student because it was both entertaining and enriching--I now have a much more analytical approach to looking at, playing, and listening to music.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! Make sure you get into a small section because that makes it much better and much less stressful. There is a lot of homework, but since it counts for 50 percent of your grade or something, it's fine. Just be ready to put in the time during the week to do it. But the fact you have to do so much analysis makes studying for the tests basically require no time.",
    "The first step in advanced music theory- starts out with rudiments such as cales and chords, including triads and seventh chords, moves into harmonic analysis such as roman numeral analysis, chromatic embellishments and harmonic embellishments, cadences, part-writing, finishes with unit on form. Learn about small binary, small ternary, sonata. The class focus on the classical era of music.I would recommend this class if you're genuinely interested in expanding your musical knowledge. I would especially recommend it if you're a musician of any sort and want to learn more about the foundation of the music you're playing. Even though the class focuses on the classical era, it's good for musicians from different backgrounds if you have the prereqs and an open mind."
