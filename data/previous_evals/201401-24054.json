   "comments": [
    "I would summarize this course as an extended class debate about the best way to evaluate NGOs. I would recommend it to a student interested in development economics. However, if you are looking for a conventional class with a set syllabus, weekly readings, tests, and essays, this will not be for you.",
    "Interesting class. There is a lot of participation. That doesn't mean you need to do a lot of work\/readings but don't expect to just sit in class and get much out of it ... come in hungry to contribute. Karlan is a KILLER in this field. The nonprofit world will begin to look a lot smaller after this class, and strangely you will know some of the biggest players thanks to Karlan.",
    "Great class, you get to decide how real money is donated and learn a lot about evaluating NGOs and what makes one good vs. bad!",
    "A very informative class. It was very heavy on class discussion which was great because it kept the whole class engaged and we were able to hear everyone's opinions. That being said, we needed to make sure we were prepared before class to be able to have thorough and interesting debates. The professor also brought in very interesting speakers including someone senior in the Ford Foundation.",
    "Examining every element from morals to economics to politics of charitable giving from a donor's perspective",
    "Great survey course on evaluating charities. Dean has an interesting open discussion teaching style which suited some students and turned off others. Depends on what kind of student you are (active or passive). There is no real foundational lecturing so a lot of the learning has to be done outside of the classroom. All in all, great course with an interesting deliverable at the end (giving 50k). Important to note, however, that this was the first year and things may be different next time. Dean is very keen on improving the course and asked us for a lot of feedback at the end of the semester.",
    "The class has really great potential! We gave Professor Karlan feedback at the end of the year dinner so the workload next year should be timed and spaced out much better. it also is going to have a more clear structure from the beginning - it was taught for the first time this year so it was very much trial-and-error. I really liked the class and think I learned a lot. Getting to know the people in coming up with frameworks for evaluating NGOs and ultimately comparing our chosen NGOs with everyone else was fun.",
    "I recommend taking this class if you are really interested in charities and about thinking critically about charities and comparing them from a donor's perspective. However, be aware that this class is very disorganized and will by no means cover a large number of charities, but a very selective group of charities mostly chosen by the professor.",
    "Really great opportunity of a class. The first half of the course seemed disorganized, but things really came together at the end. In addition to being a course about evaluating charitable organizations, it's about debating and discussing ideas with people who are different from you. If you do take this class, please put your laptop away, except for supplementing class discussion. It quickly became the case that anyone with a laptop open would get distracted and lose their place in the conversation.",
    "I took the class in the first semester in which it was offered so there were definitely some kinks that need to be worked out. To be honest, it was extremely disorganized but not to the point that it got unmanageable. Dean is a brilliant guy and a leader in this field of economics so taking the class with him is a unique opportunity. To feel up to speed in the class, you need to make effective use of office hours and reach out to Dean when you're feeling lost. That being said, the subject matter is fascinating, and your class works toward the tangible goal of giving away $50,000. The workload is unpredictable so at times can get unmanageable. We deviated from the syllabus multiple times so I wouldn't take it at face value. However, I found I got a lot out of the class for the time I ended up putting into it.",
    "I would not recommend ECON 472 to another student. It is beyond poorly organized. Despite it being a huge gut with pretty much no work all year, you learn nothing from it. The concept of the class is great and it has potential if it were to be completely restructured and taught differently."
