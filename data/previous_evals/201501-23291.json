    "This was a great class, rigorous in its approach to writing but also very comfortable and supportive. Workshops are, in my experience, by far the best way to improve as a writer. This course is no exception; I can clearly see the growth in my own writing over the semester. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in fiction writing, either as a discipline or a hobby.",
    "I enjoyed this class -- workshop method is always a great way to get feedback from both your peers and a more experienced professor. We wrote three stories and did one major revision over the course of the semester, so I now have a lot of writing to work with!",
    "If you get into this class and have any interest in writing, definitely take this class.",
    "If you want to read and write some stories, this is the class for you. There's no lesson, no instruction here--just reading and writing. A lot of it depends on your classmates. Some people have very little respect for other people's work--there was one comment of \"This is not a short story\" and several people walked out feeling crushed. Other people, to be fair, are incredibly helpful and incredibly nice. It sorta depends.",
    "A fantastic format through which to learn from a professional writer, as well as experience a communal form of critique in sharing work with other fantastic students.",
    "You write 3-4 pieces of short fiction throughout the semester and get feedback in a workshop setting. The weeks you don't write you give others feedback. I would recommend it to anyone looking to write and get feedback in a workshop setting."
