    "Intro to Dramaturgy is a real-world look into the life of a dramaturg. Each student works on a project of their choice throughout the semester. I would highly recommend this class to any person interested in pursuing theater in any capacity. As an actor and playwright, I learned so much from this class about dramaturgy and the theater in general.",
    "It's a look at what dramaturgy is and how a dramaturg works in a rehearsal room.",
    "Definitely interesting material and provides a lot of opportunity for creative expression. However, don't be fooled by Tanya and Ryan's fun vibe and sense of humor in the classroom; the work was graded very harshly and they expect a lot from their students.",
    "Take it! This class was the highlight light of my semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to theater people of all disciplines. Learning about dramaturgy and how to be a good dramaturg will help you whether you are a designer, actor, director, or producer. This was the first time the course was offered, so descriptions of the assignments were vague and unclear at times, but I'm sure this will be fixed the next time the course istaught. Also, the work for your casebook can pile up if you don't stay on top of it!",
    "The first half of the class provides you with context for what a dramaturg is, and different theories you can put to use in dramaturgical research. It's all really interesting, and the weekly reading assignments are very manageable. The most fun part of class is the weekly activity or exercise, where we were split into smaller groups, given some task like condensing Act 2 of The Crucible into a 3-minute interpretive performance piece (just one example of many different kinds), and then performed and analyzed them with the class. It's unlike anything else I've done in a Yale class, and keeps you constantly pushing yourself creatively. The second half of the class is about preparing your own dramaturgical casebook for a show of your choosing. This is awesome because you get to feel complete ownership over a show, putting together production history notes, period political and cultural research, an actor's packet, and yourown alternative pitch of the show. Each week a different piece of the casebook is assigned, so there is never too much work week to week and the only thing you have to do at the end of the semester is revise work you've already done and structure it together in a binder. The only other aspect of the final project for the course (no final exam, just the casebook) is a 20-minute presentation pitching your concept for the show to the class just as you would to an artistic team at a theater. It's a great way to thoroughly think through all the creative aspects of a show and present the research you've done. My one word to the wise is that Ryan and Tanya (who are AWESOME in every way) expect a tone of extreme professionalism in the presentations, truly as though you are giving a pitch to a creative team that may hire you. The only negative things I have to say about the class were that we frequently felt unclear about expectations for the assignments and the final presentation, but since this was the first year the class was taught I'm sure Ryan and Tanya will work out those kinds and be more explicit next time. Overall, fantastic class!",
    "Yes. Take this class. Even if you know nothing about theatre (you might be at a bit of a disadvantage at first, but you'll learn so much). Alternatively, even if you know a lot about theatre (because you will still learn so much). Basically, take this class."
