    "A good course. Some of the topics were obscure. I wish we spent more time on consciousness.",
    "I took this as a fifth class Credit\/D and it was perfect for that situation. There are only three assessments, all take home writing, and they are not super difficult. Just glance at the readings before coming to class and you'll be totally fine. I also didn't have any philosophy experience coming into this class and it was a little bit overwhelming, but Aaron did a great job of explaining most concepts. Was happy to have a chance to explore this material.",
    "You definitely have to be inclined towards philosophy, because this course is not light. That being said, if you do like philosophy, or might be interested, this is a really great topic to explore, especially because philosophy of mind has been developing and getting more interesting recently due to the new information we have about the mind.",
    "A broad overview of ideas and approaches in the field of Philosophy of Mind, including Functionalism, Dualism, Consciousness, etc. The class is formatted like a lecture, but has a lot of discussion based on its small size. Norby aims to analyze each reading together with students to make sure each student has a holistic view of philosophy of mind, and really wants students to reinterpret and apply the ideas being thrown out in each reading in their own terms. Overall, he does a good job. If you're into the course material and don't mind spending the first few classes trying to grasp the terminology, you'll be fine. He's lenient with grading, but that might just be because everyone was so into the topics.",
    "I would take the class if you're interested in the mind and are ready to struggle with some hard arguments",
    "Pretty good course. The material can get somewhat difficult (loads of new terms and structures for thinking about the mind), but luckily the take-home midterm and final are a series of short responses, which is a better way of writing about what you've learned than a longer paper. Stick through with it, since the class really shines in the latter half.",
    "I would recommend taking this class only if you are interested in the material. It is ridiculously easy to just attend lecture and then only do the readings specific to the midterm and final (both of which are take home) and do reasonably well in the class, but you won't get anything out of the class that way. Because each meeting covers a different reading (some of which are difficult to understand), I sometimes felt overwhelmed and unsure of how the readings connect to one another. Overall, not a difficult course, but it is not a gut.",
    "You'll learn about the mind mainly through 20th century philosophers. The topics range from discussing different \"isms\" like behaviorism, functionalism, and physicalism to whether what we think in our mind actually represents to us, what representation is, the limits to our cognitive processes, etc. It doesn't cover everything in philosophy of mind, but I think it is broad enough. Most of the class delves deep within each sort of topic by looking at how each philosopher is responding to each other's ideas. Truly, I think it is a really interesting and enriching class. However, it is difficult. I know Professor Norby advertised this as a class where anyone can take it, even if they had no prior experience in philosophy, but I had some experience, and thought that the papers were difficult to read. I couldn't imagine someone who was trying to take philosophy for the first time."
