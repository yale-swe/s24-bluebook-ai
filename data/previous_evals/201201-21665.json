    "Highly recommend this class. You get a lot out of it, may be because you are required to put so much in.",
    "Take this class if you want to work very hard and grow as a thinker. This class was more work than most, possibly all, other classes I've taken at Yale (this was my last semester). It was also one of the best classes I've taken. I would not, however, suggest taking this course in the same semester as your senior essay, that was tough for me. Overall, this is an excellent and demanding course and the reading list is superb."
