    "Pretty good! Better than I could've ever anticipated for an organic chemistry class",
    "Organic Chemistry does not have to be a painful experience, and Chem 220 is a very manageable course if you enjoy a much more visual approach to chemistry itself. Professor Schepartz is a fantastic professor, and really knows how to teach organic chemistry in the most engaging and efficient way. She will make a difference in your undergraduate experience if organic chemistry is on your agenda. She is engaging, energetic (a blessing for a class so early in the morning), adaptive to her audience, and even bought candy and Munchkins for the class from time to time.",
    "DO NOT take this class unless you are a premed - but then again, you knew that already. I honestly cannot think of any reason to take this course unless you are applying to medical school - it's simply too much work and too hard. If you are a premed, then buckle in and get ready to pull all-nighters for this class. But then again, you knew that already - or why else would you be a premed?",
    "AHHH so much work",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student because it is super hard. I'd say to only take it if you absolutely have to. Some of these tests were the hardest I've ever taken.",
    "If you think you know enough chemistry and don't need to \"suffer\" Orgo, think again. Organic chemistry gives you important knowledge for understanding chemistry and biology. Most importantly, it teaches you to use a gigantic toolbox of ideas to solve difficult problems, to piece together seemingly unrelated ideas into a powerful big picture. Professor Schepartz is an amazing professor who is knowledgeable on the subject and passionate about teaching. I really enjoyed this course. If you're reading this and are interested in learning organic chemistry, I would suggest you not to base your decision on the reviews. For a famous\/infamous course like orgo, people are biased and their opinions won't . Shop this course and see if you like it.",
    "Alanna Schepartz is a fantastic lecturer who made the material accessible and straightforward. Because 1st semester orgo is a class which relies heavily on student dedication and effort, some students were better prepared for what was expected of them, while others seemed to have difficulty adjusting from Chem 115 to 220. This class was really smoothly run, clear about expectations and reasonable in workload, and overall it was my favorite class of the semester. Students seemed to work together a lot on homework sets and in studying for the exams, the curve was generous and the grading quite fair. All in all, take this class with Prof. Schepartz if you can!! For me she made the lectures (which in orgo seem to be the mass of the class) wonderful.",
    "I have heard this course has been awesome in the past few years but I was NOT impressed. Prof Schepartz was scatterbrained and all over the place in terms of her teaching style. Even when I would read the text book\/do the pset before class, I would be confused walking out of lecture. I would not recommend this class to another student. Honestly, I wish I could have taken Freshman Orgo.",
    "Chances are, if you're taking this class it's because you need it to fulfill a requirement. This is going to be the case for almost everyone in your class. Be warned that if you are unfamiliar with organic chemistry, there are going to be many people in your class that have taken it before and it's not taught well enough to keep the playing field even. You will need to work harder to beat the curve. Be prepeared to put hours into it every week and don't plan for much of social life.",
    "CHEM 220 is an introduction to the basic concepts of organic chemistry.",
    "220 honestly did not live up to the scary representation of organic chemistry perpetuated by the mainstream media. I honestly found chem 118 to be a harder course. This course was more informative than soul-crushing, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning the material. The textbook is extremely helpful, and I encourage students to not skimp on reading it. Lectures and sections both served to solidify the textbook material, but a significant amount of independent work is required on the part of the student to understand the material. There's no secret to doing well other than putting in the work (and perhaps having a good visuo-spatial IQ subdomain). You probably have to take it for a major or pre-med requirements, but don't be scared off by the class. It really can be enjoyable.",
    "Only take this class if you absolutely have to.",
    "It's Orgo. It's tough, but it's more about how much work and time you're willing to put in. Take it, and don't let it get the best of you! You'll be fine",
    "It's hard. The sooner you realize that and join the rat race of incessant studyers, the better.",
    "Yale does a pretty good job of teaching orgo. It's a lot of material, but the tests are fair",
    "I would definitely recommend CHEM 220 to another student. It is challenging but definitely worth the effort.",
    "Chem 220 was straightforward and what you'd expect from an intro orgo sequence",
    "I really enjoyed first semester orgo even though I was so scared at first. If you are the kind of person who enjoys puzzle kind of problem solving, I think you will enjoy this! Also knowledge really builds on itself, so keep up with the material!!",
    "I would recommend Chem 220 to another student, with the warning that this is not a course you can ace without spending a large amount of time studying. It is a serious time commitment, but well worth it.",
    "Alanna was really an amazing instructor, she made lectures very engaging and easy to listen to. Especially with a 9am class and dense material, it is so essential to have an instructor who seems to care about the material and wants to make everyone as excited as she is. If you can take it with Alanna, do it.",
    "Don't take if you do not have to.",
    "A pretty difficult class, but manageable if you put in the hours.",
    "I would recommend it. Be prepared to work very hard I spent about 80% of my academic time on orgo. Make use of resources.",
    "I would summarize Chem220 as a great course for anyone interested in majoring in Chemistry and even for non-chemistry majors who are interested in the medical and biological applications of Chemistry.",
    "You get out what you put in. And if you put the time in, you may realize that you actually love organic chemistry by the end of the semester :)",
    "If you're taking this, you probably have to take it. But in this setting I felt like I learned things and was almost enjoying it, too!",
    "Very hard.",
    "Only if you need it - a lot of hard work and brain power",
    "I would not recommend it for its difficulty and I would advise that it will consume much time and one has to be proactive about getting ahead in the course.",
    "Chem 220 is definitely a hard course and I would not suggest taking it unless you have to for premed requirements or a major. However, despite how much work it required and how hard it was, it was rewarding! Professor Shepartz is an amazing lecturer and she kept lecture engaging. Despite how stressful it was, I really enjoyed the class.",
    "If you have to take it, devote a lot of time into it and it's definitely doable.",
    "Difficult class but mandatory for many majors",
    "This is known to be one of the hardest premed requirements. Prepare and manage it appropriately.",
    "A lot of work!!!! But I guess you also learn a decent amount.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to any students interested in the sciences. It's a great course. Most will only take it if they're premed or if it's a requirement for the major. Some will credit\/fail it for fun, but you should really only do this if you KNOW the professor is good and enjoyable. Otherwise, probably not worth it unless you have to take it.",
    "CHEM 220 is your standard foundational course in organic chemistry. All of the material builds on itself and is indeed cumulative, so falling behind in coursework can be disastrous. The beginning of the course is quite a bit of general chemistry review, before getting to reactions and mechanisms, but the acid-base portion of the material is important to pay attention to, as it comes up often later in the course. The course fairly rewards those student who keep up with lecture and read the textbook, and punishes those who slack off. Take the class with Alanna if you have the chance.",
    "It is a general summary of organic chemistry focusing on hydrocarbon reactions and transformations. I would recommend this course for anyone both interested in chemistry and in lowering their gpa.",
    "It is a hard course that required a lot of work and I think people mostly take it because they have to not because they want to...",
    "CHEM 220 is a great class. It is challenging. Professor Schepartz is a very good lecturer, but the assessments definitely challenge you and your understanding of organic chemistry. I recommend CHEM 220 to another student. It's a very interesting class.",
    "If you like getting Ds, this class is for you!! But don't worry, Yale will curve your near failing grades to a B+ in the end. Actually though, this is a really difficult class but you're probably only looking at it because you absolutely need to take it. Don't let it deter you from being a STEM major\/premed or whatever, but be prepared to work really hard and still not do great.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I found that it was less intimidating than other students made it seem, and I found Professor Schepartz to be a better teacher than I expected.",
    "Great general survey of the basic topics in organic chemistry. Touched on basic atomic theory and then expanded out from there to explain how\/why various mechanisms work. I would suggest this course to any student who likes chemistry, or likes puzzles (the latter half of the course focusses on applying knowledge of mechanisms to various brain-teaser questions).",
    "Its Orgo.... Get over it lol",
    "CHEM 220 is a class that is definitely filled with confusing concepts, but if one puts in the needed time to study the material and work through the practice problems, the concepts will come slowly and gradually as the semester goes on. If there is any confusion at all, it is always best to ask the professor or the teaching assistant to make sure that the confusion does not persist into new topics.",
    "No, unless it is a must.",
    "It's a lot of work, but I feel like this class actually teaches you real chemistry. The grading's extremely fair, and the lectures were pretty enjoyable (if you genuinely like chemistry as I do). At any rate, I'd totally recommend it to anyone willing to put a significant chunk of his or her time into it. And by significant chunk I mean treat this class as a 1.75-credit time expenditure when planning out a schedule for next semester.",
    "I would say that this course was very challenging but rewarding. The exams were difficult but getting a good grade back was an awesome feeling. I would highly recommend this course as long as Professor Schepartz was teaching it!",
    "Although a fair amount of work, CHEM220 was a good introductory organic chemistry course that taught the foundations and concepts well. I would recommend it to another student who needs organic chemistry as a requisite for a major or just to someone interested in organic chemistry.",
    "Prepare to do a lot of self-teaching. This class depends entirely on the professor and TA's. It's really interesting, but the exams are awful and the lectures are not well organized.",
    "It was a very difficult course requiring a lot of memorization of rules and a complete understanding of those rules, as well as the ability to use the understanding of those rules to work on problems that you may have never seen before. You need to know every little detail. All notes are given in class, there are no posted notes, so you need to be there for every lecture or get notes from friends.",
    "A challenging class in which one needs to stay ahead of the game. If not, you will be crushed by the breadth of the material and your classmates whom have already taken the course in high school.",
    "You probably have to take this class, so I don't even know why you're reading this review, but don't stress out too much about orgo. It gets a bad rap, but that's really just because it's unlike any other science class you've ever taken before. Orgo relies much more on intuition and creativity than any other science. There are few hard and fast rules, and basically no numbers. You will feel out of your element at first, but don't be dissuaded-- you can do it, and it might even be fun.",
    "Yes recommend. Chem 220 with Prof. Schepartz is a good, painless intro semester to organic chem. Prof. Schepartz is a good lecturer and cares about the students. Material largely follows from Gen chem principles. Curves are pretty standard for an intro course, probably nicer than freshman orgo. TAs are good and section is good preparation for exams. I expect 2nd semester orgo to be more difficult so that's something to consider - 220 is mostly harmless but complacency is dangerous if you're taking the full sequence I'd say.",
    "This class is a BITCH. The material is interesting, but it kind of makes you want to hate your life a lot of the time. If you take this class, prepare to let your other classes take a backseat.",
    "Chem 220 was a class where you had to put in the time\/work to enjoy it. If you don't put in the time to understand the basic mechanisms, you will quickly fall behind, which ends up being no fun. There was a very clear divide in the class of who was reading the textbook and really understanding the material and who was not. (For example, our final test had an average of 67 with a standard deviation of 21 - a giant spread that shows people are either getting it, or not)",
    "CHEM 220 isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be - personally, I thought that this was one of the courses in which performance generally reflects how much work was put into it. I spent hours on this class, and it was most definitely a challenging curse, but I would highly recommend taking this course. However, I would also recommend forming study groups for this class, because had I not had friends to study with, I probably would not have wanted to stick with the class. I cannot emphasize enough how beneficial it is to collaborate for this class, but I'm sure that there are also some people who can tackle Orgo by themselves, too.",
    "It's okay. It's a lot of memorization and it moves too quickly. Understand things related to polarity, charge effects, and sterics as early as possible to help understand mechanisms (and memorize them) better.",
    "Take it because you have to. The expectations are pretty bad coming in, but it was honestly not too bad. You just have to be consistent with studying and never give up. Prof. Schepartz was a pretty good instructor too.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to for a requirement. It is a ton of work and not particularly interesting.",
    "Organic Chemistry requires a lot of work. Professor Schepartz gives great class notes and is extremely helpful during office hours.",
    "Just be aware that in addition to the 50-probem homework sets, most of the studying necessary to do well in the course will come through reading the textbook and doing additional practice problems, especially towards the second half of the course in which the focus is primarily on reaction schemes and mechanisms.",
    "If you have to take the course you have to take it although I'd say that the course has been improving over the years and is much better than it previously was. Still difficult at times and requires a lot of memorization. Neither particularly good or bad.",
    "The class is challenging, but not unmanageable, and dare I say, even enjoyable when you see how the pieces fit together. Know that learning the material may take a lot of out-of-class time if this is your first time seeing the material, so don't overload yourself.",
    "A lot of work but really interesting. Actually really enjoyed this class.",
    "Obviously take this class if you need it for your major or premed requirements. Not as bad as people make it seem, but don't take it for fun.",
    "Fun, quite difficult, but lots of help available.",
    "This class requires a lot of work and I would not take it unless necessary, but it is very interesting and keeps you engaged in the material."
