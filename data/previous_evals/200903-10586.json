   "question_text": "How would you summarize AFAM 505 01\/AMST 643 01 for a fellow student? Would you recommend AFAM 505 01\/AMST 643 01 to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "This class provided glimpses of varied research topics and approaches relating to biological questions with the underlying theme of demonstrating the value of interdisciplinary approaches to these questions through the analysis of primary literature. I would definitely recommend this to any student who felt that their area of study might fall even marginally close to the boundary between two given fields. Also, I would suggest that any student could glean a great deal of useful, general information about biology, scientific thinking, and collaborations from this class, and would therefore find it useful regardless of eventual field of study.",
    "Every week you read 2-3 papers. Discuss the basics of the papers with your class (students only) on the monday session. Then discuss them in depth, with faculty present, on the wednesday session.If you are a physicist interested in using physical methods on biological problems, this class should be very useful, and you will learn a lot of biology. If you are a biologist you will be exposed to biophysical techniques but not learn a lot of physics.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in looking at biology from a more mathematica\/engineering\/physics approach. This was good for me because I have a weak biology background, and this course presented biology topics in a way that was easier for me to understand.",
    "Methods and Logic in Interdisciplinary Research brought together students from biology, physics, and engineering backgrounds to discuss current problems in the emerging field of physical biology. We met with Yale faculty from many disciplines, generally one from biology and one from physics, engineering, or computer science, and discussed work from their field of expertise. Students were encouraged to take a major role in the discussions, so we learned a lot. The workload is pretty light. This is a wonderful course - it is ideal for any students curious in exploring the boundaries between computational biology, physics, applied math, and biology."

   "comments": [
    "The course provided me with an opportunity to critically evaluate primary scientific literature and gain feedback from experts in the field. Additionally, this course exposed me to several fields of study with which I was largely unfamiliar, and helped me to better understand what it means to perform \"interdisciplinary\" research, and the value that collaborations can have when doing so. I believe all this will contribute to my understanding of how to be a good researcher, while simultaneously broadening my knowledge base in biology.",
    "I hope that this course has helped to give me a better background in biology so that I may be able to take other biology classes. Although it does not directly contribute to my research, I think that the topics discussed will be very useful indirectly.",
    "This course helped to define my discipline. Because of this course, I better understand the differing areas of physical biology, and I was introduced to the Yale faculty that work in this field. Now I can make a better-informed decision about my future rotations and thesis advisor."
