    "Enhancing your reading comprehension and writing skills. In particular, the weekly homeworks will focus on interpreting articles and writing concise summaries. Speaking and listening skills are improved via the various clips we review in class and general discussion.",
    "I learned some terminology about medical issues in Spanish!",
    "In addition to refining my Spanish, I explored concepts in modern-day medicine that I could apply to my everyday life.",

    "I feel like my medical Spanish vocabulary has hugely increased with this course, as well as my actual understanding of multiple diseases and ailments.",
    "I gained an understanding of a variety of medical concepts, in Spanish. The breadth of the course was helpful, especially for those of us who are not interested in going into medicine but who want to learn more about basic medical issues and their treatments. The weekly writing homework, class presentation, and final paper further enhanced this experience.",
    "I learned more about medical terminology in Spanish!",
    "I definitely improved my Spanish speaking ability and became more comfortable speaking the language. I also learned a lot more new vocabulary and medical terms.",

    "My written Spanish improved.",
    "I strengthened my Spanish writing skills, and actually learned a lot about different ailments and how to detect and treat them.",

    "The class was a great Spanish course with an amazing teacher! I learned a lot from the format of the course, which was a nice balance of discussion, lecture, Q&A, and videos. The presentations are a good way to cap off the year and working on oral presentation skills.",
    "The strength is that the coursework is interesting and doesn't require too much work. There is no weakness!",
    "I believe that this course is wonderful as is! The students have opportunities to engage with the material, whether it is with auditory or visual aids.",
    "Strengths: great peers, the professor was always very supportive and made class engaging, lots of freedom to choose final paper topics and presentations. Weaknesses: would have liked more time in class to practice my Spanish, sometimes if I wasn't forced to participate it was very easy to just sit there and not speak for a whole class. But maybe that's just more on me to force myself to participate.",
    "I honestly really enjoyed this course and learned a lot. One suggestion might be to make it more structured, not from class-to-class, but in an overarching way.",
    "This course enabled me to gain an understanding of a variety of medical concepts, in Spanish. The breadth of the course was helpful, especially for those of us who are not interested in going into medicine but who want to learn more about basic medical issues and their treatments. The weekly writing homework, class presentation, and final paper further enhanced this experience. Also, it was clear that Professor Carreras really cared about the material, which made each of the lectures interesting. This course could be improved by having more speaking practice. For example, students could be required to give 2 presentations instead of just one. Or, there could be small group discussions during class instead of just a lecture.",
    "This is a relaxed course where you practice your spanish! I'd recommend it.",
    "Some of the homework articles were not in Spanish, and I may have possibly gotten more practice if they were in Spanish.",
    "The course is well structured. I liked the medical topics that we covered.",
    "The strengths included a high level of engagement, great relevance to the real world and a teacher that was very involved, passionate about her work and always willing to help.",
    "Strength was written Spanish. Weakness was opportunities to speak Spanish.",
    "This is an awesome course! No improvements needed.",
    "The course is good because it is fun and low-pressure, but I do not feel like I learned anything. Because there were no assessments there was no incentive to memorize or engage with the material.",
    "Fun class, you get out what you put in."

    "Yes, definitely! If Professor Carreras is teaching, definitely take it.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "Definitely! It is an effective to improve and\/or refine your Spanish, while learning things that are useful in the context of your everyday life.",
    "Yes! The course has a very relaxed pace, but is still interesting, stimulating, and engaging.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who wants to improve their Spanish in general, and specifically medical vocabulary. It's also super interesting for people who are interested in science but aren't premed. Seriously, the course is surprisingly science-heavy.",
    "I would recommend this course. It enabled me to gain an understanding of a variety of medical concepts, in Spanish. The breadth of the course was helpful, especially for those of us who are not interested in going into medicine but who want to learn more about basic medical issues and their treatments. The weekly writing homework, class presentation, and final paper further enhanced this experience. Also, it was clear that Professor Carreras really cared about the material, which made each of the lectures interesting. Overall, the course was quite easy, with a very manageable workload. When you show up the first couple of days, Professor will send people away because the room is full. However, keep coming because by the following week 1\/3 of the upperclassmen who were allowed to stay will not have actually taken the course.",
    "Yes! Great way to practice spanish in a low-stress environment.",
    "Absolutely. If you are looking to improve your Spanish speaking and listening, while learning medical terminology at the same time, this class is great.",
    "I definitely would recommend it. Its a really fun class, Professor Carreras is awesome!",
    "This was an amazing course that not only provides a very practical and interesting set of knowledge, but the class is fun and has an absolutely amazing teacher!",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes. It was a fun and interesting class.",
    "yes.",
    "yes, a very niche course for students who are interested in medicine. It's very interesting if you are interested in medicine.",
    "Yes",
    "This course is a gut. You will learn very little and often feel confused about why you are watching an episode of House in English, only to become more confused when the class ends with a Ricky Martin music video. There is little work and little in class engagement. Your spanish will not be improved by this class.",
    "Great L5 course and not a ton of work."
