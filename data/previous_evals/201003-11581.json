    "I think this course needs more social scientist input (which Dave acknowledges and tried to redress). It might be good to have some more general readings to unify the class discussion. However, the workshop aspect of the course was really useful, and Dave's insights into the PhD process were extremely helpful. He always knows what to say, and he reads people very well. Both he and Jonathon helped me a lot on my final project, and I enjoyed following the work of my classmates too.",
    "Q10: Course relevanceThe pace of the course was slow owing to the self-direction associated with student projects. Paired guest lectures and conversations with the speaker were very interesting on nearly all topics, and offered perspective for those considering academic, research or policy focused careers. Being provided a safe and engaged space to float research ideas, formulate methods or draft grant\/fellowship applications was invaluable. Adding official readings to the course would detract from this. The current focus is perfect."

Even though speakers were not necessarily within my exact field, I still found it very helpful to learn about the paths they chose and the decisions that were made along the way.",

    "I think we need more of a common language amongst the doctoral students -- more general readings and perhaps more divisive speakers would help.",
    "Possibly one or two required readings on scientific method etc., but not more. More speakers with an explicit social science focus - although the instructor made mention of the difficulty in confirming speakers from social science disciplines.",
    "The only thing that really disappointed me was the behavior of the class as a whole. It seemed painfully obvious when people weren't engaged and the fact that there were so many open computers seemed completely disrespectful to the guest speakers. I'm not sure whether there is anything that can be done structurally to mend this, but it was frustrating nonetheless.",
    "ideally, class discussion should be facilitated by an instructor in the lull and transition periods, while students should have primary voice during all other times.extremely competitive"

    "I thought that this was a good introduction to the doctoral program. It was interesting to learn more about the structure of the program and the rough path that all of us will be taking in the next few years.",
    "Exposure to a variety of topics in Environmental Studies was critical to my overall education this semester. I appreciated being introduced to areas in which I had no background or knowledge. I feel that this exposure enhanced my ability 1) to recognize the full spectrum of environmental issues being addressed,2) to appreciate the breadth and depth of scientific research underway, and 3) to weave common themes together from this array of research that deepen my understanding of my own focus area. This exposure is a superb balancing mechanism to prevent doctoral students from becoming myopic. It forces us to learn and think about topics beyond our scope, ultimately making us better equipped to generate insights about our own topic."
