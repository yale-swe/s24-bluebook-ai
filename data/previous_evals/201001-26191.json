    "Awesome. Yes. Please see 1 and 2.",
    "good class, not to much of a committment",
    "Take this course with Ame Cividanes! You will learn a lot and she is very understanding and caring. The course is not that difficult.",
    "Take it if you need the requirement or want to learn Spanish better.",
    "Spanish 140 is basically a continuation of 130. You'll have small to medium assignments basically every night, but they're useful for the most part. Take it!",
    "More grammar work and things of that nature. A good transition with more reading and speaking, but still heavy on the grammar",
    "Take it. It's a must. If you care about speaking Spanish take it with Cividanes and take L4. It might seem tedious at times and you might not want to go to class come the second half of the semester but you'll walk away with a lot of knowledge.",
    "The course did a really great job integrating literature, movies, and culture into Spanish language. For example, I loved the novella we read at the end, and all of our stories had great grammar and great vocabulary. I also felt like my writing improved because we experimented with more and more advanced grammatical forms and I learned how to write with them. I did not feel, however, like my speaking improved very much. Most of our conversations were about trivial matters that were sparked by vocabulary, and I feel like my conversational skills are the same as before (although perhaps I can listen better).Doctora Cividanes is a fantastic woman. She is extremely nice, and she cares about her students. Her strengths as a teacher I think are that she cares a lot about pronunciation, so she will teach you how to pronounce words correctly, both by going over them carefully, stopping you as you speak, and serving as a role model because she speaks really well. She is also great at teaching literature. I wish she had had us speak more often about more substantive things.The course is not too difficult-- the same level as L3 (or a little easier since there is less new material).",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. However, the grading is very difficult. In fact, Spanish 140 might have been my most difficult class this semester as far as the possibility of getting an A."
