    "We would leave for the site that we were working at (Bethlehem, Pennsylvania), around 1:30 on Friday afternoon, and return around 10 pm Saturday evening. It may seem like a drag to give up your Friday night and your Saturday, but there are only four weekends of digging so it is not too bad. It is also definitely a bonding experience. I am not an archaeology major, but I still enjoyed the class and got a basic introduction to working in the field.",
    "Yes! but conditionally. Don't take it freshman year, the weekends in October are some of my favorites. The safety dance, college screws, parties in general, plus the talks and just general merriment is too much to sacrifice. As a sophomore, I missed them a lot, but I'm glad i've had one full fall at Yale, and two more.Other than that, its a really fun course. The weekends are a lot better than you'd think, and were at points much better than at Yale. It's nice to get away. And who does work between Friday at 1 and Saturday at 11pm? You can even still go to Toads. Like whoa, right?You learn a lot, and have a lot of fun doing it. I don't know when else, as a non-major, I would have been able to have this opportunity. It's really interesting work. Bethlehem is a beautiful little town, and has a fabulous history. Definitely skive off work at some point to explore.So, sophomores through seniors, take this class. Freshman, stay on Old Campus while you can. So maybe you sillimanders andTD kids should take is any year..."
