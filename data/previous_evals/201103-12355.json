    "great class. so helpful.",
    "This class can be extremely boring at times because the lectures are so long and it is at 9 in the morning. HOWEVER, it is also full of SO MANY THINGS that you will learn something, and not all of it is boring. A lot of it is actually really interesting. I didn't take a section, so that probably made my life a bit more difficult when it came time for papers, but in general, it's a decent way to get some background in the Middle East.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! It is the best course I have taken at Yale! You will learn tons,the work is minimal and the professor is amazing!",
    "I would definitely recommend to anyone to take this course. It is not so complicated, yet it is certainly necessary to keep up with the readings. Readings and lectures are very interesting and the professor is excelent.",
    "A broad overview and introduction of the Middle East from the prophet Muhammad's journey to Medina in 622 to the present day, which is a must-take if you haven't had exposure to any Middle Eastern history before (I hadn't). It's a nice mix of history with some culture thrown in, and the second half of the course focuses mostly on the 20th century, going all the way up to the Arab Spring. Professor Foster is what made the course for me \u0097 he's extremely knowledgeable and has also spent time living and studying in the Middle East so he can tell stories, especially when you get up to the 70's, about being there and what he saw and experienced. He also tied some of the events in the course to Yale history, which was a plus. Basically he made the material very relevant and interesting and despite this course being at 9 am I would always look forward to it.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn anything about the Middle East. Super broad overview that will really teach you about this area of the world. Just go to the Friday optional sections so you don't write the paper - the TA was amazing and the lectures super interesting. There is a lot of material to go through (this is really a history course even though it's not cross-listed -- although it should be), so be aware of that before entering, but it's totally manageable. He also accepts outlines instead of essays on the midterm and final, so you don't even have to write any coherent essay so long as you write an amazing outline with all of yourinformation. Take this class!",
    "Intro the Middle East is a great way to get a sense of the paths that each country in the Middle East has taken since the rise of Islam, in order to understand their complex interactions today. I highly recommend the course to anyone looking for a foundation to do more specific case studies of the Middle East.",
    "This is a great survey course of the Middle East (pre-Islamic times until today). Readings are extensive and sometimes overwhelming, but mostly interesting. Prof. Foster is a superb teacher with old-school methods \u0096 don't expect any in-class discussions, he presents his profound and knowledgable view on the subject and you have to accept it as is. Take his course if you want to get an intensive introduction to the subject by a great professor, but don't mind the many readings and his ex-cathedra teaching style.",
    "Lectures are interesting. Readings are interesting. Foster is the man! And you learn about the Middle East and why stuff is happening. Winning.",
    "I'd recommend it; I feel a lot like I can read the news about the Middle East and actually understand what's going on.",
    "If you don't know much about the Middle East, definitely take this class! It imparted to me an understanding of the geography, history, and politics of the region, and that is so relevant and important in today's world. It is a broad survey course, so we never got into great detail about a subject, but this is an essential foundation course to understand the situation in the Middle East today.",
    "It's great. Period.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class for a grounding in Middle East history. I feel quite conversant on topics regarding the Middle East, and I have this class to thank for that.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to people who don't have a strong foundation on the Middle East and would like to form a greater understanding that builds from the past to the present. There is a good amount of reading and memorization involved, since this is essentially a history course, so be prepared for a good amount of work, but it's worth it.",
    "Before deciding to take this class, you need to understand the different \"options\". You can do the \"standard\" thing, which involves two exams and a final paper; or you can go to optional Friday lectures given by a TA, which exempts you from the paper (otherwise there are just two lectures a week); OR, you can be in the writing section, which will give you a WR credit in exchange for going to a seminar-like section with a TA on Fridays, doing extra reading, and writing almost-weekly reading responses and three 5-page papers (and you also get out of the single final paper). I did the writing section option. If you are in thewriting section, your entire section grade counts for 1\/3 of your total grade (plus 1\/3 midterm and 1\/3 final equals 100%), which seems a bit unfair because you do a LOT of work over the semester and it doesn't count for much, whereas the exams will have what seems like a disproportionate weight. Now that you know that, some other thoughts: If you are not good at memorizing lots of names and dates and other historical facts, the exams will seem pretty hard, and you are pretty much left on your own to prepare for them. Lectures are like drinking from a firehose: the information just keeps coming and it's hard to keep up, such that if your mind drifts for 10 seconds you may never realize what held the train of thought together or why the whole rest of history came out the way it did. If you do all the readings, this problem will be ameliorated, because lectures are heavily based on the readings, but good luck with that, because including all the reading for the writing section, there's somewhere around 1500 or 2000 pages of reading, and it's (mostly) not fast or light. As for the writing section, it might not be worth it if you don't need the WR, but if you do, it's decent and you get to write about whatever relevant topic you want, if you like that sort of thing. Grading for responses and papers is more based on your writing than content. With the writing section, this may be one of your harder classes; without, it will be much easier.",
    "Great class! Just a lot of material. Exams are very fair.",
    "It was a great orientation to middle eastern history. I approve this class for any student who really wants to learn more about this part of the world (Also, there are various class options, ranging from Wr seminar or to just mid\/fin).",
    "Take this course. I didn't know as much about the history of the middle east - particularly the las 100 years - before this class. Now I can appreciate how much the Western powers influenced the development in the region.",
    "Because of the ambitious scope of the course, it is necessarily a broad survey. It is a helpful introduction to the region, but because of this survey nature, is probably not as gripping or engaging as a more specifically focused and in-depth class."
