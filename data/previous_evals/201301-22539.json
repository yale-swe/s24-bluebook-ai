   "comments": [
    "Take this class! Professor Dimock is wonderful and the reading list is great.",
    "Take it if you love literature and you love discussions. The novels are absolutely beautiful, and the discussions absolutely worth your time. It's also very stress-free because besides the reading, which you may not have to finish all the time, there are only 2 papers and a small presentation into the novels, which is just basically easing the discussion in at the beginning of each class by present the storyline and putting down a few questions on the table.",
    "Probably not, but here's how I would break it down. If you really like the reading list and really like comparative literature, then take it. If you want your writing to improve, think you'll be busy with other classes, and prefer close reading of the texts, then take a more standard freshman English class.",
    "Not a bad WR credit, good reading list.",
    "I'd recommend the class as a great way to expand one's horizons beyond the \"classics\" of American literature and get into some city-specific gems. Also an opportunity to read more contemporary literature.",
    "Literary Cities sounds a bit cooler than it was, but it wasn't too much workand it's a writing credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course if the student enjoys reading novels and is a fast reader.",
    "Great class, great reading list! The workload isn't too much and the readings are really fun so they don't even feel like homework.",
    "A fantastic class to take as a freshman. Wai Chee Dimock is wonderful--a true expert in the field who genuinely cares about her students. The reading list is a joy and the papers give you plenty of freedom to explore whatever aspect of the books that you like.",
    "The reading list for the Literary Cities seminar includes a nice mix of contemporary and classic novels, but realize that you are expected to read a full novel per week. Class discussion are generally interesting and laid-back. Prof Dimock is very warm and understanding as a professor and genuinely enjoys working with\/getting to know her students."
