   "comments": [
    "I would NOT recommend this course, this was by far my least favorite course I have taken at Yale. The material was dry and the professor failed to engage students in any interesting and creative way. The 75 min class period was way too long, and I failed to learn anything cohesive in the course of the semester. Additionally, my Spanish skills get worse over the semester since there is little opportunity to practice speaking in class and homework consists of readings and a writing one paper.",
    "It's a brief history of Spain, both historically and culturally. I would recommend it to other students who feel confident in their Spanish.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a bit more work than it appears. The readings are a bit heavy, but you learn what to take in and what's fluff. Final and midterm are open note, don't be fooled though-they're mighty tricky and graded strictly. Overall a pretty good class, although I expected easier.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. Interesting material and manageable workload.",
    "This is a history course in Spanish, essentially, that covers topics in Spain's cultural history since the 15th and 16th centuries. An open note midterm and final, with two page-long responses and a trabajo final (7-10 pages). I suggest it to strong Spanish speakers, or at least those more than competent at reading comprehension.",
    "If you want to continue your spanish skills and learn a lot information about Spain but don't want to get too over your head, this is a good class for you.",
    "I would recommend taking this course CR\/D\/F since there are a lot of assignments and readings. I took the course for credit to brush up on my Spanish skills and learn some new things about Spanish culture, and I got exactly what I wanted out of the class.",
    "It is an overview of the cultures of Spain. The class is not too difficult and a great way of keeping up with Spanish skills. I would recommend it.",
    "I took the class to maintain my language skills after studying abroad in a Spanish speaking country. While I LOVED discussing places I'd just visited in Spain, there wasn't a lot of interaction required on students behalf which meant that I was not able to work towards maintaining my conversational skills. The reading was also hefty and I feel the pay off would have been stronger had the reading been assigned at a slower pace and had we spent more time working through the readings.",
    "Probably not. Definitely don't take this Credit\/D which a lot of people ended up doing. It's a lot of little work for the credit and you are expected to participate.If you have taken L5 it's easy to comprehend in class, although so many of the readings are pretty tough to get through.If you really want to take a spanish class this is not the worse L5. I wish we had more options....."
