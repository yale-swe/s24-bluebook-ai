    "I recommend the course to students who have at least some programming background and who are willing to spend a lot of time on this course.",
    "I would tell a fellow student that GENE 760 is a time consuming and frustrating course, but that you do learn fundamental skills of genomic analyses in this course. Ultimately I would only recommend this course to students who either had some computational experience or who would not have another opportunity to learn these skills in a different setting.",
    "It introduces the basic concepts in genomic analysis and teaches about how to use the tools for analysis.",
    "GENE760 is an introduction to programming for use in various genomic analyses. You will complete the course with a basic understanding of RNA-seq, CHIP-seq, and exome analysis. This course requires a lot of independent study, so be prepared to teach yourself most of the programming.",
    "It is a difficult course. Without prior knowledge of coding, the 13-hour crash course does little to help you float in a sea of confusion. Prepare for hours of hair-ripping frustration in front of the problem sets.",
    "I would recommend the course to students who are at least familiar with Python and Unix. Otherwise, the course and the assignments takes considerable amount of time to fully comprehend."

    "This course shows how the analysis of genomics data actually works. The problem sets are time-intensive but completely worth it."
