   "comments": [
    "I dont know how the new professor would be but history 115 is an amazing course and incredibly relevant to all facets of american history and culture.",
    "Kind of ridiculously boring, but easy with an engaging lecturer. You don't have to work too hard to get a good grade.",
    "Take this class if you like American history. It provides a great cultural look at colonial America and was relatively easy!",
    "This class is actually amazing. I took it with extremely low expectations, but Demos surprised me every day with how much there is to learn about like, 100 years of American history. It is a lot of reading, but it's absolutely fascinating. It's a cohesive, expansive, and in-depth survey course of what life was actually life in the early American colonies, and I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "Strongly recommend it if the Professor is as engaging. Interesting subject, makes you appreciate both the benefits and consequences of the colonial period in US history.",
    "This class was great and you should definitely take it if you are interested in the subject. Professor Demos is an amazing lecturer, but since he doesn't use powerpoints (he does have visuals on handouts and gives out each lecture's note outline on a worksheet), some people might be bored by the lack of visual stimulation. Everything Professor Demos says is amazing, though, and super interesting, so if you can get past his old-school teaching style, is is SO worth it. Also, Professor Demos has an extensive personal collection of colonial artifacts which he brings in for the class to try and to touch. That is really cool too, and a definite perk. Lastly, if you can get Mike as a TF (if he's still TF'ing for the class), do it. He is amazing. Awesome class overall.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it, although I don't believe it's being taught again. If they ever revive the course, it really won't be the same without Professor Demos. It was an unbelievablecourse and a very unique way of studying history (looking at social themes rather than facts). Best history course I've ever taken.",
    "This course is an intensive study of colonial american history. Do not take it if you do not want to read 10 books about the subject, one per week. Although it only has 1 paper, 1 midterm, and 1 final, the grading is harsh and often, the work you put into it does not result in the final course grade.",
    "Not sure how it will be without Demos. Section counts for a lot of your grade, so make sure to go. The material's interesting (even for someone not particularly interested in colonial history).",
    "This is a pretty interesting course--it challenges all the assumptions you have about this country's beginnings. Great readings, fun and easy paper assignment. It will not be the same without John Demos--he's one of a kind.",
    "AMST 188 is a general survey course in pre-Revolutionary America. The workload is pretty typical for an American Studies class, in my experience: a book each week, midterm, 1 paper (~8 pages), and a final. The paper is a great assignment, even if it seems like a lot of work at first (taking a given set of court records and analyzing them for one specific person's lifetime or the history of one crime - at first it can seem really hard to draw connections, but once you do its a really great assignment). Professor Demos really made the class, so its too bad this will be the last time he teaches it. Try to get Mara Caden as a TA if you can - she's absolutely fantastic.",
    "Great lecture--mostly due to John Demos. However, the content is still great, it's a social approach to 17th century America (so very little in terms of dates\/politicians\/battles).",
    "Absolutely, great course.",
    "Interesting lecture, if you're interested in social and cultural history. But very weak on the facts and dates.",
    "I would recommend this class. Although I found there to be a lot of reading, the readings and lectures were very interesting. I especially liked how Professor Demos brought objects into class to show us."
