   "comments": [
    "I will definitely recommend taking the course to every student with a sufficient knowledge of the Japanese language. The course would allow the student, through some work, to develop a deep understanding of the material, and to establish his\/her critical approach toward it.",
    "I would recomment Japanese 885 only to students who are highly confident in their Japanese reading skills, as well as their writing skills. Students must be willing to contribute strongly and effectively to class discussion, and submit original research papers that will be evaluated very closely. I would recommend the class only to undergraduates with exceptional skills, but to all graduate students with the appropriate Japanese skills.",
    "This class involves reading and discussing works of fiction and related criticism from different decades, late 1800s - present. Highly recommended for serious students of modern Japanese literature; that said, students who do not have a reading knowledge of classical Japanese or are unfamiliar with old forms of kanji characters may have a hard time with the readings from earlier periods."

   "comments": [
    "The course has deepen my knowledge, and increased my understanding of the discipline.",
    "This class is where I am currently getting the meat of my knowledge of my discipline at the moment. With so few Japanese literature professors currently at Yale, this class has been essential to my learning about Japanese literature. I have been exposed to a wide variety of Japanese literature across a broad time period, and become familiar with many fiction writers as well as critics and academics."
