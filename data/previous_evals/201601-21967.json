    "I would say that this is the closest thing you're going to get to a conservatory-style course at Yale. It's an excellent course for anyone seriously interested in going into theater professionally as it helps you prepare for the dive into the real world of the arts.",
    "Take this class if you want some practical skills going into professional auditions. Don't take this class just to try out theatre.",
    "Great performance class!",
    "An advanced musical theater performance class with biweekly performance assignments and several New York performance opportunities. I would highly recommend.",
    "Take it take it!!!! Master class type feel each week with a huge amount of performance opportunity... Papers and journaling too",
    "If you are a performer or a director you have to take this class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Just do it. You will get the kind of opportunities you could never imagine having access to as an undergraduate. Just do yourself a favor and do the thing.",
    "A great class! It provides you the practical experience, instruction, and knowledge you need to be successful in musical theatre. Annette Jolles is a gem! Speaking practically, her knowledge and connections in the professional world are indispensable. She expects a lot from you, which is motivating, but she is also the nicest, most compassionate, most genuine person. She wants each and every one of us to succeed, so she pushes you to make you better. She cares so much about her students, and it shows in everything she does. I absolutely adore her and cannot say enough incredible things about her. You get out of this class what you put in, so make sure you have the time and desire to really pour yourself into this work. Definitely recommend! A HUGE thank you to the Shen Curriculum!"
