    "Take it if you are at all interested in psychology.",
    "Take this course. Really. Take it any of your four years, but make sure you do at some point. It's certainly not a gut, but it's absolutely worth it.",
    "Highly recommended",
    "I consider this as one of the \"must-take\" courses here at Yale, especially if the professor for the term is Paul Bloom. He is an exceptional lecturer, and often incorporates humor into his lectures. I looked forward to going to every lecture.What you learn in this course will help you understand life and the world so much better. You'll learn about the psychological explanations of ethnic conflict and ultranationalism. You'll learn about the causes behind love and relationships. You'll learn about how people can become superstitious, and reasons for which religion exists.You'll love the textbook as well. It's well-written and has a lot of humor. Occasionally, you'll get annoyed at how long it takes to finish reading a chapter.",
    "This class is way too overhyped. Reasons not to take it:1. the tests have really weird questions, some that aren't even from the reading or lectures.2. Professor Bloom promises you that his lecture will \"radically transform how you think!\" but it never does.3. the TAs don't care about you. actually, they hate you. duh, they're psych grad students.The reading responses are easy shmeasy; my TA even told me that as long as the response is the minimum word requirement and it's at least a little close to topical, then you'll pass.",
    "I'd never taken a psych class before coming to Yale, and thought Psychology 110 was a fascinating introduction. Psychology 110 was fantastic. I learned a lot from and really enjoyed both the lectures and the readings. The videos we were asked to watch outside of class were also very informative and enlightening. Some of the test questions were somewhat random. Paul Bloom is GREAT though, and I was never bored. I highly recommend it!!!",
    "I loved this class. Paul Bloom is such an amazing professor. He is brilliant but was able to explain everything in a way that everyone could understand.Attending lectures is necessary for doing well in the class. And there really is no point to skipping lecture since Paul Bloom is such an amazing speaker. But if you do, he posts the lecture notes online.The reading can be pretty extensive. However, I never did it until the night before the exams (there are three over the course and no final during finals week which is nice). Although it was probably stupid to do it all the night before, I enjoyed not having homework during the periods between exams.As a freshman it may be a bit daunting at first, so I highly recommend staying on top of reading and lectures especially before the first exam.I have no interest in studying Psych in the future, but Paul Bloom was definitely worth it.",
    "YES! Take this class, regardless of your major, because its implications are relevant for any other subject you might study and everyday life in general. It was very interesting and even though there was a lot of work, it was all paced out nicely. Take it!",
    "GREAT! Just make sure you do all of the reading, ESPECIALLY for the first exam, which is the hardest by far. Read each week, don't cram beforehand, and make study guides for yourself based on the reading and lecture. If you do well on the first exam, you're set for the class.And ALWAYS read Bloom's book for the book review due at the end of the semester. Why? Because he incorporates a lot of his knowledge into the lectures, and if you read his book you end up learning a lot of things necessary for exams. It's a 2 for 1 special.",
    "It was a really interesting and engaging class. Everyone should try to take this at some point, it's really that essential. Marvin Chun was a guest lecturer and he seemed pretty good too. I would still recommend Paul Bloom though. The course workload wasn't too bad. About a chapter of the textbook every week (around 30 pages) but the readings were fun. I did it on the elliptical at the gym to make time pass more quickly. The reading responses were not too hard and the exams were very fair and not too hard. Overall, great class!",
    "TAKE!!! Psych 110 is an amazing class, and you will LOVE the lectures. There is a lot of information, but if you put the time it the workload is very manageable. Paul Bloom is AMAZING, and doing wellon his exams is extremely rewarding. It is a really fascinating, dynamic survey class, and the textbook is interesting and funny. Make sure you do all the reading; going to lecture is EXTREMELY fun, but you need to do both to do well.",
    "Psych 110 is an awesome class. I would tell another student that if they wanted to learn material that they could use to improve their own lives, they should take this course. Also, I would highly recommend Paul Bloom to them as an instructor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It was my favorite one this term. We had three tests, weekly reading responses, an essay, and served as subjects in experiments. Prof Bloom is very funny and engaging. Be really to feel anonymous though! The class is huge!!!",
    "Psychology 110 is a very broad introduction to many fields of psychology. The workload is very fair, but the questions can be very detailed on tests. Be sure to do all the readings and attend all lectures if you want to do well. Professor Bloom is an excellent professor.",
    "Definitely! Professor Bloom has amazing lectures!",
    "I would absolutely recommend Psych110 to another student! It was interesting and provided a lot of information.",
    "Psych110 is an absolutely wonderful intro psych course. Each lecture essentially gives you a taste of a different branch of psychology - from developmental psychology to social psychology to moral psychology to neuroscience. We touched on everything from language to memory to emotions to psychological disorders. If you think you might be at all interested in psych, TAKE THIS COURSE. I took this as a first semester freshman and it's made me think I want to be a psych major. Professor Bloom is so engaging that psych lecture literally becomes something to look forward to in your week. We also had 3 guest lecturers, all of whom were great - Peter Salovey taught us how to make other people fall in love with us. The readings are a mix of the textbook and magazine articles from the New York Times, the Atlantic, and the New Yorker. There are also several short videos you're assigned to watch of psychologists explaining a bit about their work. Great material + great professor + reasonable workload = one class you do not want to miss! There is also an experimental participation component, which requires you to volunteer for grad students' psych experiments. While this can get tedious, it's a valuable way to experience what psych research is like.",
    "Yes! You learn so much in this class that's very, very applicable to everyday life.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!! Paul Bloom is INCREDIBLE - he's so much fun to listen to and lecture is never boring (on the contrary: I always loved going to lecture and was usually sad when it was over and Paul Bloom was done talking). It's extremely interesting even if you are not at all interested in psychology. Also, TONS of people take it so you are bound to have a lot of friends also in the class (especially if you are a freshman), so I recommend forming a study group - that's what my friends and I did and it was extremely helpful. This class is a great overview of the whole field of psychology so it's especially great to take if you are planning on going on to study psych in more detail. Finally: If you've taken AP Psychology and are planning on skipping this class, don't skip it. I took AP and took this class and there certainly is some overlap, but a lot of it is new material and Paul Bloom is definitely worth learning some things again.",
    "Psych 110 is a great class with interesting material and a great lecturer (Paul Bloom). I feel Psych 110 is a class everyone at Yale should take. The one drawback about the class is the amount of reading and the specificity of questions on the test. This is no joke intro class, so be prepared to work hard. But your hard work is worthwhile because the material is so interesting and applicable to real life.",
    "Awesome class. Take this class pass\/fail with Bloom and you will not regret it. Get all the fun and joy out the class without having to worry about the curves too much.",
    "This is an amazing course - not one you want to miss over your 4 years at Yale. Professor Bloom and Marvin Chun are equally incredible orators, and will totally capture you in their explanations of the inner workings of your mind. WARNING: there is more work in this course than some people will lead you to believe. There are 3 exams (no final), but when it comes time to study for them, often you realize there was just too much reading assigned each week to have kept up with it all, so you have hundreds of pages to read and memorize. This course requires extreme pacing yourself and somehow deciding what's important to read and what you can skip.",
    "YES. it is great. don't think it is going to be easy. but the class is great.",
    "This class is extremely self-motivated. You are expected to keep up with the readings, although it is not mandatory to do so. However, it is highly discouraged to leave readings until just before the exam. These concepts are broad (as expected in an introductory course), and thus expect to spend additional time studying and reading outside of class for extended periods of time (unless you have already taken AP Psychology, at which point you would have a slight advantage in simple recall of information).",
    "I would recommend this class to every student at Yale, Pysch major or not. Especially with Paul Bloom, this class is one of my favorites at Yale. Despite the difficulty I had with the tests, I still enjoyed the class very much. A lot of material covered in a little bit of time but very interesting. Very happy to have taken it.",
    "Intro to Psych is a great course, and i would definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You'll learn a lot and Professor Bloom is a great lecturer. The course wasn't necessarily easy (personally, it was my hardest class during that semester) - the reading can take a while and isn't as interesting as the lectures, and the tests focus on details sometimes. Overall though, I really enjoyed the class.",
    "Take it. You'll learn a lot, you'll work a lot, you'll have a lot of fun.",
    "Psych 110 gives a basic overview of psychology as a whole. I would recommend it because I think a lot of people would find the material intriguing.",
    "Yes! I think this class gives a great overview of the main principles and theories in psychology today, and you might even learn a few tips on picking up dates and raising children. I would recommend it!",
    "Intro Psych is perfect. I dearly wish that it were a four-year course.",
    "If you didn't take AP Psych, go for it.",
    "Excellent course. Paul Bloom never failed to give stunning lectures, interesting topics, and superb guest lecturers.",
    "Recommended only if you have a genuine interest in psychology or you will hate the course.",
    "Like I said before, the perfect class to take credit\/d\/fail if you know you're not a psych major. I wasn't sure whether I wanted to major it in or not, so I took in A-F, which is fine, but if you take it cr\/d, you'll spare yourself some late-night studying hours and frustration over some I-can't-believe-they-actually-asked-me-that multiple choice questions.Overall, you learn a lot, and you have a relatively good time doing it.",
    "Great class, interesting and an easy A. Tests are challenging, but if you do the readings you will be fine. Plus Prof Bloom is amazing!",
    "It's awesome. I'd recommend it to another student because the subject matter is interesting.",
    "An interesting class led by a great lecturer. Worth taking for everyone, and can really spark your interest in the way we make decisions and see the world.",
    "Definitely a class that should be taken before graduation. The material covered in this class literally blow my mind every time.",
    "Good intro class, fairly interesting",
    "Don't get behind on the reading, and go to all the lectures -- they're fun and important, and if you do those two things, studying for the tests is super easy.",
    "If you took AP and want an easy class, fine. If you didn't, prepare for a lot of reading. The course is good and not too difficult, although the tests had a wide variety of difficulty. I believe everyone should know basic psychology regardless of what they're studying because they will have to interact with people. Take the class, pro's outweigh the cons's.",
    "PSYC 110 is very much an intro\/overview course, which is fun, but not thoroughly intellectually stimulating. It's kind of fun to be in such a huge class, and the lectures and readings are interesting. You have an experimental participation requirement and weekly reading responses, so be aware that you can't just put everything off.",
    "Very interesting course. I would recommend it to anybody, regardless of major.",
    "Psych 110 was a fantastic overview of intriguing psychological concepts. I found myself telling my friends all about random experiments I was learning about during the course. There's a lot of reading, but if you attend lectures and complete the reading it's not overwhelming. The TFs were extremely helpful, and Professor Bloom is amazingly friendly and accessible despite his celebrity...great class. Take it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, unless one hates lots of reading. The textbook reading was pretty well balanced with other aids like videos and articles, but it still required a significant time investment. Interestingly, though, the textbook was one of the funniest and most engaging I've come across.",
    "Covers a wide range of topics in Psych. Everyone should take it, just because it gives you such an interesting perspective into the human mind.",
    "Professor Bloom is a really good professor and he makes the lectures informative and interesting. Many of the subjects discussed sometimes seems redundant but it makes you think about things that although seem self explanatory you never thought about in the past. This is a good introduction in psychology and it's useful whether or not you are interested in majoring psychology.",
    "I would recommend this class for a fellow student, although I would advise them to study everything, and although it seems that some information is more important than others, it does not make a difference for the tests.",
    "Good intro class. Surprisingly harder to get an A than you think though.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course because the material is very interesting, there is no final exam and the professor is amazing.",
    "Take it!",
    "Paul Bloom is maybe the best lecturer you'll have. It's worth it as a backdrop for the rest of life. Do it.",
    "Absolutely recommended. Both Bloom and Chun are known to be great lecturers. Psychology itself is so fascinating.",
    "Yes. So interesting, definitely should be taken no matter what one's major is.",
    "I would uber-highly recommend this course. I'm an econ major, but this class was INCREDIBLE. A MUST-TAKE.",
    "It's both a large-scale and detail oriented study of Psychology. After learning about its history, we studied multiple topics including human nature and mental diseases. I've already recommended intro Psyc to many of my friends. Even if they aren't planning on being psychology majors, the course offers many interesting insights on the human mind.",
    "The lectures are tons of fun, but the grading is HARSH, so beware.",
    "I would recommend PYSCH 110 to ANYONE. Best class i've ever taken. No joke.",
    "Its an interesting class but its too much work.",
    "very interesting class. you get what you put into it for sure",
    "A very good introductory course. It will keep your attention.",
    "I strongly recommend other students to take Introduction to Psychology! The course is one of the courses which would be most useful in my life! Professor Bloom is a great lecturer and I have learnt many interesting concepts. Moreover, writing the book review was a wonderful experience!",
    "This is the best class I took this semester! Take it--you cannot graduate from Yale without taking it or else you are missing out on something amazing! Paul Bloom is the most incredible lecturer and I learned so much from this class. It was fascinating, engaging, and moved at just the right pace. I wish I could take it again.",
    "I would most definitely recommend Psych 110! It is a comprehensive look at the field of psychology and the things we learned are completely mind-blowing. This was the most enjoyable class I have ever taken, and although there were reading and writing assignments, the material was so interesting that it didn't even feel like homework.",
    "This class is a must take. Even if you aren't interested in Psychology, Professor Bloom makes it interesting. I didn't think I'd enjoy this class this much, but now I'm thinking about majoring in Psych.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Dr. Bloom is a great teacher. His skills as a speaker and his funny\/interesting lecture slides and examples made each lecture an engaging experience.",
    "You would be hard put to find a class that offers material more engaging, relevant, and easy to understand. This class truly is a survey course of many subjects related to psychology, so you will dabble in a little bit of everything and find what interests you most. Professor Bloom is a great lecturer, explaining concepts efficiently and humorously. If you have any interest at all in human behavior, you're bound to like this course.",
    "Super interesting class. Difficult. A lot of the exams were word for word out of the textbook and random stories that Bloom told. If you do not go to lecture or read, it'll be impossible. Even if you do both, it is still challenging.",
    "I would certainly recommend Intro Psych to another student! The class is always interesting, and the material covered is so relevant to every human being. This is one of those classes that changes the way you look at yourself and the world.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, Professor Bloom is a brilliant, engaging, and most importantly engaged lecturer that makes you want to come to class. The topics covered are fascinating and what we learned in class was often extremely pertinent to my own life (think: perception, attraction, mood disorders). If I had any criticism of the class, it would be that it was a bit frustratingly broad and that I often wanted to go more in depth into the subjects we touched upon. However, I think that this is an inevitable aspect of such a broad introductory course. TAKE IT :)",
    "Intro Psych is an amazing course and I definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to take it. Professor Bloom is an amazing lecturer and the readings are fun because you actually learn about other people's behavior and why they do\/say certain things. We learned about dreams, relationships, happiness, the unconscious and the brain... There are a lot of readings for each exam, so you might not want to get behind. Also, exams are super detailed, so the little things matter.",
    "An awesome class with a great lecturer, that is very interesting. The tests require a lot of studying but not too much work other than that. The readings are very interesting and you learn a ton about psychology and you find yourself using that knowledge in everyday life. Fun, interesting, and useful information.",
    "Yes! Great course. A must-take course for Yale.",
    "Take it! If you're pretty sure you're not going into Psychology as a major and just take it for the fun, I'd recommend taking it credit\/D. It's not a particularly tough course, but it does take a lot of effort to get an A. It would bemuch more relaxing if there's no pressure to score high. It's really important to read and study the textbook as well as the lectures. Sometimes the questions on the midterms could be very detailed, but they were usually easy to study for. You either know ir or you don't.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Paul Bloom is a great lecturer and he makes Psychology seem really interesting. Professor Chun also teaches this class and I've heard he is just as good. If you've every been curious about the field of Psychology and want to see what its all about definitely take this class.",
    "This is a great course, I definitely recommend it to everyone. Paul Bloom is a great professor and his lectures are very good.",
    "Take it. It's fun, interesting. Best class I took this semester by far.",
    "BEST COURSE AT YALE. You just need to be on top of your work; it's VERY easy to slip up because the class SEEMS like a gut, but it really isn't. Naturally, a good survey course on psychology. Take with Bloom. BLOOM = GOD.",
    "Psychology 101 is a good introduction to psychology, and I would recommend it if you want to get a taste of what psychology is.",
    "This course is NOT A GUT. Although the workload in Psych 110 is manageable, the tests, which count towards much of your grade, definitely have the potential to make your grade suffer, not because they are difficult necessarily, but because they often test you on obscurities hidden in the textbook. Moreover, since most kids receive about the same grade on a test, the difference between an A and a B is a matter of points. That being said, it was an interesting course that prompted me to question a number of aspects about the human mind. If you're looking to go into psychology, definitely take this course. If not, be sure that your interest in the subject matter outweighs your desire for a high grade.",
    "Intro to Psych is an interesting course whose work load is not outrageous and is overall not painful to get through. I would also like to say that many of the things you will learn will merely be formalized terminology for what seems like common sense, this at times can make the course slightly boring or lacking in insight. Also, the exams can be very difficult. If you are interested in Psych I would recommend taking this course, but be don't expect to be amazed at everything in it. Also just as a note of advice for the book review, do NOT read Bloom's book, itwill be extremely boring because most of it is an exact repeat of what Bloom will teach you in class.",
    "This is to Yale classes what Robot Unicorn Attack is to online games: a paradigm of greatness.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. There basically was not one part of the course that was bad. The lectures were fascinating and the workload was very manageable. There are only three tests and they're very well-spaced. The final paper isn't even that bad. Even if Psychology isn't your subject, take it just for the experience of taking a class with Paul Bloom.",
    "It is a very good introductory class. If you attend lecture and do some of the reading you will be okay.",
    "**If somebody tells you that this is class is EASY, remember: IT IS ONLY EASY IF YOU DO THE READINGS!!! I made the mistake of listening to a lot of upperclassmen say it was \"easy,\" and then didn't take the class seriously, then did so-so\/poorly.Oh, and a lot of this stuff seems common sense. Essentially, giving terms to common sense stuff. But I guess that is the nature of Intro Psych.Overall: Fine. Never boring. Paul Bloom seems cool.Strength: Never boring; youtube videos were funWeakness: Huge class; reading responses not fun; psych experiments also not fun!!",
    "It was a mildly enjoyable course which gave a good (though sometimes rushed) overview of psychology. Workout load was certainly manageable. If you study and keep up you'll get your A, if you fall behind then you probably wont.",
    "I highly reccommend Intro to Psych with Bloom whether or not you are interested in Psych - I loved it even though I have no intention of taking other Psych courses. It is fascinating material taught by a brilliant professor.",
    "Bloom is an enrapturing professor that allows students to look forward to going to lecture. He brings much of his research into his lectures, which allows students to see a different perspective. However, I felt that his views on evolutionary psychology were somewhat radical, so do not take every fact he presents as a FACT, so to speak.I would highly recommend this to another student. Just be warned, this course has a lot of work and for each exam, Bloom expects you to know EVERYTHING. So don't fall behind on your reading...Other than that, keep up with reading and enjoy!",
    "PROFESSOR BLOOM IS THE BEST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD. I WAS ACTUALLY VERY UPSET TO FIND OUT LECTURE HAD BEEN CANCELLED ONE DAY BECAUSE CLASS WAS THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY WEEK. BLOOM TRULY CARES ABOUT HIS STUDENTS (EVEN THOUGH HE HAS SO MANY). HE IS A FUN AND LOVING GUY. TAKE INTRO PSYCH WITH BLOOM OR YOU WILL REGRET IT!",
    "Psych 110 is a fun, interesting class, but the tests can be somewhat difficult and overly based on fact memorization. I took it Credit\/D, which was a great choice. It was nice to be able to just enjoy the class for what it is--an entertaining overview of psychology--without having to worry too much about memorizing irrelevant trivia.",
    "Great course! Need to study hard for the midterms but interesting information!",
    "rote memorization, better read the textbook by yourself",
    "Great class!! Try to keep up with the reading, you will thank yourself later. The topics are all very interesting, but there is still a ton of material, so don't think it will be easy. Many people bombed the first test.",
    "Great intro to psych with a great professor-- take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student!",
    "you must take this class at some point, it's very interesting and not too much work. readings are long, and you need to do them to do well in the class, but they're interesting so it's not too bad. lectures are also very interesting- professor bloom is a great lecturer, definitely take this class when he's teaching it.",
    "Yes, you will learn so much about how your mind works and the class is very well taught.",
    "This class is definitely worth taking at some point in your Yale career. Bloom is the professor to have. The workload is manageable and the grading is fair. Just know that the lecture and the readings don't always overlap and you're responsible for both.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, even to people who aren't thinking of majoring in psychology. It's about humans and the real world, something we all have to face at some point - so take it! It's an intro class, so keep in mind the curve probably won't help you. Prof. Bloom is down to earth while still being one of the most successful people in his field. Any psychology article you find he's probably quoted in it. He always made class enjoyable, and all of the topics he covered were clear.The workload wasn't bad, a weekly reading response, 3 midterm exams, and one paper. The book review (paper) was actually interesting since all of the options for the book were really good, and the prompt was fun.",
    "It's a really interesting lecture, Bloom is great. There is a lot of reading, but it's not tough stuff, you just have to keep up with it. The reading responses each week can be a pain; they're not hard, just annoying. The tests are not hard, and there is only one paper, which is graded more on content than writing. The tests are well spaced out, and there's no exam, which is nice.",
    "Psych is a very interesting class, but pretty difficult. Make sure to do all the readings and listen to all the lectures. Don't find yourself just sitting in lecture enjoying yourself and forgetting to do the reading. It can be easy in this class, but if you put in the work, you can enjoy an interesting and challenging class.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone. It's really interesting and fun, and a great way to start out your first semester at Yale, since a huge percentage of the freshman class takes it as well. Great way to meet new people. If I could do it over, I might take it pass\/fail just so you can really enjoy the lectures more and not worry about the grade.",
    "I would highly recommend this class, but I would suggest you take it credit\/D\/fail. The material is too interesting to waste all those hours trying to remember how neurons work. You can find social science credits another way. It's a class that you want to sit and bask in, not pull an all-nighter trying to study for the very difficult exams. But besides that, it's a fantastic class, and everyone at Yale should take it. Also, take it with Paul Bloom because Marvin Chun's guest lecture was really boring.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE AND FIND OUT! IT'S AMAZING.",
    "I definitely recommend this class! The lectures are super-interesting, and the reading is pretty interesting too--it's possible to have fun with the reading responses (and okay to not do them all). But while this class is fun, and less work than the average class, the exams are harder than you'll probably expect and it is NOT an easy A. Also, don't let the experimental credit screw you over. Start before midterms. Upperclassmen, Credit D if you don't need the social science! If you're thinking of being a Psych major, Paul Bloom may well convince you to go for it.",
    "I LOVED this class. It was by far my favorite course this semester, and I always looked forward to it. Professor Bloom is a fabulous lecturer--funny, thoughtful, and intelligent--and the material was consistently fascinating. There's some reading, but it's only bad in terms of volume if you procrastinate doing it, and the textbook and articles are rarely dry or dull. Take it--you'll be glad you did.",
    "Take it only if the subject truly interests you, and you're willing to put in some work. If so, it's terrific",
    "Introduction to Psychology offers a great overview for those intending to major in psychology or even for students who want to take an interesting class with a great professor. Be prepared to work however, because this course involved one of the most amount of work out of all my fall classes.",
    "I think this is a class that anyone even vaguely interested in what is the fringe of understanding of human anatomy. The class is great fun, with unique and really interesting presentations in every class. Professor Bloom is fantastic. The exams might get a little tedious as they cover a lot in each exam, but if one doesn't procrastinate, it shouldn't be too much of a pain. Even if it is, deal with it. This class is worth it.",
    "Yeah it's chill. Take it.",
    "Take it. Period.",
    "As I am sure everyone will write, Intro Psyc was a nice breath of fresh air. Bloom made each lecture soo enjoyable, complete with informative but always fun-to-watch clips that I think are ESSENTIAL in creating effective presentations. The midterms were challenging and very book-based but the book review was a nice alternative to a regular research paper.",
    "Psych 110 is not an easy class. The midterms are really harshly curved and the material can be challenging. Nevertheless it is a class that every single Yale undergraduate has to take! The lectures are fascinating and Paul Bloom is a fantastic professor. At the end of the course, I looked back and realized how much the class had changed the way I look at human behavior and interaction! In short, don't be expecting an easy class; but expect a fantastic class nonetheless!",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT! TAKE IT NOW! Sooo much fun, even if you're not planning on being a Psychology major. Honestly, the lectures are as much entertainment as they are education. The first class where I never had trouble concentrating on the lectures for even a second.",
    "I believe its a course worth taking even if one doesn't want to major in Psychology. I really enjoyed taking it with Professor Bloom whose lectures were most animated and interesting. Though I must say the workload was greater than that of other classes that I was taking in the sense that there was a lot of material that we needed to revise to prepare for the in-class exams. So, I would suggest taking the course Credit D and preferably with Prof. Bloom.",
    "Take this class!! Workload very managable. I never dreaded a single assignment!",
    "Excellent course if looking for a fine lecture course. Not too much work, but tests can be quite difficult.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to every student at Yale.",
    "Great class to take if you're looking for a relatively low work load and a really enjoyable lecture.",
    "Psych 110 is a very comprehensive overview of psychology. It covers everything from happiness, love, and dreams, to mental disorders, art, and the brain. I would HIGHLY recommend this class to everyone and anyone. If you're thinking of majoring in psych, it's a great way to see what aspect you might be most interested in. If you're not thinking of majoring in psych, it's a great way to simply learn why people act the way they do. You might even learn something about the class! There's not a lot of work (although I would definitely keep up with the outside articles and videos he assigns, they will definitely come up on tests!) and even the textbook is interesting and at times, funny.",
    "Psych 110 is a lot of work, but overall very enjoyable and a very interesting subject. I would recommend it to someone who enjoys a lot of reading.",
    "A fun course that's engaging, kind-of-but-not-too challenging, and fairly relaxing. While a lot of psych seems like fancy terms for really obvious things, what's significant is really just a whole new way of looking at a world that was historically the domain of literature, art, etc. - people. It's science applied to the humanities, which is interesting in and of itself.",
    "This course is both fun and thought-provoking. It is a VERY broad introduction, but Professor Bloom's interactive, dynamic lectures effectively outline the main points of the material. Since a course in Psychology should be part of anyone's liberal arts education, you should definitely take \"Introduction to Psychology.\"",
    "Super fun class. Bloom's a great lecturer, and the work is minimal.",
    "A very good course with a very good professor. I felt fortunate to have been in that class with a professor that is a leader in modern psychological research. Highly recommended for anyone who has a brain and wants to learn about it.",
    "Absolutely recommend it.",
    "YES. GREAT COURSE. The first for which I could apply textbook material to daily life. Fantastic professor, engaging lectures, good guest lecturers (although they don't compare to Bloom), fair workload\/reading load, challenging tests but very doable. TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT.",
    "very interesting general psychology course. yes, would recommend",
    "Take this if you're at all into psych. It's a staple in the curriculum. Dr. Bloom was hilarious and engaging and I hear great things about Chun as well. It's a really solid intro course and as far as lectures go, I found myself looking forward to class each week.",
    "This is an amazing course. The lectures are captivating, and the workload is not very heavy. The tests are difficult, though.",
    "It is a very difficult course. Do not take it unless you have a true interest in learning about the basic Pyschology concepts. However, if you do take it, you will not regret it. It will be a grind at times, but the information you learn is invaluable.",
    "Would recommend, especially if you didn't take any psychology in high school.",
    "Unless you are really passionate about the subject or are willing to put in a significantly larger effort than you would for another course at Yale I would not recommend it.",
    "This class is great. It thoroughly increases your understanding of people and society. Absolutely take this class. I would recommend this class to any and all students.",
    "I would for those possibly interested in studying psychology for fun, but not for those who want to study it with any depth.",
    "A compelling course with captivating lectures from a great speaker who is prominent in his field. Recommended most highly. Take Bloom over Chun, too; having listened to both speak it is clear which one will make for a more interesting semester.",
    "I would recommend it for someone who wants to better understand the workings of the mind in various aspects of life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to everyone. You learn a lot of cool stuff, and the lectures are fun. The tests aren't too bad, and it's not a lot of work. TAKE IT.",
    "Paul Bloom is an incredible lecturer! Take it. The class is fascinating, especially if you have had no exposure to psychology.",
    "Paul Bloom is an excellent lecturer. If you enjoy his first class then you will enjoy the others. He is humorous and stimulating.",
    "DON'T PASS UP THIS COURSE! It is challenging at times, but incredibly interesting and well taught (no, I am not a psych major). Paul Bloom is the man, but I hear Marvin Chun is also an amazing teacher and he had a good guest lecture for us.",
    "I highly recommend this class. It was a decent amount of work, but it was very interesting and the professor was amazing.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's a great overview of every aspect of Psychology in a really interesting way. Paul Bloom is fantastic and engaging and the class is really interesting, even if lectures aren't your thing. There's no final, which is great, just three in class tests and one major paper on a book you read on your own. But you have a lot of time to work on it. There are weekly reading responses, which are really not much work at all and plenty of reading that you should definitely do if you want to do well on the tests. This was definitely one of my favorite classes, subjects, professors.",
    "Psychology 110 offers a very broad introduction into topics in Psychology. You are expected to learn a lot a lot of information about a lot of different topics, which made studying for exams pretty stressful. If you do not intend to actually do the readings assigned, I would not recommend taking this course. Reading the textbook in addition to listening and taking notes on the lectures is very important.",
    "Definitely take this class. The lectures are extremely interesting, but all that will really matter in the class will be whether or not you do your reading. If you are not up to reading 120-200 pages of text per test, you will not pass, no matter how good your class notes are. Having said that, I think every Yale student should take this at some point.",
    "TAKE IT. It's an amazing class taught by an amazing professor. Work is definitely manageable, and exams are fair if you keep up with the lectures and readings. Definitely my favorite class so far, and the material is fascinating and you'll find yourself bringing it up in everyday life.",
    "I thought this course was incredibly interesting - there's a reason why nearly 400 people take it every semester. This course is a lot of reading, which one has to keep up with in order to succeed on exams, but lectures are always enjoyable and actually pertain to everyday life. I absolutely loved this course and I think everyone should take it at some point in his or her Yale career.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student.",
    "It is an interesting introduction to psychology, and it is quite exciting and intriguing.",
    "Wonderful course in psychology. It is a survey course, but it is necessary to start some of the higher level courses in psychology.",
    "Do not take it if you are not up for it. You can expect a lot of reading and a lot of materials because you cover everything regarding psychology.",
    "I would definitelyrecommend intro psych to anyone. I think it is one of the most engaging and fascinating classes at Yale. You do not need to be a psych major to appreciate Paul Bloom's fun teaching style or the variety of interesting topics addressed. We watch TED talks as homework (among other readings from textbooks and I think this says something about the innovative style of the class; it kind of reminds me of a series of TED talks addressing everything from why we love who we love to why people believe in god. Even though a whole range of topics are discussed, this does not make for confusion; instead, it makes the class never really feel like work, but instead feel like a variety of investigations into topics of interest. There is not a lot of work, and what work there is turns out to be quite engaging. If you have trouble with multiple choice \/ true or false, you might want to take it CR\/D, but otherwise, it shouldn't be too hard to do well if you pay attention in class - which you will probably want to do anyways!",
    "If you have any interest in psychology definitely take this class!",
    "Take it and do the work and study class will be mad breezy",
    "If you are remotely interested in Psychology, I would suggest taking the course especially if you can have Bloom as your professor. However, it\u0092s important to keep on top of the reading and to study hard for the exams, because they are comprehensive and pretty tough.",
    "I would recommend this course.Topics are very interesting. Paul Bloom is great.",
    "Interesting, useful, and not really that much work. Lectures are very engaging and often downright entertaining; the material itself would be extremely interesting even without the excellent presentation it receives in this course. Lots of applications to your actual life; makes you think about your view of the world and grapple with ways of understanding what sort of being\/creatures humans really are. In short: do it.",
    "Psychology 110 is a great course and I recommend it if you have even the slightest interest in taking a psychology course. Professor Bloom is an amzing professor and his lectures are always interesting. The workload is extremely manageable and you only have to write one paper during the course of the semester. This course is very relaxed and a great course to take.",
    "Absolutely take this class before you leave Yale!! You'll study everything from how to train a pig to dance to why George Clooney's sweater is worth more unwashed, and you'll definitely find yourself looking at people's behavior from a completely different point of view. Professor Bloom is amazing, but we had Chun for a guest lecture and he was great too.",
    "Yes! If you're interested in how people work and why we do what we do, take it. Paul Bloom is awesome.",
    "Should be a distributional requirement - great survey course - should be required of a liberal arts education. Bloom is engaging and the material sells itself. Even as a Junior in a primarily Freshmen class, I loved it. Be warned, it is very impersonal (I feel sorry for the TFs!), but this can't be avoided with 375 people in a class.",
    "TAKE THE CLASS, AND TAKE IT WITH PAUL BLOOM. He is a god. I actually looked forward to going to lecture; it seemed more like entertainment than class, but you still felt as though you learned a lot. The material taught is interesting on its own, but Paul Bloom just takes it to the next level.There are 3 non-cumulative midterm exams rather than a final, which is SO NICE.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone, regardless of major, because it is very, very interesting and useful in knowing how the mind works and how people interact.",
    "TAKE IT. no matter what your major is. the tests require a lot of memorization, but other than that the course is really laid back. and bloom is the best. classes are so entertaining and you learn stuff that is interesting to bring up in everyday conversations.",
    "Take Psych with Marvin Chun ( I had Bloom).",
    "I would recommend this course to any student in any major. It is the best class I have ever taken by far, and I actually think about the things I learned in this class in my daily life.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning about people and why we do the things we do and interested in taking a phenomenal, fascinating and transformative course from an awesome professor. The reading is really interesting and fun.",
    "Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone interested in or curious about psychology. Paul Bloom is incredibly entertaining, and the course covers lots of interesting material. A few warnings though. First, this class is not the easy A it's rumored to be; going into the class I heard that 50% of the class got A's and 40% got B's, but this is a very inflated number. Second, I can't emphasis enough how quickly the midterms and book review come up. Start writing the review as early as possible. As long as you keep up with the reading, you'll be fine. Intro Psych is a great course.",
    "A really interesting class that explores the field of psych. My only complaint is not being exposed to enough ideas in the reading; you read a lot of Paul Bloom stuff and listen to a lot of Paul Bloom in the lecture. It'd be nice to get some other view points.",
    "You must take this course. It's amazing. However, keep in mind that the tests do require you to know the text like the back of your hand. Use the window of opportunity during the first exam and do really well, and you will enjoy this wonderful class without having to worry about doing poorly.",
    "definitely take, but prepare for the hard tests",
    "I recommend this class wholeheartedly. Yes there is a lot of reading and yes it took me a while to figure out what would and wouldn't show up on the tests, but I learned so much about human desires, fears, interactions, etc. I feel like this class made me not only more knowledgeable about psychology, but a better person. By evaluating topics such as happiness, depression and group psychology in an academic manner, I was able to come to some realizations about my own cognitive biases. I hope that I will be able to fight my vulnerabilities to things such as social influence now that I am truly cognizant of their effect on my behaviour.",
    "You cover all the big important topics in psychology. I'm not sure if I want to take more psych courses, but I'm glad I took this one.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Professor Bloom is great and it is so informative. It makes you think a lot about yourself. It's a quick look at a lot of different topics in psychology, but I generally felt that all the questions I had about each subject were answered.",
    "This is a GREAT class, especially with Paul Bloom. The concepts are super interesting, especially since most relate directly to our lives. Lectures are fascinating, and Bloom makes it feel as if he's talking directly to you instead of to a class of hundreds. You learn so much!",
    "Intro Psych with Paul Bloom was an awesome class. I truly looked forward to going to class every week. Bloom keeps the class engaging and interesting with funny anecdotes, youtube videos videos, interesting and relevant articles, and other examples that make students want to continue paying attention throughout the lecture. Although, I must admit, the class was more exciting during the first 2\/3 of the semester and decreased slightly toward the end, but that could also simply be do to time's effect on shock value. Additionally, the final paper was somewhat of an ambiguous assignment, as it is a broad book report essay, but overall it was not too difficult of an assignment. The tests are difficult simply because they cover such a broad range of material, but with a little bit of studying (and memorization) anyone should be fine.",
    "Simply put, you must take Intro Psych sometime during your Yale career. It doesn't matter if you're a freshman, sophomore, junior or senior, make sure to take this class at some time, because what you learn is just so interesting, exciting, and eye-opening. And if you can get Professor Bloom, he's the man- though everyone said that Marvin Chun's great too (but I didn't enjoy his guest lecture as much as Professor Boom's classes). This is stuff that is really important and helpful to know. So do yourself a favor, and take this class- and spend the time doing the reading and going to class, because you can get a ton out of it.",
    "A worthwhile class. Covers a ton of information, and lots of it is useful. If you're taking it for a grade, you have to go to every lecture and pay close attention.",
    "I would recommend it if you thought the psychology with Marvin Chun was too crowd-pleasing and if you wanted a bit more seriousness in class. Prof. Paul Bloom is also a very good lecturer, no worse than Marvin Chun. It's a huge lecture class, and you have a lot of readings and lots and lots of materials to study for when it comes to midterms and final. It's not a gut class- you have weekly response, 3-4 midterms, a book review (10 page paper), and also need to fulfil 5 credits of psychology studies experiment. Only if you are really interested in Psychology and if you are ready to do all these work, take it. Otherwise, other psych classes with specific topics seem to be much more interesting and productive.",
    "It is a must take class for a Yale undergrad",
    "I would recommend this to other students because it was a good course and it did not have a final. However, if you have already taken a psych course in high school or elsewhere, consider taking a more advanced course because I found I knew much of what was discussed.",
    "Highly highly recommended. Everyone should take this class. It is fun and you learn so much. Paul Bloom is amazing. I looked forward to every class and even to doing the readings. But there is no rush to take it unless you want to major in psychology, and i actually recommend it as great extra class to take credit\/d\/fail, because you can get alot from the class while doing very little work. It is actually a bit hard to get an A, but very little work is needed to pass. Again. take this class.",
    "Terrific course. Something all freshman with any interest in psych\/philosophy should take. Great lectures, great professor, a TA staff that really knows what they're doing. All around, very good course!",
    "TAKE IT! It's a lot of reading but incredibly interesting! Paul Bloom is an excellent lecturer - take it with him!",
    "I would tentatively recommend Psych 110. The lectures are interesting, and Bloom is a good lecturer, but the tests are fairly ridiculous in that they are a m\u00e9lange of too easy and too hard questions that can make it tough to distinguish oneself since the whole class has a pretty tough curve of only 30% A's. The workload is very light though and the readings can all be done on the days leading up to the tests. The class also briefly surveys too many topics without going into much depth, and the reading supplements do not make up for the fact that the class is pretty thin in terms of depth in general. But you do learn a lot about a wide variety of psychology topics.",
    "AMAZING.",
    "Yes, it is a great introductory course.",
    "Psychology 110 is a very interesting survey of the broad subject of psychology. It covers everything from child development to love to abnormal psychology. Psychology 110 provides useful, fascinating insight into the human mind and human nature. I therefore recommend it to all students.",
    "It's a fantastic course that covers all the fundamentals of Psychology and then some. Bloom includes cutting edge material and fantastic moral explorations in addition to the intriguing science. DEFinitely take this course.",
    "In Psychology 110, you will go through the different disciplines within psychology. It is definitely interesting and I would highly recommend taking it with Professor Bloom. However, be conscious of the fact that it is a large lecture course. This means that it requires a lot of personal commitment tokeep up with the course's work. It was also fun to take a class with so many other people; you are bound to run into people you know and meet many others.",
    "Very, very interesting course and Professor Bloom is awesome. I would definitely recommend taking this class with him. Theres a pretty good amount of work but the readings aren't too bad if you keep up with them and we read about current and interesting things in psychology. I didn't take psychology in high school and I thought this was a great introduction to psychology. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, it is a great introduction to psychology.",
    "Psychology 110 is definitely what I would consider a survey course. It covers a lot of basic psychological material that extends into every single facet of life. From sex to dreams to happiness to disorders, Professor Bloom covers it all in an informative and inspiring way. He's a great professor who is dedicated to his students, and perhaps even more importantly, is always willing to look at an issue in different ways. Even during lectures, when students would ask questions, Professor Blooms' responses were always dynamic and open. I would absolutely recommend this class to a student interested in psychology who has either never experienced psychology in any other facet, or to a student that has an interest in taking higher level psychology classes (which 110 is a prerequisite of). However, If you took AP Psychology in high school and did well, I suggest trying to get into higher level classes as this will probably just recover material you already know.",
    "I LOVE THIS COURSE. LOVE IT. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. TAKE IT.Professor Bloom is definitely the highlight of the course, and he presents the material in such a captivating and interesting way with contemporary and historical examples that going to lecture every time was like watching a stand-up comedian for an hour and fifteen minutes. I never missed a single lecture and it was always one of the high points of my day.The material itself also is so fascinating that I feel like I'm learning so much every time I do my reading (as cheesy as that sounds). This class is making me want to consider being a Psych major even though I hadn't planned on it.",
    "Actually a fun course, if it's the only hard one you've got. Don't get all Ivy-Leaguer eager and make this your fourth \"gut class\" because its the opposite--its quite difficult.",
    "Very good class, a must-take. You have to do the reading, but you will look forward to class, and even studying for tests.",
    "Extremely interesting course, highly recommend it.",
    "Strongly recommended for every Yale undergraduate. Also, take this course with Bloom. He is apparently better than Marvin Chung.",
    "A really great course that covers a lot of interesting material that is relevant to subjects that span beyond just the realm of psychology.",
    "This is a broad survey course. There are no sections - you sit with a couple hundred kids in an auditorium and watch Paul Bloom perform, and then you go home and read a textbook. However, as far as Intro. Psych. classes go, I'm sure it's quite good. Professor Bloom is a great lecturer.",
    "Definitely take this class!",
    "TAKE IT.. one of the best classes at Yale..and especially with Paul Bloom he is a great great great lecturer!",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student",
    "Take it! Even if you're not particularly interested in psychology, it's a great class that will teach you a lot.",
    "Even if you're not interested in Psychology, you have to take this class. It's just one of those at Yale. I went into it thinking I would major in something in the hard sciences and came out realizing I wanted to be a psych major. This will be the best class you take all week, you'll look forward to it every day and always wish it was a psych day.",
    "Take it! I looked forward to every lecture. You'll probably get an A.",
    "This course is a great introduction to Psychology and will open the doors to you figuring out which area of psychology may interest you. I would definitely recommend the course!",
    "This course is an excellent general introduction to psychology. It's well taught and very interesting. I'd recommend it to anyone who has even a passing interest in the subject.",
    "PSYC was an immensely interesting course that not only answered a lot of my own questions about the way the brain functions, but also prompted me to consider new ones.",
    "Everyone will tell you to take Intro Psych, and they're RIGHT. It's WONDERFUL, even if you don't plan on being a psych major. Take it with Bloom - he's hilarious, and his lectures are interesting every week!The work really only picks up during the weeks of the tests, and the grading scale is pretty fair. The essay is graded really easily, so don't take it worrying about your grade. It's SO interesting - don't leave Yale without taking this class!!",
    "TAKE IT!!! No matter what your field\/concentration\/focus is, the material of the class appeals to humanity in general and the questions it answers are ones you probably have already wondered or will wonder at some point. I truly gained a wealth of knowledge from this class.And there's also the point that Paul Bloom is beyond awesome. I looked forward to each class.Bottom line: manageable work, do the reading, and ENJOY.",
    "Psychology 110 is one of the best courses offered at Yale. Even though it might seem basic and trivial, if you have not taken a Psychology course before (and even if you have taken Psychology in high school), I highly recommend this course. It is intriguing and fascinating; the inner workings of the human mind are interesting to students of every major.To summarize the course, you will cover the fundamentals of Psychology in its beginnings, including Freud, Pinker, and Skinner'stheories about development, learning, and interaction. After that, you will look into relationships, from family to love, sociology, and finally delve into sicknesses of the mind. The course is absolutely fascinating and as I've said, no matter what your major or background, I highly recommend it.",
    "Pretty difficult and hard to navigate your own grade at times because of the curve. A lot of reading and if you're not willing then don't take it.",
    "Interesting.",
    "Psych 110 is a good, fun course. The exams are nothing to blow off but studying for them isn't tedious because of the interesting material.",
    "Yes, absolutely take it. Very interesting and great introductory lecture course.",
    "Psych 110 is very much what the course description says, a survey of psychology and its basic principles. It is a lot of what was covered in AP psych for people who took that class in high school. If you are diligent enough to keep up with the reading, it is not too bad of a course. It feels a lot like what you are learning is more understanding than memorization (aside from being able to put a name to what you understand). It was a very enjoyable course and I would recommend it.",
    "This is a phenomenal class and Paul Bloom is amazing! Professor Bloom consistently got applause at the end of each class. Take it even if you have no interest in pursuing psychology. The readings are necessary for the exams but overall they aren't that long.",
    "I would definitely recommend Psychology 110 to another student. It was an amazing class. It was the one class where I would go to the library after class and actually want to read the textbook and preparefor the next class. Professor Bloom would summarize some of the key points from the books, but would also incorporate contemporary ideas and current psychological research. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this class.",
    "Intro Psych is a great class with exciting topics and a passionate professor. The reading adds up but the light tone of the textbook and the currency of the articles\/videos made it worthwhile. The book report was not too difficult. The reading responses were also decently easy. Definitely take this course while at Yale.",
    "Intro to psych with one of the best professors here. Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend Intro to Psych to another student.",
    "A joy of a class. Take it take it take it. It was a pleasure to sit down and listen to Bloom for 2.5 hours every week. I took this my senior fall, and I truly believe that if I had taken it as a freshman, I would have become a Psych major.Also there's no section, which is clutch -- and makes it the perfect class if you're looking for a Credit\/D.",
    "I would definitely Psychology 110 01 to another student. It is a very interesting course that has a lot of relevance in our everyday lives.",
    "I will recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "Really interesting course, and not too much work. The readings are good and show up on the test, so definitely do them. Lecture is usually also pretty interesting so definitely go! It's three midterms plus a paper, and no final. Bloom is really good and can be pretty funny and he chooses good material to lecture on (it's a little different each year).",
    "Decent class if you're very interested in Psych, but otherwise I wouldn't take it. I know that I certainly wouldnt take it again.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student either interested or uninterested in Psychology. It is a great course.",
    "Great Intro class but it's hard. Be ready. It's highly recommended.",
    "Yes I would recommend this. It's a great course that gets you thinking about how people work- definitely changed the way I think about interactions and stuff. The workload is not too bad- a reading response a week, three exams (no final cumulative exam), and a book review. I found the exams doable, but others found them kind of arbitrary and hard. Overall, awesome course!!",
    "Take it. It's one of those must-take classes at Yale with one of the BEST professors at Yale. I could not recommend any course more highly than Psych 110.",
    "Psychology 110 01 is a large lecture course that meets twice a week. you are given readings for each lecture and every week you are assigned a question for a reading response. The workload otherwise includes three major tests and a book review paper. I would suggest this course to other students because it is very interesting - a great introductory course.",
    "I would recommend this course if you think you might be interested in psychology. You learn a lot, but the curve is rough, so I would recommend credit\/d\/fail if you aren't sure about it. Bloom is the best though and is a great lecturer.",
    "Take the class. It's a good course and you learn a lot about human psychology that you would have never learned otherwise. And it's not just stuff that's nice too know but entirely useless. There are things that I've learned in this class that have helped me to understand various events in my life much better as a result of having taken this course.The exams are fine, just study well for the first one so your grade isn't a shock like it is for half the class. The other two exams are not as bad once you know how to study for them and understand the format.Bloom is a boss. One of the best lecturers at Yale, by far.",
    "I would recommend this class. I really enjoyed it and learned a great deal. This was probably my most worthwhile class this semester.",
    "PSYCH110 was my favorite course this semester, and up there on my list of favorite course at Yale so far. By nature it covered a lot of material, but did so in a way that flowed well and was engaging and fun. If all psych course are like this at Yale, and if all the department is like Paul Bloom, then it is easy to see why psych is such a popular and strong department here. My one complaint of the course was that some of the questions on the tests were often way more specific than one could ever imagine being able to retain, but this is obviously only a minor inconvenience if anything. I highly recommend taking this course for an easy and fun social science credit, particularly if you are, like me, a science major.",
    "Wonderful, wonderful class. Professor Bloom keeps every lecture entertaining. Definitely worth taking.",
    "I say take it. It's a fun class, and it's a great thing to learn. You already know that you've got to fill some of those extra credits.",
    "I highly recommend it. Period.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Bloom is one of the best, and you learn so much in the class. I would consider taking it credit\/D because there is so much material covered and small details are often on the tests.",
    "If you have the chance to take this class with Paul Bloom, TAKE IT. I've heard good things about Marvin Chun, who typically teaches the class during the spring semester, but I can absolutely say that you will not regret taking it in the fall with Professor Bloom. Not only is he kind of famous in the field -- one of the genuine big shots of Yale's illustrious psychology department -- but he is also a fantastic lecturer and (I feel comfortable saying this even without having talked to him in person, one-on-one) a really amazing human being. You will look forward to coming to class just to hear what he has to say about the day's topic, and you won't mind doing the readings and writing the weekly reading response because he's already put such an interesting spin on the material in lecture. One note of caution: the tests are not super hard if you've been keeping on top of the material and taking good notes, but they're not easy, so take the time to prepare. Also, there's one long writing assignment, a 10-pg \"book review,\" but it's fairly open-ended, and the book choices are all really good, so it's not too much of a slog.",
    "I would say that everyone should absolutely take this course, no matter what you are thinking of majoring in. Everyone seems to enjoy this class weather they are science, math, or humanities oriented people. The course is so applicable to our everyday lives. It is not necisarilly an easy course, but it will feel somewhat effortless because the material and Paul Bloom are just so interesting. Don't leave Yale without taking Psych 110, seriously.",
    "It's a very interesting, fun course to take and I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "The course content is interesting and the professor is very engaging, yet the format of the class: mixture of exams and papers but without problem sets for practice or detailed writing tutoring, might make it very time-consuming to do well on the course.",
    "A basic intro course, covers many fields of psychology but does not go in depth into any one field. I would definitely recommend this to another student, if only just to hear paul bloom lectures.",
    "Paul Bloom's lectures were great, I would absolutely recommend this class based on that alone. The lectures were twice a week with a half page reading response due each week. There was a book review due right before Thanksgiving and three tests. The tests were challenging but going to the lectures and doing all the reading really makes a difference. This is a really good class to take with your friends.",
    "Introductory course to psychology",
    "Psych 110 is a great class, mostly because of Paul Bloom. Teaching Fellows are a major weakness, however. Take the class, do all the assignments, do the reading, and start the final paper as soon as it is assigned. You'll do fine.",
    "Yes, definitely because it was fun.",
    "Psychology 110 is definitely worthwhile, regardless of your potential major. It's information everyone should know.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student his isn't already well versed in basic psychology. You learn tons of interesting stuff, and will look at the world in a new way after the class is over.",
    "It's a great class, one of those that you need to take. Be careful, because it's more work than you'll expect.",
    "I would definitely recommend psych 110 to another student. Very interesting class"
