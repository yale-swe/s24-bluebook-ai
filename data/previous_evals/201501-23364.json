   "comments": [
    "I think the structure of the lectures could be more... structured! It would be helpful to start off with a bit of background, explain the life cycle or the biology, etc. of the topic and THEN go into papers and research. I think sometimes we jumped straight into research and then bounced around a lot and although we eventually hit all of these things, it was hard to follow. I also think the vaccines guest lecture was really fantastic and it should honestly be at the beginning of the FIRST semester instead of the very last lecture of the second semester. I think this lecture covered really great basics of R0 and vaccine types, etc. that ends up coming up in almost all of our lectures from day 1. Therefore, having this lecture up front would be far more beneficial than at the end when it becomes redundant because we already know it at that point.",
    "I really liked the diversity of topics covered with the emphasis on overarching ideas and concepts. I appreciated that the lectures provided lots of information but that the exams stayed away from focusing too much on smaller details.",
    "A great diversity of topics and speakers",
    "Really loved this course. I think it's probably one of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "Assignments were open-ended and fun. Exams were relatively easy. Topics covered were interesting. Weaknesses: slides are not organized.",
    "learned a lot of great general informaiton\/\/larger views of ID across multiple diseases, but felt like I missed some of the more specific\/mechanistic knowledge",
    "Wonderful information. Could have used a few more lectures on diseases such as tetanus, pertussis, and others. More concise discussions about surveillance and public health practice mixed in.",
    "Brilliant professor. Challenging and engaging course. Students were not only required to do the readings, and come to lecture, they had to think critically, develop an opinion, and do their own research into the literature in order to back up their claims. A lot of professors could learn a lot from Dr. Childs. Students who are really good standardized test takers but not really good at thinking for themselves might be thrown off by this teaching style. However, I think they should get over it and learn to think like a scientist the way Dr. Childs is trying to teach them to.",
    "Very interesting course covering a range of factors influencing infectious diseases in the modern day. Some improvements to organization and communication of deadlines could be done, but overall a thought-provoking and enjoyable class.",
    "The strengths of the course were focused around the diversity of specialists that were brought in for the lectures. Each lecture focused on a different topic and for the majority of the courses, specialists taught the lectures. They were extremely knowledgeable and kept the course extremely interesting with insight from the field. The course covered a broad scope of information and balanced this with professional insight.",
    "The course seemed a bit disjointed at times. A clearer syllabus that defined the trajectory of the class would be helpful. Some of the guest lectures toward the end of the course weren't particularly helpful. Regardless, I learned a lot about the context in which infectious diseases are studied in public health.",
    "Strengths: very interesting subject material. We covered a lot of topics. Weaknesses: the powerpoints didn't always flow logically, making it a little difficult to follow when going back to study.",
    "I think many of us felt that we had no idea what was going on. The syllabus would say one thing, but you would change the dates and we would never get notification. I liked the guest lectures for the most part more than the normal lectures. Jim Hadler's was somewhat boring though mostly because there wasn't anything new or novel.",
    "The class is very interesting. The course seemed a bit disorganized sometimes, but it all worked out. Assignments and midterms were very general, but Jamie does a useful review session that will adequately prepare you for the exams.",
    "Great course overall. Really loved the material. Could have been organized a little better.",
    "I thought the structure of this course allowed me to absorbs more information and general concepts as they relate to infectious disease transmission and prevention. I thought the pace fast at times and it was a little difficult to keep up with a lot of the topics but overall t was very informative.",
    "Good overall, a lot of guest speakers, so felt incoherent at times. Nevertheless, very interesting topics were covered.",
    "Strengths: Realized we covered a lot of material. Thought the homework assignments and exams were very generous. Interesting speakers for guest lectures Improvements: Lectures felt pretty unstructured and often left feeling like I wasn't sure what we were supposed to really keep in mind? It's also a lot of material and for students who have not covered some of these infections in prior courses, having a little more context on the front end of things that's more straightforward could be helpful. Journal articles don't necessarily give the same foundation as a textbook; so perhaps that could be a useful reference, as well. Also, lots of things felt unorganized, in terms of due dates and assignment instructions.",
    "Great class."

    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie has so much knowledge (and energy) and is a really great lecturer for ID. The only thing that always got to me was the open-ended questions in class. Pointing at someone and asking \"Rabies is what?\" is confusing and ambiguous - rabies is a lot of things. I almost never know what he's trying to get at when he asks open and general questions like that and it makes me really hesitant to speak up during class.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0A very interesting and lively professor that knows how to make us interested in infectious diseases !",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Dr. Childs is very engaging and interesting. Very knowledgeable and kind to student.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is awesome.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0a little spacey, but interesting stories.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Wonderful. Pleasure to be in his class.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Dr. Childs is great. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. PS: Please don't post the readings the night before, at least a couple of days.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Professor Childs was a wealth of knowledge on infectious diseases. He was always open to students questions and concerns and managed to keep a very casual feel to the course. He always looked out for the well-being of the students and encouraged critical thinking from our assignments. I would highly recommend him as a professor for this course in the future.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Dr. Childs is an easy-going, engaging professor who is very willing to share his experience and expertise.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is great! He is very engaging and knows so much about infectious diseases. His abundance of experiences was inspiring to hear about.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Speak louder! If you change the syllabus, notify us via classes v2 and actually send out the notification!",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is an awesome, engaging teacher and just an overall cool guy. My only complaint is that he sometimes seemed to me scattered\/disorganized (lectures starting late, things shifting around in the syllabus, due dates for homework getting changed around, things like that). It would help to have just a little more structure - perhaps the TFs could help with this.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0So informed! He knows so much about the topics and if so enthusiastic about teaching this subject to the students.",

   "comments": [
    "Excellent intro to a variety of infectious diseases and a good continuation of ID 1.",
    "A great overview of the diversity of infectious diseases but also of the application of their study.",
    "I would recommend this course. Really interesting and fun course. I definitely learned a lot!",
    "It's not as hard as the first PID.",
    "required course. more interesting topic than 1st semester, but less formalized learning.",
    "Engage with the material it is exciting stuff!",
    "Worms, bats, rodents, and more worms.",
    "A combination of critical thinking of overall trends in ID combined with specific information about pathogens, specifically NTDs.",
    "The course provided an overview of infectious diseases that assessed issues and information from a multidisciplinary background that included environmental factors, social, political and health. I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student because it gives strong insight into the complex issues that arise in public health and disease ecology.",
    "The course was a good supplement to the fall semester's infectious disease class. It was definitely broader and less disease-specific. It provided a good understanding of the study of infectious diseases and challenges associated with that research.",
    "There is a lot of subject material, so you will learn a lot. But the expectations are very reasonable and there isn't too much work so it isn't very difficult.",
    "If you are interested in neglected infectious diseases you would enjoy this class.",
    "Interesting course. Some aspects taught well and at other points I felt like I had no idea what was going on.",
    "Jamie's lectures and all the guest lectures have fascinating lecture materials. Sometimes it is difficult to know what exactly Jamie wants you to know from it, but the review session is very helpful. By the end, you will notice that you can link certain things together in ways that you didn't think you could before.",
    "Great class! Just take it!",
    "It's a great course but I think the pace should be a bit slower to allow students to understand and grasp concepts in addition to connecting the lectures.",
    "Covers many interesting topics on IDs.",
    "Not sure I would recommend this course to a non-EMD student. However, would summarize the course as a good opportunity to be exposed to many neglected and lesser-known parasite infections."
