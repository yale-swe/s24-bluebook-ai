    "Professor Leon is really nice and a very talented teacher of L1.",
    "The course is well run and you will learn a lot of Spanish, and the workload is not too bad, even if you take the time to memorize the vocabulary before each class. If you're starting a language from scratch and you don't know which one to take, I'd recommend taking Spanish because it's less work than other languages and it's a very useful language. You can do well even if you've never taken Spanish before, as long as you're willing to put in the necessary amount of time. Rosamaria Leon is a good lecturer and has an accent that's relatively easy to understand. Take the course director's section if you can because that gives you extra advantages (sometimes our section didn't get emails before tests that other sections got, that contained useful information), but if you can't get into that section, take it with Leon.",
    "I liked it! You do have to go every day and there is consistent homework, but the tests are predictable and at least you get to know the other people in your class. I feel like I actually know basic Spanish now. I'm happy I took the course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it if you are taking it simply for a foreign language credit or even if you are taking it for fun and further language practice. The pace is great, and the fact that the entire class is taught in Spanish really helps you to master the material.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is difficult if you have never done spanish before but it doesn't put you in a disadvantaged solution if you haven't."
