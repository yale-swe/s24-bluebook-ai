    "My French improved greatly. I speak more confidently and fluently, even if I'm not always using perfect French. My accent has improved so much. I also can read actual books in French now!",
    "I dramatically improved my French after 125, becoming a much more fluid speaker, listener, and writer.",
    "I learned a lot in this class! I learned how to express my thoughts more effectively in French, both in writing and in speech. By the end of this course, I felt very comfortable picking up French novels to read or watching French films on Netflix.",
    "This intensive crash-course in the French language, following on Madame Constance Sherak's excellent first semester of teaching, was a great way to gain greater proficiency in the French language and in my awareness of French and Francophone cultures.",
    "One of the most beautiful, intense introductions to French culture and literature. This course is an adventure - absolutely - but I promise you, you will love fall in love with the course, the professor, your classmates, but above all, the language. What an experience!!",
    "- a detailed knowledge of the subtleties of French culture and language",
    "Through this course, I greatly improved my knowledge of french language, literature, and culture. The immersive style of the class caused everyone in the class to become much more proficient in speaking french, and our weekly videoconferences with students in Paris gave us a greater understand of modern culture."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Mme Skorupa is an angel and a star! I basically only took this class because I adore her so much. She is such a fabulous person and the absolute best person to take any class from (especially this one) in my opinion. She brings the class yummy baked goods and is the cool French mom you wish you had. A big strength is also just the intensive nature of the class. It forces you to think and speak in French at least 2 hours a day (plus homework) so it's been so rewarding to look back and see how much my French has improved. I also thought the reading and film selection for the class was really strong. We read great books that people in France actually read (granted they probably read them much younger...) and we watched some classic French films. Now I feel so cultured when I talk to my French friends! Weaknesses: I get the purpose of the audio exercises but they were so inefficient and time-consuming at points. There is so much work for this class sometimes, which can be really difficult to balance. It's definitely a difficult class but for people with a particular affinity for language, it's a joy. It really was an amazing way to start my day and exercise my brain in a new way. I will say this course can be difficult to balance with other intensive courses that require a lot of work at regular intervals. I took this course with other seminars that met once a week and that helped me so much to be able to balance it, since my other classes were more long-term projects and papers. To not feel overwhelmed, I recommend doing something like that. The French work each day isn't difficult per say, but it can be long and it has to get done.",
    "This course is challenging, both because of the material and the workload, but I think Professor Skorupa is extraordinary. The strengths are both pedagogical and in the ways that French at Yale is made so rigorous. In terms of weaknesses, I am hard pressed to think of any, except perhaps, that the final reading assignments (for Un Sac de Billes) are excessive in their length.",
    "Strengths: novels, immersive experience, Telecom sessions Weaknesses: The audio exercises were unhelpful, overwhelmingly numerous, and tedious.",
    "This class is well organized to help you improve your french in that it combines new topics in grammar and vocabulary with a lot of old topics we learned in L1 and L2, which helps really cement the grammar in your head. The readings and discussions help you learn new vocabulary very organically, and really develop a lot of french in a short amount of time. However, the course packet exercises could be improved. I found that the audio system was frustrating because it made you go at the pace of the audio, so you would waste a lot of time doing exercises slowly if it was a topic you understood well. I also found that the exercises from L1 and L2 were much better at focusing on the hard parts of certain topics and really making you work the most challenging areas. In contrast, this semester a lot of the exercises felt tedious and more like busy work. They also tended to take more time than last semester which was an extremely frustrating combination, as it felt like you were doing more work to learn less. For example, when we did past tenses this semester, there was one worksheet that just involved putting like 50 verbs in Passe Compose, which was tedious and not very helpful, especially since a lot of the verbs were regular verbs, making the exercise incredibly repetitive. I would recommend changing the course packet, and maybe involving more exercises from French in Action, as overall, those exercises seem to be better designed. There should also be a time limit on how much homework students have to do per night, as more than 2 hours per night is extremely excessive, and I think putting a time limit would force a more careful selection of the exercises, to make sure they really maximize our learning and minimize busy work.",
    "I feel that Madame Skorupa does a remarkable job of balancing the set syllabus and creative exercises of her own design. The more organic opportunities for conversation in French, the better. Madame Skorupa facilitated such opportunities very well, particularly through her innovative cultural exchange program with the French university Telecom.",
    "This course was perfect, with the exception of the long audio exercises haha!",
    "Very in depth, lots of work",
    "This curriculum of this course was engaging and interesting. One improvement could be to alter the french audio recordings and exercises to be more concise (most had many long pauses that add up to minutes per recording), so that the already large amount of homework does not also include wasted time."

    "Absolutely! It definitely depends on their reasons for wanting to take it though. For people who love languages and French in particular, the intensive nature of this class will be a dream. It was one of my most rewarding Yale experiences. But for those who aren't compelled to take it for some deep, desperate reason, this class may just be a slog.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Skorupa is thoughtful, flexible, and tremendously compassionate. You will not find a better professor of French anywhere.",
    "Yes, if you really want to be able to speak and understand French. No, if you're just trying to fulfill a language requirement.",
    "This course is a ton of work. It is more work than first semester intensive, but it has the advantage that you can do the work ahead of time much more easily. I would definitely recommend doing as much as you can during the weekend so that you don't get as stressed out during the week. The readings were interesting and you review a lot of the grammar from last semester, so that by the end it all comes very naturally to you. You improve your vocabulary and fluency a ton and Madame Skorupa is a very dedicated teacher who does a lot of very sweet things for her students. However, I found that the worksheet problems were poorly designed, especially relative to last semester. It felt like a lot of busy work, and that they were often spent too much time on the easier aspects of grammar topics, and not enough on more difficult concepts. You also had to do them with audio tape things which was super frustrating, because the tapes gave you the prompts for the questions on the worksheet, so you couldn't go faster on the homework than the audio tape, but the audio tape was often super slow. The course got better later on, but still it was more busy work than first semester intensive.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to excel in French and is willing to put a lot of time and effort into doing so.",
    "YES! 100% yes! This will become one of your most memorable academic experiences at Yale, trust me!",
    "Absolutely! Only if you really have a passion for learning languages, though, as it is a lot of work.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is motivated to take an intensive course and is excited about learning french. This course is an extremely rewarding experience but has a large workload, so you have to remain committed to doing all of the work and staying excited about the material to get the most out of the class."
