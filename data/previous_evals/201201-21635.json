   "comments": [
    "Basics of linguistics: syntax, semantics, pragmatics, morphology, phonology. Pretty interesting stuff, and stuff that I'd recommend to anyone as just good things to know about english.",
    "This is a great sampler course if you want to learn what linguistics is all about. Sometimes the lectures could get a little boring, but in the end I found the class worthwhile since it gave me a great survey of a truly fascinating field.",
    "If you think you might be interested in linguistics, it's worth at least shopping this class. It covers a lot of different areas of linguistics, which is helpful for figuring out whether there is a particular area that you want to pursue. The work load is very manageable - just a short-ish pset each week.",
    "Yeah, sure. It's an easy class, fairly interesting, although a little arbitrary. Many things seemed to be made up, but the material was graspable and interesting.",
    "LING 110 would make a good fifth course. The subject is relatively interesting, there's not much work, and it's pretty easy. But don't expect lecture to be the most exciting thing in the world.",
    "I wouldn't consider the class a complete gut, but it was fairly easy. Problem Sets are not too bad, but lecture can feel like a reiteration of the reading. That being said, lectures can become quite boring, but one can easily get through the course just by doing the reading.",
    "yes take it, you'll be able to impress so much by your newfound linguistics knowledge.it's not a lot of work at all--should be a famous gut class in my opinion. tests are really easy, and the homeworks are like an hour a week.",
    "I initially had this class in my schedule as one of those \"extra\" classes that I thought I would have to cut. But I found the material so interesting that I decided to stay. Take it if you like humanities-type stuff but are also mathematical\/scientific. I actually think the more logical mathy people do better in this class, not the people who speak seven languages and think they know everything there is to know about language in general.",
    "Take it. Shop it with a few friends, and convince them that it's going to be easy and low-commitment.",
    "No I would not recommend Linguistics 110 to another student. The homework takes forever to do and I dreaded going to the lectures. The class was not what I thought it would be.",
    "I would summarize Linguistics as ALL OF THE BEST EVER.",
    "This was a good course. Although the material may not necessarily be as useful as that from other courses, the class is interesting and you learn a good amount. Professor Deo is very approachable and sweet and makes lectures enjoyable. The problem sets are not very long and they are a great way to help your grade. Two midterms and a final, which are good tests. If you know the material, you will do well in the class.",
    "Yes, it isn't too hard and you'll learn why languages are amazing.",
    "This is just a simple introduction to linguistics, and it goes through all of the relevant concepts, but one must be interested in the material to stay engaged. It had both a quantitative aspect and a qualitative part and they were generally balanced.",
    "I might call this a gut class. It was very interesting, but it required little to no work. I could go into a midterm with as little as an hour of studying and feel completely prepared. This might be a reflection on Ashwini's good lecturing. This class was weird in that it was a survey course--all the information presented was very disjointed (two weeks on phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, etc.). It was definitely a good way to explore many areas of a field as large as linguistics--it helped me realize which areas were interesting to me and which were not.",
    "It's a good, fairly easy class for a social science credit, but ONLY if:- you like linguistics- you do the reading (it's so easy, too - only 15-30 pages per class in a very readable textbook)- you take the time to go to section and office hours - otherwise, the problem sets go from busywork to very difficult. If you get to know your TA, you'll be fine!Professor Deo is a good lecturer and posts the slides every week, and she's such a nice person, too! Basically, a class that's interesting and not too difficult - if you are interested in linguistics, shop it and see if you like it!",
    "This is the easiest course I've taken at Yale. Along the way, you'll learn a few interesting things (not that many, because you won't learn that many things in the first place). But this class is not a prerequisite for other linguistics courses and there's a reason for that: it's so broad that it offers absolutely no depth in any of the fields it \"covers\".If you're looking for a fun gut SO (is there a dearth of these?), go for it, but if you're actually interested in linguistics, you might want to jump straight to the higher level classes.",
    "Boring. And I'm interested in this stuff. I hear the higher-level linguistics courses are better, so maybe just skip this one.",
    "Only for linguistic majors.",
    "This is a really good, thorough, interesting introduction to an enormously rich and diverse field of study. We discuss the six basic levels of linguistic analysis, plus contactphenomena, patterns of linguistic change, and questions in neurolinguistic research. The course is well-organized (no subject is underexplained or overemphasized) and the workload (eight short p-sets, short textbook readings) is eminently manageable. Tests can be tricky but are generally fair, and I do recommend going to section (optional, and more of a help session) as often as possible. The course focuses mainly on English -- so those with substantial backgrounds in other languages and\/or a particular interest in linguistic diversity or comparative linguistics might be a bit bored at times. Overall, though, this is an awesome course -- easy, well-taught and totally fascinating.",
    "This class was not as interesting as it could have been, mostly due to the professor (Ashwini). She didn't put forth much effort to engage us in the lectures, and as a result, they were sometimes boring. For the most part, though, the class was somewhat interesting and not too hard.",
    "Ashwini's a pretty good professor, I think I just wasn't all that interested in the subject matter - linguistics is a newish field and though some of it is interesting, a lot of it seems like bs some of the time. A few tips: do not skip a pset, they're worth 5% of your grade each, section is optional and pointless, and the exams are straightforward if you study.",
    "The material is fascinating, but the lecture is mediocre. It gives you a very good overview of most of the different fields of linguistics. Not many people show up for lecture because if you do the readings, you don't really have to. There's not much work- it's an easy A.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is not too difficult, and the workload is very manageable. The only issue is that the topics covered are very diverse, so some parts of the semester will be much more interesting than others.",
    "I would recommend linguistics to someone who is looking for a broad overview of linguistics and who likes large lectures. Sometimes I found it a little boring, but a lot of the time if was fun and not that much work!",
    "I would recommend LING 110 for any student looking for an interesting class that isn't too much of a time commitment. I'm so glad I took the class!",
    "Linguistics 110 is a good introductory course. Not too much work, but it does get somewhat technical -- you learn real linguistics, not just a high-level gloss of what it's about.",
    "This class is easy, but it's also really boring. The class is way too superficial, making it difficult to stay awake through lecture.",
    "it is a pretty boring class for anyone who is not very interested in the topic of language. i wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they showed a great interest in the subject. and it is a lot of work if you just take it to fill a requirement.",
    "The material covered is often interesting but Professor Deo's lectures were not. Her slides (which she posted online) were nearly self-explanatory. Any gaps could be patched by Google searches and occasional emails. I recommend that if you take this class with Professor Deo you skip lecture and devote time to going over the slides with a friend. You wil save time and frustration. The first midterm was somewhat difficult, the second midterm and the final were both straightforward. The weekly homework is quick, but sometimes inane or poorly thought out. This class had its moments, but did not do its subject matter justice.",
    "It is a very interesting course that lets you get a good introduction of linguistics without branching into anything too difficult in any given area.",
    "This is a great class for what it is--an introduction to all things linguistics. If you like linguistics, you'll like this class, and it's not that hard. It gives an introduction to all the different fields in linguistics, not so far in depth, but that's an intro course, and it's enough to let you know if you want to take a class further in the topic. Ashwini is a good professor, kind and helpful and well organized, although occasionally the lecture can get a little boring. Section is optional and helpful for some topics but unnecessary for others, so that works well. 2 midterms and a final, weekly psets.",
    "This was a really interesting course, with a lot of useful things learned. That being said, be prepared to put in the effort, especially on the reading, to know the material backwards and forwards, since many things on the exams are not covered or only covered very briefly in class.",
    "About average for a introductory course. However, if you have any interest at all in progressing beyond the basics in Linguistics, it would probably be a better idea to take another course."
