    "Take it if you have a project you really care about. It will be stressful, but if you keep up with your research throughout the semester, you'll feel great about the end product.",
    "It's mandatory if you're writing an independent thesis, but it was definitely helpful.",
    "I'm glad that I wrote the senior essay because it was a good culmination of my academic work. That said, the class contributed very little. The entire department needs to get its act together making the major more structured and instituting some depiction of what it is. Right now, if the word american appeared in the course lectures at any time, it counts. That's not what AmStud is about--projects and instructors should focus more on the interdisciplinary nature of the major. There should be more structure\/required courses so that AmStud majors feel a better sense of community because it is a small major. Also Camacho was a superior DUS to Dudley who doesn't seemed to care at all about the individual undergraduates in the major or even the trajectory of the department collectively.But FYI, my senior essay monopolized my time more than anything else this semester except Netflix, but such was due to my work on the essay rather than anything relevant to the course which was an occasional ninety minute blip on my radar."
