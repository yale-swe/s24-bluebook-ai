   "comments": [
    "The course presents a literary and political overview of Rome. The course is small and allows for very fruitful discussion. It utilizes a variety of media, including art pieces, poems, historical accounts, etc. and convers the major themes of Rome over a vast period.",
    "It's a bit like DS with its cannon of books, but focused on Rome. In addition there are powerpoints dedicated to looking at architecture. Students are encouraged to explore Rome through both readings and actual explorations around New Haven and in museums. The class is advertised as a seminar, but is more of a small lecture class with ample opportunity to interject and ask questions.",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Jewiss is one of the greatest professors I've had at Yale. I've learned so very much in this course. We studied a wide range of topics regarding Rome over the centuries. It was very interesting to see the progression of one of the greatest societies the world has ever seen!",
    "This class is a rare find: truly interdisciplinary, diverse in terms of assignments, and a lot of fun to be in. A great illustration of what the humanities are all about. Would highly recommend."
