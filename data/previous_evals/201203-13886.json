    "Strengths: The professor had high expectations. I learned a lot in the class.Weakness: I would have liked to seen a different set up for the final project. I learned a lot about a systematic review but the entire process overshadowed what I actually learned about MCHN. I took the class to learn more about MCHN and I feel like I wasn't give the full opportunity to do this with this final project. I also think a research methods class is a more appropriate class for a SR.",
    "I liked the set up of the course in that the professor lectured about the topic of the day and then we discussed it. I prefer that to student led classes every week because I feel like we are exposed to the professional opinion and information rather than the student interpretation. THe major project of the year, the systematic review, was allotted sufficient time to complete and was a reasonable group project.",
    "good overall",
    "Great course. Learn about issues in maternal child public health.",
    "The course was very well structured and I learned a lot from the lectures and especially from conducting the systematic review. Discussions after each class were also very helpful.",
    "The material was extremely interested and the delivery was from an absolute expert in the field, which made it even more compelling. The guest speakers did not add much to the course overall.",
    "This course is poorly organized, and not at all informative. All I noticed was that the professor was never there to teach.",
    "Strengths: Excellent breadth and depth of material on maternal and child nutrition issues. Good to come out of this course with a solid skill (conducting a systematic literature review using PRISMA). Professor was willing to meet with student before\/after and outside of class and offer meaningful advice and support.Weaknesses: The deadlines for the systematic review of concentrated at the end of the course. Would be helpful to spread out a bit. Also, it would be helpful to have one lecture from the Librarian, Jan Glover, and the details of literature searches using various search engines."

    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0I was impressed that despite his busy schedule he graded\/commented on our work instead of having the TA do all of it. However, at the same time, because he is so busy, he missed some classes and while there was a movie one time, the TA spoke one time and one time there was a guest speaker, it seems like for a class that only meets once a week, there should be a greater commitment to be at class.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Dr. Perez-Escamilla is very passionate and knowledgable about this subject. I think he did a great job lecturing on the various topics and presented the information in an easy-digest-manner.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0very understanding",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0The professor is great. He does a lot in his field and his experience is a great addition to the course.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Great professor; really understands maternal\/child nutrition and gave us a very real-world view of infant health, growth and development.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Dr. Perez-Escamilla missed too many of our classes. For a once a week class, I just don't think this is acceptable, and it clouds everything else I might have to offer. Offering a 'powerpoint' given by the TA is not what I pay a fortune for.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Rafael missed out on many classes. As this class is taught only once a week, he should be committed to being there every week, or simply not teach a class. Our main project was to write a systematic review, yet there was extremely little instruction on how to do that, and almost no guidance. Although responsive to emails, I do not feel that Rafael had a strong connection with the students, and the class was not well-organized or well-taught.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Great wealth of knowledge and is able to communicate it clearly.Very personable and dedicated to class and students.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0I chose to take this course primarily based on the instructor. The instructor was passionate about the material, quite involved with the students projects, and always willing to offer extra material or input upon request. The instructor drew heavily from his own experience, which brought the material to life. The course could benefit from a wider range of global examples (examples were primarily drawn from S. and Cent. America and the US)."

    "This is a good course to learn more about MCHN issues. It can be a little more challenging if you have only had Epi 1 and not Epi 2. I didn't know some of the concepts and it isn't the type of class where they are explained. If you don't have a basic knowledge of nutrition issues, you will need to either learn them on your own or take another class first.",
    "This course is interesting while not be too time consuming. I think the topics are relevant to many areas of study and you have a chance to be taught by one of the leading academics in MCH in the world. I would recommend this class.",
    "very specific",
    "Learning about various topics in maternal child public health, such as WIC, breastfeeding initiatives, etc.",
    "Great course! Would definitely recommend to a fellow student.",
    "a wonderful, expert overview of the primary maternal and child health issues",
    "I would not recommend it if you are looking for global health credits.",
    "Excellent overview of a variety of issues in maternal and child nutrition, from a public health approach. I would highly recommend this course for anyone interested in the topics in the syllabus, or for anyone wishing to learn to conduct systematic literature reviews (though not meta analyses)."
