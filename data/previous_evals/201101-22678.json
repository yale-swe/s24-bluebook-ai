    "This class was amazing. I looked forward to it. The discussions were intelligent and intuitive, while the workload is pretty minimal (two reading responses + final paper).",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It's relevant, interesting, fun, and not an overwhelming amount of work. Professor Pabst is fascinating and has a really unique take on many topics compared to a lot of her colleagues in the department.",
    "An interesting class with a good reading list, and a generally manageable workload. Pabst is nice and good at leading classroom discussion. Sometimes she cancels classes unexpectedly. There is a reasonable amount of work.",
    "Definitely take the class! You won't regret it. I plan on taking another class with Professor Pabst before I graduate.",
    "Definitely. The books are fascinating, and you can really learn a lot."
