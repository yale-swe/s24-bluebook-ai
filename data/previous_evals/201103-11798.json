    "This class is for seniors who want to be intensive majors. I would definitely recommend it! It's really exciting to have an awesome finished project by the end of the year - totally worth the extra semester of work. Also, Professor Smith and Shai are great.",
    "If you're thinking about the intensive sociology major, definitely do it! This seminar is extremely helpful and exists to make the process much more feasible and at times fun. Feasible because you will be going through the entire process with a bunch of peers in the same situation and with plenty of individualized guidance from Professor Smith and your TA. Fun because the sociology department loves its intensive majors and provides cookies.The amount of individualized guidance we've received as well as the camaraderie of working with our peers on similar projects is definitely another reason I am so happy to have chosen to major in sociology."
