    "I learned about a few ways that people are using art to try to change the world, and I appreciate that. I did not develop as much as I'd hoped because the material was not always that beneficial or engaging.",
    "In this class I read important texts in arts education and activism and developed my ability to think, talk, and write critically about various service initiatives and the philosophy behind them.",
    "I learned about the important role that artists have to play in shaping society, and to think critically about the way we present our work.",
    "I developed the ability to think imaginatively and critically about the ways music\/art can be used as a tool for social justice. I was exposed to influential writers and thinkers I hadn't encountered before in my studies as a music major."

   "comments": [
    "I didn't enjoy this class. The discussions were all very similar, and conversation was too focused on philosophical approaches to education and art. It would have been more valuable to focus more on concrete ways that people are using music to impact society, with some philosophy and theory added to justify and support those approaches. We talked about that in the second half of the semester, but it was too late at that point. The conversation leading exercise diminished the effectiveness of the discussions. I think the final project was a good exercise and probably the best part of this course.",
    "The texts and discussions for this class were amazing, as were Professor Ruth's insights and leading of the discussion. I really liked the discussion forum and having students start off the class with discussion questions. Sometimes I wished the class were a little smaller, so that the discussion could go further. One weakness was that we received delayed or no feedback on the two portraits.",
    "I loved the open (but subtly guided) discussions.",
    "The course was wonderful. The only weakness in my mind was that the seminar was rather large, which tended to make it difficult to have a balanced group discussion. This could be improved by having more frequent small-group breakout sessions. Having deadlines for reading responses Sunday at noon was not a huge problem, but since weekends were often quite busy for me, I would have preferred deadlines to be Sunday evening, which would still have given discussion leaders most of Monday to read over the responses."

   "comments": [
    "This class was absolutely amazing. Professor Ruth is brilliant and charismatic, and he does a fantastic job of leading discussion without taking it over or dictating where it should go. The texts are fascinating and everyone in music should read them at some point. I often found myself wishing that the class were longer than two hours.",
    "This class has transformed my approach to making art. Take this class to learn about the purpose of art through art theory and social\/civic practice.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This is particularly a good course for undergrad music majors because it is so radically different from anything else in the music department. The course focuses on art in a social context and promotes a whole different set of values compared to the rest of the department, which is focused purely on classical music for its assumed intrinsic value. Take it early--I took the class senior spring, but I would have appreciated this perspective as a junior if not even earlier in my Yale career."
