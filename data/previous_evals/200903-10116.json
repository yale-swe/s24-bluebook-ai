    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. The course was a fun and informative introduction to how beer is made. It is a science credit, but the science is not overly difficult and is always explained well. Also, the class is about beer...what more needs to be said?",
    "Take it! A fun and interesting science credit. Not a gut \u0097\u0097 you have to try hard. But it's definitely worth it.",
    "The Science of Brewing investigates scientific topics, from across disciplines, within the context of brewing beer. For people, such as myself, who aren't crazy about science, yet would like to get a solid introductory level foundation, AND have an interest in beer, this is the ideal class. Otherwise boring topics seem more interesting when trying to understand a topic that so many college students have such an affinity for. It isn't easy, and at times can be frustrating, but Prof. Williams is excellent at presenting the information in a reasonably easy to understand manner. For a science class, this on is excellent. Take it.",
    "it's a fascinating science-based look into brewing -- think your junior-high science classes about protons and eukaryotic cells and enzymes, but a little more advanced and related to beer. the first paper involved relating brewing to each student's major, which was really, really cool to hear about. it's a relaxed course and you'll learn a lot.",
    "Best class ever.",
    "Yes. this was a fun class in which I learned a lot that I have already used day to day. it wasn't the most stimulating class-time experience, but I'm very glad i learned what I did. The papers were interesting and fun to do and the guest speakers were great. You don't actually get to brew beer which would have really helped the course. It's a great way to get a science credit.",
    "An enjoyable and unusual re-introduction to high-school science. Not as concerned with beer itself as you might think.",
    "Definitely. This is a great Sc class for students who either have an interest in brewing or want to learn about a specific application of science in daily life.",
    "If you have any interest in beer and brewing, than this course should be at the top of your list.",
    "A great review of the various scientific fields in the context of brewing. It really was a great class - the papers were fun to write and the weekly assignments were never too complicated (though be careful because you could very easily spend much more time than was necessary since the expectations are occasionally badly defined). Still a fantastic course - you learn an insane amount about beer.",
    "Great science credit; you will learn a fair amount the brewing process and probably be surrounded by a lot of good kids.",
    "Learn the basics of the brewing process and the bio\/chemistry behind it.",
    "Take the class because it is the most interesting and eyeopening science class I have ever taken. I went from struggling to remember high school biology in the beginning of the semester to reading detailed experiments and scientific studies of brewery waste water composition at the end o the semester. If nothing else, this class taught me a different way to approach scientific material. The class also is very applicable for ANY college student's understanding of the intricacies of the brewing process."
