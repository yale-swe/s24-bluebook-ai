    "I honestly don't know if I would recommend the class. Someone could get just as much from reading Shakespeare on his or her own as I got from this seminar. We read Shakespeare plays, we didn't really talk about them or about the companion Jacobean plays, we moved right on to the next Shakespeare play we really didn't talk about, etc. The seminar just didn't do anything for me. It didn't help me get a better idea of the period, or familiarize me with new material, or open up Shakespeare to me in interesting ways, or show me the type of class I would one day like to teach. It's not a bad seminar, it's just not a great one either. You take it because you have to take it.",
