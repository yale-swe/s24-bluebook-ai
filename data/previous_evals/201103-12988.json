    "I recommend this class, especially with Lourdes. I'd say maybe about half the class hadn't taken Spanish before, I know a few had taken lots of French and were starting Spanish as another language. I took some Spanish in high school but forgot much it over the past two years so I bombed the placement exam. Intensive covered everything from the ground up so I was sure I wouldn't overlook any gaps in my knowledge, and it went at a fast enough pace that I wasn't totally bored doing busywork and sitting through classes on things I already knew. This class WILL improve your speaking skills IF you just speak up! Say things and interact in class even when you're not required to, volunteer for doing little skits in class, and express your opinion during discussions. I'm not sure how the workload compares to a \"normal\" Spanish class, but it was manageable even in a 5-credit semester (including two demanding science credits). There's one oral presentation that takes a lot of time to prepare, but other than that it's a pretty low-key demand. Lourdes was an absolute joy even at 8:30 in the morning, so do try to take a Spanish class with her if you have the option.",
    "this is a great class - the amount of work is sensibly higher than normal language classes (non-intensive) but if you're ready to work a little bit every day by the end of the semester you will have learnt a lot!",
    "You learn a lot of Spanish VERY quickly. I think I might've done better and retained more in a slower paced class, but that being said, I cannot believe how much ground I've covered. This is not a class for the faint of heart, and don't expect an A.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. The class time is the biggest time commitment. The workload is totally manageable, although I do not recommend taking this course along with other language courses. Take it if you want to learn Spanish really quickly! It works!",
    "if you're okay spending a lot of time in class, this course is great for you. your comprehension and speaking skills will astound you by the end of the semester.",
    "A good amount of effort is required, but by the end of the course you will be speaking relatively fluent Spanish with few problems.",
    "I would recommend the course to any student prepared to be engaged 5 days a week. It is a great deal of time both inside and out of the classroom, but well spent."
