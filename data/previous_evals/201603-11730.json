    "I learned about Asian image in Latin American culture, which I really didn't know about before. It was a pretty interesting survey and I feel I got a good sense of political and social movements along with literature.",
    "How to think critically about literature and discuss it in Spanish. Also, the class made broad connections to the relationship between some pieces of Latin American literature and Asian imagery that I would have never made on my own.",
    "I think I gained a new appreciation for the relationship between literature and society and the marginalization of asian experience in latin american literature, even if it was unintentional."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the number of readings we had per class were excessive because we usually didn't have enough time to talk about them. I also think it might have been more engaging if we had more classes like the trip to the art gallery or if we had more formal in-class participation requirements. I also think it would have been interesting to consider non-literary aspects of Asian image and perhaps move a little quicker from Orientalism to Asian heritage authors.",
    "Truly an amazing course! All of the literature that we read was incredible, and I had not read most of it. The way in which each week tied back to the broader themes of the class was great. Also, the essays and critical analyses that accompanied some of the works were helpful in terms of being able to fully grasp the material.",
    "I think that the course was very interesting. I might have enjoyed reading even more asian\/latinamerican writers and having more student led discussions (maybe even have students sign up to guide a section, with instructor guidance\/contribution, of course) to help encourage higher engagement."

    "This is a good course for someone with relatively advanced Spanish reading skills. The readings are largely interesting. The workload is doable and it is an interesting topic.",
    "YES! If you are interested in the intersection between many different cultures, then you should definitely take this class! It was incredible to analyze Latin American works from a different perspective, and understand their global relationship. Anbal is a great professor, and he along with our TA (Janelle) facilitated the class discussions in an organized and interesting manner.",
    "This class was very insightful about the portrayal of Asians in latinamerican literature. To me it felt like the perfect blend of literature meets history course amd is up to this point my favorite class I've taken\/offered by the spanish departmeny"
