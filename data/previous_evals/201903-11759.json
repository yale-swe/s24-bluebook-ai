   "comments": [
    "You learn to think about the avant-garde as a conceptual framework, and then apply this to the specific context of the Russian avant-garde. The course begins very theoretically (you read theories about the avant-garde from a mostly non-Russian perspective) and moves quickly to Russians texts from the early revolution period all the way to the modern day.",
    "I enrolled in this course with little past exposure to Russian avant-garde poetry and am leaving this course with a wealth of knowledge about a) the main critical theories of the avant-garde and b) the evolution of the Russian avant-garde, from the first wave to the contemporary. I have developed a much greater appreciation for the avant-garde and for contemporary Russian poetry. I have developed a better sense of political, historical, and economic trends in 20th- and 21st-century Russia. I also improved my ability to secondary readings as well as my Russian close reading skills. It's hard to express just how much I learned in this course!",
    "A greater understanding of the tradition of Russian Avant Garde poetry. As well, the ways politics in the Soviet era affected the artistic world.",
    "The course provided a firm theoretical background on the concept of Avant-Garde art more generally, and in context of Russian poetry in particular. This course has deepen my knowledge in prosody, and provided a safe space for rigorous intellectual discussion.",
    "Close reading, argument building, research and presentation skills"

   "comments": [
    "This course is amazing. Professor Bozovic is incredibly knowledgeable and excellent at running class discussion. I have almost no recommendations to improve the course except that I would have liked to maybe spend a week or two more on the most contemporary avant-garde material, but that just may be a personal preference!",
    "This course has many more strengths than weaknesses. One of the course's strengths is its chronological order, which nicely pairs with a fascinating overarching focus on the evolution of the Russian avant-garde. Another strength is the emphasis on student presentations; I gained a lot from writing, presenting, and listening to in-depth reading responses. A third strength is the professor: Marijeta Bozovic is a phenomenal instructor. My only suggestion would be to spend more time on primary material. I sometimes felt bogged down by the amount of secondary criticism assigned each week and wish I could have delved further into the works of the poets we discussed!",
    "This course is fantastic. The discussion was well directed and we had exercises in close reading that aided the discussion immensely. More of these exercises from the beginning of the semester would have been better.",
    "I love Marijeta's approach to divide us into groups and to develop a mutual understanding of a poem. I also love the format of the presentations in this course, and the final task. This is an amazing course and I am very happy for the opportunity to take it.",
    "The course was well-designed for its purpose."

    "Yes, absolutely, if you know Russian and are interest in poetry\/the avant-garde\/theory, then this course could not be more perfect.",
    "Yes, absolutely! If you take this course, you will fall in love with the avant-garde. The readings are fascinating. The discussions and in-class exercises are varied and informative. All in all, a phenomenal class, and one you won't forget!",
    "Absolutely. It's definitely a class for students of unique interests, but its engaging even to someone that doesn't tend to study this era of Russian literature.",
    "Definitely! This is an excellent course for anyone interested in Avant-Garde and\/or poetry.",
    "I would recommend this course."
