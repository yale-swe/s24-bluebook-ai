    "As an MEM, Silviculture was a stretch. I dont know tree ID, i didn't take stands, etc. It's a lot of information. a ton of material- the most. but it is, i think, indeed the quintessential Yale Forestry course. Some say its stand dynamics, but there's no one like Mark Ashton, especially in the woods.its really really an ecology course, so watch out. Those interested in Management plans, or land management more generally, you may be disappointed (as i was) that there isn't more landscape scale stuff.its four credits for a reason get ready to work.the reading blows but it helps.",

Both the teaching fellows were great and necessary to help the class go smoothly. They provided alternative means of explaining concepts if Mark Ashton could not get the idea across. The reading load was heavy but not essential to understand the material or pass the exams--maybe make them more necessary if so many are going to be assigned. The exams were very fair, and I was glad not to have to write the prescription. I felt the workload adequately reflected the 4 credits earned and the amount of effort I put towards the class!",

The primary mode of evaluation was through exams and class attendance\/participation, but I felt like I would have been able to better integrate the material if there had been a couple of small assignments over the course of the semester--so that we could have seen how well we were putting material together and also to give us an additional opportunity to engage more with the material.",

Which makes it good for MEM students, and I'm really glad that we have them because it gives the class a critical mass. I'm aware that this class is the \"flagship\" class for MEMs interested in forestry.But I came to the school to get a Master of Forestry. And here I am, taking Silviculture because this is our only silviculture class, and learning, over the course of ONE SINGLE CLASS, about the whole discipline once called Silvics, about principles of Forest Ecology, Silviculture, site treatments and planting, wildlife habitat, forest operations, landscape architecture, urban forestry.Don't get me wrong: this diversity of issues make the class interesting, and the way Mark Ashton works to integrate all of them is nice. We get a holistic view.But I took Forest Operations with Mike Ferrucci, and the session about forest operations was redundant to me. And I took Stand Dynamics, and the session about stand dynamics was redundant to me. And I took Forest Health, and the class about wildlife habitat was redundant to me.On the other hand, I never had to opportunity to take a class about forest ecology, and it will never be offered to me during my curriculum.More importantly, I will never have the opportunity to learn more about silvicultural treatments. And this to me is such a huge disappointment. To spend one class one selection systems, one class on shelterwood systems. While all over the world foresters are tearing each other apart debating about single cohort versus multi-age, about \"close-to-nature\" versus traditional forestry, and so on.I would have loved to learn more about the birth of each of these doctrines and the rationale behind them. Loved to learn about instances where they worked, instances when they failed and why they did. Growth& Yield models. Numbers, quantitative facts about the yield of different approaches. How they can or cannot be implemented depending on your climate, species, yield constraints, and manpower.I would have loved to take an entire class on Forest Ecology\/Silvics. An entire class on Silviculture. An entire class about Forest Policy. To cut down on the redundant, superficial content. I guess this is not how the program is built as of today. I suppose we just don't have people to teach these classes.So in short - the instructor is great. But he's trying to teach us both too much in terms of scope, and too little in terms of depth. Should be renamed Introduction to Silviculture.(Yes, I know there's the Southern Fieldtrip and the Germany Fieldtrip and Forest Crew and the opportunity to work at the School Forests Office. Still, the core of what we learn should not depend entirely on extras. We're in Forestry School: the core of what we learn should be what is taught.)",

    "Definitely take it, even if you are just auditing, which is what I did. It had no real \"relevance\" to my course of study, but is such a great class, and Ashton if really a wonderful lecturer.",
    "Pay attention!",
    "If you feel that the lectures are a little too fast, that you're not understanding everything, or that you don't have the forestry background that many other students seem to have, I would read Dr. Ashton's \"Applied Silviculture\" textbook. It really helped me understand the concepts on a much deeper level.",
    "It depends what you want to get out of it...but, I would highly recommend the course to anyone considering it. It feels like a core class for students at the Forestry school...we spent significant time outdoors, which helped to make concepts more real. The class allowed for different styles of learning--experiential and book.",
    "Every ardent and aspiring environmentalist must take this course. It goes beyond just forests",
    "If you feel you have to take a forestry course, this is the one for you. If you don't need to take a forestry course, I wouldn't bother."
