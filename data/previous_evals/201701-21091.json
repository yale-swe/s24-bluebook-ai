    "You read very interesting Soviet literature and watch very provocative Soviet\/post-Soviet film; however, the class always runs overtime. The session definitely should have been longer!!",
    "I liked how we read excerpts of Russian literature for class - I think it's really interesting to read sources in the original language. However, I felt that the amount of homework assigned was a little inconsistent and often a little too much for the one day between classes."

    "Because of the nature of this class, there are many different language levels which can make it hard to tailor the class to everyone's individual needs. There is a good combination of grammar\/vocabulary, reading, and speaking practice. The class is very much discussion-based, so be prepared to talk about the readings or practice vocabulary and grammar.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class as a continuation of fourth-year Russian. If you enjoyed and learned from the first semester of this course you will continue to do so in this class. Take especially for the focus on literature and film, and early soviet history."
