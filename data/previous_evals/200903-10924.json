   "comments": [
    "It's a required class for us, so at least it isn't too stressful.",
    "I would say yeah, its interesting if you are into Spanish and linguistics. Otherwise you'll be bored. Also it's once a week for 2 hours so by the end of those 2 hours you are like, OK, enough. But it's still really interesting.",
    "Spanish 500 01 provides a linguistic and historical overview of the evolution of Latin into the various Romance languages. The course's focus is clearly the development of Spanish specifically and its emergence from Latin. The linguistic emphasis of the class is the emergence of medieval Spanish out of Latin, but the latter part of the course addresses the development of modern Spanish and the formation of various dialects in Spain and Latin America. The course's overarching theme is the intersection of external historical and cultural developments and the internal evolution of language.",
    "Seeing as the course is required, I would definitely recommend it to all students, at least if they actually want to graduate! Joking aside, however, I would both take and recommend this course even if it were not required. As far as a summary is concerned, I think the title does a fair job of summing up the course, although I might add that it covers both the evolution of the language itself (changes in morphology, syntax, phonology, etc) as well as the historical factors affecting those changes. It is a more comprehensive view of the language than I had expected to get."

   "comments": [
    "A good overview of history of Spanish language. I now realize the why we have this required course in our department.",
    "Gave me background on history of Spanish which I will use in the future as a student of the language.",
    "Learning about the origins of Spanish provides me with an essential background for my current literary studies and future thesis research of Hispanic literature. In addition, the historical and linguistic content will hopefully help prepare me for comprehensive exams.",
    "On a practical level, understanding the different phases in the evolution of the Spanish language has made it much easier to understand older texts, particularly from the medieval era. I now have a context for deciphering words, spellings, and grammatical constructions that I could not recognize before. Additionally, studying many of the external factors that influenced the linguistic changes has also helped me understand some of the key themes that arise in literature, as authors were responding to the same historical context as language was. Finally, I feel I have a better understanding of how the language works on a technical level. This will help me to see more clearly the ways in which an author uses\/manipulates language in service of his\/her message, which will allow me to interact with texts on a deeper level.",
    "As an aspiring Medievalist, I appreciated this course for the link it provided between Latin and Spanish, and its broadening of knowledge around the historical context for language change in Spain."
