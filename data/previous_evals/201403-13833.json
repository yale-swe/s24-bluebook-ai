    "The best I have taken at Yale so far--certainly open it to undergraduates next year!! It is seminal is providing a foundation for students interested in food and agriculture and interest for these subjects is rapidly growing at Yale and there is a huge need for classes like this one to provide an overview of many of the most complicated issues surrounding food and what the future of food will look like. More than just the subject matter, the format of the class was also incredible engaging, useful, and enjoyable. The group projects and presentations allowed us to hone in upon research questions and facets of these larger overwhelming themes and also forced us to develop our presentation styles and articulation skills.",
    "Q 12 -- This course is a crucial component of the course offerings at FES related to food and agriculture because it provides an in-depth look at a number of topics. It also provides a strong foundation in the regulatory landscape of food and ag issues.",
    "This course was great. It gave students with an interest in this field a really strong forum for discussion about issues that, though seemingly different, tied together throughout the semester, creating a strong narrative about challenges and solutions in the food system. Students were given a lot of space to bring their own ideas, experiences and input to the course and I think I learned as much from my peers as from the readings and the teaching. This was a powerful mix!",
    "Prof. Wargo taught this class well...it was--as appropriately for a 700-level seminar--heavily reliant on student presentations and student-driven analysis. Prof. Wargo offered his own opinion and several lectures, which were helpful. The readings in the class were chosen well. The readings may have benefitted from some explanation of which readings to focus on more, and which readings to focus on less...the readings may also have benefitted from some more academic literature, particularly systematic reviews that provide broader overviews of each week's subjects. Prof. Wargo is often pretty skeptical of regulatory institutions, large corporations, and other large organizations. At the beginning of the class, this came across as bordering on the somewhat paranoid...but as the class progressed and the reasons for Prof. Wargo's skepticism became clear, this skepticism was an incredibly powerful tool. My only criticism (which is more of a suggestion than a criticism) is that I really wanted to hear more about Prof. Wargo's forthcoming book...it sounds interesting, and the class might have benefitted from some more of the insights from it. I understand that Prof. Wargo didn't want to take an excessively heavy-handed approach to teaching the class, and often seemed to hesitate before interjecting with his worldview, but this would have been fascinating. Overall, a great class.",
    "My main critique of this course was that it was focused on exposing students to issues rather than working through how to solve them. While this is acceptable for an undergraduate course (where a focus on awareness is necessary), a graduate-level course needs to teach management solutions as well as background information. One way to fix this would be to make this class be more case-based. On a weekly basis, student teams could be expected to not only read background material, but also provide a solution for how to solve the problem from different perspectives (e.g. EPA, private enterprise, or government). After this, the \"correct\" solution enacted could be reviewed and discussed. Another tweak to the course could also be to limit the amount of subject matter covered."

   "comments": [
    "The best aspects of the class were the group presentations, which allowed everyone to focus in upon a central question that excited them within these broad topic areas. Although I thought there could have been a better job done of mixing up the presentation groups, I was able to work with a different set of students every time and loved getting to know and work with a range of students and their respective interests, skills and backgrounds. I also enjoyed the sessions where everyone who wasn't responding had to do a short write-up answering a question or summarizing an article and then present that to the class in 2-5 minutes because it forces us to read, summarize, distill, and present in an articulate, coherent way. It also ensured that everyone was engaged and contributing even on the days when they weren't presenting. Needless to say, I loved the trip to the winery and to Wargo Ranch for dinner. That was such a special treat and was a real chance for the class to come together, grow closer, and enjoy learning and talking together outside the classroom.",
    "This was my favorite course of the semester. We had really excellent, informed, wide-ranging discussions. The presentations were a good learning mechanism to get deeper into each week's subject.",
    "The depth of analysis and discussion in the course was impressive given the number of topics covered. Readings were well-selected and extensive to provide information about each section. Discussions of risk assessment and regulatory strategies were particularly interesting.",
    "A very comprehensive overview of issues and topics in food. Great to have a food-centric course, there are not enough of them! I think the way it was broken up in sections (i.e. GMOs, certifications, etc) was very useful.",
    "The instructors genuine interest in learning - both from course material and from student work",
    "I enjoyed the readings, and the instructor led really interesting discussions and encouraged participation from everyone in the class.",
    "The discussions, though they often were lengthy, were always interesting and brought to light ideas that were new to me. We even continued these over email outside of class time which I think speaks to the success of this class in raising important and engaging questions and asking students to be creative and innovative in their analysis of them.",
    "I loved the group presentation aspect because it allowed me to handle the material in a way I probably wouldn't otherwise interact with it. I also enjoyed the different perspectives everyone brought to the class.",
    "The best aspects of this course were the presentations and discussions, as well as the wide array of topics covered throughout the course. We covered a lot of the most important topics in food and were able to get sufficient depth in each while still surveying everything from food certification to pesticides and animal feed. The presentations given by groups of students every other meeting provided great opportunities for discussion and a chance to delve deeper into the material.",
    "Already hashed out in my first answer...but the weekly case studies and student presentations were wonderful. Prof. Wargo was consistently helpful and available.",
    "-The breadth of subject matter. -The group work and presentations. -The structure of both above."

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "I have two suggestions for the presentations. The first is that I think it would be beneficial to mix up the presentation groups to ensure that each student gets the opportunity to challenge themselves and work with others in the class who might have differing styles, skills, backgrounds and interests to them. However, this makes the presentations all the richer and also allows students to develop their collaborative abilities, skills that is invaluable for environmental studies or F&ES students. I also think that there should be a strict time limit placed upon presentations. In the real world, students will not be able to talk for as long as they like, despite how interesting their subject matter might be. Imposing a time limit would ensure that students go to develop their synthesis and communication skills.",
    "Time management. Professor Wargo was too lenient with letting student presentations run WAY over time (20 minutes turning to 60!). As a result we never had enough class time to do everything he wanted us to do. Also discussions could be managed better to some extent. Some members of the class had a tendency to dominate the conversation.",
    "Stricter timing of student presentations would be helpful to leave enough time for class discussion after each presentation. For the readings, I preferred the model of assigning each group one reading and drafting a one-page summary. Ideally, these would be posted a few days before the class meeting to give students time to review the summaries. This would also help reduce the reading load, while still allowing students to do more reading about topics of particular interest.",
    "Although I see the value in class discussions, I think the course was way too discussion based. It would have been helpful to have a lecture-style overview and required readings for the first part of each section. After the presentation, there could be a class discussion. The following week, following student presentations on the subject, discussion also naturally follows. The summary of readings and in class projects were too inconsistent and scattered. As a result, things often seemed unorganized. Although people are obviously passionate and the discussions were enjoyable, I think leaving specific time for discussions and maintaining more structure would be better.",
    "I think that having shorter presentations might have allowed more time for discussion--the topics covered in class were all interesting led to great discussions, so it would have been good to have more time for discussion. Maybe in the future instead of having presentations every other week, some of the presentations could instead be in the form of \"discussion leading\", where groups take a deeper look into the subject matter and come up with discussion questions that the class can talk about.",
    "If anything, the course could have benefit from a slightly larger portion of lecture time compared to discussions and presentations. Sometimes it is good to get a comprehensive introduction to a topic before you go out to look for information.",
    "I would have liked to deal more with US agricultural policy as it relates to food issues.",
    "I already mentioned this, but more thoughts from Prof. Wargo in connection with his forthcoming book, as well as a more heavy-handed professorial approach in guiding class discussions, may have been helpful. These are admittedly very small criticisms in a well-taught class, which I looked forward to every single week.",
    "More discussion of the Future of Food outside of the realm of risk assessment and reduction."

However, both from conducting my own presentations and listening to the other group presentation (as well as reading the wealth of resources we had), I learned an extraordinary amount. Another unanticipated learning experience was through the group work and presentations we gave throughout the class. My collaboration and presentation skills developed in remarkable ways as well as did my ability to take a large, complex problem and focus in upon a certain aspect to convey it in a transparent and compelling way to the class.",
    "Yes! Professor Wargo is an invaluable guide to the intricacies of environmental health and food regulation, as well as the science behind them. I found myself constantly sharing what I had learned in class, and applying it in my own life.",
    "Yes, this course exceeded my expectations because of the depth of analysis and quality of presentations and class discussions.",
    "Yes in that I learned about the issues summarized in the prompt. The nature of the class as primarily\/dominantly class discussion based was not as expected.",
    "The knowledge and skills that I gained from the course exceeded my expectations. We covered an array of topics that I had previously not had that much exposure to.

I do wish that we had switched up the groups more often. I think that letting students choose their own groups certainly has merit and makes it enjoyable, but there's also much value in forcing students to work with others they don't know or are less comfortable with. In the future I would recommend assigning the first two groups and allowing students to pick their own groups for the last project.",
    "Group presentations were a useful tool to explore several topics within the course, and also provided an excellent discussion of topics that I did not present on. All the student presentations throughout the semester were well-prepared and informative.",
    "I enjoyed working with different people on the presentations throughout the semester.",
    "I enjoyed working with a group for the presentations. It stimulated small-group (3-4 people) discussion about some of the issues covered in class. It was difficult to find times to meet as a group, but I thought that the small group work was an important aspect of the course.",
    "The group work was enlightening and I am glad that we were able to work with different people on different assignments, as everyone seemed to have a slightly different background, so this gave us the opportunity to learn from not just one or two of our peers, but from a range.",
    "Sometimes group work was hard to schedule, but was ultimately helpful since the presentations made researching more focused and interesting.",
    "Group work went well...although I naturally prefer individual work, the types of group work (presentations, analysis of case studies) was well suited for group work. Positive experiences here.",
    "I can imagine there were disadvantages for others, but my group work was always helpful and illuminating-- working with others that are compatible in work style and ethic, while coming from different backgrounds is always illuminating."

The course material is extremely broad and you'll breeze through an impressive range of umbrella topics (plastics, food waste, biotechnology, food certification, etc.) and to get the most out of the class, it's good to be able to come at all of these topics with an understanding about what you want to get out of it and why you want to focus in on. Also, you get incredible leniency with your choice of topics for all of the group presentations and final paper so make sure you enjoy what you're working on! Also, go meet with Professor Wargo. He is wonderful and care so much about the class and the students in it. Make sure you take the time to come talk to him outside of class about what you're excited about.",

    "Take it!",
    "I would definitely encourage other students to take the course. The subject matter is fascinating, and the final term paper is very open-ended, which gives you the opportunity to explore a subject that interests you.",
    "This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale, and would recommend it to anyone interested in issues related to food and agriculture. It is unique in the way students engage with the material through presentations throughout the semester in which they are asked to discuss a particular issue and propose a solution. Professor Wargo is fantastic and extremely knowledgeable, and he makes himself very accessible to his students. Every topic we covered was interesting and relevant to everyone who is concerned about the environmental and health impacts of what they eat. This is a must-take course with an excellent professor.",
    "Do the readings...they're helpful. Begin working on the group presentations and case studies well in advance.",
