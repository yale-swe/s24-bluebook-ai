   "comments": [
    "I would but be prepared to do a fair amount of work to get all the projects done in good quality.",
    "This class is a lot of work, but the projects (often, you'll be working on several at the same time) are fun.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It is a great opportunity to develop as a designer and work on realistic projects from the starting idea all the way to the finishing details. Professor Chung is an invaluable guide throughout the design process. Her feedback was always constructive and she was readily available outside the classroom for additional guidance. After taking this class, I can't look at anything without instinctively thinking about the design.",
    "Definitely recommended. Alice is wonderful, and the class is usually pretty small so you get to know her and your classmates well. It's a laid-back atmosphere, but you'll work hard and really develop your design skills."
