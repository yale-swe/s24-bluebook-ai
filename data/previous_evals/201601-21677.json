    "Great course. Take it with Pamela Newton, she is a phenomenal human being.",
    "Great class! I do not expect to write very many essays in my time here at Yale, yet I am still very glad I took Engl 120. Readings were interesting, classes were enjoyable enough, and I found myself by the end really trying hard to improve my writing with each essay. Workload is basically 5 essays, readings (including drafts), and peer reviews. Pamela Newton is very nice and super helpful! This class has a lot to offer if you're already very confident with your writing or you're like me and need help. Start early on the interview!",
    "English 120 is great for those students who want greater exposure to nonfiction writing and greater control of their own voice on the page. I had a good deal of previous nonfiction writing experience before taking 120, but I definitely think my writing is tighter having taken 120.",
    "Great course with awesome homework that teaches you how to write about yourself. Definitely take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 120 to any student, even those who think they aren't particularly interested in non-fiction writing, because it covers a broad range of topics, so it would honestly be hard to never find a moment when you're interested in the class. The workload is doable, and you grow so much as a writer throughout the course.",
    "It's an awesome class with an awesome teacher. If you are looking for an English 120 class you can't go wrong with 03.",
    "ENGL 120 is \"how to write.\" It is not a class on reading texts and analyzing the meaning behind it. It's not \"read the Iliad and comment on the deeper meaning behind a metaphor,\" it's \"read a much shorter essay and find the metaphor and whether it works to support the author's point or not.\" You will read example essays and identify writing techniques, and you will have several opportunities to write your own essays on any topic. The prompts are very loose, such as \"place\" or \"humor.\" It does not focus on grammar and will not teach you how to write an academic essay, but does lay a solid foundation on how to engage with an audience. You are expected to share at least one essay with the class and may be expected to publish one in a Yale publication. Pamela Newton is an excellent teacher who knows what she is doing and efficiently leads the class through all the material in one period, and she is consistent with office hours and open to discussion.",
    "A good class for a writing credit. Expect some good tips for writing nonfiction but not necessarily good grades."
