    "Knowledge of pharmacology; it is far from my academic background but I was interested",
    "The course introduced how one should think about dosing schedules given the ADME properties of drugs, different physiological systems, and disease mechanisms and how and which drugs are used in treatment. Professors gave lectures pertaining to their expertise in different fields, ex. inflammation and asthma, radiation treatment, immunotherapy and chemotherapy treatment for cancer, antibiotics, enzyme kinetics etc...",
    "This course taught me the basic principles of drug discovery, development, and applications within the clinic.",
    "This class taught fundamentals of pharmacology and then followed up with various drug classes for specific conditions, as well as some potential therapies.",
    "I learned basic mechanisms of different classes of drugs, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics principles and insights on clinical trials.",
    "I now have a much better understanding of how drugs interact with the body, cancer development and treatment, and cell signaling pathways."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A lot of different professors (great survey course); sometimes hard to see what the takeaway of some of the lectures was supposed to be.",
    "Strengths: Broad view on therapies, Merck course in drug development, different lecture styles Weaknesses: Sometimes questions on exams were very broad and it wasn't clear why points were taken off",
    "A strength of the course was its integration of basic science and clinical practice. The first part of the course detailed traditional drug targets and the chemical properties that make molecules drug like. The second and third sections of the course then introduced how these compounds are used clinically and how modulation of the aforementioned properties can change patient administration, compliance, and side effect profile. Also, I enjoyed hearing lectures from both PhDs and MDs. This emphasized the transnational nature of much of the research done at the University and underscored the fact that the basic science we do in the lab can have a profound clinical effect. Although it was unavoidable due to cancelling of class by professors, the overall organization of the class could have been better. For example, the lecture on pharmacophores was in the second section, which was much more clinically focused. It would have been beneficial to learn about pharmacophores in the first section of the course when we were learning about pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics since the type of pharmacophore can affect these properties.",
    "The strengths of this course were that the lectures were generally given by competent lecturers with expertise in the subject in question. The material covered was also, for the most part, very interesting. The weaknesses of this class lie in its assessment of students. The midterms were not cumulative, meaning that essentially all prior material could be dispensed to focus on the next unit, and the exams almost entirely required straight regurgitation of material, simultaneously reducing the interest level of students and exacerbating the problem of forgetting important material from previous units. I think this is a problem because I found all of the material equally important, and now find myself having difficulty recalling the material taught earlier as I had to replace it with material of lesser importance, though still likely to appear on an exam. I think this course could be improved by limiting the amount of regurgitation of information. Being able to recall the information in a fill-in-the-blank sort of manner does not necessarily associate with understanding. Being able to integrate information in more real-world situations would be of more use; the first midterm did mostly fine with this as it was math based, I cannot recall any questions on the second midterm which were not straight memorization, and only Drs. Braddock and Lolis had questions which required more than direct recall on the third. Though this would alter the structure of the course, I think it would also be much more beneficial to have questions that crossed subject matter. The one questions per lecture concept is facile and convenient, but also doesn't really translate to many real world settings. I believe broader questions which display thinking are more valuable to students than hammering out specifics--it would also reduce the \"cut-throat\" nature of this course, where seemingly every point is so important to achieve the highest grade. I would advocate for a set up where achieving perfection is not the goal of the test taker, but instead showing one's thought process.",
    "The strength of the course is its teaching style. Each lecture was taught by a different professor. Many of the instructors have unique experience in drug development and clinics and they gave a lot of insights on their areas.",
    "Strength: the various lectures overlap well. Things I learned from one lecture helped with other lectures. Weakness: While faculty lectures tended to be good about this, some of the lectures needed more distinct take-away points. A lot of \"just in case you're interested\" information would obscure primary points."

   "comments": [
    "yes; interesting overview course",
    "Yes. It provides a good foundation in pharmacology and introduced students to the work of professors.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students who are interested in drug discovery and application within the clinic. The Yale\/Merck course that accompanies this class is unique and furthers students understand of the drug development process. It focuses on drug design within industry and the agency involved in monitoring drug safety and efficacy. I have had limited exposure to these topics and the course, which was video based and easy to complete, improved my understanding of these processes.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as it does a good job instructing in the foundations of pharmacology. I would however also mention how I dislike the assessment of students.",
    "Yes. The course is suitable for people who are interested in pharmaceuticals and want to learn the basics about it.",
    "Depends on what their interests are. If they're interested in cancer, then yes."
