   "comments": [
    "I think with a larger class this would be better - really small which made discussions hard, but I loved all the books we read and it was a good chance to explore Eastern literature and add perspective on the Middle Eastern conflicts happening today. Very few grades and kind of tough grading,",
    "Great!",
    "This is a great survey of Arab literature! If you have any interest in 20th century literature of any kind really, it's great. Creswell is a fabulous teacher. The discussions could lag, mostly because of our lack of contact with these literatures, but Professor always did a wonderful job grounding the works in context and leading the discussion along.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in the Middle East or Anglophone literature. Not only are the texts rich and interesting pieces to grapple with, Professor Creswell does a great job of centering them within a broader historical framework. I felt that much of the seminar's success lay in its ability to shift between close readings of the texts and the respective historical moments of each of the authors. In short, the course offers a stimulating and multi-disciplinary approach to some really great literature, guided by Creswell's thoughtful and holistic consideration of the readings. Take it!",
    "If you're interested in Middle Eastern Literature this is a great survey class. You'll come out of it with a much broader understanding of the literature and poetry. Professor Cresswell is one of those awesome Yale professors who seems to be an expert in his particular field yet makes himself available to every student. It's a great opportunity especially if you're interested in reading short novels every week.",
    "It's a well-done survey course, and you'll end the semester with a fairly good introductory understanding of Middle Eastern literature. The readings are all fantastic and most likely books\/authors you wouldn't have heard of or read before. Get a feel for the class dynamic discussions could be a bit dry and stilted at times (other classes were great), but that might've had more to do with the class than how Professor Creswell led it."
