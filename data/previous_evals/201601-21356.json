   "comments": [
    "Critique of Political Violence was a superb discussion of political theory and philosophy relating to the notion of violence, the foundations of governmental legitimacy, the basis of power, the relation between rationality and violence, and problems of coercion and administration. The course was comprehensive, and readings were varied and provocative. Professor Kapustin is an exemplary professor and an inspiration, and I would strongly recommend taking this course.",
    "This class is very philosophical and examines a lot of post-strucuturalists etc who speak in utterly incomprehensible allegories. This can make it hard to understand what on earth is going on. That said, Kapustin lectures so clearly that you will eventually understand what the readings are about even if you don't understand them at first. Advice of ratios class would be to take careful notes during class on readings you don't understand well. There are definitely some readings that I still can't make head or tail of, but can talk about them confidently due to how lucid Kapusitn's commentary on them was.",
    "Critique of Political Violence is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I recommend it to all who care about the topic of political violence, desire a rigorous intellectual experience, are willing to commit the time to doing all the readings. I would just add: be aware that the selection of readings are (as the syllabus states) predominantly from an \"existentialist, post-structuralist, neo-Marxist, critical-rationalist\" perspective.",
    "A comprehensive look at violence through the eyes of many fascinating people--Gandhi, Arendt, Keane, etc. Absolutely recommend, I am keeping my course packet forever so that I can revisit the readings.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. You will not regret it. Professor Kapustin may be the best professor I've had the privilege of taking a class from at Yale. He's an incredibly professional, caring, and knowledgeable instructor. Above all, he's a breathtaking seminar leader. I've learned so much from his mini-lectures over the course of this seminar. Thanks to his insightful comments and analyses, I feel quite prepared to engage with advanced topics in political philosophy and read some of the densest texts in the field. Professor Kapustin epitomizes a first-class Yale professor. He will teach you how to read and critique political philosophy in the best possible way. Overall, a great reading list and great discussions guaranteed.",
    "Fascinating class, complicated texts that will be deconstructed and critiqued in class.",
    "Take it if you get the chance; it is one of the best classes you will ever take.",
    "Absolutely! Amazing class, learned so much & Prof. Kapustin is brilliant. Definitely take if its offered again!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. SIS keeps signing me out, so this is my third time writing this review, but whether you love philosophy or have never read a philosophy text in your life, this class will be the perfect amount of challenging and will change the way you think. Discussion is always lively, and you will leave the class each week feeling smarter. I love this class, and cannot say enough good things about it. TAKE IT!!!!",
    "I took this class to give philosophy a try and discovered it wasn't for me--I often felt like the writers and my classmates were living in some alternate universe that had nothing to do with the real world as I know it. The only papers I found useful and interesting were the two or three sociology ones. I wouldn't take this unless you already have taken philosophy courses. If you do like philosophy, however, you'll probably love this course. The discussion was always animated and Professor Kapustin is truly passionate about what he teaches."
