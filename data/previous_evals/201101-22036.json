   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommend it, but like with any language, you will learn best if you are actually interested in and intrigued by the language\/culture.",
    "Japanese is the best. If the Japanese professors were to follow me around at all times and provide commentary and advice in my daily life, it would be basically the best thing ever. If you're even the tiniest bit interested in Japanese or in Japan, take this class. You won't regret it. It's a lot of work sometimes, but definitely manageable. The class environment is great \u0097 fifty minutes flies by every day. Definitely one of my best experiences at Yale.",
    "It is as great as last semester!",
    "Japanese 120 is an AMAZING course. The small class sizes are great for learning a new language, and you will definitely make a lot of progress in Japanese. The workload is a lot (like 110) because there is class\/homework everyday. All of the professors are super nice and approachable. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "The students have a strong sense of community, and band together to encourage each other. The students have built strong friendships and learned from one another.As a graduate student taking this class, I feel that I can interact well with the other undergraduates.I strongly recommend Japanese 110\/120 to any student who is serious about learning Japanese.",
    "yes, its hard but its really worth it. And its fun too",
    "If you have ANY interest in Japanese, or have no clue what language you want to take to fulfill your language requirement, this isby far one of the best options. Japanese is superbly taught at Yale.",
    "A fantastic class taught by an all star team of teachers. Harder than intro Chinese. You'll get a lot out of it though. Tons of memorization. I would highly recommend taking it - but be prepared to do the work. Probably pretty tough without any previous exposure to some Asian language.",
    "Great class. Really grounds you in the foundations of the language and teaches you practical conversational skills that would come in useful for daily use when visiting Japan. Most productive to take if you know you want to go to Japan in the future. Very work-intensive, so don't underestimate how much time of your day it will take.",
    "If you've taken L1 already, keep going! Japanese here at Yale is unbelievable, my favorite class at Yale. A big commitment, but so enjoyable and well worth it.",
    "Yes.It's intensive and useful.",
    "It's a great course - overall the best way to learn the language quickly, especially when coupled with the Light Fellowship. It is also, however, the easiest way to watch your grades drop unless you devote yourself wholeheartedly to the course.",
    "Recommend. But understand how much work it is--it might not be for you.",
    "Yeah, totally, go for it. Best way to learn Japanese anywhere. The work is very doable.",
    "I would highly recommend taking Japanese 120! The course truly prepares you to hold conversations in Japanese, and the class itself is so much fun. You will get to know your classmates as well as professors and teaching fellows well, and it is such a nice community to be in.",
    "An extremely rigorous course which may take time away from other courses taken in the same semester. I would advise any student to approach with caution. But if they were serious about learning Japanese, this course would help them significantly and effectively.",
    "recommend. i3 japanese",
    "If you have a strong interest in the Japanese culture and would like to learn the language, then take the class. The language itself is difficult to learn, but the professors are extremely engaging, kind, helpful, and very entertaining.",
    "Pretty similar format to JAPN 110. It's still a lot of work, but the senseis are incredible and the 110-120 sequence is definitely one of the academic highlights of my time at Yale.",
    "Do it. The class and the teachers are still as lovely as ever, it's still really, really hard, and if you do the work, even though you're not guaranteed to do well (at all), you'll have a great time and you'll learn a lot.",
    "It's intense and a lot of work everyday, because there's written, listening, grammar, and kanji to memorize. If you do all the work expected, you'll do well, but sometimes that isn't necessarily manageable.",
    "A lot of work, but worth it...",
    "Take it! Japanese is a really fun language and you'll learn SO much and SO fast. It's more manageable than the first semester since you know more now and there's more use of real materials, which really helps your listening skills. The sensei are devoted as always and lots of fun!",
    "Yes. But I would only recommend it to people who are truly interested in the language. Like any other language, learning Japanese requires you to devote a lot of time and effort. If you are not prepared for this, you might find it pretty tough.",
    "An incredible class. The teachers are so dedicated and will do everything they can to help you learn the language. The only downside is that the class is a lot of work, perhaps more than other lower level languages. After one year, I feel that I can hold an intelligent conversation exclusively in Japanese.",
    "Considerable workload, but a must for any student willing to pay the efforts for the learning of a new language.",
    "It's a lot of work but less than 110 (hopefully you get used to the rhythm of how the Japanese department works so it's not as hard)"
