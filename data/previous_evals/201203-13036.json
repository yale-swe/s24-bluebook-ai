    "If you're taking DS, you have to take H and P, that's the deal. Try to enjoy the readings as much as possible and think about possible essay topics early. Read Thucydides. i know that as H and P progresses into modern times, Petranovich will be a better professor, as that is his area of expertise. But for the first term and the ancient and medieval worlds, you can do better than him.",
    "I would recommend it. Petranovich is more concerned with the development of your ideas and argumentation than he is with giving you a bad grade for not being the most brilliant person in the world. He understands you're a freshman and evaluates your work accordingly.",
    "This class is a huge pain. It's incoherent and teaches you no real ancient history. It's just a hodgepodge of random political theory and random facts about Greek and Roman leaders. The reading is boring and seems really pointless. And the lectures for this class were all AWFUL.",
    "Definitely take it! And do all the reading, especially Thucydides and Aristotle. It's really a waste to only read the \"nuggets\" that are covered in lecture. And if you can, take it with Petranovich. You won't find a better professor!",
    "I was very happy with this class and would definitely recommend it: Professor Petranovich's section is friendly and productive and the texts themselves are alwaysinteresting (but still challenging).",
    "This is not a history class. Nor is it a class in political thought or philosophy. It is some combination. The readings are long but often very interesting. It is not as important to read for minute detail as it is for important themes and ideas that characterize each work. I would also recommend doing some background research on the actual history to contextualize what you're reading. The sections are what most make this class worth taking.",
    "This question is ultimately kind of irrelevant, because the people who take DS seem like a pretty self-selective group. Just know what you're getting into, I guess.",
    "DS history and politics is a survey of early western historians and political thinkers. The class is perfect for anyone who wants to learn about the origins of political philosophy",
    "This is an incredible class in the texts we read! Even if you are not a history enthusiast, the historical philosophy is eye opening in how applicable it still is today. I would highly recommend this class to anyone open minded and motivated."
