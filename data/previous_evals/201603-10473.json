    "I didn't know anything about organic chemistry before taking this course. The course taught me a lot about organic chemistry and its processes .",
    "I gained an appreciation and understanding of the basics of organic chemistry.",
    "Chemistry 220 is a very challenging but interesting course. If you keep up with all of the homework and do every practice problem and read every chapter, you will have absolutely no problem at all. This is not, however, possible to do if you are a functioning Yale student with ~4 other classes who has a social life and sleeps a decent number of hours a day. This class is very time-consuming, and it is really hard to do well. There was many a night when I was forced to cram, and it definitely was not easy by any means. That being said, Professor Ellman is a genuinely wonderful man and an engaging lecturer who makes the material sensible, interesting, and digestible. I highly recommend taking this course with him. I do not recommend taking this course if it is not required for your major, or something you are passionate about.",
    "How to think critically, how to stay on top of my work",
    "I learned more about the reactions of a class of organic products here, such as alkenes and halogenoalkanes. I also learned that whenever I had some longer break, I needed to sit down and write down a compressed version of the main reaction mechanisms we had done, since sometimes we learnt four mechanisms in a row and I had to make sure I distinguished between all of them. The course taught me the importance of a good textbook. The Loudon textbook used in this course is not my favorite and when taking CHEM 163, I used McMurry. I still went back to McMurry about some important concepts we covered this year and would strongly recommend it, even the 1996 edition.",
    "I received a thorough semester's worth of intro orgo in an extremely well presented manner and feel very prepared to take on the next semester.",
    "Basic orgo, but also a much better understanding of the fundamental concepts of chemistry than I ever had before.",
    "After a difficult freshman year learning about the various facets of chemistry in CHEM 167, organic chemistry was a welcome relief, as it was a well-taught course that allowed me to have an intuitive grasp of the basics behind organic molecule synthesis, the use of reagents in forming stereoisomers, and broad rules of how the different groups affected the formation of different carbon-carbon bonds.",
    "I gained an understanding of basic organic chemistry principles.",
    "Learn many chemical mechanisms and structures.",
    "You learn mechanisms in a step-by-step processes.",
    "None, really, to be honest.",
    "So much about chem and orgo.",
    "A lot of orgo. Became very good at drawing hexagons. Aside from that, I really really felt that organic chemistry really went into detail about why things happened. It seemed like with each chapter in the textbook, there was something new that would really excite me, and at the same time, explain the processes behind some very essential life happenings.",
    "I learned organic chemistry quite well. Also improved a lot at non-mathematical problem solving",
    "I learned a lot about the structures and reactions of organic compounds.",
    "I loved organic chemistry (compared to gen chem) because we were actually learning why certain aspects of chemistry lead things to react in the way we do. It was way more interesting to learn facts like pKa when it was embedded in a mechanism. Definitely recommend!",
    "Learnt a lot very quickly - all about organic chemistry",
    "I've had no background with any sort of material like the material taught in this class and I learned lots! I became more comfortable with visual learning and feel much better about chemistry in general.",
    "Orgo class was an entirely new experience of chemistry material. Because the content was very unfamiliar (as opposed to other chemistry classes in which you build upon prior knowledge), I found the transition into orgo really challenging. There are so many nuances in examining the path of highest probability of electron travel, predicting the starting materials, reagents, and products of reactions, dictating which substrates undergo which reactions under certain conditions, etc. Orgo is a new kind of puzzle that takes a lot of getting used to.",
    "During this course, I obtained knowledge in reactions and reaction mechanisms for alkanes, alkenes, epoxides, ethers, and alcohols.",
    "There was so much I learned in orgo, Professor Ellman covers a lot of material.",
    "This course was incredibly clear, well thought out, and digestible in a way that I never thought organic chemistry could ever be. I have gained a solid foundation in the most essential reactions and concepts required for an understanding of organic chemistry in a broader scope, as well as an appreciation for how much fun chemistry can be.",
    "Organic Chemistry",
    "It was not easy, but I have become familiar with organic chemistry and some of the intuition that comes with it.",
    "Organic chemistry and a great refresher of all the chemistry I learned before. I felt like this class really reinforced a lot of my general chemistry knowledge and built off of it into orgo. You learn mechanisms, some theory, reactions of alcohols, epoxides, and stereochemistry and you LEARN it all with Ellman.",
    "How to draw molecules, complete reactions, draw mechanisms, other basic organic chemistry techniques.",
    "I learned a lot about organic chemistry.",
    "I really learned how to understand questions, and quickly. I was able to apply my knowledge of organic chemistry concepts, mechanisms, and reactions.",
    "I learned the basics of Organic Chemistry.",
    "This is not applicable information, only take this course if you're premed or chem major.",
    "Learned the foundations of organic chemistry and organic reactions.",
    "If you start off on the right foot, you will learn how to do well on your own. The out-of-class problems and reading are important, so if you make the time for them (and you will need a lot of time), you will be fine.",
    "I learned so much about the mechanisms underlying chemical reactions. It was the first time I really felt like I understand why certain reactions take place rather than just having to memorize them. I feel like I could apply these concepts to various real-world issues as well, like the production of pharmaceuticals.",
    "I moved forward in my premed goals.",
    "I learned about the different types of organic molecules, the structures and characteristics of these molecules, and most significantly how organic molecules react with one another.",
    "I leanred a lot about reactions, mechanisms, reagents, stereochemistry, reaction rates and more.",
    "Classic understandings of organic chemistry, reactions, stereochemistry, and molecules.",
    "I definitely developed a more profound understanding of some of the concepts taught in general chemistry which was very rewarding, including the mechanisms behind why reactions occur the way they do.",
    "I learned a lot from Dr. Ellman. He was an excellent teacher.",
    "I learned a lot of specific organic reactions and working with the 3D nature of molecules.",
    "How to solve problems in organic chemistry.",
    "The class effectively taught us a lot of synthesis reactions as well has how to logically work our way through them, as well as the fundamental basics of orgo.",
    "I learned a lot about organic chemistry from this course and by the end of it I was able to identify different mechanisms by which compounds are produced and why certain compounds hold certain properties. It provided me with a very strong foundation and knowledge in organic chemistry.",
    "I learned the basics of organic chemistry! The introduction to this topic was very well-taught and I feel as if I learned an immense amount of information throughout the course of this semester. I think everything was graded fairly and was beneficial to my learning and understanding; however, the final exam was significantly more difficult than the other exams given during the course.",
    "You learn a lot about stereochemistry and chirality as well as reactions with alkenes and alcohols, reaction mechanisms and nmr spectroscopy.",
    "I learned a lot about different mechanisms of organic chemistry reactions and why these mechanisms have different results.",
    "Excellent course. Very interesting, well taught, and extremely engaging.",
    "Good intro to organic chemistry",
    "orgo",
    "This course challenged me to think visually and to use concepts to manipulate structures. The problem solving value of this course was excellent.",
    "I had never taken orgo before so this course introduced me to organic chemistry.",
    "I learned how to tackle the conceptual basics of organic chemistry, including how to understand and complete reaction mechanisms, how to assess a multi-concept problem, and how to set up reactions from a set of given starting materials or products. I also have become much more comfortable with the basics of chemistry as a whole, and have a better understanding of the processes, laws, and forces that are behind the material learned in intro chemistry courses.",
    "I learned the basics of Organic Chemistry, including broad concepts behind the nature of electrons and their theoretical compositional changes during the course of a reaction. I also learned various reactions that make up the foundations of Organic Chemistry.",
    "I loved this course. I learned so much about Organic Chemistry at a very reasonable pace.pace and feel",
    "I learned a lot. Honestly, I don't think I ever understood chemistry until this course. It forced me to apply chemistry concepts in original ways and understand the concepts themselves well, and I'm actually glad I took this course in the end. I feel so much more comfortable talking chemistry now.",
    "Seems like a pretty standard Orgo 1 curriculum. You'll get into a few mechanisms, stereochemistry, E2\/E1\/SN2\/SN1, effect of solvents, etc. You begin to build up a fluency with reactions and will by the end of the year, start recognizing patterns.",
    "n this course, I learned the basic lab techniques that are used in a organic chemistry lab. I also learned to think through the chemical processes of reaction based on product formation, and what the role of the chemicals were in these reactions.",
    "I developed a very solid introductory knowledge to organic chemistry concepts and reactions. We studied many types of compounds and reactions, useful for everyday life.",
    "I learned the basics of organic chemistry including the naming of compounds, many different mechanisms, and other concepts.",
    "Base for organic chemistry - the key reactions, mechanisms, some acid-base stuff",
    "Orgo is different from genchem - this course helped develop my spacial skills and s somewhat intuition-based. Overall, it was intellectually challenging.",
    "Memorization",
    "Organic chemistry is a very conceptual subject. From this course, I learned fouhdarional skills and how to really understand various mechanisms and apply this knowledge to predict other reactions. I gained a deeper understanding of molecular structure and interactions and about the importance of organic chemistry in applications to natural and synthetic molecules in the body.",
    "Before this course I knew nothing about organic chemistry. This class quickly teaches the basics and then goes into very complex and interesting reactions and molecules. I learned a lot of chemistry and abilities in critical thinking.",
    "Organic chemistry is a language, and professor Ellman is great at making it easy to understand.",
    "I realized organic chemistry isn't as hard as everyone says. It really depends on the person.",
    "I learned how to think mechanistically about reactions instead of memorizing hundreds of facts, which I thought was very useful. I was able to integrate lots of concepts into a few central processes, and this course really pushed me to be proactive in keeping up with assigned problems, etc.",
    "I learned about different reactions and how different molecules and reaction conditions impact the product results. I used skills from general chemistry and applied them to this course.",
    "We developed basic knowledge of organic chemistry, began to build a base of reactions and mechanisms, and learned how to approach organic chemistry problems.",
    "The ability to understand chemical reactions.",
    "This class is hard, both in the material that you are required to learn and what it demands of you, but if there is anything i can say it is that I learned a lot throughout the semester, and now have a much better understanding of organic Chemistry.",
    "I learned about organic chemistry (unsurprisingly). I felt that the class spent a lot of time on foundational material and I feel I have the basics for any future organic chemistry courses I may take.",
    "Organic Chemistry Basics involving structures, sterochemistry and reactions.",
    "This class was well organized and very interesting.",
    "Reactions, mechanisms, NMR spectroscopy. Problem solving skills developed.",
    "A very reasonable introduction to Organic Chemistry, section leaders were helpful and the lecture material was highly organized and thorough.",
    "This is a very thorough and wonderfully structured course for organic chemistry. I learned a lot about organic chemistry and how to enjoy it. Additionally, I also learned a lot about myself.",
    "This class was an honest, straightforward introduction to organic chemistry. The most important topics included acid base, reaction mechanism, stereochemistry, and structure analysis.",
    "I learned organic chemistry compounds, mechanisms, and reaction types. I quickly learned that organic chemistry requires a lot of memorization, which I slowly learned how to do over the term. I saw that I needed frequent repetition of the material to learn the huge amount of information at a detailed level."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures for this class were extremely organized, which made it much easier for me to learn the material. I do think that we moved a bit too fast after thanksgiving break, so the spacing could be a little better with respect to the end of the semester, but otherwise this was a fantastic course.",
    "Lectures were phenomenal! Professor Ellmen came prepared and provided clear and concise notes that helped you develop a better understanding of the content. A huge weakness was the textbook and assigned text problems. They did not present the content very well, and were incredibly expensive to purchase.",
    "The professor is very organized and makes it clear what information is important for us to know, it's really easy to keep track of things in the class. Weaknesses include that it's not exactly imperative that you do the problem sets or read the book so often I don't read the book or do any problems until the day before a quiz. If problem sets could somehow be graded then that would provide a better buffer for tests. Also, the tests were sometimes unfair in the sense that you could just have a small thing that you don't understand but then one problem is worth so many points that you get a ton of points off for a very trivial thing.",
    "This course taught my Professor Ellman was fantastic. He does a great job of assigning corresponding readings before each lecture, breaking down the material in class, writing amazing notes, and being very approachable. If you put in the work and keep up, this class is very doable, but if you fall behind it is very difficult to catch up again. I think it could be improved if the sections and TAs lectures were more standardized. It was very clear again who the better and worse TAs were and it was confusing as to why some sections got certain handouts while others did not.",
    "Chemistry 220 is a very challenging but interesting course. If you keep up with all of the homework and do every practice problem and read every chapter, you will have absolutely no problem at all. This is not, however, possible to do if you are a functioning Yale student with ~4 other classes who has a social life and sleeps a decent number of hours a day. This class is very time-consuming, and it is really hard to do well. There was many a night when I was forced to cram, and it definitely was not easy by any means. That being said, Professor Ellman is a genuinely wonderful man and an engaging lecturer who makes the material sensible, interesting, and digestible. I highly recommend taking this course with him. I do not recommend taking this course if it is not required for your major, or something you are passionate about.",
    "Strengths: Straightforward lectures, daily readings to reinforce concepts Cons: No other graded assessments besides quizzes or midterms (having problems sets to cushion our grades would have been nice, but having no sets also lightened the work load)",
    "One of the things I realized in the course was that I like when I can ask why something happens. It helps me understand or perhaps, remember better. Most of the times, I felt good about the course and I felt that Prof. Ellman and my TA could address a lot of questions, but there were some times when some aspects of mechanisms were obscure and we just had to study and know them. Prof. Ellman did mention that when he had taught the class previously, he would include some deeper aspects which he had found be cause more confusion than bring clarification. I also would have preferred we had not sped up so much in the last few lectures. However, the best strength this class has is Prof. Ellman's excellent organization. He is a very approachable professor and wants students to understand what they are learning while being aware at certain times the amount of information is greater than other times. Also, there was no official homework, but Prof. Ellman assigned problems which are highly recommended, since they would introduce important details to a concept and would show up on exams.",
    "The strengths were the incredible professor, Ellman, and the structure of the course with only quizes and midterms with recommended reading and problems. The weaknesses would be the few review sessions available only before exams.",
    "I think the course was very well-organized. Towards the end of the semester, perhaps because we were running short on time, I feel like we covered a massive amount of material in a short amount of time and that did not best facilitate learning.",
    "This particular course was extremely organized. The professor was concise and lectures were ordered and neat. A downside of this is that it sticks pretty strictly to the basics- if you are looking to go above and beyond in an organic chemistry course (I was not), and learn things that friends at other colleges wouldn't know, this might not be the best class for you.",
    "Lectures are well laid out, except for the lectures after midterm 3, they were confusing to follow.",
    "Its' strength is that the professor really succeeds in breaking down the material into manageable chunks. He himself talks in an adequate pace and makes sure that students understand. He is never surprised or judgmental when a student does not understand and he tries to see what student is seeing.",
    "No improvement. Flawless class. Seriously. No clickers, no flipped classroom BS. Just good, clean, classic lecturing. Knew what was expected. Loved this class. Praise Ellman. That man is a god.",
    "The course is very backloaded. The beginning is easy but a lot of information is thrown at you in the last couple of weeks. The material could be spread out better across the semester.",
    "I just very much enjoyed organic chemistry this fall. The lectures lined up with the textbook readings very well. Section went into very good detail about key components of lecture. Everything just worked together very well.",
    "Professor Ellman is absolutely fantastic and that made the course much better, but if not for the incredibly competency and pleasantness of the professor, this class would be terrible. Way too much material, not particularly intuitive, and tests and quizzes are horribly stressful (except for the practice exams provided, which are a godsend and likely the only reason I was able to do relatively well in this class).",
    "Dr. Ellman was great. He taught the course very well and was extremely easy to follow in class despite the difficult material. I also found his class organization quite agreeable.",
    "Material was presented way too quickly in class, especially towards the end.",
    "very difficult quizzes",
    "The class is very well organized. Professor Ellman actually made organic chemistry fun and interesting!",
    "I think the course was really good-- the only recommendation I would have is that the pace really picked up and we ended up learning a ton (what felt like more than our first two midterms combined) in the last few weeks so it could be more evenly spread out but I may be underestimating how long it takes to really establish the skills we learned at the beginning.",
    "Lecture notes VERY useful - Professor Elman was very organized Section was also very helpful if you had a good TA Hard to stay on top of the reading and problems but if you did this it is useful.",
    "I don't think it was fair how much new information was dumped on us in the weeks after the midterm. Also, I am not sure why we covered NMR. That seemed unnecessary; we could have instead used more time with the new material.",
    "I really liked the structure of the course. It's completely manageable to do well if you put in the time and keep up with the work.",
    "Orgo taught by Ellman is very well organized and laid out, up until the material following the third midterm. This portion of the class is what mostly shows up on the final exam, but there's so much complex content that's stuffed into the final two weeks of class that it's almost impossible to handle. The semester's three exams are very fair and mirror the practice exams provided, but the final exam is much, much harder than any of the prior assessments (and the final exam practice test). There are no p-sets, but there are four quizzes. The course begins slowly and gets progressively harder. Towards the end, the final two weeks' material is the most challenging, so I wonder if it's possible to redistribute the content presented in order to alleviate the rush of the last portion of the semester.",
    "The strength of the course is definitely Professor Ellman. He takes the time to go through the material and explain each part of a reaction However, one major weakness of the course is that too much time was spent earlier in the semester going over very basic organic chemistry. The result was that we had to cram in multiple more complicated reactions and reaction mechanisms, causing a lot of confusion during the final. I feel that we did not spend enough time on complex reactions.",
    "Professor Ellman is a great lecturer; his notes are really easy to follow and very in depth. The grading system although is fair places a lot of emphasis on the final exam and the final exam in terms of content was more like a 4th midterm which was stressful.",
    "Strengths: ridiculously clear lecture notes (amazing), amazing professor who was both helpful and clear and connected with his students, good quiz and exam pacing Weaknesses: while the pre-exam 3 material was well-paced and understandable during lecture, the material post-exam 3 was incredibly dense and caused the pace of the class to increase threefold in just the last four lectures (this left many students scrambling to catch up during reading period)",
    "There is no online information about which practice problems we should do or which pages we should read, so forgetting to write that down during lecture becomes very problematic. If there was more information, the course would be easier to keep up with. Also, gen chem hw was much more effective for my learning than orgo quizzes.",
    "Problem sets are not assignments. And while this frees our time and makes the class less stressful, it makes it easy to fall behind without discipline in learning. Learning organic chemistry requires being somewhat immersed in it, especially with no background. Perhaps making p-sets required assignments, students will learn the material better.",
    "With Ellman teaching, this class is perfect. Organic Chemistry has this reputation of being such a hard class but with Ellman teaching it all of the information is so clear and laid out well and you feel like you truly understand organic chemistry by the end. Only weakness is I don't think it is useful to have 45% of the grade be the final. A lot of work goes into the homework and quizzes for that to be 3%, and the midterms are so so much work and they feel like so little when you drop one. The massive final puts too much stress on this one test.",
    "Solid course.",
    "One of the strengths of this course was the pace of the material. Professor Ellman explained everything really clearly, and his notes and lectures were always really organized. Another strength of this course was posting practice tests so that students could understand what was expected of them. I also really appreciated that we were given a full hour on exams instead of just 50 minutes.",
    "I really enjoyed how the lecture was written out on the board. I feel like I was able to learn at a very nice pace, especially at the beginning. The tests were also fair, and I don't know what I would've done if I did not have the practice midterms prior to the exam. However, I felt inadequately prepared for the final, especially since I had two finals the previous day, and I felt like I would have performed better if I had more time to study. I feel like we covered a lot of reactions in the final stretch of the class, and NMR was covered only in 2 days, and I wish we had learned about NMR earlier on. Overall, though, amazing amazing class and learning experience!",
    "This class is taught very well. Ellman is very engaging and this class was way better than gen chem. I think having graded problem sets would have made this class better. I found it difficult to keep up with optional psets and all the other work I had to do for other classes. Graded psets would have forced me to stay on task.",
    "This course is very well taught. The one weakness of this class is that the workload is unevenly distributed across the semester: we learned about the same amount of material in the last three weeks as we did in two thirds of the semester.",
    "Great professor but way too much information for his teaching to be enough. Most all of the semester was reasonable except for the last month where we learned about 50 new reactions. It was ridiculously difficult at the end.",
    "Strengths: book was highly helpful, lectures clear and instructive, TAs helpful Weaknesses: assigned problems did not always reflect what would be asked on the exams, easy to fall behind if you do not independently keep up.",
    "The strength and weakness of this class are one and the same - how well you do is solely dependent on how much time you put into the class. If you do all the work, it will be easy to get an A. Otherwise, especially towards the end of the semester when all the reaction mechanisms build-up, it will be difficult.",
    "The course could be greatly improved by increasing the number of grades through graded problem sets to prevent test heavy grades.",
    "I absolutely loved this course. It was clear, straightforward, and challenging. I always felt like I needed to put in a lot of work, but I knew that if I did, the results would be favorable. The lecture style worked well, and I like not having PSETs that were due. I was able to do the homework on my own time without worrying about getting graded. The quizzes were good check-ins, and I liked being able to drop a midterm. My only complaint is that it seemed like quite a bit of material was crammed into the final two weeks.",
    "Ellman is an amazing professor. I had all the support I could have wanted.",
    "I think that Professor Ellman is a strong and intelligent teacher, who made the material easier to understand and comprehend. I liked the format of the course, but I would have preferred the homework to be graded because it would have been a better way to improve my skills and test my knowledge. Two other weakness would be that I thought it was a disadvantage to have quizzes prior to my scheduled section time as well as a disadvantage to have to always take the examinations outside of our normal learning environment. I would suggest that quizzes be done after all students have the ability to review the information in section, especially since not all students have the ability to go to office hours due to other classes and commitments.",
    "Professor Ellman provided great in class notes for us to follow and copy down. There were no psets, which left it up to the students to keep up with the coursework.",
    "Professor Ellman was incredible. The student guidebook was very helpful as was the textbook. Practice exams were the most helpful of all.",
    "I think that Professor Ellman's lectures were incredibly clear and helpful when approaching tough material. I was always engaged in lecture and it really helped me to make sense of the readings. I wish that the textbook were clearer, and it sometimes went over material in a much greater level of detail than what was expected. I also wish we had weekly problem sets to motivate me to do the problems and so that our entire grade is not exam based. I also wish that more time were devoted to the material covered after midterm 3 (all of the reactions and mechanisms tested on the final), as it was very overwhelming to learn in a short period of time. The practice final and midterm exams were incredibly helpful.",
    "The professor goes over the material very well, but it is hard to keep up at times. New material is presented every lecture, all lecture long.",
    "The homework was not graded, so there was not much incentive to do them other than the possibility of it appearing on a quiz. There was a large amount of daily homework and it was hard to keep up with. The course also felt rushed at the end. The strengths of this course are the resources available to students for understanding the material (the professor, TF's, office hours, etc.",
    "The course seemed a little dry at times, with the lectures feeling just like reading the textbook. However, they were very clear! I really appreciated when Professor Ellman brought in other concepts or uses for the organic materials we were talking about, like in pharmaceuticals or materials science.",
    "Ellman is a huge strength of the class--he's amazing, fair, organized, and teaches really well. Honestly, the only weakness of this class is that it's a bit backloaded--a lot is packed into the space between the third midterm and the final.",
    "I think the strengths of this course were Professor Ellman and his teaching style (his notes were great and he taught the material really well, which I feel makes all the difference in the course like this), the TAs and the homework assignments (and how they were optional) as it allowed the student to choose their level of engagement with the class and material. One weakness is the slight lack of balance in the class. It began at a relatively slow pace in the beginning of the semester and we went over everything in detail multiple times, but then we rushed a lot of material at the end of the semester. If there was a little bit more of a balance I think this would be beneficial for students and would help them better learn the material in the second half of the class.",
    "The strengths of this course are far and away the instructors. Professor Ellman was incredible and was always willing to remain after class to answer any questions that arose during lecture. I think this course could be improved by spending more time on the information that was covered during the final unit, as this seemed rushed and I did not feel completely prepared for the final exam. Other than this, I thoroughly enjoyed this class!",
    "The class isn't very transparent with how it's graded which is frustrating for students. Also, the teaching assistants weren't very helpful. However, the structure of the course worked well and the exams were fair.",
    "The class was well taught during lecture, but I wish there was more structure to homework.",
    "Strengths: We knew exactly what to learn from a very well-structured class. Prof Ellman had probably the best lecture of all my science courses thus far. The grading is very fair, with much room for error, which is helpful. I felt that the structure really encouraged my learning. Weaknesses: I would not say that this course has any weaknesses at all. Perhaps one thing that could be fixed is convincing the other module to not be a two-day a week 9 am struggle bus :(",
    "Strength is that if you do practice problems it should not he too bad, weakness is that if you get behind it is very hard to catch back up.",
    "Strengths include the clear lectures with amazing notes, and the TAs that provided practice problems in section. Weaknesses include lack of regular practice and work. The class completely relies on testing skills which is not necessarily the most effective evaluation of a student's understanding and hard work.",
    "This course was incredible. I learned so so much and it is all thanks to the professor. He was amazing.",
    "Strength': very well organized with very involved teaching scholar staff and professor. Really interesting material and overall very enjoyable class. Weakness: limited feedback received on how to improve and the pace of the course was extremely fast paced for the last two weeks of class.",
    "Good teaching.",
    "I think that the biggest weakness of the course is the fact that there is no accountability for problem sets. I understand that we have a solutions manual and are expected to use it to fully understand the problems, but I certainly would have done more of the homework if I at least needed to turn it in for completion credit. I know that this seems reflective of my own lack of motivation, but the reality is that a large percentage of students in the course end up skipping some or most of the problem sets as it is. Frankly, this is understandable since Yale students are all busy -- if students aren't committing a lot of time outside of class to the problem sets, it's probably because they're doing other work, not because they are lazy. While I'm sure many students like the freedom of being able to figure out the course material and do the problem sets at their own pace, I think that there was almost too much freedom for my liking. That said, the course itself was taught very well, so I still feel as though I got a lot out of it.",
    "lecture notes were amazing",
    "The lectures were awesome. They were organized and very understandable. I never felt like the scope of the material taught left me unprepared. I have no complaints.",
    "it is mandatory for a lot of premeds",
    "This course was phenomenally taught; Prof. Ellman is truly it's greatest strength. He made difficult and intimidating material digestible and interesting, and he had great faith in us as students to be able to follow and tackle the information, without taking for granted our comprehension. The textbook he used and the layout of the problem sets (optional, though extremely helpful), both helped to facilitate engagement and self-accountability amongst the students, and were both strengths. The only real weaknesses of this course are the number of students that take it, which of course cannot be controlled by the professor. I found that the sheer volume did make it difficult to ask questions in lecture or get to know professor Ellman one on one. The other weakness would be the variable quality of TA's--mine was pretty terrible, so section was not helpful for me, and I would go to other TAs or students in other sections for better study tips and guides.",
    "This class is awesome if Ellman is teaching! He's great at explaining the material. The class is hard though, it takes a LOT of personal study and memorization, but a great class, way better than Gen. Chem. It doesn't have mandatory homework though, which can make it hard to get motivated.",
    "The course is excellent. I do, however, feel that the final is worth too much of the overall grade.",
    "The regular quizzes and exams keep you very on top of the material.",
    "Prof Ellman teaches this course extremely well!! I found his notes much more helpful than the textbook. I kind of wish psets were collected for credit because not having them count for a grade made it easy to fall behind.",
    "Ellman is the best of the best. Clear, consistent, friendly, organized. He made the class so approachable and was extremely fair. I liked the format of the class with no graded psets, as it lets students time themselves. In terms of improvement, I would prefer if we avoided having to do the bulk of memorization in the last few weeks, instead spreading it out, and I would like for the final exam to be worth a smaller percentage.",
    "A strength if the course is that it builds up from week to week making it easier for students to understand the importance of each lesson and lab. A weakness is that most of the material that is expected to know for final test is not covered in class. Therefore, the final does a very poor job assessing the student's performance in the course.",
    "One strength is the very clear lecture notes that professor Ellman gave. One weakness is the lack of psets, which often times help you keep up with the material.",
    "The course was taught well; Professor Ellman is a fantastic instructor. I did feel like the course material was rushed at the end, although that is my only complaint.",
    "The strengths of this course were the organization of the lecture and the engaging professor.",
    "We moved extremely fast and were never told what was really important. Practice tests were super helpful, though.",
    "The pace of this course was perfect. I appreciate how the chalk board was used so that students could visualize the concepts gone over in class and it allowed the students to follow the instructor's pace.",
    "Ellman is SO organized and clear in his lectures. He's a genuinely kind guy who cares about his students. His practice tests were very representative of the exams. I liked how the quizzes kept us on top of the material in between midterms. Section felt kind of unnecessary but that was probably my own fault for not getting caught up with the material until the quiz\/midterm.",
    "The main weakness of the course is the very rapid jump in pace and difficulty leading up to the final - I'm not sure how many other classes are like this, but the last month of orgo was incredibly more fast paced and dense. I think material could be better distributed to prevent a sudden rush at the end. The main strength of this course was the organization: there are plenty of extra study materials, TAs and peers tutors are readily available, and multiple practice exams are posted in advance of each assessment.",
    "Make it more interesting, please.",
    "I absolutely loved this course! Strengths: very organized, well-taught, exams tested exactly what was covered in lecture, excellent professor, good course structure with 4 quizzes and 3 midterms, no graded problem sets Weaknesses: I thought the last few weeks of lecture were very rushed and the material wasn't covered thoroughly enough",
    "This class is all about how much you put into it. For me, this was strength. For others, it was not. What i mean by this is, the homework was not due, only for your benefit. This meant that many people never did any of it or they did it too late. I liked that i could study at my own pace and when it was convenient for me as well.",
    "TA's were very useful and gave a great outlet to actually understand the material outside of class.",
    "A strength of this class is that you really determine your own grade. This is because there are exact assignments due per say, but there are practice problems. The weakness of this course would definitely be getting behind on those problems. Making sure you keep up to date is the best strategy to do well.",
    "First semester orgo is a very comprehensive and solid foundation for the topic. Prof Ellman is a fantastical lecturer, very approachable and accessibly, and very nice. The only thing was the pacing of the course was disproportionate toward the end. While he did mention the class really picks up at the end of the semester, it didn't seem to be because of increased difficulty of material, but a time budgeting issue. A lot of time was spent in the first couple months on background and logistical knowledge, most of which wasn't even important for the final. We could definitely dive into the meat of the class earlier and make it less intense at the end.",
    "I thought that Professor Ellman was an extremely organized and clear teacher, which I really appreciated. I thought he was the true strength of this course, because he made the material accessible to all students, regardless of how much organic chemistry knowledge one came into the course with. I also thought, in a similar vein, that my TA Aharon Rosenbloom was extremely helpful and I was very lucky to be in his section. He gave many tips and tricks from \"Organic Chemistry as a Second Language\" that I found profoundly helpful. My only concern with this course was that it seemed to progress at a brisk but manageable pace for the majority of the semester and then threw all of the ether and alcohol mechanisms into the last two weeks, which I felt was a much more accelerated pace. I felt very rushed in the last few weeks.",
    "I loved the layout of the course and found that not having problem sets took off a lot of stress, but at the same time, having optional homework problems allowed me to practice the material. Professor Ellman amazing for this course and made organic chemistry engaging and manageable. My only complaint about the course would be the 40% weight of the final exam because it does not accurately reflect all of the work put in for the whole course.",
    "Instead of giving optional problem sets, making them required would probably be beneficial to many students",
    "This course had a good layout with fair amounts of spacing between exams and quizzes. The material covered on exams is always made clear beforehand and helpful materials are posted online. The lectures were very straightforward and only contained necessary information, which I appreciated.",
    "The teaching staff was great, exams were fair, homework was optional but helpful, and the class was engaging",
    "The style of the course was very good because material was taught very well in lecture and then homework problems and sections allowed for extra practice and explanation. The fact that the homework problems were ungraded was a downside, however, because personally I shunted the problems to the side when I ran out of time as they did not count towards my grade. Being forced to do the problems (or at least some of them) probably would have been more beneficial for me.",
    "I think that this class could benefit from a restructuring of the time line throughout the semester. I feel that in the beginning of the semester the class was almost easy, and i had to dedicate relatively low amounts of time to it. However a lot of material was crammed in at the end of the semester, and it made studying for the final very difficult. I therefore feel that the material could be more evenly distributed to give the class a more consistent feel.",
    "Professor Ellman is great, and his notes were always very organized and easy to follow. I like the fact that our homework was not mandatory, but continual progress was encouraged by the frequent quizzes. My least favorite thing about this course was its pacing, which was awful. The class moved far too slowly at the beginning-- we spent many days on repetitive, basic material. About half of the course material was learned in the LAST TWO WEEKS of the course. By the end of the class, I felt more lost than I have ever felt at Yale, despite attending class regularly. I would strongly suggest that the beginning of the class be paced more quickly to let the ending be more reasonably paced.",
    "This class moves very fast, and while that is expected for the amount of material covered, it seemed that there was no strong support for students who had not been exposed to the material before hand. I found myself always trying to catch up despite doing all the readings. I think having supplemental material besides the textbook would help, especially since there was A LOT of reading and not enough time to study between midterms.",
    "The class was easy to follow and well structured to help me understand the complicated topics. A weakness that was not much of a problem is that the class was not as engaging as previous chemistry course.",
    "Notes were always very organized. Weaknesses are that the tests seemed to emphasize memorization more than understanding concepts\/problem solving.",
    "The course was well taught and organized. I was never unsure about what an exam might cover nor was I surprised by an exam's content.",
    "Professor Ellman is a very enthusiastic and dedicated professor. However, I found it very difficult to learn the material (and the huge amount of it) when it was only presented once in class. The constant influx of information makes it hard to keep up, and a huge amount of time is required out of class to memorize everything and do the psets. The psets are not checked, graded, or reviewed, which can be helpful if you're short on time one week, but is not helpful in making you learn the material."

   "comments": [
    "If you have to take organic chemistry, take it with Professer Ellman. He was extremely organized, took the time to explain things well, and made the class an enjoyable experience",
    "Yes! Far better done at the General Chemistry sequence. The intention of this class is to help students learn, not weed them out.",
    "Yes! Even though I have to take the course for a requirement, I really really enjoyed it (much to my surprise) because organic chemistry is really fun and Prof. Ellman makes it really enjoyable. It's not painful at all and I was motivated to go to every class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if Professor Ellman is teaching.",
    "Chemistry 220 is a very challenging but interesting course. If you keep up with all of the homework and do every practice problem and read every chapter, you will have absolutely no problem at all. This is not, however, possible to do if you are a functioning Yale student with ~4 other classes who has a social life and sleeps a decent number of hours a day. This class is very time-consuming, and it is really hard to do well. There was many a night when I was forced to cram, and it definitely was not easy by any means. That being said, Professor Ellman is a genuinely wonderful man and an engaging lecturer who makes the material sensible, interesting, and digestible. I highly recommend taking this course with him. I do not recommend taking this course if it is not required for your major, or something you are passionate about.",
    "Everyone says the Orgo is the worst thing you'll ever take-- I completely disagree. With a wonderful, clear, and engaging professor like Ellman, Orgo will be neither difficult (nor exceedingly easy!) to learn. You just have to be willing to put in the work, which is minimal-- do the assigned readings and the problems, and ask questions during section. I actually found Orgo to be easier to study than Gen Chem.",
    "I would recommend this course. I felt that when I had to think about certain mechanisms it also helped my visualization and perseverance a lot. A good TA, however, is as important as being taught by a great professor like Ellman. I would, however, not rely on the textbook assigned, but rather read McMurry's Organic Chemistry.",
    "I would absolutely recommend if it is with Ellman",
    "Professor Ellman is a gift from god. There's a good chunk of professors at Yale who make be stars but they can't teach to save a life, and Ellman is the exact opposite. He takes so much care to explain everything so well. The tests are always so fair; you feel you are definitely only be tested on what he taught you in class. Honestly introductory organic chemistry is a thrilling subject only for the very very few, but if you have to take it as a requirement then this class will make it as straightforward as possible. Not a waste of time!",
    "I recommend the course to any STEM major or pre-med who want a solid understanding of organic molecules, and provides a solid base for CHEM 221, to understand how these molecules are formed, used, their effects in living things.",
    "Orgo is a great course, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you need to take it for your major or medical school.",
    "It is a good course that many people need to take as a pre-requisite for other classes or Medical School. Taking it with Professor Ellman was the best decision.",
    "I would recommend, you learn a lot of interesting things, its not extremely difficult.",
    "Yes, organic chemistry could not have been taught better.",
    "Go for it if this guy is teaching it. It's probably the guttiest course in the CHEM department.",
    "JON ELLMAN IS A GENIUS. TAKE THIS CLASS. Seriously. Excellent lectures, clear content expectations, fair tests. I was amazed by how accessable he made a classic \"weed out\" course. This was awesome. I actually like orgo now and I was dreading it.",
    "Organic chemistry can be confusing and convoluted, but Ellman is an excellent professor and lecturer. With dedication and a decent amount of studying before exams, it is very possible to excel in this course. I highly recommend waiting to take this class during a semester when Prof. Ellman is teaching!",
    "Yes. Take it. Super interesting. A lot of reading, a lot of mechanisms, a lot of reactions, but all very worth while.",
    "*sigh* Orgo. You've probably heard that Orgo is terrible and stressful and an absolute mess, and this is entirely true. The material is difficult, the tests are hard, the quizzes are impossible, and it's just a lot. Professor Ellman is the saving grace of this awful class - he gives wonderful notes and is great at articulating concepts, and provides 3 practice exams for each exam, including the final, which will save your life. The worst part about this class is the material itself. If you have to take it, good luck, and if you don't, you probably shouldn't - save yourself the stress.",
    "Not unless the student needed to take it for some important reason.",
    "Ellman is great, makes material super clear. However, it is A LOT of material. You have to prepare for exams\/quizzes about a week in advance to pass.",
    "Yes! There are a lot of horror stories out there about organic chemistry. And it was hard, especially the last two weeks of the semester, when things really picked up. However, the class was really interesting and cool and exciting, and it's easy to see how it applies to really life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student-- I feel like chemistry doesn't really begin until orgo so people should take it even if they didn't love gen chem.. it's way more interesting and Ellman made it very manageable.",
    "Yes - only if you're a strong science student - it's a tough but enjoyable\/interesting course.",
    "This was a very well-organized and engaging course. I would recommend it!",
    "Yes - as far as organic chemistry goes it's totally manageable and engaging, as long as you commit to putting in the work you need to.",
    "I definitely recommend orgo to both science and non-science majors because it's an interesting, intellectually-stimulating course that has something for everyone. It's a puzzle of sorts, trying to reason through each of the mechanisms and reactions. Orgo is both challenging and gratifying all at once.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in organic chemistry. If you have to take orgo, take it with Ellman. He is an absolutely incredible professor.",
    "Yeah its's good to know and required for pre-med.",
    "If you can take this course with Professor Ellman and you have any interest whatsoever in learning organic chemistry (or just experiencing a fantastic STEM professor and lecturer), TAKE IT. I loved chemistry to begin with, and this class only solidified every single positive thought that I've ever had about the subject. Don't let the first few lectures lull you into complacency - you will be thoroughly challenged as the lectures continue, especially toward the end.",
    "Yes, it is a premed requirement.",
    "I would recommend this course to those who must take it. Otherwise, doesn't make much sense to study organic reactions unless for brain exercise. Ellman makes the class worth taking.",
    "YES! Obviously only take this if you enjoy chemistry and have a super good handling on your general chemistry knowledge. This is not for someone to take for fun and you have to be committed to learning and studying chemistry.",
    "This is as good as organic chemistry courses get! Professor Ellman is the absolute best hes super organized and approachable, and quizzes and midterms are easy to prepare for if you put in the work. Of course, theres lots of work. Yes, you need to be organized and devote a significant chunk of time to the course material. But conceptually, its not a difficult subject at all, and I would argue orgo is much more rewarding than gen chem, because its largely conceptual, so you get to really think about the reactions instead of plugging numbers into a series of equations. Youre probably taking CHEM 220 as a requirement if you are a biology\/chem major or premed, but I really do think that this was a super fun and rewarding class as well, particularly with Ellman.",
    "Normally I wouldn't recommend a chemistry course, but if Ellman is teaching, definitely take it! He does a great job explaining and organizing all the material.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was a really great introduction to organic chemistry, and I feel like I learned a lot. The class was challenging, but the material was explained really well, so the work was manageable.",
    "Definitely take organic chemistry with Professor Ellman! You will be learning from the absolute best. Try to understand the reactions and mechanisms well, especially how the questions will be asked on the exams! Professor Ellman makes organic chemistry fun with occasional tidbits about medical applications of orgo, not to mention the fantastic job at teaching the dense material in the first place! Take it with Ellman you won't regret it! You can do it!",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to, but that being said, it is incredibly interesting and well taught.",
    "This class is actually very interesting. If you are premed or have to take it for your major, then I would recommend taking it (you have to!) If you don't have to, be aware that this is a difficult course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Ellman is a very good instructor. However, I would warn any students interested in taking the class that a lot of work has to be put in to do well in the class.",
    "Not unless you have to take it.",
    "If you have the chance to take this with Ellman, I would highly recommend him as a professor. He took the time to explain the mechanisms, sometimes more than once, and made Orgo as smooth as possible for us.",
    "Organic Chemistry is wonderful and you should definitely take it with Professor Ellman!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Professor Ellman is wonderful, and you will learn so much. Be prepared to put in a lot of work.",
    "Definitely take it with Ellman if you can.",
    "Personally, I wouldn't recommend this course unless you needed to continue your chemistry or pre-med studies. While there were some interesting pieces, I would not say that I enjoyed organic chemistry. Professor Ellman was a great professor though!",
    "Yes, I recommend taking organic chemistry 1 with Professor Ellman, becasue he teaches very clearly and makes it easy to follow along if you put in the work outside of class.",
    "Orgo I was definitely not as bad as everyone makes it to be. Professor Ellman does an amazing job teaching tough material in an engaging and rewarding way. Do not fall behind in the course as the material tested on the final gets very overwhelming and challenging.",
    "If it is required, take it, but it did not give me too much fulfillment memorizing these reactions :\/ I guess I am more of a physics kind of guy.",
    "Yes! Professor Ellman is great.",
    "More than likely, you're going to take orgo if you need to. That said, however, I can't recommend Prof. Ellman and this class highly enough--he was an amazing professor, ran the class very well, and made it very manageable to learn.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Ellman is great and it gives you a great foundation for going forward in chemistry or chemical engineering. (And if you consistently do the homework and go to sections this class is pretty easy compared to other stem classes!)",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they were looking for a challenge or simply wanted a greater understanding of the chemistry of organic molecules and materials. I think the assignments are fair and are very beneficial to student learning, and the professor and teaching fellows are incredible and enjoy the material themselves!",
    "Yes very useful information",
    "If you actually like chem this is a good class, but most people take this for pre med, which means that your in class peers probably don't want to be there.",
    "Take it if Prof Ellman is teaching. He is one of the most organized professors I have seen at Yale thus far. Orgo is considered a really tough class but with him it was not too bad.",
    "Take this course if it is a requirement. It is not that bad but not great either.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. There is minimal work, as there is no homework and only exams\/quizzes. The five quizzes (one can be dropped) in the semester are very low in point value, and there are three midterms (one of which can be dropped). Other than those, there is almost no work other than briefly studying for four quizzes, studying thoroughly for two midterms, and studying for the final. The lecture notes are ESSENTIAL for studying. For the first two months I literally considered this class a science gut, but towards the final it actually gets really really difficult with memorizing\/understanding a bajillion mechanisms and concepts.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Hugely recommend, although you will likely take this class as a requirement for a major or premed. It is such a great class though and if it's being taught by Ellman you cannot pass it up.",
    "Yes",
    "If you do not commit time to doing the problem sets (even though they are not graded), you will quickly fall behind. The material starts out relatively easy and then gets progressively harder, so you will have to stay really motivated in order to keep up. However, what helps is that Prof. Ellman is an absolutely wonderful lecturer -- he goes at a perfect pace that allows students to take down extensive notes while not feeling too rushed (most of the time). He is also very clear and easy to understand, assuming you keep up with the textbook reading and problems. If you do not, you will definitely find yourself lost in lecture, even with Ellman's great teaching.",
    "yeah ifnur premed",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. Most of those that take this course are required to, but they shouldn't dread it because it's honestly pretty fun. The material is challenging but accessible if you pay attention and put in the time, and putting it all together is rewarding.",
    "only if you have to",
    "Yes, especially if you have to take organic chemistry. Professor Ellman is incredible, and I could not recommend him more. In a course that is notoriously difficult, he makes things manageable and even exciting. Take Orgo I with Ellman if at all possible--you won't regret it!",
    "If you have to take this class, Ellman is the way to go. He's great.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes absolutely. Professor Ellman was incredible and knew how to explain orgo in a way we understood.",
    "Yes definetly with ellman",
    "Yes! Absolutely take Orgo I with Ellman. As someone who came into Yale very nervous for Orgo I can say that I genuinely enjoyed the class.",
    "Well organized. You probably have to take the class anyways, but Ellman is an excellent, clear lecturer and the workload isn't bad except around exam time (though you definitely have to study hard). Really not as bad as it could have been.",
    "If you're taking this class, you probably don't have a choice. Luckily, Ellman is probably as a good of a orgo professor as you can hope for; I think he makes the orgo experience as painless as possible. His lectures were as clear as possible, and his exams are straightforward with no huge surprises (if you do his practice exams). I made the effort to show up to lecture because his note are super helpful. Definitely try to keep up with the class. The assigned problems, while not required, will actually help you understand orgo, and I think reading the assigned pages beforehand would help you get more out of lectures (because you would probably understand the lectures so much better).",
    "For those who need the class for pre-med or your major, this class won't be much of a choice, but I highly recommend taking it with Ellman. He is the best of the best at what he does, and you will not feel overwhelmed. They ease you in! Fair work load, extremely fair tests. Ellman definitely cares about his students. He even does things like provide practice exams very similar to the real thing.",
    "Yes, the course itself is not that bad. If you are interested in the subject, it will be enjoyable.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to others. Well-taught and useful but it is a tough class, good amount of work.",
    "The course is a standard organic chemistry course that most will be taking to fulfill requirements. I would recommend taking the course with Ellman though, because he did do a wonderful job of teaching it.",
    "Yes, the course was very enjoyable and students learn a lot.",
    "Yes, I enjoyed orgo with Ellman. I'd even advise some freshman to take it instead of freshman orgo.",
    "Only if you're taking it for a major requirement: it's certainly interesting, but I wouldn't take it just because you can.",
    "This course is goof if you study a lot, otherwise you'll fail. The class is not stimulating at all since you only have to remember stuff. Prof. Ellman is really good, but the class is really bad.",
    "I would only recommend it if you have to take it.",
    "Yes! Especially if Professor Ellman is teaching it--he is one of the best professors I've had so far at Yale. You'll learn a lot in this course and it is very well-organized and well-taught!",
    "I would highly recommend this to any student, even if they are not a science major. This course was well-taught and incredibly interesting.",
    "I would. This was a very good orgo course.",
    "Yes, it's a great course, especially with Ellman, great professor who makes lectures easy to understand.",
    "Do not take this class unless you absolutely need to.",
    "If you put in the effort, you will do well in this class.",
    "Take it if you have to, Professor Ellman makes it clear enough that it's actually not so bad. There are 3 midterms, 4 quizzes and you can drop your lowest midterm score and your lowest quiz score, and there are no psets, just recommended assigned problems which you'll have to do anyways because the quizzes end up being made up of those. The midterms and quizzes are also extremely fair, but the final was pretty hard. Other than that, the class is fun if you go in with an open mind and are willing to put in the work. It's also much more intellectually satisfying than gen chem and a very good class overall. Definitely as good as the first semester of orgo can get.",
    "I mean don't take it if you don't have to for your major, but if you do have to, don't worry you will make it through alive.",
    "I think Organic Chemistry has been so important in my growth as a student and scientist. It was not so much the material as the methods of thinking that I really have taken away from the course.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who needs to take organic chemistry as a requirement. It is a challenging course, but it is manageable. I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would have.",
    "I found orgo to be fun but I also had to take this class as part of my major. I'd reccomend taking this course if it is highly recommended for your major, but if it's not, I wouldn't bother.",
    "If possible it is an interesting challenge.",
    "I mean, it's pretty much required if you're premed, which is the only reason I'm taking it. It's not a total nightmare, as far as stereotypical orgo classes go. Ellman is a great professor and I feel lucky to have had him. You'll be fine as long as you Keep Up with the work regularly!",
    "If it is one of your requirements, take it of course. Otherwise steer clear because it is an unnecessarily hard class. If you decide to stay, you will be doing a lot of the teaching yourself, despite ellman being a great professor. Do yourself a favor and look up videos rather than wasting your time doing all the reading which has extra and confusing material.",
    "This is a great class and I would recommend it to anyone who has already taken chemistry.",
    "Like any typical pre-med course, take only if needed.",
    "Yes, it really doesn't get better than Ellman. He's a fantastic lecturer and knows what he's doing. Organic chemistry is very interesting and could be a fun class to take for even non-stem majors.",
    "The course is a lot of work. The material is interesting and the class is taught well, but a lot of time and effort needs to be put into the class in order to do well. The material is not necessarily very hard though.",
    "People are typically taking it as a requirement, and therefore have to take it regardless of recommendations, which is unfortunate. I wouldn't recommend it if your other classes are also time consuming, because this class requires a lot of time and memorization. You can understand all of the material but still do very poorly because of the sheer amount of information you have to perfectly memorize.",
    "I actually enjoyed this course a lot. Professor Ellman is a fantastic lecturer and a kind person. He explained the material clearly and provided three practice exams for each midterm and the final in the exact same format and with very similar questions. If you study the practice finals and do the assigned homework, which is not graded, then the course is not as bad as its reputation."
