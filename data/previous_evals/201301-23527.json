    "12. We need more classes on food and agriculture. This course was mediocre at best, but it was the bestoffered on the topic this year. Yale FES must do better.",
    "A fascinating new course with a fascinating structure. It was great to hear so many perspectives. Gordon reallywas a facilitator more than a teacher. In the future, having 1 instructor for each module would be better than having a different lecture every week. I found the one lecture format not really ideal. The talks were great, but it wasn't really teaching so to speak. A field trip or two would be great as well.I like the course and its subject matter and hope it continues.",
    "I was a little frustrated that the grading scheme changed for the reading responses -- originally, they were much better, and then once it became more of a completion grade, the quality diminished.Maybe if we had to do fewer but better ones, the quality would improve? With the caveat that you can be cold-called in class, and marked down if you clearly haven't done the reading (even if it wasn't your response day)?",
    "I liked the general format of speaker + discussion, but I think the order should be switched next year, so that we can discuss the speaker rather than preview. There would be much more to be said I bet. I loved the final project and hearing about other peoples. Perhaps more time should be devoted to presenting on that. I found we didn't have enough time to give a good presentation. Maybe no final speaker and 2 full class days of this?",
    "I really enjoyed the class overall. But as with most food related classes, it is hard to come away with real take-homes. This is the first year of this course, and I hope to see this class improve next year.",
    "Many of these questions don't apply because the course was structured around guest speakers."

    "Having professionals and practitioners in the field coming to speak with us directly about the issues and specific commodities.",
    "The guest lectures.",
    "Hearing the guest speakers who were eloquent, getting to work on a research project",
    "The class really encouraged a high level of student participation and involvement (in class discussion and weekly reading responses), which helped me think about the concepts from the readings\/lectures in more depth. The course was well-organized and was able to tie together the 4 different commodities. The guest lecturers were, for the most part, informative and interesting. I do not have an agriculture background, so this course was a great way for me to \"get my feet wet\" in the topic."

   "comments": [
    "More structure in the discussion sessions, and a sharper focus on possible solutions.",
    "I felt that there was a little too much emphasis on technical information. This is a generalist class and most people are not going to be subject matter experts (and certainly not through this class) so I think the focus should be more on general strategy and positioning rather than the ins and outs of some technical issues.",
    "Some speakers were very poor presenters. The room was too big and poorly laid out for quality presentations and discussion; most people were on their laptops the whole time.",
    "Logistical challenges that led to a sense of discontinuity...sometimes difficult to really absorb. I was too busy to really do the readings fully and that would have helped. I tended to rush through the reading responses. The readings were really well curate though, with a few exceptions.",
    "Some of the speakers were not quite what I expected.",
    "More connections between the lectures, or in the future casting a slightly less \"wide\" net.",
    "Discussion could stagnate sometimes. What about assigning students to be discussion leaders for topics that they really enjoy, or areas in which they have expertise?",
    "I didn't love the readings, but I'm not quite sure what would be better.",
    "Discussion should be more focused on the reading, since that's the common body of knowledge we all had about the issues at hand. We should also reflect more on the speakers, which we did towards the end.",
    "a wider range of guest speakers, I think having more people from the private sector and government would have been more beneficial than having NGOs dominate the speaker listthe reading responses - the specific questions were too constraining, I often found myself skimming to find the answers rather than reading the entire section. I think having boarder questions would have been more beneficial.I would remove the tomato component, I felt that they were too rushed and it would have been more beneficial if we have less modules and more time on each individual one",
    "More time should be spent in defining mitigation options for agriculture. Also, more time is needed to define how students graduating from FES may have the most impact in mitigating agricultural impacts. For example, we discussed a lot of technical approaches to mitigating agriculture, but I am still usure of our role in increasing the use of these technologies.Also, I think the group projects should be more limited and perhaps linked to client opportunities with some of the guest lectures. This would help to connect the class discussion more with the long term projects\/papers.",
    "The seminar portion of this course needs improvement. No one in the room was an expert on the material, as it was centered around guest lectures, which made discussions unfocused. Both instructors were often very hands off about leading discussion, which I felt made the seminar run worse. I usually left seminar not feeling I had learned much of anything.To make it better, I think either the course would have to be partially restructured, or someone would need to lead discussion with a stronger hand and with more pre-discussion planning. For course structure, having discussion that follow the lectures, instead of precede them, would allow for the class to process and delve into that talk and would provide more framing for the discusison.",
    "I would suggest that the order of the discussion section and the lecture be reversed. I think class discussions were not very helpful this semester, and I feel that they would be much more rich if everyone had already heard the lecture beforehand (ie, Tuesday = lecture, Thursday= discussion section). I would also have liked for some of the lectures to talk about the environmental issues surrounding their commodity in more detail, while focusing less on one specific technology. John Volpe's first lecture, for instance, gave a great overview of the issues surrounding salmon production. Lastly, I thought the reading responses with the more general\/broad questions were the most helpful, because they helped me hone in on the topics that were most interesting to me and that I wanted to focus on. Also, one of the weekly response prompts should be to create questions for the next lecture."

    "I hope to work in sustainable food and ag after Yale.",
    "This is right up my alley. I liked the organiztion of the class into commodities, but I think future versions of the class could be less a series of presentations, and more an actual expert in this field just teaching the class. there are benefits and drawbacks to each. The class contributed to my knowledge of agriculture at the large scale, how its actually done in the world, which was great, as my previous exposure was primarily small scale sustainable. Figureing out where these meet in a less techincal and more rigorously political way might also be good. Food is more than just commodity, but I do appreciate learnign the metrics and values used to discuss ag at the large scale.",
    "For someone interested in food and ag, it was great to finally have a course to tackle these issues directly, and from more practioner perspectives.",
    "It fit into my plan of trying to take as many food-related classes as possible. I think, in the end, it made me realize that the way I feel about the food system is perhaps too radical for the Forestry School, which is a little too reformist\/conservative, if this class is any indication.",
    "This course is directly linked to my focus on food systems - food production, distribution, and purchasing. This course did cover an ambitious and sometimes overwhelming amount of material - food marketing, GMOs, aquaculture, carbon credits, labeling, international industry groups, etc. While exposure to all these concepts is wonderful, it was hard to go deeper in certain areas, even with extra readings. Everything felt very rushed."
