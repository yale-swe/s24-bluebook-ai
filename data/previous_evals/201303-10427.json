   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this class to someone if they were willing to go with the flow and take this class for the ways it makes you think. It is definitely an unconventional choice, and you should know that going in. That being said, I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to someone who could set aside their academic prejudices and take each seminar as it comes. Some days are better than others, but I always walked away having learned something.",
    "This class has so much work!! 200 pages of reading a week PLUS 6 one page reading responses, 3 five page papers, and 1 twelve page final paper. Nonetheless, I did learn a lot! I don't regret taking the class.",
    "It was a fascinating course that challenges accepted ways of thinking about disability.",
    "A lot of thought provoking information on injustices and complications in the world. Not for the faint of heart.",
    "ANTH234 is a great class if you want to learn more about disabilities and how all people - both able-bodied and disabled - are involved in disability culture around the world. To be honest, I learned a lot about myself from this class and I would highly recommend it to everyone. However, the class is what you make it. You can float by without doing most of the readings but not utilizing such a great resource in Professor Karen and the readings she assigns would not be the smartest idea.",
    "ANTH 234 is a dynamic and exciting course that explores such an important and relevant topic of disability studies; this course related in one way or another to the four other courses I was taking this semester. Each theme of the course approaches disability studies from a different perspective, while still making sure to bring in intersecting topics. Karen is so knowledgeable and approachable; although many reviews describe Karen as quirky (and she is!), I would say you don't have to get past her quirkiness as much as accept it. (Besides, aren't we all quirky in some way or another?) She allows students to really engage in discussion and bring in their own perspectives from other studies or life experiences. This semester I think the class was more of a seminar because 10 students took the course and we moved from a WLH classroom to the anthro building - this allowed for a more intimate class experience. Karen brought in two guest speakers who really brought the course readings alive and gave voice to lived experiences of disability - this was by far one of my favorite parts of the course. There is a fair amount of reading and writing in the course, however it was mostly very interesting and our TA, Gabriela Morales, would provide helpful feedback on our work. Gabriela Morales was such a helpful, approachable, and accessible TA as well!! I would definitely recommend it - it's a very unique and relevant course!!!"
