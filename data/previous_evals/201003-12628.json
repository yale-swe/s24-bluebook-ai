    "You'll probably take it if you have to, or if you have some interest in Separations for some reason or another.Again, I believe that Rosner knows his stuff, and anyone interested would probably learn a lot from him.",
    "This class feels kind of disorganized, but Prof Rosner is a really nice guy. He generally gives you all of the answers for homework questions during class, so don't hesitate to ask him for clarification. Also, he cares a LOT about presentation of assignments, so don't turn in sloppy work if you want a good grade.",
    "Most likely you have to take this class if you're reading this, however, even if you don't have to, it's a really interesting class if you have the right background. This has been one of my favorite engineering electives so give it a shot and shop!"
