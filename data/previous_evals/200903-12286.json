   "comments": [
    "YES! Take it. It's a great class teaching you a region in the world that is not often studied.",
    "If you are interested in the region and if you would like class that is engaging, take this course. It is not too much work, but the work that is assigned is tremendously meaningful. I'm not sure if they are keeping this course a seminar next year, but I really appreciated the discussion.",
    "Modern Southeast Asia was an outstanding course and I think any student remotely interested in learning more about Asian culture should take this class. As a science major, I was worried that the anthropology theory would have been overwhelming, but Professor Harms made the material very accessible. Also, the reading selection was very interesting. There is a lot of reading for this course, but the workload was reasonable with only two papers and a geography quiz. This year the course was in a seminar format, and I really enjoyed the discussions. Professor Harm is an amazing professor and one of my favorite at Yale. An excellent course with an outstanding professor!",
    "There were many readings to do for each class, and at times some of the readings were too cumbersome. But they were worth it because there were interesting discussions each class about the topics covered in the readings. Professor Harms is a very helpful professor and included articles, books, movies, and personal experiences throughout the course so we could get a good understanding of Southeast Asia. I would recommend this course, but only if you are very interested in topic.",
    "Great course, lots of really interesting topics. Good for non-anthro majors and also anyone interested in learning more about Southeast Asia. Work is not difficult. Interesting readings. Professor Harms is really nice and dorky funny.",
    "Absolutely! Great classroom atmosphere with people drawing on their experiences. Whether you've lived in Southeast Asia for most of your life or you don't know the first thing about Southeast Asia and want to know about geography (guided tour courtesy of Prof. Harms and Google Earth), culture, political systems, class differences, etc., this course is ideal.",
    "Yes, I would. This was a good introductory class, it's just too bad that students often cannot continue with classes in specific areas of the region, such as Burma or Cambodia, because Yale really lacks a good Southeast Asia department. So really, you'll only be able to scratch on surfaces of countries you're interested in because this class covers the whole region, unless, of course, you're interested in Viet Nam. Then there are a ton of classesfor that country.",
    "If you are interested in anthropology and want to learn about a new area of the world, I highly recommend it. The class offers many weekly readings, perhaps too many, but the class is what you want to make of it.",
    "Overview of Southeast Asian countries' histories and cultures.I would absolutely recommend this course. It was fantastic -- one of the best I have taken in my time at Yale (and I'm a Senior!).Strengths:-Professor Harms' genuine interest in the material, in teaching, and in his students' ideas about the material-Reasonable workload-The incorporation of ClassesV2 and other internet resources into the course-Interesting readings (with fewer toward the end of the course, allowing students time to focus on the final assay)-Useful assignmentsWeaknesses:None",
    "Possibly my favourite class at Yale so far - gives a great overview of Southeast Asia on many different levels, while also allowing ample room to develop and explore your own personal interests. The wide range of media used was very engaging - contemporary newspapers, local movies, academic articles. Also, the assignments were very original, and varied enough to keep you entertained. Take the class, whether you have a background in Southeast Asia or not!",
    "MSEA is a fantastic course. I came into the class having spent my summer in South East Asia, and this was a great way to broaden my knowledge on the region. I loved the fact that some of my classmates were from the are themselves, and could contribute insights that were particular to one region. I loved the scope of the class--it covered a wide range of fascinating topics. Definitely take this class--it's been one of my favourites!",
    "It's really a great class for everyone. If you know nothing about the region, it's also a great class to take to gains some insight because it truly is interesting. The readings can be a bit tedious but you learn a lot from them. the seminar style was also helpful in absorbing and retaining the material. I'd recommend this to those interested in learning more about SEA.",
    "ANTH 244 will help you to become familiar with the cultures of SE Asia and the effects of modernity on their societies. The reading for class was interesting for the most part, sometimes really dense, always pretty long. It's best not to leave it for the evening before class if you really want to have an understanding of it. The online posts the class makes about the readings are helpful too, basically summaries and thoughts about something of interest in the reading. Best not to make a post too late the night before lecture or there may not be anything for you to summarize if you didn't feel particulary engaged by the reading during a given week. The writing assignments were not difficult to complete and were actually pretty fun. The topic choices were left up to each student, so it allowed for lots of exploration. The class worked well in seminar style, but might have to change, I think, if enrollment is larger next time around."
