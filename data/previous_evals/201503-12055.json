    "A lot of work, but definitely improves your French.",
    "150 is a class where you really solidify your French skills and learn a ton. Take it with Madame Skorupa if you can, she's amazing. I feel now like i can read and write 2x better than at the beginning of the semester. The reading was manageable, and the overall workload is lower than L1-L4. If you're considering dropping French or taking 150, I'd definitely recommend sticking with 150! It's not a ton of work, you learn a lot, and you become much more comfortable speaking French. I feel like I won't forget my French now if I take next semester off, which is a level of confidence I haven't had yet in French.",
    "French 150 is great if you are looking to get more experience with grammar and writing before continuing on in French. It progresses nicely from L4 French with a similar format. Madame Skorupa is fantastic and really helps you build your skills in both speaking and writing.",
    "A million times better than L3\/L4. The readings are interesting and fun, and the work is not nearly as tedious as previous courses. Everyone will tell you to take 150 with whichever professor they took it from, but seriously...Madame Skorupa is so wonderful. She brought us food and taught us baroque dance, and was so flexible to our schedules and needs. I didn't take this course as a freshman (but I did take L3 freshman fall), but I feel like if I were to have had Mme Skorupa my first semester of college, I would have felt so comfortable and cared for, which is really important. Absolutely take this course, even if, as was my case, you don't need any more language credits and are just looking to improve your language skills and read some interesting french lit along the way!",
    "FREN 150 is a great class to take as a freshman and I would definitely recommend it. The workload is not too challenging but hard enough that you feel like you are improving your language skills. The texts are also adequately challenging yet interesting. If you decide to take it, take it with Madame Skorupa; she is the best!",
    "If you hope to continue your studies of French into the L5 level but do not want a class that is overly strenuous with the rest of your course load, FREN 150 with Mme Skorupa is a great choice. She is among the nicest professors I have had at Yale thus far, grades fairly, and excels at keeping the classroom atmosphere relaxed and even fun. FREN 150 is a literature-heavy course that exposes you to well-known French novels and plays; while most of them are fairly dense and difficult texts, Mme Skorupa does a good job of clarifying them in class. While the professor sometimes had a tendency to focus more on literature discussion than grammar in class, going to her office hours was often very helpful. There are only three unit tests in the semester, and they are all in-class, with straightforward essay questions and without the audio component that could often prove difficult in FREN 140. Oral exams are separate and not too difficult. Do study well for the final exam, however, as it can be slightly trickier than the unit tests. Overall, I am very glad I chose this section for FREN 150.",
    "Grammar, writing, reading, speaking--survey of basic French language skills. I would recommend this course. Improved my language skills, and I enjoyed it.",
    "French 150 is a great course that will improve your grammar by introducing you to some of french grammar's minutia specifics and to great french literature. I loved it! Madame Skorupa is an absolutely amazing professor. She is kind, clear, and helpful. She is generous (bringing food to our class when she knew we needed it!) and she is creative (prompting us to do role-plays that I will most likely remember forever). Whatever she is paid is not enough. She is just the best. Thank you, Madame! Take this class!",
    "I think this was one of the most interesting classes I have taken at Yale. It is a lot of work sometimes, but the projects are usually very interesting and enjoyable. Definitely take it with Professor Skorupa! She is the best!"
