   "comments": [
    "You examine various pieces ranging from the Baroque (Handel, Bach) to Modern (Stravinsky, Bartok), and how the pieces are interpreted by different performers. Through features such as tempo, articulation, instrument type, dynamics, etc., you understand how different performance choices instill different meaning into the music, and which performances are more authentic\/you like better\/etc and why. I would strongly recommend this course if you are looking to sharpen your listening skills and learn about the abundance of variation there lies in the role of the performer.",
    "This is a course about the specific techniques of performance and how they relate to the effect the music gives the listener. It is pretty detailed and specific, so I would only recommend it to those who have some prior knowledge about classical music and to those who enjoy listening to classical music. It isn't too much work, but you learn a lot, and it's also fun, especially if you like classical music. The homework is all listening which is fun, but you have to like listening!",
    "It's about taking many performances of the same piece and understanding the decisions each performer makes in their interpretation\/execution of the piece. There is so much more to music than just \"the performer felt this sounded better' and while there's a lot of technical jargon to sort through there's also a big personal component of the course too, which is a nice balance to achieve in any field you go into I think.Would recommend if you're interested in (Western \"classical\") music and\/or in understanding the motive behind people's interpretations and performances of things. Would not recommend if you're deaf, hate \"classical\" music, or do not understand human motives.(I use 'classical' in the colloquial sense meaning 'anything that's not like pop or jazz or \"modern\" music.)",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. But in order to get the most out of it, you have to take a lot of initiative to listen and re-listen to the music on your own. The listening can also take a lot of time if you do it properly -- and in order to really appreciate the class you need to have carefully listened to the music.",
    "You'll listen to a lot of great performances of great pieces, and prof friedmann tries to pick pieces and performances one wouldn't usually encounter (he tends away from very popular pieces like beethoven's 5th and chooses something like his 15th string quartet instead, just as significant but not as likely to be listened to by the average music enthusiast student; also, for each piece, he will choose some recordings by great artists that a modern student might not listen to as much, such as Schnabel or the Budapest quartet)For each piece on the syllabus, you'll listen to 3-5 different recordings of it. Usually the whole piece will not be assigned (for Messiah, we only listened to three small movements, etc...). The normal workload per class (twice a week) would be around 1-2 hrs, which is not bad at all.This class was great in many ways, and I made some of my best 1st semester friends in it. If you are looking for a laid-back course that makes you listen to great music with good friends and a memorable professor, take it. If you are more serious about developing musical skills and would rather a less fun, more rigorous class that develops your understanding of something like theory, history, or ear training, then take a different course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in music and wish to learn about music appreciation. You will change your way to look at a music piece after you have taken the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to those who do have a background in music and love to discuss music in general. It was one of my favorite classes of the semester. I loved going to watch the concerts and this class taught me to recognize the nuances of how each performer can add his or her own interpretation into the written music. I feel like it really helped me to grow as a performer and musician myself. The varied compositions that we listen to broadened my idea of music.",
    "This is a fantastic freshman seminar, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the performance of classical music. Professor Friedmann is a great teacher, and class discussions are intense and exciting. The workload is very manageable, and Professor Friedmann offers numerous chances to write extra credit essays to earn back lost points. We attended quite a few excellent concerts as a class that led to a better understanding of the material. Overall, this was just a fun and rewarding seminar.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class regardless of musical experience. All that is required is a love for \"classical\" music (though you learn fairly quickly that Friedmann is not the biggest fan of that term)."
