    "You have to take this if you're a CS major... pretty wierd if you took it otherwise.",
    "Its required obviously but if done right 490 is also an awesome experience. I learned a ton and got to focus on topics I was specifically interested in. Make sure you don't save the work til the end of the semester. If you get into a groove where you work maybe 10-20 hours a week on the project and you stay in that groove, its way easier to keep up and do a good job.",
    "There couldn't be a better course - you just choose something cool to look at and study it all semester long. Really gratifying and I learned a ton. Just make sure you choose a topic that you're actually interested in, which means you should start thinking about options\/advisors early (over break).",
    "I think the senior project is a great requirement for the CS major. It really gives students a chance to do individual research and get a sense for whether they want to pursue research further (such as in grad school). One thing I regret is not having spent more time before this semester thinking about and picking out a senior project that really interested me. Since I didn't have any project ideas, I went to Professor Abadi and asked him if he had any project ideas. He shared some with me and I picked one that sounded interesting. My semester turned out to be a lot busier than I expected, and I kind of put off my project. I ended up working on the project 20 days past the end-of-reading-week deadline. I would highly recommend picking a project that you really want to work on and then scheduling some set hours each week where you will work on the project. It is also a good idea to set some milestones for yourself, or else it is very easy to end up doing everything at the end of the semester, like I did. Looking back, I wish I did a project involving the StarCraft Brood War API: http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/bwapi\/. If you're into StarCraft, I think this would be very very cool, and you could try out some AI algorithms."
