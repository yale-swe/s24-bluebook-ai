    "My Japanese is improved significantly through this course.",
    "JAPN 157 is a comprehensive course that covers all aspects of the Japanese language. I felt that my listening, reading, writing, and speaking have all dramatically improved during my time taking this course. We read lots of challenging articles that would have been difficult even if they were translated in English. I learned a lot about Japanese history (especially the development of democracy in postwar Japan) and about Japanese culture (specifically about the cultural aspects of Edo Period). Through this course, I got on average about 90 minutes of intensive practice in the language (class met on MWF, but on TTh and weekends, I would be busying doing homework). It has taught me just as much as 3 years of high school Japanese in just a semester.",
    "I developed skills of reading Japanese materials, and listening to Japanese news."

    "I would appreciate it if we could have more focus on the Japanese grammar.",
    "This course provides a lot of opportunities for practice, and does so in a pretty reasonable pace and intensity. The instructors have been wonderful, and the seminars have been very enjoyable. The small class size (averaging about 4 on a given day) definitely helped, and I was able to interact with the instructors in a pretty engaging way, and pretty often. As far as language courses go, this course was phenomenal. The workload was pretty consistent in the beginning, but began to fluctuate a little toward the end. This was a little frustrating given that it coincided with campus events like Bulldog Days. Besides that, I don't think this course had any noticeable weaknesses. The instructors constantly try to improve the course and are very responsive to student feedback."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students given the great training and professional attitude of professors\/TFs.",
    "Definitely take this course if possible. This course provides so many opportunities for practice, and you will improve a lot if you do all the work. In the beginning of the semester, I was very hesitant to describe myself as \"fluent\" in Japanese; now, I can say with confidence that my Japanese has reached fluency. JAPN 157 focuses on everything about Japanese--from tonal accents and kanji to cultural fluency and idioms. It's pretty interactive as well. This semester, we went to see real ukiyo-e woodprints in the Yale University Art Gallery, and we saw letters by Matthew Perry and Yoshida Shoin at the Sterling Memorial Library. It's a lot of work, but the instructors are absolutely amazing and will help you along the way. If you have learned Japanese up to this point, do not stop now! Take this class :)",
    "Yes, I would like to recommend this class to students who want to know more about Japanese culture!"
