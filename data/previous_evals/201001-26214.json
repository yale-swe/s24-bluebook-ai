   "comments": [
    "Very good course, but did not provide much additional information than Epi I. I felt as if it were a repeat\/refresher course and did not go more in depth into epidemiology, which is what I had been hoping for. Homeworks and exams were fair.",
    "There was a lot of repetition with the Epi 1 course, however, the content of the course was clear and well organized",
    "this was a very challenging class and i have yet to master any of the material. i felt like a lot of it was a review of the first semester but it was still very challenging. this is hard material to grasp.",
    "It as a great course - good use of literature to directly demonstrate the points being made in class.The only issue I had was that it was very repetitive of Epi 1, and we learned only a few new things. In my opinion it would make more sense to teach it as a continuous two semester class, so we wouldn't have to spend most of the time on review.",
    "The homeworks were very hard and graded very strictly. If the homeworks had been graded on completion and not on perfection, the class would have been less stressful. The exams seemed very fair and the in-class examples were great. I was frustrated by how much this overlapped with the content of EPI 1. Many of the subjects were the same, though taught slightly differently. I would have preferred new subject matter and less repetition.",
    "the lectures were well prepared and thought out. excellent class overall.",
    "Great class but difficult to pay attention.",
    "Strengths- in depth look at some of the conceptual ideas in epi. Instructor is interesting and funny- good stories and depth of knowledge on material.Weakness- calculations were glossed over in class. although they were covered in the HW it could have been helpful to offer an occasional lab to walk through the problems. More practice probs would have better helped prepare students for the exam; Also seemed like a shame to go through so many papers and then not have the opportunity to discuss them as a class. Presentations on papers were interesting but didnt allow for as much independent thought.",
    "A lot of the course material was exact repetition of material from the first semester. It would have been nice to try to vary it up a bit, either by going more in-depth or approaching from a different perspective.",
    "Excellent.",
    "This course was great. It was very straightforward and presented the issues in a clear and concise manner. The only change I would make is that readings need to be posted at least 72 hours in advance of lecture. Often we had only 12-24 hours to complete them which was often impractical.",
    "It was really informative but I would have wished if they arranged optional sessions with the TAs where they solve the assignments to students so that we know what we did wrong.",
    "good.",
    "This course is very worthy to take. It refreshed and intensified my epi knowledge.",
    "Epi II would be a decent course in epidemiology taken on it's own, but in conjunction with Epi I it is a waste of time. At least 90% of the material covered in Epi II is a repeat of what was covered in Epi I. It has value only for students who did not do well or did not understand the material in Epi I. Personally, however, I found that the material was covered more clearly in Epi I (with Dr. Niccolai). This course is a waste of time for students who worked hard in Epi I and a waste of time and money for YSPH in allocating class and professor time. At the very least, Epi II should not be a required course for any division.",
    "strengths: interesting and entertaining professor, read\/dissection of journal articles, study types, study quality, applying the epi principles we know, etc.weaknesses: a lot of repeat from the first semester!",
    "Strengths- reaffirmed concepts learned in epi 1. at times felt like a rehash of information though",
    "This course is more-or-less a review of Epi I. Although we went into more detail for certain topics (e.g., matching), most of the material was review of first semester's epi. While Professor Desai is an intelligent and engaging instructor (with a snarky sense of humor that I believe most students relished), the material was redundant.",
    "I enjoyed Epi II. Prof. Desai was extremely amusing (in a very good, educational way) and I loved some of the articles he used in class. If it wasn't for data management this semester (which he also taught) I would say this would be my favorite class.",
    "The course was EXCELLENT. I really recommend it to all biostat phD students. I feel like it really rounded out my education. I feel VERY secure in the major epi concepts which, I think, already help me as a biostat student. A+++, Mayur! :)",
    "I think it's a very strong course overall-one of the strongest at EPH. I would have benefited from a little more information on errors made on the problem sets, but other than that, the class is very well-taught.",
    "3 strengths:The instructor is engaging and fun, and does not make epidemiology a chore to study for at all.The readings are diverse and unpredictable, but always relevant.The homework assignments are easy to follow, good at reinforcing concepts learned in class and great revision guides for exams.weaknesses?It's too short :) I wish Dr Desai could have taught us more epi(maybe Epi 3?)",
    "What I appreciated most about this course was the introduction to new topics in epidemiology, including life tables, survival analysis, in-depth discussion on matching, and meta-analysis. There is quite a bit of overlap with epi I; however, given the importance of this material, I feel that it's useful to hear the information again and in a slightly different way.",
    "I really loved this course. I had taken an epidemiology course in my undergraduate major, so during the first semester, these concepts were not new to me, but the course first semester was still quite challenging. This semester, all of these concepts became very clear to me and were taught in a way that they were applicable to current projects and interests.",
    "This class is extremely redundant with Epi I, and I am resentful of the fact that I had to take both. There were only a couple concepts that we didn't learn last semester in Linda Niccolai's class, and those could have easily been added to Epi I. It was almost as if Dr. Desai didn't look at Dr. Niccolai's syllabus--if he had, he would have seen that the two courses cover the EXACT same material. Please remove this class from the required SBS curriculum; it's completely unnecessary.",
    "An excellent course with few flaws.",
    "Great class!",
    "This course helped me to develop a more critical approach when reading and promoted a more sophisticated understanding of methodology. There is a lot of overlap with epi I, however, which could sometimes be frustrating, although it certainly doesn't hurt to review some of the concepts.",
    "This course is very comprehensive",
    "The case studies were interesting, but not crucial to performance in the course, so I think that's why attendance may have dropped off. I attended almost all lectures, but found them not necessary. The material, while a review of Epi I, was difficult, but not unreasonably so.",
    "The emphasis in class was not the emphasis on the exams. The midterm was all calculations and the final was calculations and important concepts\/ideas. There was a big focus on the readings, but we were never tested on them.",
    "Strengths: covers concepts from first semester more in-depthCons: assignments were not fairly spaced out over the course of the semester (5 homework assignments and 2 of the 5 were due in the same week at the very end of the semester)"

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Desai is one of the reasons I came to Yale- sat in an Epi II lecture last year and loved it.

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He's great! Strengths--he's engaging\/good lecture, goes through the material without insulting our intelligence (I mean that in the less vain way as possible--compared to other profs, whom I found unable to fully connect and earned complete respect from students). Weakness--there really wasn't any.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Prof. Desai is absolutely amazing. Aside from being brilliant and having killer shoes (!), he is just a really nice guy. LOVED taking a class with him, LOVED talking to him in office hours, LOVED his lecture notes...just all-around loved him. He's organized, caring, andsmart. He knew my name (and, it's a HUGE class) on the second day. He was the first professor I've had at Yale to do that. He wrote really good exams, we had fantastic examples in class. The homework was helpful and worked as a nice review of all of the work we had done in class. It is a very applied class, but if you ask about the theory, Prof. Desai knows what he is talking about. By FAR the best professor I've had in the public health school. I really can't say enough good things about him and his class. I think that it should be a mandatory experience to study with Prof. Desai; he is the \"gold standard.\" The *only* criticism I have of the class is that I didn't like the text book. That being said, Prof. Desai only assigns select chapters\/readings so even that wasn't horrible. Honestly, I don't think he should change anything because it was a wonderful experience!",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is a phenomenal teacher. I appreciated that he tried to make every class relevant to the greater field of academic epidemiology. His slides are very clear (albeit lacking in color), and it was a great way to understand the practical aspects of epi.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He's an excellent teacher. By far, my favorite instructor thus far. He makes learning fun by relating concepts to real-life epi problems. He's also approachable and friendly.",

Her review session before the midterm was completely unhelpful and almost laughable how little she knew and how poorly she explained the information. Her explanation of grading for homework was also not helpful. She should not be allowed to act as a TA again.Heather Sipsma, however, was an EXCELLENT TA. Very helpful, very accessible, and very knowledgeable. Her review session before the final was extremely helpful and she was very sensitive to questions and concerns about the final. I really enjoyed the lecture she gave to class; it was very pertinent information. She should definitely TA this course again!",

At times it appeared that Anita had either not received the hw ahead of time or had not reviewed it b\/c when asked about specific problems did not seem familiar with material. Would have been helpful if she had attempted to answer in a more conceptual manner. As students already have the slides, questions may be better answered by looking to other sources or ways to explain the material.",
