    "A really interesting course, and definitely something unlike anything I have learned at Yale. If you are not particularly artistic, I would recommend taking it Cr\/D, because it is a lot of work, and that can take some of the stress off. However, don't be deterred from taking this class even if you have no artistic skill whatsoever.",
    "You will enjoy this class if you like to make things with your hands. You complete four projects over the semester (working in wood, paper, cement, and then a presentation plus 10 page paper). The best part of this class is that you have access to the Fabrication Lab of the Architecture School. I felt like I actually gained practical knowledge, which is not true of my other classes. This class also changed how I view buildings, furniture, construction, and more (not things I ever thought about before). The weekly section isn't that useful (Powerpoint presentation), but in such a small class you can't skip. Also frustrating were the long readings, which we never discussed afterward. Professor Farricielli can sometimes expect more of her students than they can deliver, and you will find yourself working late the nights before a project is due. Talk to the TF who will have more reasonable expectations and who will help you focus. You will bond with your classmates: the class was originally capped at 14. Over the semester, we had a few drop out, and by the end we had 11. I wasn't considering becoming an Architecture major when I came into this class (I was also the only freshman) but I am considering it now.",
    "Yes. It is a lot of work but a different type of work to what you would do in another class. If you are thinking of majoring in Architecture, take it in freshman year!!!The class gives you exposure to a variety of materials, but do not expect to master the use of any by the end of this class alone.",
    "You will learn about a variety of materials used in modern day construction. Then you will have the hands-on opportunity to work with these materials. This class combines creativity and functionality in each of the five assignments. Manageable workload and a fun class.",
    "A pretty good class. Not always fun but can be really fun when it is. A nice break from academic work, but be careful becaue professor F. can be frustratingly on her own planet some times.",
    "This course is a great introduction to the different kinds of materials used in not only architecture construction but also in art works. The lectures are informative and thought provoking. The assignments are challenging and sometimes times consuming,but they eventually turn out to be great exercises, especially the last assignment, which requires students to do in-depth research on one material and propose a design. I would recommend it if you are willing to put in extra time in the wood shop on the weekends outside of class."
