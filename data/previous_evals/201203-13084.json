    "Do it if you like drawing, or want to spend time drawing, or want to try drawing and never have before. It's just lots of drawing. It's so awesome.",
    "Great course, intense pacing, can't get too comfortable (but it's worth it). Definitely recommend.",
    "I would recommend Art 223 to another student. Figure drawing is really challenging, but allows one to vastly improve his\/her technical ability and find new ways of artistic expression. I'd summarize the course as one almost wholly consumed by active studio time- one has great opportunity to draw and paint different models.",
    "It's very straightforward. Figure drawing is, well, drawing figures (that is, nude models).Also I have rated the class as less work than other Yale courses, but to clarify, it is less work in terms of homework (very little) but during class you will work hard (for 2 hours, 3x a week). It's so fun though that it doesn't feel like work!",
    "Would absolutely recommend it!"
