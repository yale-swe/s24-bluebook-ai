   "comments": [
    "Gives a broad overview of environmental issues and provides a reasonable amount of work. Not as strong in terms of developing particular skill set; more to introduce students toward a topic that they may have already heard about.One improvement that could be made would be to limit the topics of discussion and delve deeper into the issues as opposed to the rather superficial understanding that comes out of listening to different lecturers (this is also just naturally occurs when you have multiple guest lecturers, courses often feel a little disorganized). Additionally, Winslow is not the best venue for encouraging discussion - it's too big!",
    "A good basic course, though it was ambitious in the amount of material covered. I enjoyed the variety of guest speakers and felt that the readings complimented the course.The weekly discussion sections were largely unhelpful and unproductive - discussing the readings did not provide any more insight than if I read them on my own time.",
    "The course was very surprising. I had really low expectations for this course and really did not think that it would really teach me anything new. It certainly did the opposite. Like good lawyers in a courtroom, Stowe and McCarty made an amazing argument on how environmental issues matters.I have to really say that this class really packed a punch.",
    "Strengths- Professors are very knowledgeable. Promote discourse. Surprised by how much I actually learned about current environmental issues.Weaknesses- I understand how classes repeat same topics from time to time, but it does get annoy when they become repetitive.",
    "The class should meet twice a week for a max of 1 hour. Two hours after lunch is just too much and it feels like too much information is packed into that amount of time. They should keep the discussion periods though if possible. Only one instructor is needed for this class.",
    "Strengths: good survey of key issues in environmental healthWeaknesses: it would help to emphasize priority over the issues that stand out as most relevant to the field in the short and long run--as some lecture topics certainly seem more relevant than others.Improvements: Perhaps provide students with an opportunity to engage in a more in-depth project, involving interviews with key representatives, treating one or more of these priority issues.",
    "The biggest weakness is that the course is two hours long and completely presented using powerpoint. And a lot of the times the slides were packed with text, which makes it pretty difficult to stay attentive. Perhaps if the instructors used the white board to take notes that we could copy, it would be easier to pay attention for thew whole 2 hour lecture.The strengths were that the class ACTUALLY talks about current topics in environmental health. I read the news, and in many cases it reflects what we learned in class. Sometimes I think that having a textbook would make learning the material easier, but it is cool to have all the information so up-to-date.",
    "The lectures grew to be a little bit uninteresting and did not really capture much of my attention.",
    "The topics were interesting. I think the lectures could improve a bit if they weren't so focused on just what it says on the slide, but otherwise, very interesting over all.",
    "I really enjoyed this course- the professors recognized that this was a required course and that we were no all or most of us were not in the environmental concentration and therefore make the material very conceptual. we learned techniques for assessing environmental concerns and learned how it applied to public health- this was valuable.really liked the final, made us think in a public health sense rather than just an detail focused manner.",
    "It was very rudimentary conceptually and then some unnecessary memorization was occasionally included. There were good days and really silly bad days.",
    "Great",
    "The course is an acceptable introduction to environmental health. It felt a little unorganized and random at times, but overall, was a good, elemental (very easy) course.",
    "For those of you on the fence about whether to take Toxicology or Contemp Issuse here are the facts from someone who took both1) Tox is great if you are looking for a course with specific scientific knowledge and a professor with an obnoxious ego.You will learn alot in this course and subsequently pull your hair out.2) Contemp Issues is alot easier and reviews many more topics.Theres some busy work but the TA discussion sections are worthwhile",
    "While the course provided a good overview, I think the information was often presented in an incoherent way. It would be nice to have a textbook (at least to give us background) because most of us in the class don't know much about the topic. Some of the lectures were very disjointed and either repeated information or left out key concepts.Also, there should be some warning that the midterm and final are completely different types of tests! If you want to get us to apply what we have learned to articles that is fine, but please be consistent!",
    "One of the worst classes I have ever taken. Poor organization, unclear instructions, little to no insight into what we were suppose to be gaining or how to prepare for exams, poor presentation of lecture materials, assigned reading that was not pertinent to lectures and unhelpful, poor balance between over simplified concepts and very technical details that seemed outside the scope of the class. Class seemed thrown together at the last minute.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed the class and felt that I learned a lot about issues in environmental health. I wish that we could have spent more time discussing solutions to some of the problems as opposed to focusing on all of the negative impacts of human behavior on human health& the environment. I have a few suggestions on how to improve the course for next year:1) The discussion sections should be limited to one hour. We did not learn any new concepts in the last half hour of the sections.2) The instructors should provide some level of guidance on what to study for the midterm and final. I had luckily memorized adequate information for the midterm. However, the final was radically different as students were asked to comment on some major themes in a few articles. I had spent three days memorizing the important information on all of the slides for the final, yet this effort proved to be useless. I am not suggesting that the instructors specify what is on the test, but giving some element of guidance (\"don't worry too much about memorization, just know the main themes\") would have been extremely helpful for the students.3) The paper was an interesting way to explore an environmental issue in-depth. However, since no analysis or interpretation was necessary, a 10 page paper requirement was too long.",
    "Was a little disappointed- felt like I learned more from student presentations than from lectures, which often seemed to get bogged down in the details, but overall a decent class.",
    "A good introduction to environmental health. I was made aware of various environmental health hazards, which i otherwise would not have known about.",
    "Strengths: interesting topics were presented; I like the balance of work-type (mid term, final, paper, presentation)Weaknesses: long lectures; discussion sections were a bit dull. I would recommend more small group activities and creative ways to discuss the articles.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. They did a great job of hitting all of the key environmental problems that affect health.",
    "I thought this was an interesting class, but I didn't feel like it was very organized. The expectations for the course were not entirely clear and the midterm exam seemed pretty hard given the coursework up to that point. The final on the other hand was a fair assessment of the learning objectives for the course.",
    "There were too many assignments. It's not necessary to have a final, closed book exam in addition to a final paper.Additionally, the format of the final exam was misleading. Students spend hours upon hours cramming course information only to write a reading comprehension test at the end. This was incredibly frustrating.",
    "The broadness of the topics covered was great. I feel that I have a much better understanding of how different aspects of the environment can impact human health. Even better, I learned the tools researchers use to assess environmental exposures and the associated vocabulary. The multi-disciplinary nature of the field is fascinating, and I enjoyed being able to see themes that were present in so many of the topics. Although the class was wonderful, there are a few areas that can be improved.Lectures sometimes go into too much detail, causing unnecessary confusion. Details also dilute the main points of the presentation. For example, during the water lecture, a lot of time was spent going over the four disinfection byproducts. Perhaps the time would have been better spent on waterborne infections that plague 3rd world countries and the newest and greatest technologies, such as LifeStraws, used to purify water in those areas. It is a survey class, so a broad outlook would have been more useful and appropriate then the descriptions of those four byproducts (which we have all promptly forgotten).Readings should also not be too technical, a major issue when reading the papers on biomarkers. We are not scientists. If we don\u0092t understand what we are reading, we aren\u0092t going to read it.I would scratch the topic of climate change. With all of the current environmental health problems going on right now, it seems like a shame to spend so much time on climate change when all of the resulting health outcomes are theoretical and derived from a field that is largely undeveloped. Climate change seems to be fairly integrated into a good number of the lectures anyways.Lecture slides really should be posted before lecture begins, if not a few days beforehand. We like to be able to take notes directly on the slides so that when we are studying, we don\u0092t have to bounce between notes and slidesStudents should be told exactly what to expect from exams, so they know how to study for it. A practice exam would be helpful. For the first exam, students felt mislead since we were required to regurgitate lists straight from the slides when told that only the main concepts would be tested. (Recall questions, such as \u0093List six limitations of biomarkers,\u0094 are extremely difficult, since the only way to answer them is to memorize the slides.) Students expected the final exam to be like the midterm and spent hours memorizing the slides, only to find out that the exam was based on broad concepts. Either way, students were not happy campers.I know this may seem like a lot of criticism. However, the criticism is minor compared to how highly I thought of your class. It was one of the few that I actually looked forward to attending each week.",
    "a good survey of topics, but would really appreciate some more emphasis on analytical techniques, methods, or solutions to the problems presented. although this was partially meet in discussion, it would be better for the lectures to include these components.",
    "Strengths: The class was organized well in terms of having one key topic to focus on for each lecture. It also helped the course overall flow well from one lecture to another. Section was interesting and fun. Meredith does an excellent job engaging the class with the environmental health material. Katie also worked to engage the class but still has room for improvement in this area. Great to have lecture slides posted online. I also liked how many topics we covered so thoroughly over the course of the semester.Weaknesses: Lecture sometimes was not interesting. Katie also worked to engage the class but still has room for improvement in this area. Katie reads of powerpoint slides too much and she doesn't need to! The class is much more fun and engaging when she doesn't read off the powerpoint and she gets into talking about her interests and experiences. Learning in that way is more valuable and memorable than hearing Katie read the lecture slides. Would be helpful to have lecture slides posted online before class.",
    "Strengths: Students were able to learn a little bit about each field of environmental health.Weaknesses: Discussion section (new this year) did not help but was more of a nuisance. Students who are masters students should already know how to read a paper, and I felt like we spent time in discussion section learning where to gather information from the paper, which was a very poor use of time.",
    "Excellent course! For those interested in environmental health issues, this is a great survey course that makes students want to change not only the products in their own bathroom cabinets, but also domestic and international environmental health policies.",
    "It is a good survey course, introducing you to key concepts. It does not go into much depth, and after the first few weeks the material no longer seems fresh or different.",
    "Strengths - covered the essential topics in environmental health in an interesting way. The discussion section greatly helped reinforce the main conceptsWeaknesses - midterm focused too much on memorizing random facts",
    "- good overview of environmental health issues- this class is too problem-based. there is insufficient discussion regarding the solutions to these environmental health issues- the discussion section is a waste of time- there needs to be more emphasis on methods",
    "I found the topics of this course interesting; however, I feel that the lectures were minimally engaging.",
    "I enjoyed the course tremendously. There were many interesting topics in the scope of environmental health that was covered during the semester."

    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Katie - strong interests in biomarkers, built environment and other areas that comes through in her lectures. Only suggestion: speak louder! Sometimes we can barely hear you in class, even with the microphone.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Katie needs to improve her confidence in speaking in front of a lecture hall. She has great knowledge of her subject, but when in front of students she tends to rely exclusively on reading from her slides. She gets very nervous and repeats the word \"actually\" many, many times, which was frustrating enough to make me leave class early during some of her lectures. Katie is very nice and clearly very smart - she just needs to improve her delivery!",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Katie is phenomenal. Excellent lecturer and well-versed in course topics. She is incredible and breaks things down to a level that one can not only understand, but become fully engaged.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0She is great. Her PowerPoint lectures were well-structured and informative. Really knows her stuff.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Although passionate about the subject matter, not effective as a lecturer. Very uncertain and lacks confidence and did not encourage student interest in the class.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Fair overall. Good attention to detail. Covered a great deal of material, but often too much for a given lecture. Ensuring that the prepared lecture can fit into a single class period would improve a number of things, including encouraging the professorto prioritize and clarify the central points conveyed in a single lecture.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Kathleen is very smart and she relays information to us very well. However, her slides have TONS of text.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0very enthusiastic and fun to listen too. would have appreciated it if she did less reading off the slides.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0She was clearly passionate and very knowledgeable, especially in her area of interest. Her lectures and especially her power points were often disorganized. I was amused to see that much of what she included on the slides for our classes was copied and pasted directly from wikipedia.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Great!",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Katie is a wealth of knowledge and passion in the field of environmental health and has an impressive resume for someone so young. However, her public speaking skills are in need of some work. You can hardly hear her lectures (even in the first 4 rows) and she mostly reads from slides. Her PowerPoint presentations are often jumbled in terms of ideas, layouts, and take-away points. She's a really wonderful person and has a ton of potential, but needs to work on speaking up, speaking more confidently, and narrowing down her points to clear ideas. Awesome professor, though.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0At first I wasn't sure but I respect what she does.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Katie didn't really seem like she wanted to be teaching, and her slides were very disjointed and some of the time didn't make sense. She didn't do a very good job giving an overview - maybe this is because she has a lot of specific research under her belt!Her research was interesting, but if we don't understand the basic concepts it is hard to understand the specifics! The information really does have the potential to be very interesting.",

    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Dr. McCarty is a good instructor and also gave great examples of the concepts covered taken from her own research. Her expectations of the students knowledge gained from the class and the information she presented didn't always align (i.e. she tended to go into way moredetail that was necessary for certain subjects), making it hard to know what the key take-home messages were from the class.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0She was a good presenter, but her slides had too much information. This made it difficult when studying for the midterm and final exams. It was also difficult to assess was information was important and what was less so.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Katie is passionate about her work (clearly!), especially with biomarkers and arsenic. Her work is fascinating. The best part of her lectures are when she goes off-script (not reading from the PPT), like when she told us about her eco-friendly community in North Carolina. We were engrossed. It would be great if she could take some time during class and tell us some stories about her work. We live for the stories!",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0very sweet, very intelligent.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Katie is good as well. She sometimes engages the class when she is able to get away from the powerpoint. Sometimes she tries to fit too much in the powerpoint and I left the class a little confused about what the most important things to know were... Also on the individual powerpoint slides the text is sometimes too small to read. Finally, Katie lectures too much from the slides themselves and doesn't lecture enough without slides. When she lectures without slides or at least without reading from the slides it is much better. It seemed like she was working on this throughout the semester, which the class appreciated. I also liked how she explained that she was new at this and still learning how best to lecture because I could understand and appreciate that! Sometimes she covered topics with too much detail and complexity so it was hard to understand what most important about a topic. She was also responsive to emails which is always good.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0N\/A",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0In my opinion it would be much better to choose a limited amount of information to truly explain in lieu of trying to present as much material as possible without enough supporting information. If you are going to continue to present 60+ detailed slides per lecture, PLEASE post these lectures before class so that students can take additional notes on this information.Also, please focus more on the research that you conducted in Bangladesh.

   "comments": [
    "It's a broad overview course that will not go too deeply into one subject area of environmental health. If you're interested in that, take it, if not, I'd recommend toxicology or something a little more technical.",
    "This is a good introductory course to environmental health and is suited for a student who wants an overview of material.",
    "No comment",
    "Great course.",
    "Good, easy class to fulfill EHS requirement. Not the most thrilling, which was disappointing because the subject matter is very interesting.",
    "It's a broad introductory survey course of topics in environmental health. Much of it you could garner from following current events in the popular news and news analysis resources. Some of it is unique to the course. The professors' expertise adds to the course, but only minimally given the nature of the material and how it is presented.I would recommend it if you're not an EHS student.",
    "I would recommend it to other people in the policy concentrations, or other fields of study that wouldn't benefit from the detail-oriented science of toxicology. There's not a ton of work in the class, and the topics are interesting - it's just hard to sit through lecture, and it's tedious reviewing the slides for tests (because each lecture has 70+ slides!). I liked the term paper assignment, and I LOVED the powerpoint assignment, and the tests (so far) have been manageable. So yes, I'd recommend it.",
    "Great course- really enjoyed the material. Would definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "definitely take it",
    "This is one of three options for the EHS credit. If your not a science person and don't want to take toxicology or risk assessment, take this course. It's non science based and it's not tough and the professors are really nice.",
    "Do what you want, but hear me. Take EHS 510, you got enough to worry about. Why should the electives be the bain of your semester?",
    "I would NOT recommend the class. Did not find it interesting or useful, despite the ability for it to be.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to other students - especially if my suggestions above are adopted.",
    "Don't take this class if you're expecting an interesting dialogue about current contemporary environmental public health issues. Take it if you don't wanna do much work and you want to get a Core requirement out of the way!",
    "I recommend the course for anyone who is interested in getting more familiar with the effects of the environment on human health and vice versa.",
    "I would recommend this course to fellow students. It is a good core course in terms of work load and relevance to the field of public health.",
    "I thought this was a good course and I learned quite a bit about environmental health issues, though I came to the course with no background in that. I felt like the class could use some more structure and the purposes and expectations of the assignments could be more clear. I would recommend this class as I felt it was not too heavy of a workload to take it and the topics covered are interesting and timely.",
    "This course offers a broad overview of enviornmental factors that influence health, tools used to evaluate exposures, and some ways to ameliorate enviornmental risks. I highly recommend this class.",
    "a good overview of environmental issues, which should help you get a lay of the land, but not really give you much to do something about it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student for the strengths listed above. I believe Meredith and Katie are working\/will work on the weaknesses of the class. Together they seemed like they genuinely wanted us to have a good background in environmental health and a good, fun experience learning about environmental health in their class.",
    "N\/A",
    "Excellent course - especially if you have interest in and some background in environmental studies, environmental science or environmental health. Please realize that this is a broad, survey course and will never get into the depth that Toxicology and like courses.",
    "It is a good survey course, introducing you to key concepts. It does not go into much depth, and after the first few weeks the material no longer seems fresh or different. I would recommend this course as a survey.",
    "While this course will not provide any in-depth coverage of any particular topic, it could help students narrow their interests. I would recommend it to other students.",
    "Easy class, but I didn't learn that much. The issues discussed are interesting and important, but the course structure is a bit patchy. There are too many guest lectures that are not great public speakers.",
    "Overall, this course is interesting but very frustrating at times. It involves a lot of memorizing and not so much understanding of larger concepts related to environmental health. The professors are great and continue to work on improving the course in response to students' concerns, so I'm hopeful it will continue to get better.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to a fellow student"
