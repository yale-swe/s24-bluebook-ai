   "comments": [
    "Biol 104 seems like it'd be better as a seminar than a lecture if that makes sense. I'd still recommend it though.",
    "Take it! Don't listen to all the whiners.",
    "A lot of work. Leo Buss is a fantastic lecturer and he is a great person to meet.",
    "I'm not really interested in EEB, so I really wish that a 5 on the AP still exempted you from intro bio.This class, I really feel like I didn't learn much that was useful. Maybe how to read phylogenies, but that wasn't even covered in the lectures--it was covered in section.I feel like the class was a bit of a waste of time, but it was required, so I had to take it.",
    "Unless it is required, no.",
    "It's probably a requirement but the class is terrible.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to another student if you have a lot of other things on your plate. It's time consuming.",
    "Not the most interesting module of the intro bio sequence in my opinion. Professor Buss is very energetic, though. It is often hard to determine what the main points of each lecture are.",
    "I would not expect to learn how to write a scientific paper through this class. But as far as learning evolution goes, the class does teach evolution in a creative and interesting way.",
    "Yes this is a great course and opens your mind to the creativity involved in evolutionary biology.",
    "You have to take it, so just get through it.",
    "It's definitely an interesting course. I would recommend it if you need it as a prerequisite for other science courses, but if you don't and you're just looking for a fun science course you could probably do better.",
    "Problem sets were time consuming but not too difficult. The computer software could be kind of tricky. Lectures were mostly boring and difficult to follow, but occasionally interesting. Leo Buss was not always very considerate and was often rude when it came to addressing students' questions, but he is definitely a smart guy. The final paper seemed pointless and took an unnecessarily long amount of time. His expectations were unreasonable.",
    "A general intro to E&EB.",
    "Great professor, if you're interested in very specific details about the evolution of organisms then this is a good course to take. Not much about bigger organisms and the general evolution of animals, though.",
    "So much obscure work on computer software programs that you care 0% about. I picture this class and I picture mindless clicking of a computer mouse as I waited for computer programs to download, load, or compute metaphorical information that could have been grasped just the same without actually having to invest copious time into the background software usage. Without the final exam, and without weekly reading responses or problem sets, this course would be manageable and more equivalent to the workload required for other classes. As is, this half semester course easily deserve a full credit.",
    "I really liked the course. it's not very work intensive EXCEPT for the project and the final which have the potential to be quite work intensive when they come about near the end of the semester. my advice is to work on the project when it is first assigned and try to finish most of your work on it earlier. but otherwise, leo is an interesting professor with a lot of experience and a good senseof humor. he's definitely the coolest of the 4 professors and has a friendly atmosphere about him that the other professors don't really seem to pull off as well. with Leo, it's not so much a giant lecture course as a personal experience. also, he's very responsive to questions",
    "Yes, Buss includes cool lectures that you can actually relate to in real life. The reading responses were okay, but again the guidelines were vague in the beginning.",
    "104 is a solid course, with its share of strengths and weaknesses. The professor is great, but you need to pay attention to what he is saying as his slides are mostly images. The lecture study guides were awesome! I did not enjoy the project though, which took up a long time and a huge percent of the grade.",
    "The lecture has absolutely nothing to do with the class. If Buss still gives out lecture outlines and study questions, feel free to skip the lecture every time. Leo Buss really just rambles for 75 minutes and the lecture does not pertain to the tests. Readings are interesting. For all the other BIOL 101-104 classes, do NOT take unless absolutely necessary.",
    "Biology 104 was quite disorganized. When I finally understood the material as I was studying for the final, I realized I would have actually been interested in it had I understood the lectures\/what was going on.",
    "It involves a lot of historical evolutionary biology with some general concepts.",
    "The professor is very funny, but it is a course to zone out very easily in, and to try to focus on the material after having zoned out is extremely difficult to do, especially when basically no useful words are provided on the lecture slides - that is why the study guides are so helpful. This class was the longest 75 minute lecture class I had to sit through all semester and even felt longer than orgo lab sometimes. The sheer amount of work you have to do in this class is absurd - weekly psets are fine, but add to that anywhere from 20-40 extra pages of reading and weekly reading responses that were strictly graded based on how well you incorporated not just the entire assigned reading but also all of your thoughts and comments, in addition to running and continuously revising a semester long project, submitting multiple assignments based on that project, and then studying for a final held on the first day of exams. I can only hope the paper is leniently graded. The good thing is that the final wasn't that bad.",
    "Biol 104 is the best of the four modules, and Professor Buss is hilarious and super willing to answer questions on Piazza. Having both a final project and a final exam is challenging though; most people and the class in general is geared toward spending more energy on the final project, leaving the final exam sort of just there to add stress. However, I would actually recommendthis module to another student. After completing the final project, I felt that I learned a lot, a feeling I lacked after taking the other modules.",
    "Really interesting readings and lectures, but the homework and project are really tough. While Professor Buss and Professor Chandhoke dutifully answered questions on Piazza, I often felt like other TA's were giving their students a little more support than my TA was giving me. I've taken a lot of biology courses before, but never evolutionary biology, and this was a solid introduction to make me interested in the field.In sum, great course, frustrating assignments.",
    "If you don't need the BIOL 104 credit for something in your future, don't take it. It's a LOT of work for 0.5 credits, and there's a lot of kinks to work out to make it worth it.",
    "If there is any Bio sequence to look forward to, its this one. It may be a pain to sit through the others, but do not worry, there is light at the end of the tunnel. You might want to pay attention during the others though. They are very informative; once you experience them, you can appreciate this class much more.",
    "This depends on the person. It is strongly based on a project on a computer program. If none of these are interest to you and you do not plan on pursuing a science major, itsprobably not necessary and will not be enjoyable. Otherwise it gives very good experience regarding an introduction to scientific literature and research.",
    "Don't take it unless it is required, extreme work load and the class is only .5 credit",
    "A great class that I enjoyed; normally, evolutionary biology is my least favorite, but this class taught me some very interesting concepts that changed the way I look at life. Work load isn't difficult, sometimes a lot of busy-work, but it wasn't something that was hard. The final project was sort of a pain, but again, wasn't difficult so much as a lot of busy-work. Enjoyable lecturer and class overall.",
    "Awful, avoid at all costs",
    "Do not take this class unless you already know 80% of whatever the topic of this class is .... or you need it for a requirement...",
    "Bio 104 is a great introduction to evolutionary biology, and gives a lot of great background information! The project could be pretty stressful, especially depending on how proficient you were in the computer programs, but the material covered in class was very interesting.",
    "This class is a lot of work, not very interesting and lecture is boring. The course is new, and if you can avoid taking it one more year, perhaps the department will change the style of the course again. If you do not NEED to take it, do not. It is not worth the time.",
    "BIOL 104 covers some interesting material; if you're looking for a course to substantiate the evidence we have for evolution and discuss its ramifications, then this is a great course. However, it's definitely a LOT of work for a 1\/2 credit course: weekly problem sets, reading response, and experimental project, a 10-page scientific paper AND a final for half a semester? Basically, be prepared to put in time and effort. Also, there are a lot of unnecessary tangents in lecture.",
    "Horrible. Don't do it until they replace the project with something actually worthwhile.",
    "Professor Buss is a great lecturer although his lectures aren't very stuctured. He likes to go on many tangents during the class but I felt like I learned many interesitng tidbits from the class. Biol 104 is a typical into science course.",
    "It's an easy course if you do your work, attend lectures, and study.",
    "I don't really like half-semester classes. I would have preferred if I could take this as a full semester class.",
    "Biology 104 was a interesting class; the only test You took was the final, and the final project was a lot of work without a lot of guidance.",
    "Very cool class, but the project is a lot of work. The subject matter is interesting.",
    "Overall, SO MUCH WORK! And not that engaging. Learned a lot but spent the entire quarter focusing so much on reading responses and psets that I felt underprepared for the final.",
    "Fun class as a survey to the entire field of EEB, we learned how to use some computer simulations, got a chronological view on life and its changes, and had an enthusiastic professor. Basics were not well-explained but in this subject it was easy to catch on.",
    "A hard subject to teach lecture-style to 500+ students, I don't think it really works.Problem sets and the project were completely disconnected from the lecture material, it felt like two different courses. Overall, this class summed up the fact that the whole intro bio pathway can only work for certain aspects of the subject (Bio 101, and perhaps 103). 102 and 104 were a bit of a disaster.",
    "Evolution is chance and random.",
    "You are probably taking this because you have to. Runs differently than the other intro bio modules. This one has a bit more history. Psets each week, a final project, final exam, and reading responses. Sizable amount of work but nothing too bad. TAs grade very differently but I heard they will standardize at end.",
    "A fun, abstract class teaching the principles of evolutionary biology. It makes you truly conceptualize the material, rather than just memorize silly little facts.",
    "The sequence isn't worth it unless you need to take it. The reading responses in addition to homework was inefficient to my learning. The paper is difficult at first, but it is rewarding.",
    "This class sucked. Way more work than I expected. Way more work than the other bio modules. Might have been my least favorite class at Yale so far.",
    "You learn everything about the history of life, literally from before the dinosaurs. There's a lot of material, but in the end the details that might seem like they're just too much really are just for your own enjoyment and knowledge. It's a lot of work with the reading responses and the essay at the end, but it's a different way of learning compared to most science classes, and I thought it worked. Enjoy!",
    "Yes, this is probably the best intro module. There is SOOO much work, but it is probably worth it.",
    "A confusing somewhat boring course with an unclear focus. Lots of reading. Stressful project. Hard to study for the exam because professor is unclear about what you should know and what is just a tangential point.",
    "I would recommend it for a fellow student because it was a very interesting course.",
    "I found this module to be the hardest among the four. The lectures were very difficult to follow, and the psets didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t relate to any of the lectures. I cannot imagine anyone without a biology background taking this class. There was way too much work in this class: a pset and a reading response was due most Wednesdays and during some weeks, parts of the research paper were due. Even though the research paper produced anxiety (because it was worth 50 % of our grade), I actually found it kind of fun.",
    "It's kind of all over the place, but it is fascinating and helps bring together the other modules of introductory biology. Once again with the bio modules, expect to do work and study some. This course is entirely manageable, though, and the professor is a pretty great guy.",
    "No, I would strongly try to avoid it.",
    "I would recommend Biol 104 to most students since it provides a survey of topics of wider scope, not usually included in the usual biochem \/ molecular bio \/ genetics. It's structured differently from the other courses in the sequence in that a final project makes up a decent portion of the grade. I would say - take it if you need it.",
    "YES! Just take the entire sequence I promise you'll feel smarter.",
    "Biology 104 is a must for any biology student. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the origin and history of life and the current theories associated with them.",
    "Biol 104 was more time consuming that the other modules. The problem sets were fun and interesting albeit time consuming. The project was manageable.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone interested in biology.",
    "If you are going to major in bio, this class is a requirement. Out of the whole bio sequence, this class was the best organized. However, it also had the most pointless work and lots of it.",
    "Take this class if all you want to do is bio 24\/7. This module alone should have been worth 2 credits + a writing credit. Leo is amusing, if only because he's off in his own little world and doesn't give a damn about what he says in class #tenured",
    "BIOL 104 was definitely a lot of time and work, but if you are interested in the course material, or if youhave to take the class for a major, then go for it. Don't let bad experiences in previous modules scare you away from this class; it is a new professor, new format, and totally new material.",
    "I would warn the student about Professor Buss's teaching style, but I would tell them to go ahead and take it if they were okay with that.",
    "No. I wouldn't wish this class on anyone.",
    "Ridiculous amount of coursework, but definitely one of the most comprehensive courses of the module. Still slightly reeling from the amount of work put in though... and it's waaay past my final.",
    "Bio 104 is decent, it's reasonably interesting, and has decent teaching. If you're taking biology you have to take it so you don't really get much of a choice here, and Bio 104 is not bad at all in terms of workload (unless you choose a project topic where it takes forever to collect data).",
    "I would not recommend anyone take this course but most have to for premed requirements. So in that case i think that this course should be changed a lot so that it teaches somehting to the students...",
    "This course was incredibly interesting. I feel like I can see evolution in a new perspective, and my mind has been opened in indescribable ways. That said, it is very hard for me to describe things that I have actually learned in class. That is, the final was considerably hard to study for because notes were nearly impossible to take, leaving little reference for studying. The study guide provided were helpful, but no replacement for class notes.",
    "TOO MUCH WORK. Do not take if you have any other work-heavy courses as you will be completely overwhelmed. The grading is extremely dependent on each TA (not really standardized as it is very subjective). The reading responses take forever and don't seem to be simply checking that you did the reading as it was advertised. This course is simply exhausting.",
    "go to lecture they are really cool and it will help you study for the exam. Just sit back and enjoy and go through the study guides as the semester proceeds. It is only one page and it will make your life easier at the end of the semester. readings are great and easy.",
    "Required for MCDB, so yeah. If Leo Buss is teaching again, you'll be in for quite a ride. He's one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale so far, if not the best. More work than other modules, lots of reading. Don't fall behind because you'll end up miserable at the end with a 10 page paper to write, experiments to do for it, and leftover reading responses. Get a head start early, in other words. Also Leo Buss is a nice person and made the final pretty easy, as he admitted to us right before we took it.You should have a great time in this class. If not, you may want to reconsider if biology is really for you.",
    "Take it only if you have to.",
    "Good course that teaches a subset of biology often overlooked. Definitely recommended for any biology-oriented student.",
    "No, hard to absorb material.",
    "Great introduction to ecology and evolutionary biology. I found myself taking away a lot of really interesting pieces of information that I'm excited to learn more about in my future. Also, the readings for this course supplemented it really well and were by far the most interesting and well-written readings I've had for any course at Yale. I'd highly recommend taking this course if you've never had any exposure to the material before!",
    "This class is a lot of work. Ultimately, I did learn some of the fundamental concepts in evolutionary biology.",
    "Very scattered, but overall interesting if you enjoy the topic.",
    "Overall, this course was fine. I neither loved nor disliked it. The only downer was that there was a ton of work and it was all very confusing because each component was so small - problem sets, reading responses, project deadlines, final project and paper, and a final exam! It was difficult to keep things straight.",
    "Incredibly informative class with very interesting lectures",
    "Best part of the sequence. Buss is a boss.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to. Unnecessary amount of work that doesn't teach you anything, mildly offensive lectures, and useless mandatory sections.",
    "A lot about evolution, not much about ecology. You learn the entire history of the Earth. If you're into that, take it. It was also an incredible amount of work for a half credit. Problem sets, reading responses, a final project (with lots of tiny assignments and you have to give your group members feedback on everything), AND a final.",
    "This was a decent ending to a year with more than a few issues. It was a lot more of a general overview than the rest of the course, which worked well, and I enjoyed it. If you're going to struggle through bio, this is a good ending. The project was a lot less intimidating than it sounded, and the lectures were interesting to listen to.",
    "I would recommend this course to any Biology major; I learned of mind-blowing explanations and facts I had never before conceived.",
    "Better than Biol 101-103. Take good notes in lecture to make studying for the final easier.",
    "Not a great module but worth enduring to get through the yearlong bio sequence.",
    "Great course. Still not a fan of the modules...I would recommend this only to people who needed it as a requirement.",
    "BIOL 104 is basically the History of Earth-- but really, really condensed. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who dislikes playing around with different software, as there is a lot of that, or anyone who dislikes writing-- there are weekly reading responses and a ten page paper at the end of the course.",
    "Biology 104 is, plainly-speaking, an awful class. Lectures are disorganized and hard to follow. Assessments are incredibly unfair - you spend most of your time working on a project that doesn't teach you anything. Don't take this unless you absolutely need to for your major. Your time is better spent in another, perhaps even harder, class that actually contributes to your education.",
    "Probably one of the best of the BIOL sequence. Some to most lectures were dynamic and interesting. The scientific paper, which comprised a huge part of our grade, was pointless and I feel like the amount of time I spent on it is not proportional to its educational value.",
    "Intro Bio + a lot more work than expected. Really fascinating subject matter and readings. A semi-annoying but kind of cool project. In all honesty, more work than one would expect from an intro bio module, especially after the first three. If you're willing to put in the time, then I would recommend the class.",
    "Be prepared to scratch your head every lecture or so. And take notes like crazy and the course is mainly taught with Professor Buss giving a lecture and making ithard to remember all of the geological timer periods, species, and events.",
    "Manageable intro class to evolutionary biology. A prep course for E&EB",
    "Too much work for an intro bio class worth 1\/2 a credit- the paper was A LOT of time and effort, and then the weekly reading responses + homework assignments were graded seemingly quite arbitrarily. Additionally, there was even a final at the end of course- it would have been better if the \"final\" had just been the final paper and the reading responses were worth more SINCE THEY TOOK SO MUCH TIME.",
    "Awesome class!",
    "No, too unorganized to benefit the students",
    "I learned sooooo much interesting stuff. it was sooo cool. the project stinks but i learned so much cool stuff in the class that it overrides everything.",
    "If course this class will be required for some people. If it isn't required for you, I would not recommend taking it as a way to learn a lot about evolutionary biology. I learned lots of random facts from the course, mainly about geology and chemistry of early earth, but didn't get a very integrated foundation of material about evolution. But if you are looking for an interesting class with a brilliant teacher and lots of cool facts, then go for it!",
    "Nope. Nope. If you have to take it take, but other than that, stay far away from the Bios at Yale - not their strong point.",
    "Theres a lot of work. You have weekly reading responses, weekly problem sets, a giant and annoying project and a final. I also didn't really learn or understand the material until I studied for the final because the lectures were confusing. I wouldn't recommend this class unless you have to take it.",
    "Great!",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "BIOL 104 discusses the biological history of the world, using fossil records and evolutionary trees as evidence. You will learn astonishing facts about biology. The individual hands-on experiment in this module is worthwhile. I recommend this course to any student interested in biology.This year, BIOL 104 was the last module in the introductory biology sequence. It was a great experience having four varying modules in the introductory biology sequence to see the different types of work performed in each biology department.",
    "This class is pretty straightforward and easy and it should be taken by those with some interest in biology but do not expect to get a lot of information from this course.",
    "I'd recommend this class... it's certainly more interesting and less work-intensive than the rest of the sequence. Prof. Buss is great and I liked my section leader. If you're taking this class you probably have to, but hey! Enjoy it. You easily can.",
    "Only take BIO 104 if you have to. Otherwise, save yourself the stress and effort.",
    "The class had a project worth a large chunk of your grade--it was interesting having idea a science class that didn't just focus on quizzes and exams. However, I feel like I learned next to nothing about evolution and ecology. I probably wouldn't take this class again. It is relatively easy for a science class though.",
    "This course was not very well taught and was at times difficult to follow. The workload was also considerably more than most of my other classes.",
    "absolutely a horrible class. worst BIOL module. don't take it. the project takes up so much time and you don't learn anything at all from it.",
    "Take this class! Buss is such a boss! I knew little about this type of biology and it really expanded my perspective not only on EEB but on how to approach learning and life in general. Honestly, one of the only classes at Yale where I've really gotten a huge amount out of lecture.",
    "DIY class. Section is an absolute waste of time. If you ask a question, then they'll ask you to think about it. NO",
    "If you like biology, take this course because it is very interesting. If not, I would advise against it because it is very difficult and confusing along the way. If you need it for premed, sorry man",
    "This class felt very scattered. I found it hard to take in the information during lecture because we were covering such vast topics with no apparent organization - at first we were going chronologically, but then we seemed to keep taking side tracks until everything just got very confusing. The final project and the problem sets were also a lot of work. Considering it is only a .5 credit class since it is one module, I felt as though I was putting in a disproportionate amount of work.",
    "Eccentric teaching style and great course overall. Professor Buss is a great guy, and gives fantastic, thorough study guides. I would suggest this courseif you have to take a Biology course.",
    "Biology 104 is messy. Professor Buss likes to digress during lecture, and there are a lot of things to keep track of. The final project and final exam are disconnected, and the class as a whole lacked organization and cohesion.",
    "Necessary and interesting, but pretty disorganized",
    "Really interesting class, but not enough coherence between the project\/section and the lectures\/readings. Homeworks were all over the place. TF's have way too much power in determining your final grade!",
    "BIOL 104 is, in my opinion, the best of the four intro bio courses. It's excellently taught and covers material that is both unusual and very interesting. Where else will you be asked to study and propose potential origins of life on Earth? The research project is intimidating because it's worth a large portion of your grade, but depending on your TF, it's reallynot a huge deal. It's broken up into a lot of smaller checkpoints for your to complete. Discussion section is fun and will include tours of the Peabody Museum or Marsh Gardens. Readings aren't that bad\u00e2\u0080\u0094skim them in order to write your reader's response. Study guides are provided for every lecture and are, on the whole, very useful.",
    "Take BIOL 104 if you want to think about the evolution of life on a macro scale. Do not take it if you do not like the qualitative aspects of biology.",
    "Biology 104 is a good way to end the Introductory 104 sequence. The course definitely has a different feel from the first three Biology classes, but this is a welcome change. I would recommend Biology 104 to another student.",
    "My favorite of the modules! Follow the study guides through Leo Buss's roller coaster lectures and you'll be fine. There's a really interesting final project that gets you into the evolutionary material and the instructors and teaching fellows try to take you outside the classroom.",
    "Biol104 is a course on an intro to evolutionary biology and uses computer programs to help teach evolutionary concepts. It's really nice because you don't have quizzes or that many readings, but you do have a big project at the end of the semester that may be hard and challenging. I would recommend this course to someone interested in biology and evolution.",
    "I would recommend it to a student extremely passionate about these things because some of what is being taught is extremely cyclic and can be boring to those not interested.",
    "Fun and different learning experience! The material was presented in an interactive and engaging way that made you would to explore the topics more in depth in the future.",
    "Biology 104 is an intro level biology course centered around ecology and evolutionary biology. You'll talk about things like the origin of life, senescence, animal body design, and other concepts. You'll also have to do a large project over the course of the semester that culminates in a ten page paper. Though the course isn't perfect, I'd recommend it\u00e2\u0080\u0094you'll learn a lot and get to deal with some very interesting concepts and issues!",
    "The final project did not teach me anything. The reading among the TA'swas incredibly inconsistent: some TAs graded for accuracy\/quality in the benchmarks which were 25% of our grade while others graded for completion. My TA graded strangely and inconsistently as well. The project wasted my time spending hours pressing buttons instead of actually learning something. It took away from the other classes I took this semester, and I learned very little. The class has weekly reading, psets, reading responses and a final project, final exam, and final paper. That's a ridiculous amount of work for very little return on the investment.",
    "I think that this class was a major step up in terms of workload from the other three classes, something that I did not anticipate. The format of the class is also significantly different, with the huge paper worth 50% of our final grade. I personally found the material fascinating, though I did notice that in many cases it was far more abstract than, say, the material of 102.I would recommend this class as a way to learn more about how to write science as well as an excellent overview on Ecology and Evolution.",
    "I would not recommend Biology 104 to another student, but most people who take it will have no choice but to take it as part of the introductory sequence that is required of them. If that is the case, then just suck it up and do it, but if you have a choice, I did not enjoy my experience at all.",
    "Biology 104 is the study of the evolution of life on earth mixed in with the study of evolution in today's species (defining sexual selection, bottle-neck effect, etc.) This is an interesting class but be prepared to do a lot of work. There are readings for each week, but they are relevant and useful for the understanding of lectures. There is also the 10 page science paper and the problem sets. The problem sets are easy but be prepared to get little help for writing the science paper. Lectures are very interesting, and are very easy to follow if you use the study guides that Professor Leo Buss posts. Take this class if you are honestly interesting in the study of evolution and willing to deal with the frustrations of running tests with online evolution simulators.",
    "I think it's a good class. Evolutionary Biology is probably the most applicable to real life, and it really opened my eyes to a lot of things.",
    "Biology 104 is a good introduction to anyone who has not formally studied ecology or evolutionary biology, or pre-meds that last studied those topics freshman year of high school. I would recommend the course to any pre-med or someone who feels like their understanding of ecology and evolution is not solid and\/or who does not want to take a higher level course right away.",
    "A fair amount of work, but overall worth it. The software you get to use is pretty cool and the readings are actually interesting and relevant. The project at the end was a tad rough in terms of coming up with an idea, but after you had your idea the rest was not too tough.",
    "The light at the end of the intro-bio tunnel. I thought it was the best of the four by far.",
    "I loved this module, but I'm also an E&EB major, so I already appreciated the subject matter. You'll get a tour of a Peabody collection or the botanic gardens, though, which everyone I know enjoyed.",
    "104 is overly ambitious in the amount of material it attempts to cover. I spent two classes worth of time attempting to get through the lectures, which are different from the readings, which are different from the project and problem sets, etc. The origins of life are indeed fascinating once Professor Buss gets through to you with his esoteric sense of humor, but the workload is just very heavy. Prepare to spend lots of time with your computer running evolutionary programs.",
    "It was a good class! A LOT OF WORK THOUGH. The project was pretty stressful but Prof. Buss is very enthusiastic and if you talk to him one on one, you'll see how fun he is. This is one of the more work-intensive bio classes in the sequence in my opinion. My overall lukewarm feeling of this class might be influenced by rosy-retrospection though b\/c during the school year, everyone was definitely complaining. Nevertheless, this class was a breath of fresh air because it was so different and the professor is a lot of fun.",
    "Take it, this is how biology should be taught imo. Projects, trips, and interesting lectures.",
    "I have mixed feelings about this course. I enjoyed the lectures, although Professor Buss digressed a lot in his discussions and it was sometimes difficult to know what I should or shouldn't take notes on. I also loved the field trip to the Peabody, and I think it was an inspired idea to get students more interested and involved. I did not like that 50% of our final grades relied on a project, because that is potentially very subjective according to the grader. It was also difficult to know what to do because we didn't have very much direction.",
    "A horrendous introduction to Biology. A very good higher level Biology course. The class expects its students to have taken AP Bio in high school. Great lectures. Inordinate amount of work. If you have to take it for credit, I'm sorry. If you don't, but just want to learn Biology: audit it, audit it, audit it!",
    "You have to take it for intro bio so take it. I did not love the set up of the modules it made the semester challenging to keep adjusting to different professors and different expectations. Computer modules that we used for problem sets are difficult to use and I did not feel like I learned a lot from them. I wish there was a corresponding textbook to give us more background information.",
    "Biol 104 was a great course that gave a detailed understanding of the origin and evolution of life. I enjoyed how the course focused on modern-day hypothesis instead of old, disproved hypotheses. The readings were interesting and the grading was fair. Leo Buss is a great lecturer who is very entertaining although I somewhat felt that he was a bit condescending. Overall, out of all the biol sections, 104 was the best.",
    "It is a lecture-oriented class, but half of your grade is based on a confusing and challenging project way beyond your skill level. I'd recommend it only if the student really loves biology.",
    "If you have to take it, take it. Or if you like Evolution and Ecology, take it. If not, it's quite boring.",
    "This one is the best of the four. Leo is the bomb. You'll really like it.",
    "Do not just wait until the last minute to start reviewing your notes. The things you learn are amazing and inspiring and I wished I learned and understood them during the course instead of afterward. Take this course just to see the amazing features of evolution and how we came to be and the magnificent diversity of life on our planet. The readings are interesting and you should do them before lecture to better understand the material. The project is a little annoying, but make it so you have fun doing it. Instead of complaining about it, enjoy the assignment and research something interesting to you.",
    "BIOL 104 was a great way to end the introductory module, challenging me to think differently about biology and science. I would definitely recommend BIOL 104. Although, be prepared for a lot of work.",
    "Overall:-I thought this course was alright.-It had its merits and its downfalls, and neither one seemed to outweigh the other.Weaknesses:-Professor Buss's lectures could have been more engaging and organized-The project timeline could have been more spread out-Having reading responses and problem sets due the the same day was roughStrengths:-Enjoyed the weekly readings because it was interesting to read scientific literature written for the \"lay man\" and the readings were both informative and entertaining-Liked the idea of an independent project to allow us to explore the field, and enjoyed working with my peers throughout the process-Overall, interesting material and a good way to get a general idea of what kind of material you would be learning as as EB&B majorOverall, I would recommend Biology 104.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "The class was good. I enjoyed the readings, and the lectures were relevant to the readings. The class required way too much work and had too many assignments to only be half a credit though. Professor Buss had fairly engaging and interesting lectures--he threw in jokes here and there.",
    "This course taught about evolutionary concepts and ecology. The Peabody and Marsh garden tours were interesting as well.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend or not recommend Bio 104. If you have to take it for a major requirement, then you'll have to take it -- it won't be a fantastic class, but it won't kill you either. It's manageable. I personally found paying attention in lectures rather difficult, but I know other people really enjoyed Leo Buss's teaching style and the information he covered. The one thing I am thankful for having gained from this class is a general conception of how earth changed overtime, which is a geological concern as well as evolutionary concern. Interesting array of information covered.",
    "BIOL 104 is an intro to ecology and evolutionary biology. I would recommend this course to other students.",
    "I liked the class a lot. I came in not very interested at all in ecology or evolution, but the class made both topics very interesting. It's a fair amount of work with reading responses, problem sets, and the project, but quite doable and all of it was helpful. Class is well organized and Prof Buss is very dedicated.",
    "Pretty boring and dry but you'll get through it. Stay on top of your studying so that the final is less daunting.",
    "BIOL 104 is a very interesting class on a very complex topic. To understand the material being taught, students will need to actively participate in discussion section, read the assigned material very carefully and with great detail, and plan their experiments very carefully and have their final reports proofread many, many times to get the best results they can.",
    "I would definitely recommend this module to another student. This course will challenge you to consider biology in a new light and think about problems from a different perspective. It's a lot of work, but really worth the experience.",
    "I would recommend this class with caution. This class is all over the place. There are lectures and then there are readings and on top of that you also have to do the project. It's crazy to balance all that.",
    "I might recommend it because it was kind of a unique approach to the topic matter. It made me reconsider what I already knew about ecology and evolutionary biology. However, the majority of the problem sets and sections were unrelated to the material covered in lecture, which I did not think made sense.",
    "Take it if you have to. You probably have no choice for premed and bio majors.",
    "Great class - don't think that you need to be pre-med\/a bio major to take it, I found it genuinely interesting and am glad that I took it even though I decided that pre-med was not going to be my track in the middle of this semester. Would definitely recommend.",
    "I thought Biology 104 was one of the best modules (along with 103). Professor Buss was engaging, the readings were actually interesting (he posted excerpts from books online rather than from a textbook), and you get an introduction to evolution-simulating software that I enjoyed. There's a big final paper where you use the software to do your own research, and some parts of this were frustrating, but in the end I think it was a good capstone to the whole intro sequence.",
    "Logical progression from 103, more closely emphasizing personal scientific development than following a more generalized syllabus",
    "If you have any interest in evolutionary\/ecological bio, then this class would be great for you. Very interesting, good lectures, however there is a large workload involved.",
    "Usually you are taking it because of the requirement, otherwise I can't say it was particularly useful.",
    "Yes, I would recommend bio104 to anyone interested in evolution, whether it is a requirement or not (and whether you believe in the evolutionary theories or not...).",
    "Sure.",
    "Biology 104 was my favorite of the modules, and I felt that we were doing science rather than just reading and learning about it. The requirement to do our own experiment, although at first daunting, really forced me to apply our knowledge, and therefore cement it more thoroughly. I really enjoyed the lectures, and the course work is manageable as long as you stay on top of things. I would recommend this course.",
    "Bio 104 is a class that is incredibly interesting, but it's a lot of work. You will have a final project (10 pages), a final exam, and reading responses\/problem sets. It's a lot of work, but an excellent way of learning evolutionary biology.",
    "Bio 104 was a pretty good class, though a fair amount of work. There were problem sets andreading responses each week, plus a 10 page paper and a final. Leo gave good lectures and very complete summaries of each lecture, so that made class pretty chill. This material in the class wasn't hard, just the amount of time required to do the work. The project was different from the other modules, but otherwise it's about the same.",
    "it is hard but interesting. a lot of work but if you get a good ta it could be a good class.",
    "I do recommend it. Professor Buss is an excellent lecturer, and the material will be extremely interesting. Expect to do plenty of work, but if you've made it through the rest of the introductory Bio sequence, then you'll be fine. They'll definitely have ironed out some of the kinks from the first time around, so the course should be thoroughly enjoyable.",
    "Bio 104 was definitely the most distinctive out of all of the biology modules. The lectures were all very interesting as Dr. Buss is quite a character, and I enjoyed learning the computer evolution simulation programs. The project was a hassle at first, but by the end of the process, I found it very satisfying to have written a legitimate research paper. I would recommend this class to all science majors.",
    "Yes, it is quite interesting.",
    "Writing course not a biology course. Take if you're good at writing",
    "this is a course intended for students interested in majoring in biology or chem.",
    "BIOL 104 is an introductory course that is a prerequisite for biology\/pre-medical studies. Even though it demands a lot from the students (weekly problem sets& reading responses, 10-page research paper focusing on a self-designed and performed experiment, and a cumulative final), students do learn a lot from the course. If you choose to take the course, here are some tips: 1) When choosing an experiment, choose a computer software that you are comfortable with and curious about; 2) Study the study guides for the final - lecture slides are difficult to follow; 3) Ask questions on Piazza! There aren't any review sessions and course material isn't really reviewed during discussion sections because time during discussion sections is usually devoted to group work.",
    "Biology 104 was different from the other bio modules in the type of material the course covered. We first learned the basic prerequisites of life and evolution; then it was a lot of learning the timeline of the origin of life and evolution. The information couldn't really be applied so much as reiterated. The final project was a real learning experience but not too much of a burden. I would recommend the course to anyone interested in the origins of life and how it has evolved.",
    "The course part isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too bad. Leo wants you to learn the concepts and understand how evolution works, nothing super nitty gritty here. However, the project is a bit of a pain. Get started ahead of time, and get your TA to like you since they have a huge effect on your class experience.",
    "This class ask for a lot considering it's a half credit course and is only half a semester. There is a lot of reading and writing for a science course. There is also a 10 page paper and a final. Only take this class if you love bio or need it for your major.",
    "Biology 104 is cool. I'm not lying. I though 103 was cool. Then I took 104. Take 104. The research project is a ton of work and you'll want to strangle someone when you're up at 4 am running a poorly designed evolution simulating software but it's worth it."
