   "comments": [
    "Although the content was a challenge, this was easily the best class I have taken at Yale.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Nuno is great, the reading is interesting, and Nuno keeps the class from ever being monotonous or boring!",
    "A close reading of Clausewitz' On War, examined topically and supplemented by contemporary texts. I would absolutely recommend this seminar to any other student, especially Global Affairs or Political Science majors.",
    "Take this if you are interested at all in war strategy or military theory, 100%. It's a great primer on all sorts of related topics. Reading Clausewitz, one of the greatest war theorists in history, gave me a great foundation for further classes.",
    "Only take it if you have the background--if you do then it's great but otherwise you'll just feel behind and like you can't contribute.",
    "This is a phenomenal class. Take it! Readings are suuuuper long and often dense but you can still get the gist if you skim them. Discussion was very interesting and Nuno is the best.",
    "It is pretty easy, but also very boring. Look elsewhere.",
    "TAKE IT. It was a great class. If you have any interest in IR or how military power plays a role in the general framework of society go for it. If you don't, take it anyways. The readings are a bit heavy at times, but I always felt like I was learning something new. Be sure to get through all of them though.Professor Monteiro is great.",
    "Military Power is a very theoretical class - with Clausewitz's On War as our backdrop, we delve into questions about how technology could change war, why big nations lose small wars, nuclear weapons, etc. Nuno is great. If you want the opportunity to take a heavier, theoretical class, this one is far from dry and the level of discussion is very high and fantastic.",
    "Absolutely yes if the student is interested in military theory.",
    "This class is amazing. Take it if you can. Professor Monteiro is one of the best professors at Yale -- The course is a nice blend between classical text and modern statistical political science.",
    "I strongly recommend this class to anyone interested in the military power. The class provides a great history of the subject, an overview of how use of force has changed over the years on the strategic, operational and tactical levels, and an insight into how effective it is as a tool in international relations. Furthermore, Prof. Monteiro is among the best teachers I have ever had."
