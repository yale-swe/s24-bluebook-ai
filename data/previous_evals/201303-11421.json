    "The best class ever. This is what every economics class at Yale should be: a very knowledgeable and committed professor in a seminar environment. It makes everyone appreciate the importance of economics in public policy. The course load is light but not forgetting the most important literature of and public policy cases on welfare economics. You would get to read very important papers (which weren't that difficult to understand) and end the course with a debate on utilitarianism vs Rawlsian difference principle. You would never have to worry about forgetting some micro because you'd review them in class when you needed them. Shopping period could be crazy because the class was kept to 15 people but only 7 people took the class in the end, 6 of which were international students from all different countries. (Well there were 2 people from China, but couldn't blame them considering their population.) Professor Brown knew us individually andhow we behaved in class, which means he knew when we did the reading or not, but oftentimes his jokes about our behavioral tendencies worked to the class environment's advantage. He offered 4 combinations for assessment option: mix and match your own course load from 25% problem sets (which there were only 5), 50% final exam or a 10-page final paper, and 25% midterm exam or a presentation on your final paper. A lot of people opted for the problem set, paper and presentation combination, and it was enlightening to listen to public policy discussion from all different countries. I would really really really recommend this class to all economics majors. Absolutely take it if it's offered again. (I heard he's retiring and will only be teaching this as a Yale summer course. That's unfortunate.) Oh, did I forget to mention about the iPads that were allowed to be taken home for the semester?",
    "The discussion might get a little boring, but it will definitely be a good understanding for the microeconomics."
