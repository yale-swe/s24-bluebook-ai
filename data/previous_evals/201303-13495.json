    "Writing Humor was absolutely incredible! It was so much fun, and my writing skills really improved over the course of the semester. I can generate ideas and write a lot faster now than I could at the beginning of the semester because of the frequency of assignments. I wouldn't change a thing about this class. I really hope it's offered again, because I know there are so many people out there who would enjoy it and benefit greatly.",
    "Certainly the most fun class I have taken so far at Yale. It is writing-intensive and structured to help you understand the mechanisms at play in humor, and to develop a humorous style. There are different sections of the semester devoted to different methods (ridicule, narrative, characters, etc.), and readings and presentations to go along with them. Even so, there is a lot of room left for each student to develop his own style, while being informed my the techniques and ideologies discussed. There is definitely a lot of work - eight or nine papers, readings, and other shorter assignments due every week - but if you're taking this class you most likely enjoy doing the sort of work required. Not only did my ability to generate humor improve, but so did my writing in general. I would even take the class again, if only to write about different things (it's basically an excuse to do fun and creative thinking for credit!).",
    "I would recommend it for anyone who needs to work on their writing skills, explore the functions and mechanisms of humor writing in America, or anyone who needs a class that will make them laugh and not kill themselves.",
    "Yes! If you want a cool writing credit that's a little more off-the-beaten path than English 120, go for it. Also you don't have to be the funniest person in the world to do well!",
    "Only take this if you're serious about written comedy, it's a lot of work but it's worth it if you're excited about it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Writing Humor to another student. If it's offered again, you've gotta take it. Not only will it be instructive and help you analyze the way you approach writing humor, it'll be a lot of fun. Professor Wepler is not only knowledgable about the genre of humor writing, but knows how to work with you to make your personal style as successful as possible. He was critical when we needed it, but always kindly so. When he congratulated you on work well done, he did it in a way that made you excited for the next piece. He's a tough grader, but if you work hard (which you're going to want to do anyway to make people laugh) your work will pay off. Definitely take it.",
    "Why would you not take a class where you can get credit for exclusively writing things that are funny?"
