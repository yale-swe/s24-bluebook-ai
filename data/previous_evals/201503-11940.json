    "Brill is excellent. Take it if you can get in. He obviously cares a lot about his students and a lot about the work they produce. You get to write a profile of one of your classmates and a larger feature article about whatever interests you, and with both assignments you get a ton of support and feedback along the way. Plus, you get to learn from Brill, who is a tough, but fair, and a total legend.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it, but definitely only to a certain type of student. If you go into this class unsure of your writing ability, you will leave feeling like an utter failure and never want to take another writing course again. But if you go in expecting some criticism but being open to taking it at face value because you really want to learn and improve your journalistic writing skills, then absolutely 100% take it. Just know what you're getting yourself into!",
    "A bootcamp in journalism. Not for the faint-hearted.",
    "If you have the opportunity to take this class, you should. You will learn some interesting things from Steven Brill and learn a lot through your final assignment. Make sure you choose a topic you are really passionate about. And just know that the class will be a LOT of work, and Prof. Brill is a very tough critic. Good preparation for the \"real world\" of journalism and other fields.",
    "A fascinating and challenging course. It does two things. Firstly, it gives you a great exercise in reporting with a profile and a feature length article, both of which go through drafts and extensive commentary, and gives an insider's view of the journalism industry. Secondly, Professor Brill has an insider's view on the industry, and assigned great reading on contemporary journalism ethics crises, the future of the industry economically, and much more. If you're interested in writing, journalism, or business, this is an excellent course for you."
