    "This course exposed me to aspects of physics I had no background in especially statistical mechanics and osmotic pressure. This course was a revelation in the handling of complicated colloids and the problems which arise in their use. Since I work with colloids, there is a direct impact on my research.",
    "It was helpful, but on an introductory level."
