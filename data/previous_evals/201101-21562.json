   "comments": [
    "If you are a non-science major and you can get in, take it. You learn a lot in a fun, relaxed setting and will get to know your personally assigned topic in a lot of depth for a non-science major.",
    "if you are at all interested in how things came to be, try and get in. the best part was the progression of the class - how each new topic builds on the last, and fitting the pieces together is really cool.",
    "Great class and but lots of short papers.",
    "Not much of a commitment throughout the semester. If you are given a spot, think twice before giving it up because this is an extremely sought after class. All it requires of you is one big 15-20 minute presentation on your topic and then a 20 pager on the same topic by the end of exams week. You do have to submit summaries of others presentations weekly and that can be a bit tedious, but if you like new approaches to science, take this.",
    "Yes. If you're looking for an Sc then definitely do it! It's a totally painless and interesting science credit.",
    "Good course for a non-SC major. You won't learn too much specific information because you aren't held responsible for it (no tests) and because it's all student presentation-based, but you do get a sense for what scientific thought is all about.",
    "I would recommend it as a course for non-science majors interested in various science topics. The workload was 2 2-page papers a week, a 20-minute presentation, a final 20-page paper on that same topic and no tests. The workload wasn't bad, but 20 pages is a lot of writing.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class, for it covers a broad range of topics with just the right amount of rigor and depth for a humanities person; the goal was to give and attend presentations that would draw compelling origins narratives which one could remember having left the presentation. Thus, it created the right amount of background for further study or reading, and thus it accomplished a much more practical baseline of scientific knowledge for the average non-science person. Still, this is a class that will expect four pages a week of responses in addition to a term paper of appreciable length.",
    "This class is great, you should definitely take it, but only if you're actually interested in at least one of the origin topics, and hopefully you'll get to present and write on it, just convince Dave in your email that you like it and know more about it than all the others.The schedule of class where you learn it on Monday and have to turn in summaries on Wednesday was hellish, especially if you have another class with work due Tuesday or Wednesday, so be careful.Dave is the greatest instructor.Do your final paper draft well, he will give helpful comments about what he actually wants to see and you will love yourself for having something to go on when you write your final paper.",
    "Take this class! It's so fun. Probably not great if you have a heavy science background, but for the rest it manages to teach a lot without being overwhelmingly difficult.",
    "It's a writing-intensive science credit that forces you to give a presentation and lead discussions on material that you may not be too comfortable with. Take it!",
    "Definitely take this class if you can get in! Great class for non-science majors interested in learning about a broad variety of topics without being intimidated. Work was very manageable, and the long paper on your topic really helps you learn more in-depth without the stress of an exam.",
    "YES. TAKE IT. It is more work than you'd expect (writing 4-6 pages in one night plus doing all the reading is nothing to scoff at) but you'll learn a lot about your topic and get a survey of how things work. It's fun! and Professor Bercovici is SUCH a nice guy.",
    "This class is a must take. I'm a biology major, and the info presented in this class was never presented in any other classes I've taken. It was just interesting. I enjoyed coming to class. And, the class format makes you really own your topic (you're assigned a topic to write a term paper and make a presentation on for the semester). Take it, you won't regret it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student"
