    "I developed knowledge in the general character of the Greco-Roman world in the first century CE. I developed knowledge of and familiarity with many primary source texts from the Greco-Roman world that I would not otherwise have had the opportunity to read. Also, I gained knowledge of various cities\/locations throughout the Roman empire. I also took a step forward in learning how to use these texts responsibly when interpreting the New Testament through Dr. Attridge's example. I learned how to read and interpret these primary sources (through the reports) and how to engage critically with secondary sources (through the book reports).",
    "I gained a more thorough understanding of the social, religious, and philosophical contexts out of which Christianity arose."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of the course is the diversity of primary source texts a student is required to read. This helps give a broad overview of various issues related to the Greco-Roman background of the New Testament. Another strength was Dr. Attridge's \"mini-lectures\" in which he guided us through topics (such as gender) that most students were not experts in. One way the course could be improved is by spending more time discussing how to use these texts to interpret the NT. This might be done through the presenting of student course papers towards the end of the semester. Students would share their research and receive feedback and engage in discussion. This would not only make for stronger papers, but would improve the dialogue and collegiality between students. Another suggestion for improvement is to have students prepare more focused discussion questions on the primary source material. Students would write reports with questions at the end, but we would rarely actually try to answer these questions. Perhaps structuring the reports as \"discussions\" more so than \"presentations\" would help in this regard.",
    "The strength of the course rested largely upon the expertise of the professor. Beyond this, the fact that most students in the course are hoping to do doctoral work allowed for more nuanced critical conversations than one might otherwise find at the Divinity School. The weakness of the class is the lack of depth in any one subject necessitated by the large scope of the topics covered."

    "Yes. I walk away from this course more comfortable working with Greco-Roman sources."
