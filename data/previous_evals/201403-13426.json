    "This isn't an easy art class, so if you are looking for a fun one to take for your first art class this probably shouldn't be it, but you do not have to be an art or film major to take it! Most people in it weren't either of these and they enjoyed it.",
    "Since you spend a lot of time working on your original projects, the time devoted to the class will vary--but it will still be a fair amount of work, regardless. Still, it's a fun class that gives you a lot of room to explore the kind of animation you're interested in. I'd definitely recommend!",
    "it is so much fun, i would recommend it to anyone whether they were an art major or not",
    "I would definitely recommend this to a fellow student. The only drawback would be that, as an intro course, it requires more of a personal initiative to learn and experiment."
