   "comments": [
    "Knowledge: a good overview of concepts of revolution and leftist thought, and also a great exposure to relevant films addressing the media's role in this. I wish I had taken this earlier rather than later, though, as the subject matter was broad. Skills: Prof. MacKay is a great seminar leader to develop the ability to critically discuss texts, as he's incredibly enthusiastic and kind.",
    "I absolutely loved this class. Professor MacKay is one of the most thoughtful, caring professors that I have encountered at Yale. This class does not only offer insights into media, revolution, and the interplay between the two from an academic perspective; it also -- more importantly -- makes clear that the issues we focus on in discussing these films and essays are extremely relevant to our society. This class will enhance the ways in which you see and engage with social conflict outside of the classroom."

   "comments": [
    "This course really helped me think about media in a new way, and I especially appreciated the pairings of revolutionary texts with revolutionary cinema and literature that helped me better understand the cinema and texts. I wish that the course had given a bit more attention to the logistics of the revolutions that were being mediated; we read about the Russian Revolution, but some of the films that were not Soviet left me feeling like I was missing something because I lacked some historical context. If the course is taught again, maybe there should be a bit more pure historical reading on the syllabus.",
    "Strengths: fantastic instructor, very knowledgeable, collegiate environment that supported genuine curiosity Weaknesses: you got out of the class what you put in. It would be very easy to coast through the class without learning much. That said, I did do the work because of how endearing Prof MacKay was and how willing he was to work with the class. But there was nothing \"forcing\" me to do work. I wouldn't call this a \"weakness\" so much and a vulnerability.",
    "Very tight knit group with engaged and personalized discussions.",
    "I'm curious whether there might be room for more discussion of films \/ videos that connect form and content -- i.e., a film about revolution that is itself a work of revolutionary filmmaking. We certainly had several such films on the syllabus, but even with these, there were relatively few opportunities to learn about the filmmaking itself -- how were these made. I wish that the class could meet more often. The material and our discussions were so engaging, that I can only say I wanted more time than we had each week."

   "comments": [
    "A fun seminar, if you're interested in media studies! Definitely more about media than revolution, though. I would highly recommend it to a Film and Media Studies major, maybe less so to a history major.",
    "This course is a good broad introduction to leftist politics and film. It would be excellent to pair with \"Radical Cinemas of Latin America\" or another course oriented toward leftist politics. Prof. MacKay is awesome and has a very pure attitude with respect to learning, and is incredibly enthusiastic and knowledgeable. The workload is completely reasonable. You'll get out of the course what you put in, so people self-motivated to learn the material will probably do the best.",
    "Definitely.",
    "Yes. Professor MacKay is one of the most thoughtful and engaging professors at Yale."
