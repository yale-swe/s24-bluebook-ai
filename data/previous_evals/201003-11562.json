    "There seemed to be a lot of confusion related to the logistics of the trip to Cancun. It seemed like we didn't know until the last minute whether we were actually going to attend or not. Also, some of the NGO partners were only partially responsive, and that limited how engaged we could be with the negotiations.",

It's like having a part time internship, and takes a lot of time. The mock negotiation was really cool and well run by Gordon, Jaime, Alark,and Adrian. That was the best preparation for the UN conference, I knew what to expect thanks to the mock conference with Duke.",
