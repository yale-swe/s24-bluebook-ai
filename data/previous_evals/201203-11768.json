    "Really interesting if you want to learn about autism.",
    "This is a great class! You learn a lot from experts in their fields about all different aspects of autism. Although the class is small, it is still mostly lectures though, so be prepared for that. Professor McPartland is awesome as well. Just be prepared to find transportation to your practicum, because that can a little tricky. That said, it's amazing!",
    "Good class, definitely take it if you get in. Lectures consist of different guest lecturers each week who talk about their research which was interesting as a variety of different fields were represented and all lecturers were clearly passionate about their work. Professor McPartland is great too. The workload is very low key, basically all you have to do is attend lectures, go to a 3 hour weekly practicum and write a final 10-15 page paper on anything you want related to autism. It is a little hard to gauge your grade in this class as very little feedback is provided throughout the semester (and it seems like almost all of the grade depends on the final paper). Though I enjoyed the course overall I thought it was a shame there was no discussion in class at all. It was a little strange since it was a small seminar but discussion was not encouraged. In particular, practicum placement experiences were never shared or discussed amongst students which I think would have improved the experience a lot. The practicum itself is OK, though at times really boring and I don't think I learned all that much from it.",
    "Absolutely. Autism and Related Disorders is a fantastic course that truly analyzes autism from a wide range of perspectives, with guest lecturers talking about niches that they help to pioneer. The practicum is one of the best parts--Benhaven School is truly amazing.",
    "The class is scattered with re: to material being conveyed by unrelated guest lecturers, but the material conveyed touches on many different disciplines and was for the most part engaging. This class was a very pleasant experience and light on work up until the final paper. The practicum component of the class was among the more important experiences I've had while at Yale.I very much recommend this course.",
    "i was really excited to take this class but it ended up being disappointing. Each week featured a lecture by a different \"guest professor,\" experts in various fields of autism. These brief glimpses into the disorder, coupled with a lack of any structured learning (posted readings, posted powerpoint slides, etc.), prevented me from really learning anything concrete about autism beyond its basic tenets. Then your entire grade is essentially based on a final paper, which is intimidating, and there was very little guidance or support from the administration when writing the paper. Furthermore, the course require that you attend weekly practicum sessions at a local autism institution for three hours each week. Unfortunately, at the place where I did my practicum the staff never had anything very productive for me to do and I would mostly sit or wander about for three hours every week. I hate to say it, but it was a waste of time. I wouldn't recommend the class.",
    "This is a great class, though a bit repetitive if you already know a lot about autism. My placement is amazing at Benhaven school, and being in the classroom is the best part of my week. It was great to learn a bit more about the education side of autism, since I spend so much time in the clinic\/research side.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn about ASDs. This class will definitely give you a holistic educational experience. The best part of the class is the required practicum placement. The worst may be the rotation of lecturers--some are extremely dry.",
    "This is an introductory course to all things autism. It spans different perspectives on the disorder - from physiological to symptomatic to experiential - with guest lectures each week from an expert in the field. A major component of the class is a practicum placement at either a home or school for people with ASD. The practicum placements are very cool in that they are the sort of experience you are not going to get in your run of the mill psychology course. The class is interesting - one downside, though is that guest lecturers mean that the class is not always the most cohesive. There is not too much work (essentially only a research paper and related proposal), though the practicum takes an extra 3-4 hours a week including transportation on top of class time. Dr. McPartland is really engaged and enthusiastic, though keep in mind that he is more the class's coordinator and not teacher insofar as he only gives two of the lectures all semester. I definitely liked this class, but it didn't absolutely blow my mind.",
    "Take this if you can get in! Super interesting and pretty much no work until the final paper. The class is guest-taught so don't take it if that will bother you. You have a highest chance of getting in if you're an upperclassmen and\/or psych major, or if you have a personal connection to autism."
