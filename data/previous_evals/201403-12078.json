   "comments": [
    "What a wonderful class. It was a great experience to read several works by one author and see how those works influenced authors of the class. And with Nabokov there is always something to discuss. It was incredibly well taught. Professor Bozovic could be one of the best professors I have had during my seven semesters thus far. She really cares about her students and put so much work into the class and it showed! She was invested in improving our writing as well.",
    "This is an opportunity to learn about a fascinatingly complex novelist from a brilliant, charismatic young professor; what more could one ask for?",
    "Absolutely, yes! yes! A tour de force of close reading--each passage carefully chosen and brilliantly examined by Professor Bozovic, in tandem with in-class conversation. Hers is a rare gift of making the slightest comment meaningful, producing pith-packed lectures in a 50-minute space of time twice a week. The texts, of course, are a deep indulgence for the careful reader (or what Nabokov called the \"artist-reader.\")",
    "Amazing course. I felt like I learned so much, enjoyed all the books we read, and I am absolutely not a Lit major. Prof. Bozovic is an amazing lecturer and meets with every student in the class about papers. If you are at all interested in learning more about this amazing author than take the class.",
    "Good discussion of Nabokov; the 'world literature' component was less interesting and could have been connected more directly with the Nabokov component. Nabokov essentially writes the same book over and over so if you should really like him if you want to take the class.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in the course material. The amount of reading is relatively high, but never feels insurmountable. It is a very good course to work on the nuances of academic writing, especially to consider audience.",
    "Yes. Take this class if you want access to a great professor and incredible literature.",
    "Definitely take this course. Marijeta is excellent and Nabokov is always a challenging and often enriching read. I especially loved reading the Nabokov-influenced writers like Pamuk, Sebald, and Coetzee. I only wish there were more female authors in the syllabus, though I understand how that may have not been possible. Nafisis book was a disappointment, but taught very well.",
    "I enjoyed this course, I thought that that the material was interesting and thought provoking. I knew absolutely nothing about Russian literature before and feel like I walked away with a lot. I also really enjoyed the reading list. Writing the essays was not easy, requiring a huge amount of time and revision. Essentially, your essay had to be perfect to be deserving of an A grade. Somebody with limited writing experience like me might want to reconsider taking this course.",
    "This was a fabulous course. Truly excellent. One of the best courses I have taken at Yale. A wonderful experience all around. The majority of the course is dedicated to Nabokov's own writing, while the last third looks at other authors who were inspired by him. Take this class if you enjoy literature and want to learn with Professor Bozovic, who is a treasure.",
    "Cool class. Don't know how I feel about Nabokov now. Part of me thinks he is a jackass and the other part bows down to his incredible intellect.",
    "Nabokov & World Lit is a very good class, even for those of you who have read little Nabokov. Even if you don't particularly love his work, Nabokov is a brilliant author, and it's worthwhile to read his work in class, before moving on to works that have been influenced by him. The class strikes a good balance between Nabokov's works and other texts, and Marijeta Bozovic is a delightful, helpful guide. I would say that it was an interesting class, but one with few \"Aha!\" moments, or few moments of revelation, with an author who invites such a sense of discovery through all his tricks. So the lecture is decent, the one-on-one meetings about papers are very good, and the class generally attracts a fun bunch of studentseven if most people don't manage to finish all the readings.",
    "I would highly recommend Nabokov and World Literature because the novels are interesting and I came out a better writer because of it.",
    "This course spoiled me. Nabokov is a complex and fascinating author, if not the most immediately embraceable. After spending a semester with his voice, I've had a hard time finding substitutes to \"scratch the literary itch\" he leaves. Professor Bozovic is incredibly collaborative and engaging. She genuinely cares about her students, both as academics and people. You feel like a peer in her classroom, not a student, and Professor Bozovic manages to create this atmosphere without sacrificing any academic rigor. Nabokov is not an easy author, but you will easily get back what you put into this course. Professor Bozovic runs with student input, and seems to even thrive on it.",
    "Nabokov & World Literature is one of the best courses I have taken during my four years at Yale. Every Yale student who loves literature, storytelling, or just incredible writing should take this course. Professor Marijeta Bozovic is an incredible professor. The opportunity to read Nabokov's beautiful prose with Professor Bozovic is an opportunity that shouldn't be missed. Thanks for Nabokov & World Literature, I have discovered my new favorite author. I am not a Literature major but had I taken this course earlier in my Yale career, I may have switched majors. I am so grateful that I took this course. It was the highlight of my semester and may be the highlight of my academic experience at Yale. Don't miss this gem of a class!"
