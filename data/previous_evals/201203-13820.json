   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any Yale freshman.",
    "We discussed particular arguments and general views of philosophers from Plato to Aquinas by first attempting to understand their argument and then evaluating and criticizing it. I would recommend it to a student interested in philosophy.",
    "I would say \"DS Philosophy is a basic overview of Classical and Medieval philosophy. It's tons of fun.\"Yes I would recommend it, especially as an introduction to philosophy and philosophical debate.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS philosophy. The reading is dense but you can get so much out of it if you pay attention in lectures and class discussions. Whether or not you like philosophy, this class is great introduction to western thought in general.",
    "Take this with Professor Goldman if at all possible! I especially appreciated his straightforward approach and his availability to talk with students outside of class. I had never taken a philosophy course before, and he presented a perfect introduction to the subject. I went from not having the faintest idea how to write a philosophical argument or objection (let alone an essay) to feeling quite comfortable doing so. Professor Goldman's method of often writing out step-by-step arguments on the chalkboard, based on the readings, and then working with the class to refine or refute them was extremely effective and engaging.",
    "Definitely not, unless you are wholly passionate.",
    "A good overview of the classical philosophers and early Christian philosophers. Professor Goldman is quite young and interacts in a unique way with students in discussion sections. However, he clearly knows his subject, and is competent at dissecting and explaining philosophical arguments.",
    "This class is an effective introduction to philosophy. It's a little bit hard at first if you've never taken philosophy before because it's so foreign, and the papers have a totally different style than the others. Prof. Goldman was a tough grader but met with me after each paper and talked with the class after each paper so that we would improve on the next paper, and I did improve on each paper. The sections were good for practicing philosophy. Goldman ran the section well and I learned a lot about how to be a philosopher, though the discussions tended to steer away from the text and move into general discussion. If you are a very text-oriented person you might prefer a different section leader. Definitely a good class to take though, and Prof. Goldman is a nice guy, albeit a bit awkward at times.",
    "This is a great section for DS philosophy because Professor Goldman is so good at explaining arguments, and so willing to listen to students' ideas. He is very aware that he does not have all the answers, but by the end of each class, you will be gratified that you have made some progress towards the answers. At times the reading can be very dense, although this is not the section for whichit is most overwhelming. This course is a wonderful overview of the influential works of philosophy, and absolutely worth taking, especially with Professor Goldman.",
    "I would say that DIrected Studies 003 08 is an excellent class. As intensive as it is, you would not regret all your efforts because it truly gives you a better understanding of human nature. Its corpus is delightful and by the end of the term, you really feel getting something out of it.So I would recommend for all those reasons this class to anyone who is ready to work hard to study all those masterpieces.",
    "It is definitely a unique experience that I believe many students should have."
