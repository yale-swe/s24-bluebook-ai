   "comments": [
    "I feel I developed a much better sense of what good journalism involves. In particular, I think this course taught me a lot about journalistic ethics and helped me refine my own beliefs about what is and is not ethical.",
    "I learned so much from this course--not only about journalism as a profession and writing as a craft, but about politics and the world and morality in general.",
    "This class teaches students to think like journalists--to remain skeptical and to persevere and dig to find important truths.",
    "Perhaps more than actually writing journalistic pieces, I learned how to talk to people and how to get them to tell their stories, even if they were being difficult. I learned how to pinpoint the interesting aspects of a person or a problem and how to create a narrative around it.",
    "I had very little experience with journalism before I took this course, so what I learned was invaluable. I loved working on the profile and investigative report as I believe they allowed me to really pour myself into my topics.",
    "Class discussions span the Watergate (are you surprised?!), the role of emotions in reporting (emotional truth), and covering the elections. Bob not only teaches you reporting techniques, but challenges you to think about journalism as an institution and industry.",
    "I learned so much about reporting, modern US politics, and life. On the first day of class, Prof. Woodward said this is a class on how to live your life, and I believe it lived up to that standard."

   "comments": [
    "This course is fascinating. The readings are always well chosen and interesting, and the class discussion is great, too. Honestly I don't have any complaints.",
    "Bob is an incredible instructor: very experienced, cares so much, is very engaged and always available and invested in his students despite still working full-time!",
    "This class is an absolutely incredible experience. The assignments and topics of discussion expose students to a great variety of topics. And there is so much support offered to students. It was such a privilege to take this course. Any weakness of the course was that discussion could be overpowered by some students while others played the role of observer more often.",
    "Having Chris, Evelyn, and Akhil Amar in addition to Bob was a great support system. It was difficult to get office hours time with Bob at times, but that's understandable, considering he flies in from DC every week.",
    "The strengths of the course were the profile and the investigative report. Our other written assignments were reading responses, but I think it would have been beneficial to have short article assignments. I enjoyed the readings, but think some more contemporary works and a bit less Trump would be good.",
    "I really liked the assignments: Five short essays, one profile and a revision of the profile, and one final project. Bob really emphasizes the idea of \"going back\" and \"revisiting the writings.\" His work ethics and dedication to journalism (and truth) are just awe-inspiring. Another plus is the makeup of the seminar. Bob tries to make the class as diverse as possible so we had a law school student, a professional journalist, people from the YDN\/the Politic, STEM students, or just students who haven't done any reporting but are curious about journalism. You learn so much from everyone. The one complaint I have about this course is probably that we still haven't gotten back some of our short essays. There needs to be a better system of when to distribute the essays and when to collect the revisions.",
    "I thought the class was great all around. I wish we would have talked a bit more about journalistic conventions since many of us had never written articles anything like the capstone."

   "comments": [
    "If you get into this course and are prepared to put in the work, I would highly encourage you to take it. Bob is a fantastic instructor who puts a lot of energy into the course. Class discussions are consistently lively and interesting, and the readings, although sometimes long, are fantastic. 10\/10 would recommend!",
    "I would 100% recommend this course. If you get in it's a must-take. My favorite class at Yale by far, so engaging and interesting. You might not get a chance like this again to learn from the best and to have a teaching staff so invested in your well-being and learning.",
    "If you are lucky enough to get a spot in this course you must take it. It is a privilege and an amazing experience.",
    "Yes, if you can get in, take it! Not only do you learn from the expertise of Bob Woodward, who is one of the most famous journalists in America, but you also get to learn from his TA, his assistant Evelyn, and Prof. Akhil Amar (who has been sitting in on almost every class for four years). The profile assignment is also a great way to get to know someone else in the class and to get to know yourself better.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student. Bob Woodward loves to teach this class and that love is clear in the effort he puts into class preparations. I learned a lot about journalism and also about myself, so much so that I have decided to pursue a career in the field!",
    "Take it if you can get in!",
    "Best course at Yale, without a doubt."
