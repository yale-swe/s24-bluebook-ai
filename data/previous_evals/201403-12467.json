    "Navy lab. Required for ROTC but informative and cool.",
    "It's a class on Fridays during which the entire battalion of Yale midshipmen and the instructor staff meet for any number of various activities and it is always enjoyable to do so. It is not any large amount of work, but simply a time every week that the midshipmen all meet together with the officers.",
    "The greatest gathering of Midshipmen in the country.",
    "It is for Naval ROTC. The end.",
    "I would encourage incoming midshipmen to take advantage of the guest speakers and lessons taught during NROTC lab, as I feel that these lessons will help me both during my time in NROTC and as a commissioned officer."
