    "This course has given me a different perspective in the realm of engineering and as an electrical engineer some of the other fields I can apply myself in like bio-medical engineering discipline.",
    "I certainly have a much better understanding of MR physics and CT. I hope to use these in the future",
    "Before, I didn't know very much about other imaging modalities other than MRI. After this course I had a clear picture of the basic principles of other techniques. Lectures in MRI helped me to deepen my understanding in this area."
