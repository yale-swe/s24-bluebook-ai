    "Each week the discussions where usually interesting. The syllabus was accurate and there were no surprises during the semester. I do feel that there were too many assignments for a seminar class. Every week we had to write a summary of that weeks class. In addition we had to write a paper on one of those weekly topics for the final assignment. I dont think I learned anything for the weekly summaries and they mostly just got in the way. I would suggest not doing that in the future.",

    "This course was somewhat valuable to me. I took this course because I felt it would be important for me and my upcoming professional life but often times I wished I took a theory or fabrication class instead. Most of the topics were something I would eventually learn in the real world and perhaps it would be been better to challenge myself more by taking something else.",

   "comments": [
    "Well I think we had too many teachers. First of all, Phil runs the class. He needs to learn to not talk so much. Every week the conversations would also turn into something about Phil. I feel we lost a lot of interesting time with our guests because he was talking about himself, AutoDesk, or Revit.John, the other teacher never said anything. He always just sat in the corner and took attendance. I wasn't sure why he was needed at all. A TA could do his job just fine.Then in addition to this we actually had a TA who basically was just another student in the course. Maybe the TA and John could be combined and save this school some money."
