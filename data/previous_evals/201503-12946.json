    "Take this course if you want to learn a lot about music theory in a short period of time. Students enter the class at very different starting levels, but as someone who knew basically nothing about technical music theory, I was able to actively participate in class.",

    "This is a great class that anyone interested in music should take. It can be difficult if you really have no knowledge of music whatsoever but still look into this class."
