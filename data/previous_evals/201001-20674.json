    "I would recommend the first half of this class to a wide variety of students, but not the second second. Economics phd students, of course, have to take the class.",
    "first quarter equips you with a lot of tools to solve continuous time problems and also is a good introduction to investment and labor models.second quarter, monetary economics, is a lot like the second half of 510 in the sense that we are solving a lot of models that are all very similar. however, the models seem better motivated in this case.",
    "Yes. The topics are interesting and easy to understand.",
    "Yes, I think I learned techniques and ways of thinking about problems that are useful to understand.",
    "It is a required class, but I would recommend it.",
    "If you are interested in macro, it's a good course to start with. Even if you are not, this course still covers a lot of interesting topics that a economist should be familiar with."

    "I learned several new techniques for addressing macroeconomic questions.",
    "We coverd a lot of interesting topics and useful tools.",
    "I learn completely new models, which could be used in my future research."
