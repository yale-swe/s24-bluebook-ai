   "comments": [
    "Only if you were interested in microscopy and mathematical methods in regards to biochemical research.",
    "Yes, this course can help them to better understand how to use different biochem and biophysical approaches.",
    "It is a very good course to learn some quantitative biochemical and biophysical approaches.",
    "Yes, I will recommend the course to another student. It gives you an overall knowledge of biophysics and biochemistry.",
    "Definitely recommend it. The research proposal at the end also helps you to develop your writing skills.",
    "This course tells you many important biochemical approaches and how to use them for your research.",
    "It's useful if you want to do microscopy - dont take it if you dont have to",
    "I would say that it is a class where you learn a lot of detail about common methods in biology, in which most scientists do not bother to understand this level of detail. I would recommend the course to someone who will be using any of the methods we discussed.",
    "I would actually tell anyone that asked what I've stated above and tell them that they could probably get more out of some other class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It teaches you some concepts (especially the biophysical approaches) that you would never think about on your own. Oftentimes you know it works but you don't know why it works.",
    "it's a well-designed course providing excellent instruction of different useful tools.",
    "I would recommend becuase it is a great overview of biochemical methods.",
    "Definitely recommended. The course covers a wide range of important biochemical\/biophysical research methods and shows the ways they can be applied to answer interesting questions. Very useful for understanding the rationale behind biochemical approaches and designing your own experiments.",
    "don't let the seemingly worthwhile course title fool you: you will learn almost nothing. AVOID.",
    "The class was useful. I learned more than I realized about the different techniques we discussed however it can be very boring.",
    "I would highly recommend this course as an introduction to biochemical\/biophysical methods for students with a cell biology background. The course is very well organized and the professors are all very good at teaching. The way the class is organized is especially helpful in learning these methods - discussion sections after every lecture help reinforce the topics from lecture. In addition, by reading papers that use methods covered in lectures, students better understand how these methods are applied in experiments. Finally, the end of term paper was very useful in teaching students how to apply the principles from class onto their own research.",
    "yes I would recommend- important to know these concepts",
    "I would not recommend this class because it is not interesting and not helpful.",
    "I would recommend it if they lack a full grasp of all the techniques avaliable for analysis",
    "no",
    "Many gems of knowledge to be gained if you don't slack off.",
    "Highly recommend, especially to someone who has not taken physical chemistry.",
    "This is a course on biochemical and biophysical methods. The exposure to different techniques may be useful, but is not overly interesting in of itself. If you already have a background in these methods, or really do not expect to use them, it may be worth testing out of this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants an overview of molecular and physical techniques and how they can be applied to biological research."

   "comments": [
    "It was good to know the methods that were presented, but I do not think I learned very much from this course. It would have been more helpful to have instructors present about how they have used particular biochemical methods in their research, why they chose those methods, what new technologies are available AT YALE, etc.",
    "It's very helpful to me to design my experiments.",
    "It helps me to design my own experiments with the approaches I learned in the course.",
    "It helps a lot in my future research.",
    "It really helped me grasp more deeply basic techniques that I was already familiar with, while simultaneously introducing me to a whole bunch of new techniques. The final paper also helped me to develop my writing skills.",
    "learned a lot about microscopy. had to write a proposal at the end of the term, which was a good practice for writing future grant proposals during grad school",
    "This course provided me with a much deeper understanding of all the biochemical\/biophysical techniques that are used in biology, and now I feel that I have the ability to understand the methods researchers use, whether for my field of study or for any other field of study.",
    "I definitely did learn some new techniques and a bit more about techniques that I had already used. I still think my time would have been better spent taking another class.",
    "The final paper especially made me understand certain methods that I had not bothered to understand before.",
    "I was introduced to many methods which if I ever need to use, I could recall the name (good) but would basically have go learn the principles by myself.",
    "not currently useful for my research; hard to gauge if the course will end up being useful or not in the long run.",
    "The information about fluorescence, nucleic acid and kinetic and dynamic studies is very useful for my future research.",
    "I learned various biochemical methods, which I hope to usethem in my future thesis project.",
    "See answers above.",
    "useless course.",
    "This course helped me learn biochemical\/biophysical methods and how these methods could be applied to the field of cell biology. As cell biology research becomes more quantitative, these methods are becoming more and more essential. The final paper in the course helped me think of potential ways to integrate such methods into my future research.",
    "extremely helpful course- our class was probably a bit too big.",
    "I'm not sure how this class will be applicable to my research, I'm not using biochem analysis at this point and I'm not sure if I foresee a lot of it in the future.",
    "Covered a number of methods I otherwise would not have encountered. I will be using some of these methods in my thesis proposal.",
    "Writing the final paper was very helpful. I really liked how the course was gearedtoward teaching us techniques we might actually use in our research. Thanks!",
    "I think the final proposal was probably mostuseful to my research because I was able to write it on my research topic.",
    "This gave me an idea of methods that I could us in my future research. While it did not go into huge depth for each topic, it gave a broad idea of a variety of techniques and how they can be applied."
