   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The reading list is great, but most of the best books (What is the What, The Interpreter of Maladies, The Poisonwood Bible) are all work you'd probably read on your own. I did not find the discussion to be enlightening, at all, and the topics that most interested Professor Dimock I often found to be irrelevant or insignificant.",
    "If you're at all interested in 20th century and contemporary American Literature, take this course. I can't stress enough how unique the reading list is compared to the other courses offered within the English major. For the first time at Yale, I finally felt like I was reading stuff that had been published in the past 20 (even 50) years. Professor Dimock makes the class both exciting and enlightening. I really looked forward to every time we met.",
    "Really good class that will show you how America is viewed by the world, at least from a literary perspective.",
    "Yes, yes, yes. Everyone needs to take classes like these, and Americans in particular. There is often a lack of awareness in this country that literature exists beyond the peripheries of the Atlantic. however, if you cannot deal with heavy reading, then perhaps its not for you.Oh, also: the easiest way to get rid of both the American and pre-1900 requirement that exists. Also a senior seminar. Guys. It's a gem.",
    "I liked it... not sure if other people would agree. Some of the readings are very good, others not so much. Don't read everything if you don't like it. Papers were the best part for me; I really enjoyed writing mine. A pretty painless way to fulfill the senior seminar requirement for Engl majors. This wasn't my first choice seminar, but overall it was a good experience. Prof. Dimock is okay. Start the 20 page final paper early.",
    "I read all the comments on how terrible the discussion is in this course and took it anyway for the reading list. I have no regrets since the books were great and the work load wasn't bad, especially for a senior English seminar. But believe what everyone says about the discussion. Prof dimock is very involved and when this comes to essays that's a good thing because she gives great feedback. But her discussion leading style is really frustrating. She barely let's two students talk in a row before she injects a long speech about her own thoughts or changes us to a new topic or passage which many times I didn't find very interesting.",
    "Yes, I recommend it. The reading list makes more sense than it looks like it will, and the pairings are pretty good. It's a fun class.",
    "Take if but for the syllabus alone! However, the quality of the class depends very much on the other students in the section, so definitely shop.",
    "This class is awesome if you like the reading list."
