    "I did not throughly enjoy this course, but I know a couple people who did. The readings can be very dry at times",
    "This class helps you explore controversial words which have a big impact on society and our lives- even if we are not aware of it. I would recommend this class because a fresh outlook on how words can create a big impact. This course also teaches you how to analyze papers for your entire Yale career.",
    "English 114 is definitely a step above and different than most high school english courses. I found it to be very engaging and I looked forward to going to class. You have plenty of time to write your papers, so as long as you manage your time well between the weekly readings and major papers you can easily succeed in this class.",
    "YES! I think it's the best class I've taken here. My writing definitely improved A LOT.",
    "Keywords is a good section of English 114. Although it is the lowest level english class offered at Yale, it was still not easy if you are not a english person. Be prepared to read a lot, and write a lot. Make sure you get a good teacher and topic otherwise it could be a long semester. Shop them!",
    "TAKE A 114 COURSE AT YALE! Don't give me that line about how you don't like writing or English. Half my friends say English was their favorite class of the year and none of them are going to be English majors. You'll have to write 3-4 papers for this class but you get to meet one on one with the professor after your first ungraded draft and get a lot of feedback so you know what to do. The class discussions are brilliant and will make you feel like you're actually contributing to something. I wish every single one of you could have Arvind for a professor since he's basically the coolest professor at Yale but unfortunately he's switching departments. Anyway, take English. I am not even remotely interested in English and it's one of the best decisions I could have made. Can't say enough about this class.",
    "Class if you are intersted in a wide range of topics and if you have a lot of opinions. Its not really a writing class, its more of analyzing essays and debating whats wrong with them.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their writing. I believe that this is the best introductory writing course at Yale because of the professor and the course material.",
    "I really enjoyed English 114! I think English 114 definitely helped me improve both my writing and critical reading skills. I especially enjoyed this section because I felt like it gave me the opportunity to explore many different issues, such as abortion and euthanasia, or the use of key words like \"America\" and \"Family\" in our society so it never got boring. In addition to keeping things new and exciting, I felt like exploring so many different subjects allowed me to become a more well-rounded person, and learn a lot of new things that I would not have expected from an English course.I would hands-down recommend this course to anyone! Professor Thomas is amazing! He did a great job structuring the course and always engaging the class. He expects a high level of work from students but his positive energy and encouragement only made me want to work harder to meet that expectation and improve my writing. Professor Thomas is also very understanding and very personable, and takes the time to get to know his students, which is always appreciated.Overall, English 114 was definitely a fair amount of work--you have to write 4 essays throughout the semester and in this section you are definitely held accountable for class readings with reading responses that you need to submit at midnight the day before class. However, in the long-run I actually think this helps you engage with the material, and despite being being a fair amount of work, I really enjoyed the course and would recommend it to anyone."
