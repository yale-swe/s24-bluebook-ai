    "You don't know that Frederick Douglass is arguably the most important social and political figure in 19th century America and you need to. A great history seminar taught by a famed professor. My only concern is that professor Blight tends to talk quite a bit, not to the extent that the seminar is turned into more of a lecture, but in the sense that he just talks a lot. Be ware a lot of reading, as well. Overall highly recommend.",
    "This course provides a ton of resources to dig through to get to know the incredibly interesting character of Frederick Douglass. I'd recommend this course to anyone interested in biography, American history, African American history, civil rights, law... It's a fantastic course taught by a passionate professor.",
    "Take this corse. Its focus on Douglass kept discussions and readings tight and on topic. Learning about America, the Civil War, and racial politics (among other broad and fascinating topics) through studying Douglass's life was intuitive, compelling, logical, and fun. Professor Blight's constant enthusiasm and consummate mastery of the material buttressed this already excellent seminar. Less heady and more structured than Blight's memory seminar in the fall.",
    "An excellent seminar, though not at all a light one. It is quite neat to spend a semester focused on the writings and evolution of one man, at least when that man is as (surprisingly, at least for me) prolific and multifaceted as Douglass. Through him, you also learn so much about America in the 19th century. Blight is one of the most brilliant people I have ever encountered. He knows so much about the period, the man (hes writing the definitive biography on him, for G-ds sakes), and the history of its scholarship, and he tells stories like no other. Class discussions will never cover everything theyre supposed to cover because there will be so many engaging stories from him, but thats okay. The reading is interesting but rather a heavy load (hell hopefully trim it down, since this was the first year of the course and he was very aware of the issue). The papers are fine, though you should try not to let the second one slide (or the big research paper). The guest speakers we had were really cool too, so hopefully theyll come back. Im sure this type of course isnt for everyone, but for scholars of US history who know the basic facts\/chronology of the Civil War era and want a fascinating perspective on it, this is a true winner. And if you dont know much about the era, its a fun entry point to it. And, Blight being Blight, it will tie in to many modern issues our country is facing as well.",
    "My favorite course at Yale thus far. Blight is an amazing professor, and an eminent Douglass scholar. I knew nothing about Douglass before this class, and was captivated every week by this fascinating man. Blight assigns absurd amounts of reading, and you should try to do as much of it as possible to really get the most out of every class. Each week examines a different part of Douglass's life. 25 page final paper is demanding but Blight is helpful and insightful. Blight is also super chill. This is a must take course.",
    "An awesome chance to hear a great professor talk about a subject he's knowledgeable and passionate about.",
    "Take this class."
