   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in american history or understanding how to broaden one's approach to historical topics. The course involves a lot of reading (more than 1200 printed pages typically double sided). This was arguably one of the most intellectually stimulating and enjoyable classes I've taken in my time at Yale. Professor Klein does an amazing job at broadening the umbrella of American history since WWII by looking at all sorts of social, political, economic, and cultural history. She also does a great job of bringing in labor, gender, racial, and family perspectives. It was great to be in a class of 7 people and engaging in conversations every class that broadened my understanding of the factors at play in American history. The readings were a completely different approach that I had ever taken to US history. There are two 5 page papers that require extensive work in the archives and another 10 page paper that sums up the course. all were fun to work on and a really great way to inform oneself about a topic not as in depth as in class readings. definitely worth taking!",
    "I really enjoyed this course. The readings are consistently interesting, and Professor Klein is great at directing class discussions. Just know going into the course that you will be covering a lot of material very quickly. It's hard to go very in-depth when you're discussing six decades of American history in one semester.",
    "I would recommend this class for a student looking for a very interesting American history course. This student would need to be willing to put a significant amount of time into reading but if they put in the time they would definitely learn a lot and see the rewards."
