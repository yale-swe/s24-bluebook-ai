    "Hard physics class.",
    "I repeat. DO NOT take this class unless it is required by your major, and then check the major requirements very carefully to see if there is not a loophole or way to get out of it. I have found the class relevant to my life three times this semester.",
    "It's a tough course. Be prepared for a lot of studying and fairly low exam scores (it's curved though). I do feel that I learned a LOT of physics during the course, and for that reason it was good.",
    "Physics 181 is demanding because of the fast pace, but it becomes manageable if you are willing to put the time into teaching yourself material each week.",
    "take it as a prerequisite if you need it, but not the most satisfying course otherwise because you go way too quickly through the material",
    "If you haven't taken E&M before, this class moves at a really fast pace. Sohrab is frustratingly arrogant but if you can get past that he can be an effective teacher. Problem sets are long but not impossible, and be ready to cram at the end because he tries to fit almost a third of the material, which also happens to be the hardest part, into the last few weeks of the semester.",
    "If you're looking at this course, you probably want to do pre-med, in which case this is a decent choice, as it's the easiest physics course available to pre-med. If you're thinking of taking this to fulfill a science requirement or just out of curiosity, don't bother.",
    "I think this is a good class to anyone interested in engineering or physics who doesn't want to take a really quantitiave class. I probably woudl have been happier in 200, where I could have just taken derivatives and integrals instead of having to memorize many different patterns.",
    "Take it. I enjoyed it. It's not too hard but you still get an introduction into some \"real physics,\" especially because Professor Ismail-Beigi showed us some real-world applications of what we are learning and because he sometimes gave us more advanced proofs than the book, which It thought were interesting.",
    "No. Not unless necessary",
    "It's hard. It moves too fast. You don't have enough time on midterms or the final. It's incredibly frustrating and unpleasant. And I think that's because I was so resistant to the material and I just cannot think of a class I abhor more.The speed of the class isn't anyone's fault; there's too much material in too little time. They try to help break it down: online quizzes, clicker questions, problem sets, but it's just an overwhelming amount of material. I found it very difficult to stay on top of and eventually gave up. (see grade for evidence..) I think most people have taken E&M and therefore people who haven't are just in a boat that sinks almost immediately. I felt like I couldn't keep up with people who had spent a long time doing it before while I was still trying to figure out how to draw circuits.",
    "This was such an improvement from PHYS180. Professor Ismail-Beigi is a clear lecturer and his powerpoints are easy to follow, both inside and outside of class. He's also much better about reviewing homework problems, clicker questions, quiz questions, etc. There are a lot of parts to this class to sometimes it's difficult to stay ahead but overall I think the system is fair. Take this class with less intense classes if you can.",
    "It's a lot of work and unfortunately sometimes the amount of work you put in doesn't correlate with your grade. I don't really understand how or why, but that was my experience. Worthwhile to shop 171 too.",
    "Take it if needed, but don't do it for fun.",
    "Solid physics class, challenging but manageable. The use of clickers is awesome! As physics classes go, it seems to be a good choice to take.",
    "Definitely not. But who takes this for pleasure anyway?",
    "Don't take this class if you don't need to. If you're very good at physics, this class will be easy but still not a walk in the park simply because of the amount of material it covers. We basically learned relatively in one day. The style of the class is terrible, as all large intro level science classes are, and the teacher isn't great. Then again, you have to get through it. I'm into the physical sciences (though not physics) and so this class was better for me than 201 since it covered more practical topics, and less of the theoretical stuff. Exams were tough, but I think the professor genuinely cared more about learning the material than the actual grades, which was refreshing.",
    "This class is not fun, only take it if you have to. Sohrab is a wonderful lecturer, but he can only do so much for you. I found this class to be very difficult and unpleasant, but then I'm only using it for a prereq.",
    "This class is alright. You still use the same awful book sadly, but the material is pretty easy, and the exams are a joke as you get like 6 pages of notes. However, Professor Sohrab was just awful, and from what I have seen from the few lectures next years professor did, next year won't be fun either. Take 171 or 201 if you started with them. If not just bite the bullet and finish off the 180 track.",
    "Do not take this class. The exams are always much harder than the practice exams or problem sets. They are unreasonably hard and worded very poorly",
    "Much harder than Physics 180. You actually have to read the book. The midterms and final are relatively hard due to time constraints more than difficult material.",
    "Great survey course in Physics, but don't expect to have a great relationship with the professor. I would recommend this over 201 if you're fulfilling Engineering requirements or Pre-Med requirements because it gives you a good enough understanding, whereas 201 is more in-depth than you might need.",
    "This course is very hard. If you have never taken Math120, do not take this course or you will struggle immensely to visualize and understand the concepts right from the get-go, and then you'll fall behind like I did, and struggle and hate the course even though the professor is an awesome guy. Sohrab is phenomenal and I feel that if he's teaching it, you should take advantage of his ability to teach, especially one-on-one.If you do take this course, make sure you do a ton of practice problems to prepare for the exams.",
    "A good overview of E&M. A fast pace means that you have to do a fair amount of work outside of lecture to understand the material and really think about it, but it is not an unmanageable amount of work.",
    "I would only take this course if it is required for the student's major.",
    "E&M is not like mechanics - it is much less intuitive which makes it much harder. If you were not solid in mechanics I do not recommend this course for you (unless you're premed)",
    "Physics 181 is a very comprehensive course to the concepts and the underlying principles of physics. Be prepared to work a lot. There are clicker questions for every class, there are mandatory readings twice a week. The course is manageable until the midterm, and then concepts become incredibly tricky. If you haven't had a background in electricity and magnetism don't worry, but be expected to work very hard to understand concepts at the level of your peers.",
    "I chose this over 170 because I enjoyed physics and wanted to learn the classical version rather than a watered down pre-med version. I'm glad I chose 180 because I feel like I gained a lot - even though it was probably a lot harder and I probably got a lower grade, but it was more satisfying than doing tedious psets every week. Sohrab is a great professor, but I think it's also crucial to have a good study group. I wouldn't have survived if I didn't check over the psets with my friends.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE! Yes, electricity and magnetism is hard, the material that you cover is tough and takes a lot of time thinking through to really get an understanding but if you put in enough effort it is not impossible. The reason to not take this course is the professor. Sohrab is the worst professor I have had at Yale. He makes no effort to teach the materials, rushing through slides in lecture, he expects you to basically know the material before each lecture. He is condescending and rude, making snarky comments and laughing at students when they ask questions. He makes no effort to teach to students and acts as if teaching is below him. I would avoid this course unless it is taught by another professor. I would recommend going up or down a level in physics just to avoid having to \"learn\" from Sohrab.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Perhaps if a different professor taught the class, it would be a better course.",
    "You'll learn EM physics, which is more than anyone can say for 171 i think. I actually really enjoyed this class, which is not too hard at all and has a lot of interesting concepts. Sohrab is great!",
    "This class will require more work than any other class. DO NOT assume that if you have a strong physics background you will do less work. Between the psets, the online reading quizzes, the clicker questions, and the midterms, this class is a lot of work. try to take it as soon as possible with as light classes as possible.",
    "Just your standard physics class. Most of you are probably taking it because you have to for a major or for pre-med, so my evaluation probably isn't that helpful. If you made it through 180, you'll make it through 181.",
    "I took 200 and then switched down to 181 because I couldn't remember any differential equations that I'd learned.Differences between 200 and 181:- The problem sets in 200 were way harder. The 181 problem sets were pretty straight forward, sometimes to the point of banality. That being said, the 200 psets took me at least 6-8 hours a week. The 181 psets took me half that time.- The 181 psets were more problem based, but the tests were more conceptual. The 200 psets required more conceptual skills, but the tests were very straight forward problem solving. Makes no sense. Tipton (who teaches 200\/201) writes much better tests. This guy (Sohrab) writes very frustrating tests that make you feel just terrible after you walk out.- 181 has a lot more busy work (in class clicker problems and prelecture quizzes), but busy work means filler points to boost your grade.It's really hard to say which one is better...",
    "Take it if you want a solid understanding of physics. It was very work intensive but worth it in my opinion.",
    "Ehh, you're taking it because you haveto. Unfortunately, Sohrab is no Professor Lewin (MIT). This class is harder than it needs to be, goes quickly, and you have no idea how you're doing in it until you get your final letter grade because the curve isn't set beforehand\/publicized. Most of your learning will come from the textbook.",
    "As a prereq it's fine. Sohrab's PPT's are pretty helpful and I liked the clicker questions. Exams were pretty difficult compared to what was expected in lecture and on homework's.",
    "If you HAVE to take it, be prepared to learn the material on your own and also to not freak out when you fail the exams.",
    "A good course but much more difficult than the first semester. Professor Ismail-Beigi is really good and he puts a lot of effort into making the course better based on class feedback.",
    "Seems like a standard physics course to me. I personally didn't like it, but I also personally dislike physics, so take my comments with a grain of salt. Sohrab is rather intense and intimidating, but he really seems to know what he's doing.",
    "Awful class. Avoid if at all possible. Hard p-sets. Terrible professor. Long readings. Have fun!",
    "It was the most time consuming class I have ever taken although you learn a lot and it is a pretty fair course. Don't take unless you need to for your major or you love physics",
    "I feel like I learned a lot more in Physics 181 than in Physics 180 but I recommend reading the chapters before class.",
    "I would not recommend this class, but that probably has a lot to do with the fact that I struggled with it and didn't enjoy the material. If you think you really like physics, go for it. However, the class will challenge you.",
    "Really don't take it unless you have.",
    "I would definitely recommend this as an intro physics class. It was well taught and the workload was very manageable.",
    "No, take 171. This course is really annoying.",
    "Bearing in mind that YOU MUST KEEP UP WITHTHE WORK, this class was awesome and extraordinarily interesting. It just might've made me a physics major. Some key points: The class is taught to emphasize concepts, which is why I chose it over 171 and 201. Professor Ismail-Beigi really cares about this class and did an excellent job teaching it; ask him questions\/talk to him if you need to. Find people in the class to work with and to keep you motivated, even if you're each working on things separately. This was my favorite class... it was interesting, engaging, and gave me a sense of accomplishment. Honestly, work hard, but enjoy the class!",
    "Interesting material, but difficult if you are new to the material. Take it if you have yo.",
    "If you like physics by itself but think PHYS 201 would be too intense, then this class is for you. You just get straight up physics that doesn't suck up to the needs of meds, which is something that happens all too often in other science classes.",
    "not very difficult but also not very engaging or interesting",
    "A lot harder than Physics 180. Electricity and Magnetism is just intense. I liked Sohrab a lot, although not everyone did, but in my opinion he's an excellent lecturer. He loves clicker questions and online pre-lecture quizzes. Go to review sessions, especially if Ankit is the TA. I learned so much from Ankit.",
    "I would not. Take 171 if you are premed, and take 201 if you are an engineer. It will be more satisfying to take 201, because the math is bastardized in 181- E& M without double and surface integrals is basically useless.",
    "Be prepared to put a lot of work into this. After taking phys 200, this was still a pretty heavy workload course, with constant quizzes and psets. Lectures aren't always so helpful in terms of problem solving, but then again lecture is only one part of this course.",
    "PHYS 181 is a good E&M course for people who have no experience in the subject previously. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on this course.",
    "I would recommend this class, but expect to have to teach yourself quite a bit of the material.",
    "Be prepared to teach yourself physics from the book. There are online quizzes for each lecture, so you have to understand the material. Everything in class then just re-explains what it took you 2 hours to read. Problem sets can take quite a while. You can make your own study sheet for each test.I wouldn't recommend this class. I didn't enjoy it and was only taking it for my major. It is a huge time commitment--the professor assigns work as if physics was the only class you were taking.",
    "This is an overview of E&M, with optics\/relativity\/quantum tacked on to the end. I found that it went very fast, and there was a lot of work every week. (I may have found it slightly more difficult than the average person because it was my first ever Physics class). I think, as Physics professors go, Sohrab is pretty good. I just found the class a tad overwhelming at times.",
    "I would recommend Physics 181 for pre-meds and engineers. Taking the class credit\/D\/fail is a good option.",
    "If you are comfortable with math 201 might be a better choice. This class seemed to deeply cover the conceptual aspect of the material without much focus on the math. So in summary: 201 if you are quite math inclined, 181 if conceptually.",
    "A good course if you want to gain an introduction to electricity and magnetism. A note of caution: not for those who are not willing to put in the hard work. There are pre-lecture quizzes, weekly problem sets, and several readings. There are weekly review sessions and multiple tutors, so if you are willing to give it the time necessary, you'll be fine. Professor Ismail-Beigi is very receptive towards students' input, so if there is any pset that is too long or any material that is too challenging, he will slow down so that people can keep up.",
    "It's a lot of work, but you also get a lot out of it. Try as hard as you can to keep up with the readings (it's a lot), because class makes a lot more sense if you do. Also, it's a good idea to get a good group for checking the psets. Overall, though, I went from someone with no E&M experience whatsoever to having a good general understanding of a lot of concepts.",
    "This is a hard class mainly because of the pace. If you have time to read the book and do example problems along with the extra problems on the pset, you should be fine, but I found myself rushing just to get the concepts needed for each problem set down. Similarly, the online quizes started out as quite stressful because they only had 1 submission. But later with 3 submissions the quizes were stress free and let us actually experiment with answers instead of spending a lot of time checking our answers against the book.",
    "If you want to learn physics I would encourage you to take 181 over 171. There is more work and the exams are harder but it is still rewarding. Online quizzes before each lecture, Pset, 3 chapters of reading a week are all standard fare.",
    "Physics 181 is much more interesting than 180 but also much more difficult, in my opinion. The class had 2 midterms, weekly problem sets, and online quizzes due before each class. Professor Ismail-Beigi really cares about his students andtook our opinions and suggestions seriously. Overall, I came out with a decent understanding and an appreciation of E&M.",
    "I would recommend Physics 181 to a student that has already taken an E&M course in high school as this is the major class composition. Although it is not necessarily assumed that this is the case, it is very difficult to compete in the class without such preparation.",
    "Would not recommend.",
    "I suppose I would. It was a little harder for me but I think it is manageable.",
    "This is a hard course. You probably have to take it. It was clear that numerous measures were taken to provide help to students \u0096 review sessions, study halls, many office hours. Don't read the textbook. I spent many hours reading every word of the textbook, but this is not what you need to do to do well in the course. Skim the textbook by looking at figures, headings, and equations, and understand those, and work through the example problems in the book with pen and paper. Most importantly, DO PRACTICE PROBLEMS!!! I did not do these nearly enough. Do them regularly, and do as many of them as possible. Try to work through them on your own, and go to office hours individually to discuss them with a TA or the professor. Also, it's good to get a study buddy in these types of classes with whom to go over psets and do practice problems. It can be fun - race to get through practice problems! The exams are really hard, and if you want to do well, you simply must do many, many practice problems. Also go to lectures and try to pay attention as much as you can. Talk about problems as much as you can - basically, make your brain go through the process of thinking through solving physics problems as many times as you can.Prof. Ismail-Beigi is a good teacher. He lectures well, and things always felt clearer to me after he lectured about them. I spoke with him once in a study hall, and I really got the sense that he respected my understanding and really wanted to help me get the material. He may seem arrogant or imposing from a distance (I\u0092ve gotten an impatient-sounding and depressing email from him from an innocent question), but I found that on a personal level he is patient and wants to help you understand. In terms of teaching and the material, he is a great professor. But in terms of technical course stuff, maybe better to communicate through TA\u0092s. He seemed to want to be involved, really wanting to improve the course and to help students get a better understanding of the coursework.",
    "If you don't need to take this class, then don't take it. The lectures are long and boring, and the tests are unnecessarily hard. If physics is a requirement for you, though, and you don't have much of a background from high school, then this is probably best course to take. If you have taken AP physics before and have a knack for calculus, then 201 is probably a better choice.",
    "Physics 181 is a great course for someone looking to get a compelling conceptual understanding of how basic phenomena in the world work. Take it over Physics 165 where you will learn nothing and your love of learning will slowly deteriorate. Physics 181 may be a little more challening but definitely one of those decisions in life in which its worth it to take the harder road. There's no need to go higher up to 200 or 260 because this course will give you all the fundamentals you need. It has an excellent instructor and TA and will be exciting to go to lecture everyday. I encourage students to visit Prof. Sohrab's office hours as early as possible. Although he may seem difficult to approach in lecture, in his office he is much more approachable, relaxed, and willing to entertain interesting physics questions to help you gain a better insight. you will probably do much better in exams if you go to office hours. He may even get you so interested in physics that you'll become a physics major.",
    "You're probably talking physics 181 because you have to, so I'll try and give you an ouline of the experience and some recommendations....Physics 181 is honestly really tough, but also definitely manageable. Here's the biggest difference between this semester and 1st semester: electricity and magnetism are plainly SO much more conceptually difficult than mechanics is. You can SEE gravity, and you've BEEN seeing it since you were born. The way charge moves, however, NOBODY sees that. It's just this intangible-ness and also (at least for me) first time exposure to this material that made it all the tougher than 180. Otherwise, it is pretty straightforward expectation-wise: problem set every week, and pre-lecture quizzes (that actually take longer than 180's ones because they are legit question, not basic conceptual ones..) Also, there are 2 midterms and a final. For our class (taught by Sohrab) these were weighted as 10, 20 and 30% with whichever one you did best on weighted the most heavily. This is awesome. Also, you can drop 2 psets and 7 of the pre-lecture quizzes. So as you can see, as far as class format goes, the class really wants you to do well. Still though, at the end of the day, the concepts and the exams (at least this semester) are really really tough. And you'll be spending a lot of your time each week devoted to physics, because you do a chapter a lecture (2 chapters a week).Recommendations: Find yourself some friends and make yourselves a study group! There is just too much stuff and too many concepts for you to attack this class alone. Also, if you can restrain yourself, don't bother taking notes during lecture. It goes just way too fast for you to get everything down anyway, and honestly, the slides are put up online, and honestly, you can find this material anywhere (physics is physics is physics) Instead, try and just listen and understand as much as you can. Also, studying: do as many problems as you can. Re-reading the chapter won't get you very far.",
    "I imagine most people who take this course have to take it for some reason or the other. So there is little by recommendation that one can give. But I do have to say that compared to the other introductory Physics classes, 181 is probably the best in terms of ease of coursework and comprehensiveness",
    "I really struggle with physics (science and math in general), so I found that this course was very difficult, and more so than Physics 180. Profess Ismail-Beigi was great, but I still had difficulty learning the material. Also, I would stress the importance of reading the chapters very thoroughly before lecture. The online quizzes were helpful, but too often, it was more easy to search for the answers to those specific questions rather than engage with the chapters as a whole. Perhaps the most helpful thing that I learned in this course is the importance of practicing problems when preparing for exams, rather than just reviewing material from the book or from lecture. Read the chapters and attend lecture, but do a lot of practice problems! Also, don't start problem sets the night before they're due, because many of them were difficult (and more difficult than in Physics 180)."
