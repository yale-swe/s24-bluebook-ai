Amity, however, is genuinely committed to teaching. Her willingness to field challenging questions dealing with her methods and philosophy of research was a breath of fresh air. Amity was also an excellent discussion facilitator, and clearly valued lively classroom debate. The environment that Amity created made for a fruitful learning experience.",

She spent time and effort to guide my research plan, and has been extremely helpful in terms of connecting with the right people to make my summer research possible. Professor Doolittle is extremely knowledgeable and has given us some great tools which will help us understand the complexity of our world - an essential skill which I wish I knew before I entered the workplace. Also, Professor Doolittle creates an open and non-judgmental environment in class, where even the quietest people feel comfortable sharing their ideas and perspectives. This makes for an interesting and compassionate classroom environment, and we all often left the class both full of questions and understanding for each other. Thank you Professor for a wonderful class.",
