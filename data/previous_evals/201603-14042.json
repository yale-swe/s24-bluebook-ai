    "The Code Analysis project, while useful for understanding codes felt odd as a presentation especially after we had already discussed our findings during our field trip as a group.",
    "Expectations for the group projects were not perfectly clear. This is likely due to the presence of a large number of auditors in the class. Gene wanted the auditors to participate in any meetings outside of class for the group project (the code analysis) but that was never really made clear to the enrolled students. In general, integrating auditors--assuming it happens again--may need a little more planning."

    "Having Scott Conn come into the final class was amazing. If possible it might be nice to have him come in prior to the final to share his insights on where to start with the final project.",
    "Lectures often felt rushed and we fell an entire week behind over the course of the semester, and it felt like we missed out on some important content.",
    "it was difficult for me to understand the entire big picture relationships between aesthetics, codes and requirements. I did not pay much attention to aesthetics in my final assignment, putting more time into making sure the code requirements were met and that the backstage provided all the requirements that it needs to. I still am not clear whether consultants decide the interior design of the final architecture and are hired as architects or consultants. The books recommended did help a lot."
