    "Yes, especially if they're curious about perception and vision. If not, it may be too narrow and it's a fair amount of work if you're not into it.",
    "I would recommend social perception to anyone interested in cognitive science or how the mind works.",
    "A great class on social perception.",
    "Social Perception is interesting class on issues of both cognitive and social psychology with a special emphasis on visual perception. It will teach you to view literature with a critical eye to methodology and logic, which will help you far more than much of the actual content. For that reason, alone, I would highly recommend it for other students."

    "I will be incorporating many of the concepts from this course in my research and dissertation work. Developing a deeper understanding of how to carve the mind up and what counts as perception was extremely useful.",
    "Hard to say ina way that maintains my anonymity, so I'll just say it was helpful and it contributed.",
    "Redundant with my answers before, this class probably help my research more than many, because it pushed me to think critically about the nature of scientific argument."
