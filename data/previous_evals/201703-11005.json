    "I learned how to become a better reader and writer. This class improved my close reading skills, and taught me how to better analyze literature.",
    "I became more confident with discussion in seminars; at the beginning of the semester, I was very hesitant to speak, but as I progressed, I learned to engage more and more with my classmates and prof Yeazell. I also learned to read efficiently and analytically.",
    "I learned to read quickly and develop opinions supported by the text so that I could share them in class.",
    "This class offers a terrific introduction to tragedy and drama in the European canon. From antiquity to present, the syllabus offers a diverse array of plays that help form a strong foundation for future English classes.",
    "I learned how to write a college-level English paper and how to read more efficiently and effectively.",
    "I learned how to properly analyze literary texts in a macro and micro sense, executed my writing skills, and now have a deeper knowledge of classic tragedies.",
    "Reading, writing, analyzing texts and the subtlety of language."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: covers fundamental literature of western canon, great professor, small seminar (8 people), manageable reading load. Given the breadth of the reading, Professor Yeazell kept us focused on the important parts, not letting students linger over insignificant passages and tangents for too long like many of my high school English teachers. Weakness: since this course covered so much (19 plays), we spent too little time on each. We only spent two classes, for example, on Hamlet. Having never read this play before, I did not get much out of our class discussions, and got more out of reading the Sparknotes. Same for many of the other plays we read. The last three plays, which were included to broaden the scope of the course from just western literature to include a modern African author, female author, and African American author, were poor additions. They simply were nowhere as good as the other plays. Taking out those last three plays and spending more time on Shakespeare would've been better.",
    "Strengths: excellent reading list - I was introduced to several great plays that I had never heard about before! Class discussion was also engaging and enjoyable.",
    "Theres a lot of reading, but this was clearly outlined from the beginning.",
    "The class felt at its strongest during class discussion. Unfortunately, not every play was afforded a full-length discussion because of time restraints. However, I learned the most when the class spoke together about the works we had read. One weakness of the class stemmed from the mixed and vague expectations for papers.",
    "If there had been fewer readings on the syllabus, we couldve dug deeper into what we read.",
    "The readings are good but can be a bit too demanding."

   "comments": [
    "If you like literature and want a thought-provoking beginner english class, go for it! The reading amount is fine, the plays largely are magnificent (except for the last few), and Professor Yeazell is incredibly knowledgeable. The classes are tiny (mine had eight students), so be ready to participate in the discussions. Don't let the tragedy part deter you - these plays are amazing, and the second half are \"tragicomedies\" replete with comedy.",
    "If you are at all interested in tragedy, yes",
    "Yes I would recommend - but it is a lot of reading.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to someone who wishes to spend a lot of their time reading for one class.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student, particularly someone wishing to gain a better foundational knowledge of European drama. I greatly enjoyed the reading of this class, even if the paper writing was not as engaging.",
    "Yes, the discussions were fantastic, though they did feel rushed at times.",
    "Yes, but only if they are passionate enough for English and the books\/authors\/themes we discussed."
