    "Not many new things, very much a survey course.",
    "This course offered a helpful and detailed overview of Europe from 1648 to 1945. In addition to describing individual events, the course helps to understand changing themes and continuities over time. For example, social darwinism and New Imperialism contributing to nationalist (often racist) ideologies of the World Wars. The course also encourages individual research through a short final paper -- there is significant leeway to study whatever is of the most interest. Overall, this was a fantastic course, as I feel that I better understand important European trends over the last several centuries. This course, with such fundamentally important material (World Wars, revolutions, etc.), should be taken by all history majors (or, equally, those who want to learn more about relevant history).",
    "I became a more diligent reader, able to discern important information from primary and secondary sources. I was encouraged to follow mindsets, attitudes, and philosophies, in addition to events, groups, and movements. I think I leave a better writer, a more critical thinker, and a more informed citizen. I see the foundations of thought and greatly appreciate the depth of knowledge I have on the origins of European civilization.",
    "A good overall knowledge of European civilization",
    "I learned so much about european history in one class, albeit it was not stressful- material was presented more like a story, and every lecture was connected to both the reading and previous lectures. I also learned more about how historians analyze information, and how to write a good college history paper.",
    "This course significantly improved my detailed knowledge of European history considering I did not have a good background from high school. I learned how to write about history on the collegiate level as well. The books and movies assigned by John Merriman were especially insightful in giving an in depth and nuanced approach to various subjects.",
    "overview of history, how much of european history was connected",
    "I learned a lot in this class, both in lecture and in section. I developed my knowledge of European history and was able to learn about a lot of different countries. I learned how to look for key information in readings to be able to enhance my learning.",
    "European Civilization 1648-1945 was an excellent way for me to learn the major themes and phenomena of European history. I lacked a proper European history background in high school, and I felt like this course and Professor Merriman's instruction of it really helped me understand the major happening of Europe and how they shape the modern world and modern society. I definitely learned how to critically analyze sources and probe historical trends, both of which are skills I'll carry with me for the rest of my Yale career.",
    "I acquired a great deal of knowledge of European history that I did not have before. Because it is a survey course, I had to learn to manage the material so that I was able to identify major trends and be able to talk about them. Being able to read effectively on a timetable was essential, as there were multiple books assigned outside of the text.",
    "This course provided a solid background and overview of Modern European History. For those wishing to learn about the shape of Europe, or for those hoping to review the same, it is helpful and interesting.",
    "I learned so much about European History. The lectures are captivating and there is so much knowledge to take in."

   "comments": [
    "Great overview of modern European history.",
    "The strength of this course is John Merriman. From his captivating lectures to his richly detailed textbook, he brings the course to life. Professor Merriman is one of the best lecturers I have had at Yale. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of history yet makes it exciting and relevant. I really cannot suggest much improvement for this course. It succeeds in providing a comprehensive and expansive overview of the period. My only suggestion would be for section to work in addition to lecture, rather than just covering the material of the book and lecture (perhaps also richer discussion about books read). Overall, a fantastic course that I would highly recommend.",
    "Wonderful course. Strengths: Professor Merriman is unmatched. His humor, vibrancy, interest have made this course one of my favorites at Yale. Subject matter is also generally interesting--even the most dry of topics pique interests because of the Professor and the secondary sources we read. I don't see how it could be improved.",
    "Lecture was interesting and engaging and section was helpful, I just wish there were more visual aids during the lecture to further internalize info.",
    "Lectures were interesting but often felt a bit scattered. Your basic survey of European history. Merriman is really smart and has so much to offer the class. Make sure your TA is good as well because the lectures require a well thought out discussion afterwards.",
    "The lectures were always fantastic and John Merriman is definitely a phenomeal instructor. I felt like my section though wasn't always as engaging and instructional as I would have hoped.",
    "a lot of reading and section could be not the most engaging. Merriman is a great professor though and his stream of conciousness lectures are quite informative",
    "The content of the course itself was very informative and interesting. Instead of paralleling the textbook, Prof. Merriman gave lectures that complemented the readings and provided more insight onto the effect of history on people and their families. I think the course offered everything it said it would. The movies and books were great complements as well.",
    "I learned about a lot of different topics, the class covered a vast time span but it made sense as we went from topic to topic. I definitely deepened my knowledge of European history and was able to learn more about specific events.",
    "The primary strength of this course was Professor Merriman's ability to craft overarching narratives about European history. He has a natural aptitude for describing historical events in an interesting and engaging manner, and each lecture was an absolute treat to attend. The textbook (also written by him) shared the same qualities, and I found it comprehensive and an excellent supplement to the course. That being said, I felt like at times, the course was overly thematic, and I would lose my exact place in the timeline of history.",
    "The sections are great of course and the course has many interesting reads. However, at times there may have been slightly too many reads in too short of a period. The movie screenings were awesome and very engaging, and maybe there could be more movie screenings and discussions on those and balance the number of those with the amount of novels read."

   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "Definitely! Meriman is knowledgable and hilarious. Gives great lectures.",
    "Yes. Merriman is a fascinating man and it is a pleasure hearing his perspective on European history considering his extensive knowledge. He is incredibly funny and his exams are not too difficult.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to another student. This is a course that is designed to be approachable for all majors. For history majors, it is a great opportunity to solidify understanding of this important period in European history. For non-history majors, it is a great class to learn more about the past. Overall, helpful readings (not too much by any means), an enjoyable writing assignment, reasonable assessments, and fantastic lectures -- a class well worth taking.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Merriman is incredible. His humor and ability to interest the entire class makes every period enjoyable. The work is entirely doable and your grade will match it. The term paper is daunting, but the student chooses the topic, so you'll be researching something you enjoy. Highly recommend this course, especially if you did not take AP Euro. Also a good course for non-History majors.",
    "Yes.",
    "Basic overview of European History. Often pretty interesting, but depends on your section for sure.",
    "I have already recommended this course to many of my peers because it was always exciting to attend lecture and the reading material was particularly interesting.",
    "yes if you have little knowledge of european history and want an overview",
    "Yes. The lectures were riveting and the readings\/movies made it so that the course experience was both informative and interesting. Even though I am a STEM major, I thoroughly enjoyed the course.",
    "This course was great. Professor Merriman is incredible.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student if they want to learn of the main events in European history. Professor Merriman offers interesting insight on many of the events and had a passion for the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! If anything, take it for Professor Merriman - he's an absolute gem to listen to and this course has been one of my favorites so far at Yale (but I do really enjoy European history anyway). This course gives you a general overview of European history with some stories from Merriman (both on random historical events and of his own life). The textbook is great, easy to follow, and comprehensive, and my TA (Kevin Lord) was fantastic! I'd suggest taking this course earlier in the Yale career, as some of the themes and ideas pop up later in other courses. The only big assignment is one 8-10 page paper, and the exams (one midterm and one final) are both reasonable and not too hard.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it is a fun and engaging way to have the foundation of European history to be able to take more specific courses.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially to all history majors. Merriman is a great professor and this is a great course to introduce oneself to a history-style lecture."
