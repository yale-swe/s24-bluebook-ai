   "comments": [
    "This coarse gave me a great knowledge on the ancient societies of the Andes.",
    "I gained insight on how archaeologists learn about the past.",
    "This course gave a robust overview of the civilizations of the Andes. A lot of time-depth is explored through numerous sites and cultures, and Dr. Burger's enthusiasm and experience are both on display here. Lots of interesting stories of archaeology, fascinating histories of ancient Andeans, and good discussions to be had.",
    "Cultures are much more diverse in their power relations than I had ever imagined--so many different ways of approaching labor in the construction of public religious in architecture. So many little facts & bits of knowledge that will stay with me my whole life! Spondylus shells! Mitimae!",
    "I learned how to interpret archaeological evidence to create a profile for Andean pre-history.",
    "I mainly gained an understanding of pre-Incan civilizations of the Andes. As most history and anthropology I have encountered focuses predominantly on the Inca, it was very refreshing and interesting to delve deeper into the history of the Andes.",
    "I developed a much better understanding of the culture and history of the Andean region and the people who lived there pre-Inca. I also learned a lot about looking at and evaluating history."

   "comments": [
    "The coarse was very well organized. No weakness has been found.",
    "I really enjoyed how passionate Professor Burger was about the topic, but I was upset at how much weight the exams held. I would have also preferred if we had problem-sets or if section was mandatory to ensure that we kept in check with the work every week. I found it very easy to lose myself in the material.",
    "I think weighting half the course on the final exam is unhelpful as a way of assessing course engagement. Perhaps adding in a couple more of the take home assignments (which I found fun) would be useful. I thought Richard Burger was an engaging, amusing, & insightful lecturer.",
    "The course was a survey of ~10,000 years of occupation. I have a broad understanding of Andean culture and pre-history, which is wonderful.",
    "The textbook and material of the class were amazing. Although the material may seem niche to some, after taking the class I feel that a general history of ancient andes civilization should be widely taught and understood--much like the ancient histories of Europe are. A weakness of the class, which may simply be necessary, is that the cohesion of the course can be difficult to locate at times. There are many holes in the history and knowledge, so the overarching lessons of the course could often feel disjointed.",
    "The lectures of this course were interesting and engaging and I really learned a lot from them. The textbook readings were also extremely useful to furthering the course however some of the external readings were fairly dense and unrelated."

   "comments": [
    "An all around interesting lecture series, would recommend.",
    "This was a very interesting class! Would recommend.",
    "Yes, I will recommend this coarse to another student.",
    "Only take this course if you are really, really interested in the material and ready to do a lot of independent work. Although Professor Burger is passionate about this course, it is really easy to lose yourself in the material and lose motivation to keep up with the readings because there is no system of accountability. There is not a lot of work, but the exams are worth a lot. It was difficult to study for these exams because half the time I realized several days before the exam that I had not understood a topic from weeks ago. This is not the most exciting course, but I am happy to have studied South America prior to Spanish colonization.",
    "For any student interested in South America, history, or archaeology, I would highly recommend this course. A whirlwind survey of the region with a lot of interesting content and a top-notch expert in Dr. Burger.",
    "Yes. There is a bit of an information overload, & some of the numerous Ancient Andean cultures run together after a while, but Richard Burger is very intelligent & very funny & his lectures are far from boring. I took this class for an SO requirement & ended up being surprised by how much I enjoyed sitting in the lectures. The workload is not weighty. It is entirely manageable and not stressful.",
    "A great course in a new subject area, for me. Prof. Burger is an engaging lecturer with some pretty cool stories about his own exploits. An interesting course!",
    "Definitely take this course! It's so important to understand the civilizations of the continent we live on. The material amazed me, and there wasn't a dull moment in the textbook--would honestly read it for fun.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. I really enjoyed it and felt like it gave me an entirely different perspective.",
    "Yes"
