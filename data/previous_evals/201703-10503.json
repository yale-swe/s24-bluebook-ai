   "comments": [
    "I learned some basic evolutionary biology in the beginning of the course that was really reminiscent of AP Bio in that it was mostly memorization. The last half of the course was mostly a large evolutionary history lesson which didn't make much sense in the context of the rest of the bio sequence.",
    "The most valuable insights I gained from this course were a better understanding of the links between living and extinct forms of life, and the processes behind these inferences; and connections between biodiversity, geological history, ecology, and genetics. It cleared up a lot of my lingering confusions surrounding the diversity of life.",
    "I learned a lot about the tree of life, especially vertebrates, green plants, and arthropods.",
    "This module required a very different type of thinking and studying than the first 3 modules. It was a lot more memorization.",
    "General history of life on earth with discussion of important clades, fundamental principles of how evolution happens and how organisms interact with each other in a broad sense.",
    "Honestly did not learn much. This class felt like the worst kind of science class, one based around memorization and tied only loosely to understanding.",
    "Bio 104 helped me understand more about the intricate interactions within an ecosystem as well as the far-reaching effects of evolution. I also learned more than I every thought I would about the tree of life.",
    "I learned a lot about evolutionary biology, which I did not know much about beforehand. I feel like I have a strong grasp of biodiversity throughout time.",
    "You pretty much just memorize a bunch of random facts about animals and evolution of life.",
    "This course focuses on major events in the evolution of animals (not so much on plants), and topics in microevolution. Everyday you pretty much just look at some phylogenetic trees, and the majority of the course is focused on random and oddly specific lineages divergence times. This module is different than the other three; you don' really develop any critical thinking skills or familiarity with experimental techniques, its more a focus on rote memorization, like knowing exactly how many turtle species there are or the exact year we think plants started flowering.",
    "An introduction to Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Starts off pretty tame (from what I've heard from people who took it, pretty close to AP Bio) but gets a lot real quick.",
    "This was a great introduction to my major (E&EB) and I really, really enjoyed the course material. It was hands-down the best module of the intro bio sequence. I learned how to read trees, about the history of life on Earth, and about evolutionary processes in general.",
    "As the title suggests, you learn all about evolutionary biology. The course requires a lot of memorization of different time periods and phylogenys so it is actually pretty difficult.",
    "very broad look into evolutionary history of plants and animals.",
    "so much about evolution and phylogeny and how many species there are of a certain animal, etc -- very pedantic",
    "I learned the basics of ecology and evolutionary biology, and how to read a phylogeny.",
    "I learned about the relationship between ecology and evolutionary biology through the study of evolutionary history, fossils, and phylogenetic trees.",
    "I got much better at analyzing biology on a macro level as opposed to viewing it as a sub cellular subject. I never realized how important the historical aspect of biology was and how we have arrived where we are so that has been fascinating.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of life and origins of biology. This was a very new experience for my understanding of biology.",
    "A LOT about evolutionary biology!",
    "Bio104 gives you a solid introduction of Ecology, and all the fields it encompasses. The course has a lot of scope. It also improves your science writing skills.",
    "I learned all about the world of evolution in this class. Super interesting about how different species evolve and coexist with one another.",
    "This course helps you apply everything you learned in 101-103 to organismal and ecological levels. This made the class significantly more interesting than the previous modules for me.",
    "I learned about Darwin's theory of natural selection, major natural events in the history of Earth, and the phylogenetic trees of many important clades. I gained insight into the building of phylogenetic trees using molecular and genetic data, and also the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts.",
    "This class helped me build the study skills needed to succeed in a lecture set up and to improve my ability to think critically and write clear, concise answers.",
    "I learned how to understand phylogeny and evolutionary biology. I learned about the history of life and earth and learned about how different processes causes the results today.",
    "learned about how animal lineages develop and how this information is useful for a wide variety of research",
    "I learned about the adaptation of many different species!",
    "Absolutely nothing. Pure regurgitation. Awful class. Would not recommend",
    "I learned how to memorize how different plants grow",
    "I learned a lot about phylogenies and major themes in evolution. I liked how the major themes of the course were indeed emphasized and taught well.",
    "I learned how to write a review of different research articles to defend a hypothesis. I learned about ecology and evolution",
    "I learned a lot about different species.",
    "You don't really learn any new skills taking this course. It was a lot of memorization.",
    "I learned about phylogeny, and the general concepts in evolution. I also learned a lot about how life started and the mechanisms behind speciation.",
    "There's a widespread misconception that BIOL 104 is the easiest--the \"guttiest\"--course in the BIOL 101-104 sequence (People who took it in the spring often said so). However, that statement could not be more incorrect! I got so much out of BIOL 104, and it was a much challenging course than I expected. Learning to read phylogenetic trees correctly was quite intellectually challenging and rewarding. Overall, I think BIOL 104 was a great culmination of the intro BIOL sequence that pulled info from the previous three courses. It helped me review some concepts from the earlier courses, and put them together to make sense in the context of the \"big picture.\"",
    "I learned a lot of very interesting things about how evolution was determined and how we've generated our historical time scale and how everything on this planet fits into it.",
    "Memorization and detailed note taking and outlining skills",
    "I learned a lot about concepts related to ecology and evolutionary biology, and I also learned how to think about the tree of life and the relations of living organisms. Additionally, I got practice with inferring relationships from data.",
    "Ecology and evolution",
    "This was generally an interesting course that on one hand gave good foundations to the field of evolutionary biology but on the other hand was often too specific and overwhelming on content",
    "I learned how to better research and discuss scientific topics as well as learning a fair deal about ecology as well!",
    "This class was greatly taught! It really changed the way I think about biology as a whole through giving us a firm evolutionary perspective.",
    "I learned some information about how ecology and evolution interact and impact each other.",
    "a basic understanding of phylogenetics and the causes and importance of evolution.",
    "Ecology and Evolutionary Biology was by far the best module in the intro bio sequence. The material caused students to think in a different way about life on a larger scale, instead of getting caught up on little details like in BIOL 101-103. One of the main insights I gained from BIOL 104 is that there's no way to figure out the \"right answer\" of the tree of life, and there's only so far we can postulate with the fossils and databases we have. But just because there is no phylogeny that we can say is 100% right (because of convergent evolution, and the bias of the fossil record, and tons of other reasons) it is interesting to make critical decisions about inferring phylogeny, especially when the most parsimonious tree isn't correct. We learned a lot of different theories, but a lot of the theories have evidence against them as well, so we had to learn how to draw intelligent conclusions from the evidence we have. I think a lot of students struggled to see the importance of learning the history of life and why we should care, which is ironic because without a fundamental understanding of evolution and natural selection we would not understand why humans would be here.",
    "I have developed an understanding of evolution, the origins of life, and the pathways that different species have taken to arrive at their current forms.",
    "I gained a strong base knowledge in the principles and history of evolution. To a far lesser but still relevant extent, I also learned about ecology. Of all the concepts in this course, those in the second half were the ones that I had least familiarity with (for the most part) but that I found most interesting, once I understood them. I feel like I've developed some good intuition about evolution, as well as learned some neat facts about some species.",
    "I learned about the mechanisms of evolution and lots of interesting facts about the main orders of organisms.",
    "I learned about many fundamental concepts in ecology and evolutionary biology, including phylogenetic analyses, the tree of life, the diversity of life, speciation, adaptive radiation, general patters of diversification, kin selection, and molecular clocks.",
    "General ecology and phylogeny. It's what you expect out of an introductory course.",
    "I did learn some things about Evolutionary Bio, but it was more a collection of random facts than concepts.",
    "I gained a better knowledge of ecology and evolutionary biology. I learned lots of interesting things, and a lot of the information was really cool and new.",
    "This course did teach me to think, I suppose, more along the lines of evolutionary biology. That is, using inference rather than strict eliminative deduction.",
    "I learned a lot about how people can construct what appear to be absolute phylogenetic trees given uncertain data. I also liked learning how all organisms are related",
    "Learned more about phylogenetic trees and a lot about the history of life on earth. My ability to use tree thinking skills and think about groups of organisms nested within other groups improved a lot.",
    "I learned about evolution and ecology",
    "A basic understanding of ecology and evolutionary biology. I had never taken a class in this subject before and it was very eye opening.",
    "As the final portion of the biology sequence, this course confined my learning in basic biology materials with a focus on evolution and ecology (less so). It was also a lesson in test taking for me.",
    "I learned a lot about big-picture biology, the story of biology, and the visible world around me."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The tests weren't very fair - did not reflect level of student understanding.",
    "104 was by far my favorite of the intro bio modules, and any weaknesses are artifacts of the intro bio module at large -- that is to say, arbitrary grading that is not constant across graders or TAs, and the feeling of rushing through material that's unconnected to the other sequences. Professor Near was an excellent lecturer; he was incredibly engaging, funny, and in touch with how to get students to not only learn these subjects, but develop a passion for them. He got me genuinely excited about these topics, and made an excellent case for their relevance. The assignments and exams were also a bit clearer and less confusing than in the other modules -- I'd say it was the least stressful intro bio module. (As a side note, I suspect people are going to complain about rote memorization. There really is not that much more of it than in other bio classes, they're just more up front about it, and there's less of a guise of \"this will make you think like a real scientist.\" E&EB is not just memorization! There was plenty of conceptual learning.)",
    "I had no problem with the course other than I had to take it as an added prereq to my major, after I completed my major. This proved to be really annoying, because this course was graded with respect to itself only: if I gave any other information or information worded differently than presented in class on the midterm, for example, I got docked for it, even if the answers were technically right. Which threw me into an existential crisis thinking that every ecology thing I had previously learned at Yale was wrong. Pro tip: it wasn't, this course just expects you to learn in one way and one way only, which I think is extremely detrimental to those of us who don't learn in that way.",
    "Strengths - Prof Near is awesome, he makes lecture entertaining as well as informative. Having writing assignments and a PSET instead of weekly quizzes was also awesome. Weaknesses - There was so much information introduced, it was hard to learn or know what to learn",
    "I think study guides could be really helpful. I liked the sections.",
    "Prof. Near is really enthusiastic in a way that doesn't really come across in the other bio modules, which is cool to see. However, the slides were a little unorganized and the point of certain discussions in lectures wasn't always completely clear. Midterm grading also seemed a little nitpicky, and appeared to focus on whether someone said exactly what was written in a given rubric instead of whether the student actually understood the material. I still think the course is pretty good, and think it'll definitely grow as Near teaches it a few more times. I thought the paper was dumb at first, but ultimately learned a lot by working through it.",
    "This course covers an impressive amount of content in just half a semester, and has provided me with a ground level understanding of ecology and evolution. That being said, the amount of information covered in this module may have been too much. I feel as though going into the final exam, I was mainly preoccupied with memorizing mass quantities of information rather than being able to reflect on my deeper understanding of the broader concepts at play in EEB. This made the final quite challenging, as many of the questions were highly concept-based, and I mainly knew things like the definition of a depauperon and how many species of ray-finned fishes exist (32,000, apparently). It was a pretty awful feeling to have studied so hard to know everything that was covered in the powerpoint slides and still be lost during the exam. I feel as though this course could be improved by scaling back what is covered, as well as working to demonstrate the importance of these concepts in the context of other regions of biology - this would make the course much more interesting to people like me, who have a greater understanding of molecular\/developmental biology (these connections were somewhat introduced near the very end of the course and I wish more examples had been given throughout!) and may not take another EEB course in the future. Overall, this was an exhausting end to my experiences in the bio sequences.",
    "I don't think the intro bio sequence should exist. I didn't understand what I was supposed to get out of this course, which is sad because I was very much looking forward to learning about ecology and evolution as that is my declared major. I've taken intro EEB courses without having taken this class\/concurrently with it, and I could not point to one place where I needed anything in BIOL 104 for these EEB classes.",
    "I think the strength of the bio sequence is that each teacher can speak to his or her expertise for each section. However, I think this is also the weakness of the course. I leave the sequence feeling like I have a lot of disparate knowledge about biology, particular facts about particular niches of the field, but struggling to have a grasp on the bigger picture or larger story.",
    "Overall I thought it was really great. My only criticism is that the second half felt like a lot of memorization and less concepts, and I'm worried I will quickly forget what I learned.",
    "Strengths: the course doesn't have the dreaded quizzes that the other three had. Also, the content isn't that hard to understand. Weaknesses: This course is VERY boring. You basically just listen to Near talk for 75 minutes about the history of life, in a very linear, obscure, and dry way. It is by far the least engaging and useful of the four modules. The grading is also a weakness. The entire letter grade is based on your relative performance on the midterm and final, nothing else. This does make it a stressful ride to the end.",
    "Just a lot of info; unclear which parts were important and which parts weren't. Even the bolded\/red parts of the slides seems arbitrary at times and I led to lots of confusion.",
    "Like all the intro bio modules, this course suffered because of the large class size and the general disinterest of many of my fellow students, especially those who care more about molecular biology and were \"forced\" to take this module. However, I would say that generally the course was well organized to deal with this -- sections were engaging, especially the Peabody tour.",
    "I liked that the course didn't have weekly quizzes but the writing assignments are pretty difficult.",
    "strengths: demands student attention and hard work, great support for students who need extra help weakness: cover so many things in depth for a half credit course, some times lectures are disorganized jumping for subject to subject and easy to get lost",
    "It's just a really large lecture, and I don't know that any lecture that big can ever be an enjoyable class. The readings for section are obviously related to the material we learn in class, but it might be more helpful to use section as a review of what we did that week instead of using it to talk about a paper that won't be mentioned on the midterm or final. We've gotten enough practice reading scientific papers from the other sequences!",
    "This course was well organized, but I sometimes felt a little scattered and overwhelmed in lecture at the face of the quantity of material and terminology. The lack of study guides accompanying the lecture was also jarring, as those were very helpful in synthesizing the information in BIO 101-103.",
    "fantastic lecture, section was fairly basic and could have benefitted from a higher level of discussion",
    "Strengths: The course was very organized and the professors are very wiling to answer questions and clarify course material. Professor Near's lecture style was also very engaging. Weakness: Sometimes Professor Near would speak a little too quickly during lecture to follow along.",
    "I thought that the writing assignments were cool but I feel like they should have been weighted equally, as I spent honestly more time on the first one than I did on the second one.",
    "Strengths: Professor Near and Lin were both very committed to making sure we understood the information.",
    "Professor Near did a wonderful job of explaining things, but sometimes it felt a little bit like reading off the slides and not so much delving into the actual concepts until the review sessions where everyone had in depth questions. I LOVE that we went to the peabody\/marsh gardens -- it was a really nice way to engage with the material outside the lecture hall!",
    "The lectures were interesting, and the psets and homework assignments really contributed to your understanding. As did section discussions, and the papers we read in them. One thing though is that lecture often felt disorganised and went way too quickly. The professor is an interesting lecturer, but it was often difficult to understand what the important concepts were. Also, the textbooks readings and lecture content was sometimes not in sync.",
    "This class is super interesting and Professor Near does a great job of making the class very engaging. The one weakness of this course is that the weekly quizzes were not available, so it is harder to stay updated on the material.",
    "I like the midterm\/final format of this class vs the weekly quiz format of 101 and 103. I wish we had homework that was more similar to the tests so we could practice more.",
    "The strengths of this course are its weekly discussion sections that discuss peer-reviewed papers or textbook readings, as well as the lecture slides that provided all the information needed on the exams. One weakness of this class is that the lectures felt extremely rushed and difficult to follow in the first half of the class. The second half of the class had very few connections with the first half, and this lack of cohesion made the class feel disjointed.",
    "The strengths of the course are that it is rather straightforward and clear in terms of what you need to learn, and there are many outlets to get help if needed, whether it be through Enrichment, TAs, Piazza, or asking Professor Near questions directly. I think that one weakness is that it is easy to lose many points for not using the exact wording or leaving out one point in answering a question.",
    "The strengths of the class is that the assessments are fair but the lectures could be better. In lecture, I felt like I didn't learn anything that I couldn't have learned by only looking at the slides.",
    "the course material had good depth; students should be given a blue book to fill in responses because there is not enough space on exams to write responses",
    "Professor Near and Professor Lin are both very caring Professors. They really want you to learn the material and succeed. However, as someone who really enjoyed the other parts of the intro bio sequence, this was my least favorite module. Although the other modules required a lot of memorization, it seemed as though we were memorizing for a greater purpose of application. On the exams\/quizzes, we would be asked to apply these memorized concepts in a problem solving way. This course asked for a lot of memorization without context. Sometimes it was as insignificant as a name of a species that was mentioned one time without any other interesting information, but was still highlighted in \"blue\" on the slides. (blue signified an important term) I would invite the professors to take a look at the type of examination they gave. If I had simply memorized all of the slides, I would have gotten a 100%. I think there was one question that required any thinking or deductive reasoning. I don't think that's what biology is about! I wish the exams had asked us to apply concepts, the way the other modules had. I also think the course tried to cover too much. The things we went into depth in were fascinating-- plant evolution, for example. However, I feel as though other things were just skimmed over and we didn't really learn anything about them. We just learned meaningless names. I think the course would be better if it tried to cover less material more in depth. That might help with creating applied exams as well!",
    "This course barely tests any concepts as the exams are pure regurgitation based, courses like these discourage student learning and promotes nothing but the lack of creative thinking.",
    "This class had way too much content that was just scattered through weeks of lecture. It was difficult to connect any of the concepts and near the end, it just seemed like the class was simply about memorizing random facts. Also the psets were unhelpful in my understanding of the lecture material and had very little instruction. There was also no instruction on exams, so it was very difficult to study for them. I did not know what information was more important than others and that became very frustrating as there was just too much to memorize.",
    "Professor Near is a definite asset to the course. He is a great lecturer and provides real clarity and explanation when you ask him questions. The problem sets were actually conducive to student learning; after I completed each, I truly felt I had engaged with the material in a way that deepened my understanding rather than being hard for no reason. The tests were challenging but fair. Of all the bio modules, I would say this was the best (even though I like evolution and ecology the least in terms of mere subject matter).",
    "Ver clear structure to the class. Instructors helpful and Piazza was great.",
    "I think the content is just not too interesting. I loved Prof. Near's energy throughout the course, but I really couldn't get excited about the material.",
    "There aren't any quizzes or insightful psets, so it is difficult to prepare for the exams. There is also a ton of information from the lectures and it is never clear what is necessary to know for the exams and what isn't.",
    "It was presented in a very organized way, however especially at the start it took me a while to get used to and internalize the terms being used in the course. I think it would've been helpful to explain the terminology more thoroughly for the first few lectures.",
    "Professor Near was simply amazing at presenting the information in an interesting way. His passion for E&EB simply shined through all the time. Also, I really enjoyed the Peabody trip. I really enjoyed seeing evolutionary biology in action, but my favorite part of the trip was seeing how passionate and excited the people at the Peabody were. It was very inspiring to see those people absolutely love their jobs. Prior to the exams, I was quite overwhelmed by the amount of information I had to know. It is not always clear what examples and concepts we have to know and in how much detail, although Prof. Near tries to help us by highlighting important examples\/concepts in blue.",
    "This course was well-organized and all the different parts of it wove together well. Professor Near was an engaging professor and tried really hard to be funny and relatable. This was refreshing but also a tad bit overdone at times. Otherwise, this was my favorite course in the bio sequence.",
    "The course is a flood of facts that simply need to be memorized, not really applicable elsewhere.",
    "The course was well-taught, and it was interesting to learn about these concepts. It did feel like the peer tutors were maybe a little less comfortable with some of the concepts, though they were well-versed in Bio 103 concepts (and were definitely still helpful). Maybe it would make sense to split up the semester's peer tutors, such that students could be tutors for 103 and\/or 104 as opposed to automatically becoming tutors for both.",
    "Good content but lectures were hard to follow and PowerPoints contained not a lot of explaining, preparation for the class depends much on the student",
    "By far, the biggest weakness of this course is that students have no idea what will be emphasized on the midterm and the final. I found myself studying unrelated details and emphasizing unimportant concepts for the midterm simply because I did not know what we were going to be tested on. This is made even worse by the fact that the midterm and final count for the majority of the grade. If that continues to be the case, then general guidelines (or perhaps a practice exam) should be distributed before the exam. On the other hand, this course is very good about keeping students updated with announcements, important information, etc. (I wish my other courses were run in a similar way). Furthermore, it was very well organized, something that I truly appreciated. And by far the biggest strength of this course was Professor Near as he made the material much more engaging and fascinating.",
    "The professor was great, but at times, the subject was dull.",
    "There was a lot of rote memorization, and it was hard to see the meaning behind it.",
    "I really enjoyed Prof. Near's enthusiasm for the subject taught. I would say that this was the one module of the Biology track that I didn't almost fall asleep at every turn! The homework assignments were also the most do-able and enjoyable of the whole track (especially compared to 102 and 103). Unfortunately, the lecture slides provided by Near were frustratingly vague and made studying for the midterm and final excruciatingly painful.",
    "Strength: dedication of TAs and Professors to ensure that students do well Weakness: Massive Class Size",
    "The course was greatly taught and all the material was relevant and fit in nicely but at times it was too fast paced and i struggled to keep up.",
    "Strengths are that it was relatively well organized, the assignments were simple and made sense, and the tests were straightforward and lined up well with lectures. Weakesses include that the instructor generally prioritized sounding eloquent over being clear. Near obviously knows a lot about evolutionary bio, but it does not help students to learn for his sentences to be so convoluted, particularly when they include biology terms that are not explained ahead of time. I have heard him speak outside of class about how jargon is a barrier to many people learning biology and emphasize the importance that instructors stay aware of that; I now find this ironic given that this was the most heavily jargon-y class I have taken.",
    "Amazing first half included really engaging material on evolution and ecological interactions. I also thought that the writing assignments were a fantastic way to engage in a topic of interest without being overwhelming or unreasonable (i.e. not an absurd time sync like the writing assignment in BIOL103). One weakness is the testing method in the second half of the term, which pretty much required you to memorize the phylogenetic relationships of every major group of organisms, which seemed like a colossal waste of time.",
    "The strength of this course is that it challenged students to see the bigger picture through specific examples from ecology and evolutionary biology. The homework assignments for this class were not bad at all. The problem sets were pretty short and direct. The papers were a million times better than the scientific research proposal we had to do about a gene in BIOL 103. The final paper was especially great in allowing students to formulate their own macroevolutionary hypothesis on a clade of interest, and it made me pull together things I had learned from the beginning of the course and things I had learned in the very last lectures. I liked that BIOL 104 did not have weekly in class quizzes, which caused me a lot of stress and anxiety in BIOL 101 and 104. The midterm\/final format is much better for really understanding the material. Professor Near was great about clearly explaining the theories presented. Piazza was also a really great tool for specifically BIOL 104 because the lecture slides typically don't have many words on them, so when studying it's nice to read long explanations of topics that many students found confusing. The instructors were great with responding to questions in a timely manner. The weakness of the course was that often students didn't read the paper before section, so the discussion in section was a little bit dry. I'm not sure how this could be improved, especially because I found the papers assigned really interesting.",
    "The strength was definitely the lecturer and my TA (Ian Gilman). Both were very strong and presented the material in a straightforward and interesting way, making analogies that I found helpful in understanding the course as a whole. The biggest weakness of the course was that it was very difficult to study for the exams. Often times, the material was presented in a very unclear way on the slides and it was difficult to know what to study for\/how to study for it.",
    "Strengths: (1) Homework assignments were cool and interesting. (2) Logically structured. (3) History of life portion was interesting, though more emphasis could have been placed on larger concepts (otherwise it just seems like a jumble of cool but random facts). Weaknesses: (1) Oddly memorization-heavy for an introductory course. (2) Concepts should be emphasized a bit more explicitly. Strength\/Weakness: Course was very well-organized, but the organization was not very clear at first; maybe explicitly saying why things are being stated, and why they are being discussed in the sequences in which they are discussed, may help with this (especially in the second half of the course). This could also help alleviate confusion and increase appreciation for what students are learning.",
    "This was overall a very well developed course with lots of varied assignments.",
    "A strength of this course is that it surveys many important concepts in ecology and evolutionary biology, such that students can see if any topic within the field may be one that they want to pursue further. A weakness of the course (in my opinion) was the amount of time spent on patterns of diversification of different organisms. For example, we spent about three or four lectures going through evolutionary trees for fungi, plants, animals, etc. I didn't enjoy this section of the class as much, because I found the material a bit dry, but it may be much more interesting for those with a passion for the subject.",
    "The professors were very capable, and the class was organized, but I think that fundamentally they chose to teach and explain the wrong things. It was all lists to be memorized, and though I understand that this type of biology requires memorization, it felt very high school.",
    "The strengths are that the professor was really involved and passionate about the course. The TAs were really kind, the peer tutors were very helpful, and Professor Lin was amazing and super helpful!",
    "This course really comes out of the blue after the last three parts of the introductory bio sequence, which, I must say, I was rather fond of in comparison. There is much more memorization- to the degree to which you have to end up using a large portion of your energy for the class (and yes, we are human and do have only finite energy to put into a half credit course) to memorize various facts. This is really a shame seeing as how it is now only several days after the final exam, and I have already forgotten the vast majority of those facts and thus feel that I have much less to show for this course than I would like to. Perhaps this is an intrinsic challenge of learning ecology and evolutionary biology? Perhaps it is a subject which is so frustratingly descriptive that you really cannot gain anything by taking an introductory course unless you intend to follow through by majoring in EEB. In any case, this class was a disproportionate source of stress compared to my other courses, and I would say that it was a net negative. It really does pain me to say that, given that I am really a strong believer in the principles of the introductory biology sequence as a whole. Bio 104, with it density and almost absurd ambition for a half semester course, was the only time in the sequence in which I felt myself resenting the experimental nature of this sequence. It is possible this course, in teaching ecology and evolutionary biology, really cannot be improved. I am not an evolutionary biologist, I do not know if the unpleasantness of this course is an inevitable result of the field. I only worry that, should this not be the case, it would discourage otherwise interested students from pursuing a gratifying major in EEB.",
    "I feel that the exams and the midterm were, with few exceptions, very memorization heavy. I liked the writing assignment to have had access along the way to some assignments to make sure I actually understood what I had learned in class.",
    "This course focused way too much on memorization. I am an E&EB major, and I do this stuff for fun: I love memorizing taxonomic groups, life history characteristics, and dates. So I hope you'll listen to me when I say that memorization was too much of a focus here. I understand that a good knowledge of the diversity of life is a must for anyone studying biology, but there's no avoiding the fact that a good knowledge of biodiversity has to come through repeated exposure to the material over the course of a variety of scientific engagements. The amount of names and taxa placements that I had to memorize for this course that I'm never going to need to know again was way too high. The fact that the amount of memorizing in this course made *me* not enjoy the subject (and this subject is my passion already) makes me very sad, because I think there are probably a lot of students who would be interested in E&EB who now think that they don't like it because they didn't like this course. We need to increase people's enthusiasm for science, not decrease it. That may sound harsh, but I don't mean to say that this course was a disaster. The parts that did not focus on memorization were very well done. The papers that we read for section felt well-chosen: they were never unnecessarily long, they were always interesting, and the discussions in section were very topical and helpful for understanding. This is a great example of a way to improve the course: A greater focus on specific scientific studies and their findings would provide memory \"hooks\" on which to hang knowledge about the relative placements of taxa in the tree of life. More discussion, more papers, more specific examples, and less memorization would make this course a real gem. Oh, and the peabody\/marsh gardens tours are a WONDERFUL addition. I work at the Peabody and spend a lot of time there, but I had never been to Marsh before, and I'm so glad this course nudged me to go! I don't know of anyone who disliked this assignment, and a lot of people got introduced to a whole new aspect of campus. Keep it up!",
    "I honestly thought the tests were not accurate in judging if a student was learning in the test.",
    "Strengths: exams were very fair-- they basically required rote memorization of definitions and a bit of reasonable critical thinking, so if you put in the time to study you'll succeed, Prof Near's lecture slides are very clear and helpful to study from Weakness: sometimes lectures were confusing because Prof Near doesn't explain things clearly sometimes, but he usually clearly articulates his points on his slides so you can figure things out or google it",
    "I liked the lectures, however I didn't like how there was not any material to prep you for the exams.",
    "Strengths include how structured the class is. Once again, Lin did an exceptional job making sure everything was organized. I loved loved loved the sections were we got to go to the Peabody or the Marsh Botanical Gardens. Props to Lin and Near for allowing us that amazing opportunity! I really saw its relevance. I also LOVE Piazza. It was a wonderful study tool and the TF's, Professor Lin, and Professor Near were so on top of answering all of our questions. I was not a big fan of section this time around. I found that the articles we read did not relate to class very well, and I would've preferred spending that time to go more in depth about the course content. In lecture, I wish there was more transparency in how much we needed to memorize about the the phylogenetic tree (e.g. species names and how many species there were in each clade). It would've made this course less stressful.",
    "This module requires a lot of memorization, which means the studying should probably be spread out as you learn new things in lecture. The lecture slides also tend to have a lot of detail on them that is fair game for exams, which makes this module less like the others in that it seems to focus less on overarching concepts and more on specific details. It also seems like the questions student ask have very open-ended answers, which can be confusing if there are specific answers that the instructors are looking for. I would suggest better practice questions being provided before the exams so students know the kind of short answer questions they will be expected to answer.",
    "One big weakness of the course was that we didn't have weekly quizzes as in the other biology modules. Although this sounded great and less stressful at the beginning, it only made it harder to study for the exams. If you are confused about a lecture or a certain concept, there is no incentive to make sure you understand it for the quiz each week. It became very easy to go on weeks and weeks without fully grasping concepts and making it really hard and time consuming when studying for the two big exams.",
    "The course was strong in providing an engaging lecture to learn the basics of evolutionary biology. However, as a course required by many pre-medical majors, it did little to cater to this large portion of students taking the lecture. How valuable the content was is therefore questionable, as most tested subjects were a matter of how well a student could memorize 50+ powerpoint slides per lecture, rather than their comprehension of major themes and applications beyond the course's teachings.",
    "I liked lectures and found them very engaging. I found the exams challenging due to my misunderstanding of the professors idea of a broad overview, but my struggle really made me push myself to study more effectively.",
    "The module in general is very well organized and clearly outlines the expectations. However, I found that Bio 104 was flooded with a lot of information and should be condensed."

    "Not unless you have to.",
    "Unless your E&EB or really into the environment, the only reason people take this course is because it's part of the mandatory bio sequence.",
    "The only intro bio module I actually would recommend to people for more than \"you have to take it because you're a bio major.\" It was by far the most tolerable module: good lectures, sensical assignments and exams, engaging material, and a stronger sense of what was actually expected of us. Not too stressful or challenging, and I always enjoyed coming to class. It's the light at the end of the tunnel of the intro sequence.",
    "I would not recommend it to another student unless it is required for their major. The materials are incredibly dry and you learn random, disconnected facts in lectures. The assigned readings were not even up-to-date and the sheer amount of terminologies that needed to be memorized seems insurmountable.",
    "I have the impression that literally no one takes this sequence unless they have to, so...",
    "This module required a very different type of thinking and studying than the first 3 modules. It was a lot more memorization. I found the lectures about ecology and plants a little boring but the stuff about evolution was super cool.",
    "As with the other bio modules, whether you'll like it or not is pretty dependent on personal preferences, but I'd probably recommend it. The content didn't really all come together until I was studying for the final, and I struggled throughout the semester, but seeing it connect towards the end was pretty cool. Prof Near is also a great lecturer. Just be prepared to think differently and memorize a lot more than in 101-103. The macroevolution paper is also a huge drag if you're not invested in it, so pick a clade that really interests you and start early. It's not long at all, but finding sources and piecing them together was a lot more difficult than I anticipated.",
    "If you're a STEM major, you have to take it. Sorry. Just cram for the midterm and final, there's not really a way to study for the arbitrary and random exams besides just memorizing random facts. It's a shame, because Prof. Near is an intelligent and engaging lecturer, so you'd wish they'd give him good material to talk about, but no.",
    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend the bio sequence to someone unless they needed to take it. It fulfills its function as an intro bio course, but I found the course too segmented and directionless.",
    "A solid review of E&EB, with some interesting perspectives on modern",
    "I absolutely would! This topic is not covered by my major but I find it very interesting and an important aspect of biology! It has more memorization than other modules but conceptually it is easier.",
    "Most people have to take the course, so doesn't really matter.",
    "Most students don't have a choice, they have to take this course. If you are reading this and fall into this category, here are my 2 cents: although this is by far the most boring and disengaging of the four, I wouldn't say it is the worst. It might be the hardest to get an A in because of the way the grading works (entirely assigned based on your relative performance on two exams), but the content at least is straightforward. This module is much more memorization based, which is really annoying. I didn't really see the point in memorizing so many irrelevant details, like the number of species of marsupials or the 10000 lineages of extinct lizards that lead to the first mammal. It is at least the least work of the four.",
    "I'm assuming you have to; otherwise don't bother.",
    "If you like animals and evolution (and are okay with memorizing dates and geological eras and phylogenetic relationships) -- yes.",
    "This class requires alot of work so I would only really suggest it if you need a bio credit for a pre-req.",
    "only if they need it for a major or premed.",
    "Yes, please take this course! Professor Near is great and really cares about his students. Despite teaching a large lecture class, Prof. Near seems to take the time to learn the names of a large portion of the class and is very accessible outside of class as well. Lectures don't seem overwhelming during class, but there is actually a LOT of material covered in each one! Don't let the midterm sneak up on you. The second writing assignment is also worth a huge portion of your grade, so be careful with it.",
    "No.",
    "This course was interesting, and if you are starting the Bio sequence, I would recommend sticking around to check it out.",
    "yes, definitely",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because this course provided a different way of looking at biology.",
    "Only if required",
    "To anybody that has an interest in Biology or ecology, this course is probably required but honestly very interesting and far different from the 101-103 modules. I would recommend it",
    "This was my favorite module of the Bio 101-4 sequence. The material was interesting and helped build a strong understanding of the basics of evolution--valuable knowledge for both future biology course and life!",
    "Yes; this course is very interesting if you want to learn more about the history of biology.",
    "Yes! I mean you have to take it for the intro bio sequence, but it's a really nice overview of evol. bio\/ecology too!",
    "Yes. Bio104 is a nice close to the Bio intro sequence. It's very different from the first three modules, and it can be frustrating at first, but the content is very interesting and the professor and TFs are all enthusiastic and excited to help you learn.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another Yale student. Super interesting. I would recommend to both science and non-science majors.",
    "This class is so much more interesting than 101-103. The midterm\/final format is a blessing but don't get complacent. Take esp if Prof. Near is teaching... he's dope.",
    "Take it if you have to. Prof. Near rushes through many of his lectures, which takes away the value of much of what is taught in the course, although the class material can be very interesting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course! I thought the material was very interesting and the course was well-taught and rather fair.",
    "Sure, I would recommend this course. It teaches you the basic knowledge of evolutionary biology and ecology.",
    "yes because the material was interesting and comprehensive yet understandable",
    "Unfortunately, this was my least favorite module of the bio sequence. I would not recommend it.",
    "Please do not take this course unless you need it for your major or you need it for premed. If you're looking for a science credit, save yourself the hassle.",
    "I would recommend it only if it is a prereq.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who wants to learn about ecology. Very informative.",
    "No, but it is a requirement for a lot of different trajectories. I think it's important to have some background in evolution and I'm glad I took the course, but it really is just not that interesting (personal opinion).",
    "I would only recommend this course if you have to take it to finish the sequence.",
    "It is in the biology sequence, so most students end up taking it because they have to. However, that being said, it is a good course and a good introduction to evolution. If you don't know whether you might be interested in evolutionary biology it definitely got me interested, so give it a try.",
    "If you have made it this far, then you would be wasting a great opportunity if you don't take this class. It's a great culmination of the BIOL sequence; the concepts you learn are mind-provoking, the examples are interesting, and the people who run the course are simply amazing and dedicated. Definitely take it!",
    "While it was an interesting course relative to the rest of the bio sequence, I wouldn't recommend this course by itself. If you have to take it, yes. Otherwise, there are other similar classes at Yale if you're interested in ecology. The Yale Peabody is also interesting to visit (which we did!) if you'd like to learn more.",
    "Unless, it is a prerequisite, or youre really interested in learning how the different species evolved, no I would not recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining a baseline understanding of ecology and evolutionary biology. For students who have only studied more molecular parts of biology, it's really interesting to see how bigger-picture biological concepts work. It also requires a different form of thinking and reasoning, which is beneficial to practice.",
    "If you are taking bio 104 it is because you have. With that said it is a lot of memorization and a lot of information crammed into each day.",
    "Yes needed for the major",
    "If you are planning to take this course, odds are you are taking it for your major, or for pre-med requirements. Even so, I would still recommend this course as it is by far the best module in the BIOL sequence. The evolutionary and ecology concepts themselves are far more enjoyable to learn and the lecturer, Professor Near, makes them even more interesting (if you have the chance to take BIOL104 with Professor Near, definitely do it; he is an absolute joy to learn from). While I do not recommend going through the entirety of the BIOL sequence just to take this course, it is a wonderful reward for having completed it.",
    "I would recommend this professor to other students, but I think its a very specific subject that only E&EB majors would thoroughly enjoy.",
    "Only if you really need to!",
    "Yes! Very cool topics taught very well!",
    "yes! I thought this would be my least favorite in the bio sequence but it turned out to be a lot of great information.",
    "Maybe. It is less intellectually challenging than the other bio sequences but more emotionally taxing. Most people in this class are taking it because it is required for premed\/some evst\/bio majors. It is not enjoyable. Lecture is not engaging and barely worth listening to. I recommend showing up to lecture and doing your best to stay focused and take notes, but not to be too worried if that is impossible. Just carefully review the lecture slides before exams and you should be alright.",
    "Yes, my favorite of the Intro biology sequence!",
    "The class is a prerequisite for a lot of courses, so some people in the class don't want to be there and that's why I wouldn't recommend this course unless it's required for your major. Unfortunately that's just the reality of the intro bio sequence, not just this course. However, this was my favorite section of the intro bio sequence because I didn't have to get bogged down in the details, and I could intelligently talk about many events that are important in the history of earth. In that sense, I never was interested in ecology or evolutionary biology before taking this course, and it has definitely sparked an interest in a field that I would never consider without taking this course.",
    "Sure! It's a good introduction to evolution, as well as to ecology (though largely from the lens of evolution). If these subjects interest you, this is a great place to get started and a great place to survey what the field of E&EB has to offer.",
    "This was the best of the four bio sequences. Its really great and the subject matter is really interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student if they came in with some interest in the subject. As a student who is most interested in the molecular parts of biology, I didn't enjoy the content of this module as much as other people. However, some aspects of the course I did find fascinationsuch as kin selection and the conservation of particular genes across many organisms. Of course, if you are a premed or bio major, you have to take this, but if you are thinking of taking this for a SC credit, or because you think you may enjoy the content of the module, I would make sure you have an interest in evolutionary biology.",
    "This course is likely mandatory. Near and Lin are great, but it was more a list of random facts to memorize than anything conceptual. Completely different from 101-103.",
    "I would recommend this course to another person if they are pursuing a degree\/career in biology. It was really interesting, but sometimes the professor went really fast and over a lot of material at once in class.",
    "No, but they will take it anyway. It's required for everything, so why bother making other students nervous about it with a horrible review. You'll take it. You'll get through it. You'll do fine. You'll even enjoy some of Professor Near's lectures- it really is exquisite how he is able to time them so well. Still, you will most likely not feel much fulfillment after taking this course. Take the exams seriously. Swallow your pride and short-term memorize facts for regurgitation. You'll do well, and it will be fine.",
    "I think this class is really interesting and I think it is the most accessible to a lot of non STEM students. It can be a little boring at times when it just becomes listing dates and clades and such. I think any student with a slight interest in EEB should consider taking it",
    "This course includes an unfortunate amount of memorization. As an E&EB major and a longtime natural history geek, I can attest to the fact that yes, some memorization is necessary to be successful in the field, but the amount that is required in this course is not representative. If you think you might be interested in E&EB, please don't be discouraged. Try to find the interesting and inspiring bits of this course (There are many! It's really quite a fun course apart from studying for the final!) and don't get hung up on thinking you'll hate the major if you hate the memorizing you do in this class. That being said, at some point you have to brute force it, draw lots of trees, make some flashcards, and learn a bunch of dates and animal groups. It's frustrating, but if you accept it and start early, you'll be successful. Also: *make a study group with other students*!!!! This is key. You will have so much more fun studying this stuff with others, and you'll do better in the course.",
    "Only if necessary",
    "Yes. This was the easiest class in the entire bio module because the exams are very fair. You just have to memorize definitions and be able to do some reasonable critical thinking and you should be able to do well in the class.",
    "If you're taking this course it's probably because it's a requirement for you, so take it if you have to but there are probably easier science credits out there if you don't have to. The content can seem pretty simple when it's first introduced in lecture but this can be misleading if you wait too long to study before exams. The topics are interesting, but you will probably have to read more from the textbook than in the other modules to fully understand topics that aren't explained very well in lecture.",
    "Yes, it was a fun course. I might warn them not to mess up like I did.",
    "Yes! This course is really interesting and gives you an entirely different vision of what biology is. I think it's worthwhile to focus on the big things, which is what 104 does."
