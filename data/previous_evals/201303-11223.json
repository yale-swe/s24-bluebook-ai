    "Statistics 101 is great if you maybe have a background in statistics. However coming in as a student who never took statistics it was a bit rushed. The speed was very quick and maybe the first half of the semester was managaeable but definitely LIfe Sciences was difficult for not having a real comfort with statistics. It might have been better to understand the material slowly and with a textbook. I do not recommend this course unless you have a previous background in stats. I better recommend the second semester intro stats class.",
    "This is intro stat, which does not assume any previous statistic knowledge. The first 9 weeks of the class were well taught and organized. There were weekly problem sets which were not too difficult and the midterms were straightforward.Take Stat 10X but consider taking a different section that 101. It is probably one of the harder sections and not the best taught. I would highly recommend taking Jonathan Reuning-Scherer section even if you are less interested in the material since he is a great teacher.",
    "STAT 101 is a good overall introduction class in statistics, and necessary if you want to continue in research fields. The homework is fairly challenging, especially in the second half of the semester, but there are hundreds of other students suffering through it too, so with the help of office hours and other students, the challenge of the homework should not deter from taking the course",
    "This course is divided into two sections-- one taught in a large lecture style, along with students from all the other STAT 10X sections, and a second taught in a small group. The first half of the class was extremely easy-- basically, a repeat of AP Stat. The second was dramatically more challenging and (sometimes excessively) fast paced. It's very easy to get lost and fall behind during the second half, so PAY ATTENTION and ask questions as soon as they arrive. As for the material... you'll definitely learn a lot from this class. The material is sometimes interesting but always useful-- you'll get a definite and very solid foundation for statistics as they're commonly used in biology. This class gives some skills that are very important to have.",
    "Yes. If interested in performing research while at Yale understanding stats is a must, and stats 101 covers the important points that would be used in biological research.",
    "Statistics 101 01 was a good survey course that covered a lot of information. It is listed as an introductory course, but I found myself wishing I had had some previous exposure to statistics. The first half is a survey of all the introductory statistics and a LOT of material is covered very rapidly. It is a good idea to review the notes in order to keep up with the lectures, and make use of the professor. He is a funny and engaging guy and makes statistics a fun class. He is also readily available and holds drop-in sessions where anyone can go to ask him questions about the lecture, the homework, or just listen to others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 questions. The homework is not very challenging (it mostly uses a computer program) and I did not learn very much from it. The second part of the course goes more in depth about the life sciences, specifically ecology and evolution. This part of the course is more difficult than the first half and the lectures are given with alarming speed. It took me some time to get used to this. It is crucial to attend all of the lectures and pay attention to the professor. He puts his notes online, and these are very useful; especially for the homework which can be very confusing and open-ended. Often it is a matter of wording and a question can be interpreted in different ways. I would suggest forming some kind of study group to work on the homework because it can be very confusing. Professor Jetz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s availability is limited, but he wants the students to do well and learn the material so he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willing to meet with them to answer questions or talk about other topics. I felt like I learned a lot from Professor Jetz. Overall the class was a good class and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend it to anybody really because a basic knowledge of statistics is helpful in understanding and analyzing society today.",
    "A solid intro course for students interested in the life sciences. Provides valuable in formation about research study design and analysis.",
    "This stats class is definitely more difficult than some of the other ones out there, like Stat 100. If this fulfills a major requirement, it's not a bad class.",
    "This course definitely covers some useful skills, and the workload is extremely manageable. A weekly (short) problem set, a couple midterms and a final. The lectures in 100 are very clear and organized, and it's not difficult to stay on top of everything. The lectures in 101 become a bit less organized and deal with more complex topics, but the course is graded very fairly. I would recommend this to anyone who plans on entering the life sciences, as most of the topics taught are practical.",
    "Take the course with Jonathan Reuning-Scherer. He does a very good job of making a dry subject interesting, he has clear lecture notes posted online, and his assignments and tests are fair.",
    "Good intro stat survey, will clear up the basics of what you need to know for most fields. Take it if you need to.",
    "Stat 101 was very fast-paced, especially for someone who hasn't taken statistics before in high school. I got sick in the middle of the course, fell behind, then spent the rest of the first part of the semester trying to catch up on all the material from before we split into sections for the second half. The second half was more manageable for me because I didn't fall behind, even though the material got more difficult and the pace was still pretty fast. The best piece of advice would be to not fall behind, or else the fast pace and large amount of material will make the course more difficult than it really should be. That said, I'm glad I took the class because statistics is probably the most useful kind of math I've taken since probably middle school. I would recommend it definitely for STEM majors and other majors (like poli sci) that work closely with stats, but also for humanities majors as well because it's just something people should know.",
    "I would definitely recommend the general stats class. Jonathan Reuning-Scherer is a fantastic teacher. Beware, however, that the teacher and therefore class changes when we break off into the specialized sections."
