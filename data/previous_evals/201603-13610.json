    "So, so much. Not only did I learn an immense amount about screenwriting, about appreciating film and breaking it down, but I also learned a considerable amount about writing in general and at times about myself.",
    "I learned tons about story, structure, theme, writing, character, and the industry.",
    "A better understanding of how narrative in films works and how to write them successfully",
    "I learned both the nuts and bolts of screenwriting as well as how to deeply connect with and develop stories and characters. I watch movies in a new way now; I notice the symmetries, the writers strategies, the symbolism- I see more and it is because of this class. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, I learned that some teachers here really do want you to succeed and grow, as a scholar, writer, and person. Finding someone who truly cares about her students as much as Camille is rare.",
    "I learned historical, technical, and creative methods of film and screenwriting. Camille constantly pushed us to challenge our perspectives and dig deeper into a work's true nature. I learned to be intuitive and daring as a writer while appreciating the form of screenwriting.",
    "I learned about the basics of writing a screenplay. It has truly changed the way I approach film (for the better!), and has left me excited to pursue (hopefully) a future in screenwriting.",
    "I knew nothing about screenwriting prior to taking this course, and am now well on my way to writing a complete screenplay. I learned how to break down the basic three-act structure of a film and many other essential elements about screenplays.",
    "What a wonderful course! Before taking \"The Screenwriter's Craft,\" I had never contemplated writing a screenplay. I took the class because of Camille's gleaming ratings and because I wanted to try something fresh and unfamiliar. What I learned in this class doesn't fit neatly under knowledge, skills, and insights, but here goes. I learned how to write a screenplay. I learned how to share my story. I learned how to collaborate, and how not to collaborate. I learned how to watch films. I learned how to write joy, pain, and love. And I learned how to empathize.",
    "I learned a ton about screenwriting and storytelling and even more about how to be a creative, thoughtful and compassionate human being.",
    "fundamentals of screenwriting, including the three-act structure; a survey of major screenplays & films; approaches to getting into characters; common screenwriting mistakes & pitfalls; revising and refining story ideas."

   "comments": [
    "Camille Thomasson knows how to teach this class 100% perfectly, no improvements necessary.",
    "Few Weaknesses besides communication about what work is due when. Great class overall.",
    "It was incredibly engaging and an excellent learning experience",
    "Camille is the strength of this course. I don't know that I've ever had a more devoted professor. Her commitment shone through in her feedback and one-on-one meetings. She is the lifeblood of the course. She is its strength. The writing skills and polished screenplay that you will begin are just the cherry on top.",
    "The Screenwriter's Craft is a wonderful course. As an instructor, Camille is not only professional and brilliant, but also caring and honest. She made this course fun for us while challenging us with engaging projects and complex concepts. Each class was meticulously planned and rich in knowledge. The strength of this class lies in Camille's willingness to engage with both craft and emotion, which prompts us as students to be daring and empathetic. Camille also allotted a lot of her own time outside of class to meet with each student, which was extremely helpful for each of us to develop our screenplays and learn more about ourselves as writers.",
    "This course has no weaknesses. It is absolutely fantastic in every way! It is perhaps my favorite course at Yale, and I looked forward to class every single week. It is well-taught, fun, engaging, and really interesting.",
    "This class is as close to perfect as any I have taken at Yale. It taught me how to express myself through imagery and it forced me to engage with all aspects of human emotion. I loved every second of this class.",
    "I honestly thought this course was wonderful. If there was any weakness, it's that there were too few assignments. I know that sounds strange, but I'm somebody who works best under deadline, so I think I would have written a lot more should we have had stricter standards throughout. But this was definitely a course where you got as much out of it as you put in, and I am grateful that I put a lot of effort in to the course.",
    "This course is strong. Camille is an excellent instructor. Each meeting is impeccably timed, structured as to appear unstructured. Assignments are carefully planned. Camille is perpetually available. She loves screenwriting. She loves her students. She loves to teach. There is nothing I would change. This course is the closest to perfect I've ever seen.",
    "a strength of this course is that it takes an unconventional approach to teaching writing, through exercises such as getting into character and a retelling of iphigenia by the class. because it's two hours long, there's the danger of increased boredom in the second half, but because camille provided refreshments in between the two sections (&usually they were different in terms of theme \/ activity), it didn't feel like it dragged on."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Screenwriting was never going to be my calling but it didn't stop me from taking this course, and this course really made my semester. There's nobody at Yale I wouldn't recommend it to. It is fun, instructive, engaging, and every week, each class is a pleasant surprise. I can't stress enough how emphatically I would recommend this course to others.",
    "Yes a wonderful seminar about screenwriting.",
    "Aboslutely, it's a very entertaining and engaging study of how to write films, and worth taking even if you're not a writer but just love movies",
    "Yes. Camille Thomasson is an angel. Your writing will grow in the course immeasurably.",
    "Yes. Please take this class. It will change the way you see art, and it will inspire you to write from the heart.",
    "This was a fantastic introduction to screenwriting. Camille engaged every student in a different way and showed a passion for film like no other. Cannot recommend it enough.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It is absolutely fantastic in every way! It is perhaps my favorite course at Yale, and I looked forward to class every single week. It is well-taught, fun, engaging, and really interesting.",
    "This is, hands down, the best class I've ever taken. It will give you as much as you put into it, and if you are willing to do the work, you won't regret it.",
    "Yes, I would undoubtedly recommend this course to another student. If you are all interested in movies or in writing you should take this class. Camille is an incredible and thoughtful instructor who goes above and beyond to help her students. I have truly never had an instructor like her.",
    "Absolutely TAKE THIS CLASS! I had ZERO interest in either screenwriting or film before I enrolled; I took it simply because Camille had a good professor \"rating\" and I enjoy experimenting with different genres of writing. And, WOW! Camille isn't just a professor, she's a teacher, a sage. A master of her craft, she will make you fall in love with the character, feel the undulations of film writing and understand the labors that go into crafting an onscreen narrative. Feedback is detailed and she is always available. As a person, she has a deep appreciation of the difficulties of life at Yale. Sign up. Jump on board. Set sail and don't look back. You will remember this experience for the rest of your life.",
    "This course is one of a kind. I learned a ton about screenwriting and storytelling and even more about how to be a creative, thoughtful and compassionate human being. Camille is simply stupendous. You choose your story very early on in the course (so make sure you pick something you can be very excited about). What's incredible is that Camille thinks about your story just as much as you d (and she has 18 stories to think about). Expect inspirational emails from her about thoughts she happens to have about your characters, plot, etc. (These emails are so beautifully written that they can be published in a book.) She cares about her students as writers and as people more than any professor you have had. It was an absolute pleasure learning from her.",
    "ah-yes, this is an amazing class & camille is a gifted lecturer, a warm, gentle & perceptive presence. you will learn things about yourself, about how you perceive the world, about the stories you want to tell. it is offered pretty rarely, so you should definitely take it."
