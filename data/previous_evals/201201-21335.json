    "no.",
    "I would NOT recommend taking this class. It's not difficult but it is a complete waste of your time when there are so, so many brilliantly taught courses offered at Yale.",
    "PLEASE TAKE IT WITH ANOTHER PROFESSOR! For me, the lecture was so boring that I really didn't see any incentive to go up the science hill to listen to it.",
    "Boring. Easy. Skip lectures and read book for maximum learning.",
    "Take the seminar with Sigga, since macroeconomics is good and useful to know. Harder, but probably way more engaging. Intro micro lecture was fine, but intro macro lecture often felt like a waste of time. You could get away with reading the textbook instead.",
    "Introductory Macroeconomics with Professor Smith was an interesting course that sometimes felt a little bit meandering and sometimes felt very relevant. It covers what it claims to cover, and Professor Smith is a perfectly decent instructor, although his explanations can sometimes be confusing, as a he tends to draw in examples or counterexamples that don't really enhance the understanding of the material. An important thing to be aware of is that this course certainly is not a continuation of the concepts in Introductory Microeconomics, and it might be worth it to consider just taking Intermediate Microeconomics if you really enjoyed Intro Micro.",
    "Exactly what you would expect out of an introductory macroeconomics course.",
    "The material was definitely very relevant in the context of the recent global economic crisis. However, the lectures were pretty boring. I stopped going after the first few weeks. Reading the textbook is more than sufficient to keep up with the material.",
    "A lot of material is covered, but the lectures are not interesting or fun in any way. If one knows that he\/she wants to study econ, then yes you should take this course, but if you are not sure, this might make you shy away from econ.",
    "It is a good class and will give you a good grasp of macroeconomics, knowledge that anyone who wants to talk intelligently about politics should possess. However, I have rated the course \"below average\" because the lecture is incredibly slow. It's not just that the material is dry (and it is relatively dry material, though it's very relevant and applicable); the lectures move at an unacceptably slow pace, and one spends half the class time waiting for chalkboards to raise and lower and waiting for web links to load. Perhaps try a different semester (and a different professor).",
    "Yes I would. It is a useful class-not very hard.",
    "This class is an easy introduction to economics. It will leave those interested in economics unsatisfied due to the lack of depth, but is an acceptable survey course nonetheless. I think it functions mainly as an easy class for non-econ majors, which can be taken to develop a basic knowledge of economics without a large time investment.",
    "Mediocre class. Material is not that difficult, but some of the psets can be challenging. Overall, I would recommend the class.",
    "This class is stupid, take it if you are thinking of majoring in econ, but Prof. Smith is awful and attending lecture isn't even necessary, the exams are a joke if you did the problem sets even somewhat correctly, but the problem sets are graded harshly which is just dumb. Also, it's nothing like AP Macro, so if you're thinking of placing into Intermediate, I'd assume you'd be totally screwed.",
    "Good class. Everyone should understand how the macroeconomy works.",
    "This is the intro lecture to macroeconomics. If you are a freshman, then definitely consider taking the seminar class: it's not open to upperclassmen and it has a reputation as more challenging but more useful as well.This lecture, though, is good not great. Professor Smith is a relatively straightforward and clear lecturer, easy enough to listen to. You can scrape by without ever opening the book, but I don't think the lectures are good enough to do very well without using the book. Smith is very liberal, and his bias shines through pretty clearly throughout the course; he also at times meanders and ends up filling a good amount of time with fluff and not content. That being said, he's a nice and clear and entertaining guy to listen to for 75 minutes at a time.I will say, I think it's really really important for every informed citizen in this country to have some grounding in macroeconomics. You'll understand the news in a slightly deeper way if you take this class, so I do recommend it as a must-have before graduation...not so much for the experience as for the exposure.",
    "I would solely because it is needed for many of the majors offered at Yale. It gives you a comprehensive understanding of the macro economy which will serve you well for whatever major you plan on taking. The lectures were interesting, although most of the time was spent on information you weren't directly responsible for. My advice is to read the text book before the lectures so that you have a strong understanding of the material and go to section with questions. Overall, a class worth taking!",
    "Yes, everyone needs to take it.",
    "Basic overview of macroeconomic processes. If you're willing ot put the work in it is relatively easy to get a good grade.",
    "The content in Intro Macro is pretty interesting, but if possible, try to take it when Professor Smith is NOT teaching it. The course covers a few models of macroeconomic behavior, ranging those explaining short-run fluctuations in the economy to long-run growth.",
    "Look, it's dry material, and parts of it are mathematical enough to make it useless if you are hoping to get better at dinner-convo econ. That said, you have to take it if you want to know anything about the economy here at Yale (don't take Micro for general econ knowledge unless you need a QR) let alone major in econ, so, yeah take it.",
    "Macro is a class you need to take for the economics major. That seems to be the only incentive.",
    "Yes, but only if you have the dedication to make it interesting yourself.",
    "Very interesting and informative",
    "take only if you need to. or just read the textbook, it's pretty good",
    "Yes, it is a very interesting course with many real world applications.",
    "Recommend if you want to be a Econ major.",
    "Yes because it provides a solid base for understanding economics.",
    "Lectures are useless. Textbook is good. Make sure you find a good section, it'll help a lot.",
    "Intro macro course.",
    "Take it if you're interested in Macroeconomics. It's not taught extremely well though.",
    "Unless you need it for your major, stay away! It is boring, the lectures are pointless, the problem sets don't require any comprehension of the class material (and therefore don't prepare well for the exams), and you don't even need it for most upper-level econ courses.",
    "only take this if you're hoping to be an econ major or need the class to go into a major. it really wasn't that well-taught and what he tests you on isn't the best way to do it.",
    "Useful concepts in general but expect to rely more on the textbook and your sections. Lectures are difficult to follow because Prof Smith only writes equations down and explains everything else verbally.",
    "It's a pre-req requirement so I guess you'll have to take this course. But try getting into the seminar. The curve is harsher in the lecture for this class.",
    "Yes. If you want to understand what the finance page is all about.",
    "Yes I would. Most likely if you are taking Intro Macro it is a prerequisite to some other class or major so it is required. However, the problem sets are not difficult, the midterm was fair and overall the class was an enjoyable experience.",
    "The lectures are better than what people will say. He also follows the material in the book closely. I would recommend it.",
    "If you think you are interested, or if you need it for a requirement, it isn't a hard QR, but it is kind of boring and useless. I thought it would give me general knowledge of econ and what is happening but it didn't....",
    "This class is mandatory for the Econ major, so many of you will have to take this regardless. This being said, know that the professor for this class is terrible.His lectures are really disjointed and confusing and he is constantly adding unnecessary information. You will learn so much more by reading the textbook than by going to lectures. The midterm and final are okay, but beware that to get an A, the curve is very tough. Nevertheless, if you put the time into learning the material (read the book- I can't stress this enough), you will walk away from this class with a better understanding of how the economic world works.",
    "its intro econ. almost everybody sits through this class before they leave yale. its boring, and hard to do.. but its worth getting through for the basics. If you already feel mastery of the material, jump to intermediate. its not worth the easy A.",
    "Seminar is probably better, but I wouldn't strongly recommend against taking this course.",
    "Terrible class. Terrible location. Lectures teach you nothing. Just read the book.",
    "valuable to decide if your going to take economics any further or not",
    "The material is pretty interesting, but the lectures can be a bit dry. Not too much work overall.",
    "Econ 116 was really fascinating. The book is great, the lectures sometimes mediocre, but I am really happy I took this class before election season. I learned a lot.Read the book. It is excellent. And go to section because in section they give you the equations you need to do the problem sets.Going to lecture isn't as critical.",
    "Standard intro econ course. Not absolutely riveting, but Tony Smith is a nice guy and does a good job of thoroughly explaining things. If you attend and pay attention you'll do fine. Also, this textbook is ACTUALLY helpful. If you don't want to attend, you'd be totally fine just reading the book.",
    "Horrible class but at the same time its an intro level econ course...so it is what it is. It will suck your life though.",
    "Take it to learn about the economy, but don't expect this class to be conceptual. very math based, take credit D if that concerns you",
    "This is a basic, into macro class. Not too heavy workload, neither really difficult or really easy. Good to take to round out your Yale education.",
    "ECON 116 is the Intro Macro lecture course for Yale. I would recommend buying the book, and learning it yourself. I found that I did not learn much in lecture, and sections were also not helpful. Think hard before signing up for this course.",
    "Probably everyone should take this course to get a general idea of whats going on in economy. Plus it's not hard at all.",
    "Very interesting themes. I think very necessary for a basic overview of macroeconomics that is important in any career.",
    "If you don't need to take the course to progress in the econ major, still consider taking the course if you want to learn about the macro economy and can handle reading the textbook and struggling through the problem sets.",
    "If you're a freshman, shop the seminar as everyone else has told you on here (I think the prof from the past years is leaving, so the seminar might not necessarily be better). For this class, read the book in advance bc otherwise lectures makes less sense. Prof. Smith brings up a lot of current events that probably won't be tested, but they'll reinforce whatever you taught yourself. Get a good TA-- Max Appendino is great. If you have time and your TA doesn't do it, esp. leading up to the exams, do the problems at the end of the chapter (they're not bad) and ask the TA if they're right. We had one midterm, one exam, and the 11 problems sets. Professor Smith is kind and helpful with questions. You need to teach yourself the basics, but the textbook is so clear, it doesn't matter. Just read in advance.",
    "This is a very good class if you take the time to read the textbook. Professor Smith also posts weblinks every week about current issues in economics that are really interesting.",
    "If you are interested in a basic outline of macroeconomic concepts this is the course for you. It is not the most exciting course at Yale, but it will help you understand the macroeconomic issues of the day, which is an important topic.",
    "It's to be expected, Smith's lectures are off-topic and boring so a lot of people stopped going to lecture. If you don't read the textbook you'll be screwed for the final, because everything comes from there. However, Smith always puts on a bogus question or two that almost nobody will get, so be prepared for that.",
    "No, I would not recommend this class to a fellow student. I have heard better things about the Macro seminars and I would encourage a fellow student to look into the lottery there. I especially would not recommend taking this course if the student doesn't need it for distributional requirements or a major requirement. It is not worth the time or energy.",
    "Good",
    "While Professor Smith has an expansive repertoire of Lord of the Rings and Star Trek references, he does certainly need to work on expanding into the realm of Star Wars. Thus, I proffer a hesitant endorsement of the class.",
    "The class syllabus made sense, macro is pretty interesting. Profesor Smith was a bit disorganized and spent too much time deriving the final equations when he could have just given it to us sooner. Problem sets were useful. Some TA's were pretty helpful, shop around and make sure you get one that can actually clarify the concepts well. Read the book and go to section, you don't really have to go to class.",
    "This is a useful class for understanding how the economy works. The lectures can go on tangents, but they're useful ones, generally, as they illuminate what's going on right now and how economists are commenting. Not info you need to know for exams, but I would suggest going to lectures and listening to this stuff anyway so that you can get more out of this class than what you studied for a test. Exams aren't difficult, generally fair.",
    "Intro macro is a pretty good overview of modern economic theory. I would say everyone should take it before graduating and entering the real world. The professor (Smith) isn't that great of a lecturer, but everything can be learned from the online slides and textbook. The problem sets are not bad at all, so the workload doesn't feel too heavy.",
    "It's your standard macro econ course.",
    "I definitely recommend taking an Econ class sometime at Yale.",
    "Need it to continue to intermediate macro, and it is a good foundation. The book is very helpful.",
    "Way more interesting and relevant than Micro.",
    "YES. In this semester, of my 5 classes, I would say that the material and ideas I've learned in this class are one of the most useful and will stick with me forever. Even more so than Intro Micro, I can confidently say that the concepts I've learned in this class will never be forgotten because they are so intertwined with current events. I can read and understand current events better than before, and also, Macro is such a great tool to use to analyze history. In middle school and high school, I had learned about the Great Depression very superficially. I never fully understood the stock market crash, and the economic mechanisms behind the crash, until I took Intro Macro, and analyzed every aspect of the Great Depression and all of the theories and prevalent economic beliefs from back then.Take this class. The ideas behind this class are mind-blowing.",
    "It's a good introductory course. If you don't know anything about macroeconomics, this should be a good place to start.",
    "Even if you aren't an economics major or into economics it is a pretty useful class. In our current economy and world it is definitely necessary to know these things. Already concepts we've learned have shown up on tv programs, etc that I've watched since taking the course.",
    "Workload is extremely, extremely light which would definitely be a good reason to take this course if you're looking for an easy credit. One problem set a week, one midterm, and one final - try to keep up with the material, and you'll definitely be fine. There are really only a few main concepts in the entire course, and once you get those down, everything else is just an extension.",
    "The lecture is dry, but overall the material learned throughout the course is pretty interesting.",
    "Only if you totally need to",
    "I would recommend this course. It's a good intro class. Prof. Smith is really boring, but really nice, so it's difficult not to like him anyway. The textbook is pretty good. Prof. Smith attempts to make the material relevant, which is nice.",
    "Definitely take macro. It helps you understand about the economy which everyone should know about.",
    "I necessary class for economics majors, not very exciting- but important.",
    "Don't take it of you're not interested in Econ. Was not very intellectually stimulating.",
    "take seminar if you can",
    "Take this course. The material is relevant and useful.",
    "The lecture was a zoo, and therefore not worth going too. People all showed up late and TALKED the whole time, not even whispered. So I never came back. Also, this course should never be called a QR. one time we had to use excel but that's about as hard as it got. Yales QR requirement is a complete joke and this course is evidence.",
    "Take it if you want to be an Econ major. If it's out of general curiosity, I wouldn't do it with Smith.",
    "You will be able to read a newspaper better. Professor Smith doesn't really explain things better than the textbook; you will probably not end up going to class, which is fine as long as you read the textbook.",
    "It's a good introductory level course - helps you make sense of the world, and it's not too much work. If you go to lecture, you won't have to read the textbook. But you'd also be fine not going to lecture and studying off the textbook.",
    "ECON 116 is necessary and interesting for either those want to major in econ or those who just want a greater understanding of the macro economy.",
    "Don't take this course if you're just looking for a more thorough knowledge of the economy. You learn about it, but you won't come out of the class understanding American economic policy in a meaningful way. If you think you might want to major in Econ, take it. Otherwise, it might not be worth your time.",
    "If you're taking this, you're most probably taking it because you need it. No surprises for a intro core subject for the econ major, it's not going to be the best class you've taken, nor is Prof. Smith the most engaging lecturer. Lectures can run slow sometimes with Prof. Smith running over the same concepts over and over again. He does try hard to make the material relevant by bringing in real world data and blog posts from economists (which are sometimes interesting) One thing to note the final had a rather substantial focus on \"trivia\" questions. I'm not sure if he will repeat this in the next class he teaches but definitely try to pay attention to key data facts that he talks about in class.",
    "Yes must-take course",
    "Pretty poorly taught class, but you need it as a prereq for all other econ classes. Lectures are boring and Tony Smith goes on a lot of tangents",
    "It's a course everyone should take. Not incredibly interesting, but the concepts are valuable. As long as they keep using that textbook, it will be fine. The Mankiw textbook is great.",
    "It's a requirement for Econ and EPE, so you can't get around it.",
    "Absolutely don't take this class, particularly if it's with Tony Smith. He's an awful professor and you definitely won't learn as much as you hope you will.",
    "I would say that the course is a necessary one for Economics majors and for other students who need the pre-requisite, but otherwise I would not recommend the course in its current form with its current instructor. I would tell a fellow student that you could learn far more introductory macroeconomics from reading this textbook or another one rather than taking the course.",
    "A pretty difficult class but I would recommend it.",
    "DO NOT take it when Prof. Smith is teaching it!",
    "Contains good things to know, but not presented in the most interesting way. I would say that everyone should take it, just because there is no excuse for not having a basic understanding of macroeconomics.",
    "I would recommend it as a great into to Macroeconomics",
    "The class is a good into econ course and the grade curve is better than the seminar version's grade curve. You might want to check to see if it will be held up on science hill again next semester",
    "I would recommend it as a class that needs to be taken. I found the material interesting. Maybe with a better instructor the class could be better.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in Economics or need a social science credit as it is not a lot of work and is not that difficult, but it is not that fun of a class.",
    "Well taught and very topical, good to take just to understand what you read in the news.",
    "The topics are interesting, even though the material is not always clearly explained. The textbook is really good. I would recommend this course to people who are legitimately interested in the topic or who absolutely need this for a prerequisite. The topics are relavant any to current politics and affairs, but not always well explained.",
    "Take Economics 116 only if you (a) need the class as a pre-req or (b) if you're interested in economics. Although you can easily slack off in lecture, you'll have to go to section and do well on the exams to do well in the class. This isn't a \"gut\" class.",
    "no, unless it is needed for distribution. kind of boring course, with many questions left unanswered after lecturehard final with some questions not covered in class",
    "Boring class that is very similar to microeconomics. If you didn't enjoy or bo well in intro micro don't take this.",
    "Take it. It's a good class, your typical intro macro. I found that Prof. Smith taught pretty much the same thing as in the textbook and could get by with not going to class, reading the textbook, and doing the problem sets thoroughly. Section is helpful depending on who you get.",
    "ECON 116 01 offers a broad outline of the macro-economy- it sometimes incorporates current events into the course, but not regularly. I would not recommend it to another student unless he or she needs it for a pre-requisite or major requirement because it entails a lot of work that is specific to the economics field and is not a good class to take just to have some knowledge about econ.",
    "If you want to major in Economics or you need to fulfill a requirement, then I guess you have to take it.The lecture is very boring, which can be good as you can just skip it. Tony Smith is an awful professor and people only take this lecture because they need it. At least textbook used is good and subject matter is interesting.",
    "Take it to fulfill the credit. if you're really interested in macro, take intermediate.",
    "Yes. This is a solid introductory course. It covers economic concepts that everyone should know.",
    "I would recommend this course as a good introduction to Macroeconomics.",
    "Basic Intro Macro concepts presented in a large lecture format. Read the book and meet with your TA a lot if you want to really understand the material - the lectures are less helpful!",
    "Economics 116 provides a good introduction to macroeconomics. The lectures are pretty good (although a bit disorganized at times) and this class is particularly interesting and important given current events!"
