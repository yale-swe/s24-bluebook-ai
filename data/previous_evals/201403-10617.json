   "comments": [
    "yes. This is an excellent course for students who interested in ceramics.",
    "ARCG 785 provided an engaging and highly interesting way to study, understand, and analyze ancient pottery. The hands-on approach and the use of an actual potter greatly enhanced learning and made the course both fun and challenging. The class discussions, presentations, and pottery labs were all great strengths for the course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to other students and describe it as very informative and interesting. The structure is accessible to people with or without an archaeological background.",
    "I'd summarize it as a \"Review of Ceramic Analysis methodologies\" I'd recommend it, but at the same time warn them that Yale's resources allows them to look into these technologies independently.",
    "Summary: A review of ceramic production and analytical techniques applied to ceramics. I would recommend this course to any archaeology either graduate or undergraduate. Having a teacher like Dr. Underhill at Yale is a resource that any interested student should take advantage of."

I will use what I learned from this class to better my own research as well as understand other archaeological issues. My appreciation and knowledge of archaeology has deepened from this course.",
    "It added a more specialized component to my interest in archaeology and allowed me to explore ceramics from a very knowledgeable expert.",
    "It showed me all the fun techniques I can use to analyze ceramics. It also gave me more insight on the complexity of ceramics and the amount of information they can shed light on about the past. this will certainly contribute to my dissertation work! Ceramic analysis is essential!",
    "This course greatly deepened my knowledge of archaeological ceramics particularly the production process. This course is crucial for my reasearch"
