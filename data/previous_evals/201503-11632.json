    "Yes definitely take it it's a great chance to get off campus and take a class that feels like it has real world applications",
    "I highly recommend Early Childhood Education to anyone and everyone interested in children, schooling, or public policy, especially those in the Education Studies program. The highlight of the course is no doubt the weekly observation, where you get to spend two to three hours with the most adorable children on the planet. Dr. Horwitz is then able to put your experiences in context with her vast knowledge about child development and early childhood education. If you are interested in the subject, or even if you just enjoy children, class discussions are a joy. Weekly journals make the workload for this class not insubstantial, but certainly manageable. The final paper is very reasonable in terms of length, and the topic is flexible. Take it!",
    "This class is really valuable. You will come out from it very satisfied and having learned an extensive amount about children and early childhood education in the nation. The weekly observations at Calvin Hill you'll have to do will be awesome! It will be the highlight of your week-trust me. I absolutely recommend this course to anyone.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student at Yale, especially someone interested in education. As someone who is keenly interested in early child education, I gained so much from this class. However, many students in the class had a variety of majors. I really think anyone could enjoy and learn from this class. The course does require a large sense of participation and commitment to readings and observations. However, students will love the class so much, that the commitment will seem natural.",
    "To summarize the class, I would describe EDST 127 as a \"lab and lecture\" type of class. You meet once a week to discuss information that relates to your weekly clinical hour session. Yes, I would recommend EDST 127 to other students. As a class, it offers a way for interested students to see how children and teachers respond and interact with each other in a much more tactile way than reading about human (or child) psychology alone.",
    "Highly recommend--- I learned so much about school systems, educational theory, and child development, and it feels like just the tip of the iceberg. Actually, I gained such a deep interest in and love for early childhood education that I reshaped my career plans as a result(!). Prof Horwitz is a brilliant, insightful discussion leader and SUCH an amazing resource since she knows Calvin Hill inside and out. And the weekly practicum is a joy. To get to play the participant-observer role in a setting like Calvin Hill is a privilege, and anyone considering taking the course should jump on the opportunity.",
    "This course was the light of my semester. If you like kids, absolutely take it. I didn't feel like I learned a whole lot from the readings \/ class discussions (although they were by no means unpleasant or negative experiences)...this class was made totally worth it by the weekly visits to Calvin Hill preschool.",
    "10\/10, would recommend. Calvin Hill is a Yale affiliated daycare center designed by experts in child pedagogy and development. The teachers dont teach the children directly; they have instead carefully designed activities in which the children teach themselves though play. This is an amazing opportunity to learn from the best. The course features a great format; every week focuses on a specific topic (play, math, gender etc). Readings are assigned on the topic, and after youve absorbed some of this theory, you get to observe it in practice working with kids at the Calvin Hill daycare center. You then meet with your peers and professor in a seminar every week, to discuss what you have learned and observed. Major assignments are a journal with entries on your thoughts and observations on the weekly topics, as well as a final paper on any topic of your choice relating to early childhood education.",
    "The observation portion of this course makes it unique from many courses I've taken at Yale. Going to the preschool each week and seeing what is taught in the seminar portion come to life makes this class feel relevant. Over the semester you also get to know the kids and they are awesome. Professor Horwitz is very supportive and knowledgable. Enjoyed myself and learned a lot. Would recommend."
