    "The class introduces key concepts in the application of statistical analysis to psychological experiments. It's a good review for anyone.",
    "Good practical course, definitely recommended and useful. The workload is very high though, and I didn't like some of the style.",
    "It's an introductory class that covers statistics. It moves very slow at the beginning and very quickly at the end. I would recommend the course to any student interested in learning the basics of statistics.",
    "Yeah. Making sure that you understand the basics is important.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student. I would say that the class provides a good overview of some of the most used statistical tests. It will make you realize how much you don't know and will make you much more skeptical of statistics in general.",
    "I think it is an important course to take. I would say it really is course on statistical analyses, like it says."

   "comments": [
    "This definitely contributed to my understanding of statistics and how to apply it to my own research. The fact that the final project is directly applying the methods to our own research is a fantastic idea, both for the learning experience and for its contribution to making progress in our work beyond the classroom.",
    "Understanding statistics and doing data analysis are vital for anyone pursuing research in psychology. Having taken this course will certainly aid me in pursuing psychological research in the future, including my dissertation.",
    "ANOVA basics and results section formatting were very helpful.",
    "Prior to this course I had very little background in statistics so it obviously helped a lot. I really wish there was another class that was offered though."
