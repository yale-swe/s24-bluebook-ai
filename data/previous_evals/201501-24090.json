    "I highly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in astronomy, statistics, or computer science. I've taken a decent number of the courses offered by the astronomy department, and I can confidently say that this was the most fun. I took the class with no previous exposure to statistics but a good amount of experience coding in Python, and the level was just right for me. It would have been doable, but quite a challenge, for someone with no coding experience. That said, I recommend that anyone planning to major in astronomy dive in early, because learning to program well is critical to almost all fields of astronomy -- and, in my experience, what separates the women from the girls in our department. And Python is about the closest thing there is to magic. I learned how to implement so many computational tools that are often mentioned in papers; things I had a shady understanding of but would never have been able to carry out on my own. To name just a few: finding clusters in data, principal component analysis, classification using machine-learning (SVD), Bayesian probabilities using MCMC, finding errors using bootstrap Monte Carlo, etc. Since we had to code them, we learned how a lot of these techniques work at a reasonably deep level, much more than if we had simply used some pre-written software. For example, in the Bayesian problem set, we had to write our own implementation of the Metropolis algorithm to draw random variables from different distributions using MCMC -- this really forced me to understand exactly how MCMC works. Astrostatistics is a very new field -- it basically didn't exist until 10 years ago -- but it's quickly evolving, and I expect more people will go into it as available astronomical datasets continue to grow and astronomers get better at machine learning. Don't miss out!",
    "ASTR 356 is a mlange of astronomy, statistics, and programming that is both awful and wonderful. By that I mean we had four problem sets all semester that each took more than 20 hours... You will learn a lot of new and useful programming methods for data analysis - like a lot. You might not learn very much statistical theory or astronomy, however. Knowing the astronomy department, this course will be pretty heavily overhauled after this test-run of a semester, so I won't say much else. The content taught in this class is valuable for an astronomy major or anyone hoping to go into a field requiring analysis of large amounts of data. Hopefully next year some of the instructional kinks will be worked out."
