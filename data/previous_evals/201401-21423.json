    "I would recommend this class to any student looking for an acting class based in scene studies.",
    "Even if you are not interested in acting, this course is a great way to learn how to analyze human emotions. The development of emotional intelligence, the approach to demonstrating real emotions for others, and the focus on scenework make this class an awesome experience!",
    "This course is a scene study course. During working on a variety on scenes, students are able to individual acting abilities and form a basis acting technique. Through working on scene from a variety of time periods, discussions about society and humanity also arise.",
    "This class offers an in-depth look into scene work.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who's seriously about improving their acting skills - you really are held accountable and must do all the work, it's not a casual, game-based acting class, but if you're willing to work it's extremely valuable.",
    "A real scene study class. You work on 3 scenes throughout the semester-a Tennessee Williams, a Chekhov, and a scene from a contemporary play. Joan is the best!! Definitely recommend."
