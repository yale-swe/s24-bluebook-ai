   "comments": [
    "Yep, interesting, relevant, not too difficult.",
    "Yes. Definitely take this class. Not too much work and an engaging teacher and interesting material.",
    "Gut class with a lovely professor. Definitely take it",
    "If you're looking for a low commitment introductory class to global health and medical anthropology, you've come across a jackpot of a course. Panter-Brick is a sweet lady, and she gives the questions to the exams beforehand for preparation. Some of the logistics of the course are really annoying: inability to access some things you want (like legible lecture slides), NOT RUSHED lectures, and the group project sucks if you have a terrible group.",
    "Yes! The class is a bit harder than it sounds but not too bad at all! The midterm is graded harshly and the quizzes you need to study for",
    "Great class! If you're interested in Global Health, definitley take it. Good to take after (or with) Skolnik's intro Global Health class--this goes deeper into how field research is done and the theories and ethics behind it all too.",
    "Amazing class! Definitely worth taking. Class always went by quickly and lectures always held my attention. Really interesting course material. 2 quizzes, a midterm, in class project, and a final - all straightforward. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Take it. Great class.",
    "Survey of Global Health in 21st century. Take this class if you want to know more about global health.",
    "Global health is a great, fairly easy class! The readings aren't extensive, and I found them to be enjoyable. Catherine Panter-Brick is very entertaining in class, and, more importantly, she is focused on changing your perspectives on what constitutes a global health problem\/solution rather than forcing you to learn minute details (except for the first quizzes). Questions to midterm\/final are given beforehand, so you can really be prepared the day of the test. Take it!",
    "Definitely take it! If you want to get a really great intro course to global health, this is the class for you.",
    "Take this class! Professor Panter-Brick is such an enthusiastic and caring professor. This was the first global health class that I've taken, and I definitely learned a lot. The workload is not heavy at all, and you get the questions for the midterm and final in advance. You learn a lot and there's little stress.",
    "Absolutely! Solid class. Not too hard of a workload. Great material.",
    "Take it if you need a social science-interesting and not difficult.",
    "A MUST TAKE CLASS -- truly a hidden gem! Professor Panter-Brick is engaging, funny and experienced. This class is not hard to get an A in. Just show up to class and participate. Exams are not hard at all -- you get the essay questions in advance. I learned so much in this class and actually enjoyed every minute of it. A really great class for anyone interested in global health but who might need a \"lighter\" course to just get his or her feet wet in the field.",
    "Overall, this class was extremely interesting and engaging. It wasn't overly difficult, and put the burden of learning on the students who were truly passionate about the issues discussed in lecture. Take it if you have any interest in learning how health is socially constructed. If not, it's a bit of a gut and not boring. Dr. Panter-Brick is also pretty funny and entertaining in lecture.",
    "yes",
    "Yes! This class is especially great if you've never taken a global health class before.",
    "To get a good grade: pay attention in the first few classes for the quizzes. Study from lectures, section, and friends for the finals and midterms: she gives you 8 possible essay topics from which some will show up on the midterm\/final.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes and I would definitely recommend it. I felt the class was a good introduction to Global Health and it provided me with interesting and useful insight into the issues and workings of Global Health. I enjoyed learning about the importance of culture in Global Health behaviors, structures and issues. The class challenged one's traditional notions about health as a purely biological issue, which I found eye opening and refreshing.",
    "This is an incredible course. The workload is very reasonable and all of the readings were interesting. The lectures are fascinating and move quickly. Definitely take this class if you need a good 5th class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend.",
    "This was an interesting course to get us started in global health. Definitely a chill and fun class since the smaller lecture allows for interactive learning and you get to do group projects with people in your section. You won't learn a ton of stuff just because it's really vague though.",
    "This course was good but not great. Professor Panter-Brick is a good lecturer but often lectures too fast and does not emphasize important points. Her slides are hard to read and she puts far too much information of each slide, making it hard to learn from the slides both in class and in lecture. This class suffered greatly from a lack of organization and practicality. The lectures were often disorganized and it was difficult to extract larger, overarching themes from the course for this reason. Furthermore, it made no sense to have exams in this course. This course would have been much more suited to writing papers or something of that sort. The exams seemed pointless and did not help enforce any information. The quizzes were effective in forcing students to review the material and the course could benefit from having more quizzes and less exams. Also, the group project UN presentation was not a well thought out project. We were given much too little time to work on the project and too little guidance. It would have been helpful to have had the opportunity to get feedback from TAs before presenting in front of a room of people\/professors. Essentially, there was almost no time to prepare this presentation and 1-2 students in my group ended up making the entire presentation and presenting--effectively doing all the work by ourselves. This project was a great learning experience but the time given to complete the project must be increased in order for the activity to be effective and beneficial academically. The sections were often boring and did not seem to have a real purpose or objective.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student, whether they are interested in public policy, social sciences, or the hard sciences. particularly important for pre-med students."
