    "No, unless you've taken ANTH 116.",
    "A good, non-gut way to get an SC with as little work as possible. You'll learn some things. But you won't learn any methods, and the tests don't examine your understanding of overarching frameworks--just the facts.",
    "Overall an interesting course but the tests were not a piece of cake so not for people looking for a gut class",
    "kind of interesting and not too technical, so good for non-science majors. its not easy though",
    "If you are looking for a great 5th Credit\/ D class, this class is PERFECT! Your whole grade consists of two midterms and a final, and it is very easy to do B range on the exams without doing any of the weekly readings and cramming the day before the exam.On the other hand, if you are taking this for a grade, it can be a little tricky. Some of the test questions are about very specific things, so it is easy to lose points. Also, the tests are not curved, and the averages on the two midterms were in the high 70's, so doing average is not an option in this class if you want to get a good grade.Material wise, thisclass is fascinating! The professor is excellent- he calls this his \"bread and butter class\" and he really does love and know a lot about all of the material. Very interesting topics too- sex, attraction, nutrition. Lots of global health implications as well.Good for anthro majors, also great science for non-science majors as the science is very freshman year biology-like (easy).Overall, great class. I would highly recommend it, especially as a credit\/D class.",
    "Very interesting material, but be warned: the tests are hard! Studying for them (you have to know the readings and lectures in and out) makes this class much more work-intensive than the no-homework syllabus would indicate. Ultimately, I'm very glad I took this class, but three of my friends--very smart people--ended up taking a \"W\" after the second midterm rather than stick around to get B's or C's. Only take it if you're fully committed to studying hard.",
    "BAD CLASS.",
    "Should be a 50 min lecture with section. Class was pretty rough. Thought the exams focused far too much on random details and facts.",
    "Anthro 242 is a good basic introduction to biological anthropology\/evolution. You learn a lot about human reproductive behavior, aging, viruses, evolution, etc. If you're a non-science major looking for a science credit, this is the perfect class. There's not a lot of work (only a few readings a week), and 2 midterms, 1 final, and no mandatory section. If you study hard, you do well on the tests. I would recommend it if you're looking for a science credit or interested in biological anthropology, but if not, there are probably more interesting classes out there.",
    "The course material was interesting, though the examination methods made all of this go to waste. The exams focus on truly trivial things, and the grading is questionable. There is NO CURVE on any of the exams if there is a hint of normal distribution. I thought it would be interesting to take a Sc credit that was not exactly \"physical science,\" but it turns out I was wrong. I strongly recommend not taking this course, unless you are good at memorizing all your class notes and the smallest details from the readings.",
    "Really interesting class! Take it, but don't plan on it being your \"easy science credit\" -- the tests are definitely difficult. i didn't need a science credit, ended up taking it credit\/d, and it was perfect",
    "If you need a science credit, take this. It's the only 75 minute lecture that I have actually paid attention to the entire time because the subject matter is actually interesting and presented clearly.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. The material is really interesting, and Professor Bribiescas is such a great lecturer. My only warning would be to make sure that you stay on top of the readings because they will, without a doubt, be on the two midterms and the final. The exams require a lot of memorization, but if you start studying a couple of days in advance, you'll be fine.",
    "It's a very interesting class but the professor is pretty unfair about testing. For our second midterm he added questions about readings from before a date which he explicitly said was the boundary of the material we needed to know. Also, my TA told us the exam would be multiple choice and it turned out to be short answer, and again there was nothing done to make up for the problems it caused for the people in that section. The class is interesting enough but the exams are basically about memorization\/regurgitation so take at your own risk.",
    "Good for non science majors. Really interesting!",
    "I'd recommend it. I'm definitely more of a humanities person but the course was still interesting and not too difficult. Great way to get a science credit.",
    "I think that you should not rely on this class to fulfill a science credit; you might do worse than you hoped to and end up with a terrible grade that you cant drop because you need to fill your distributional requirements...The information is interesting but prof. Bribiescas makes it difficult to know what to focus on when studying. The grading is based on two midterms and a final (30%, 30%, 40%) and they are harder than you think they will be!Bottom line - take this if you are actually going to go to every section, because the TAs are helpful in emphasizing the major concepts. Also, be prepared to study hard for the exams.The relatively nonexistent weekly workload is made up for by the intense exams. One last thing - you actually need to do the readings. They are essential.",
    "This class was interesting but surprisingly difficult at times. Make sure you do the reading if you want to do well on the tests.",
    "I recommend it. Go to lecture, and study ahead for the exams.",
    "This class is... somewhat interesting. As a science major taking this course for the social science, I didn't particularly put much stock into this course (which was my mistake). The course doesn't require much work, only papers that were usually covered in Professor Bribiescas lectures. I have to say that some of his test questions were either ridiculously detailed or peculiarly vague. GO TO SECTION. They aren't mandatory and the papers seemed easy enough to read, so I didn't start attending sections until after I bombed the first midterm. You really need to go to section to understand what kind of things can be on the midterm. Also, section is actually really fun if you've read the paper and you go to Jessamy's section. I found that I enjoyed the course more when I actually went to section than when I didn't.",
    "This class is definitely not a gut. I took it thinking it would be a gut, but I was surprised by the density of the material. The amount of reading isn't too bad at all, but you are expected to know them pretty well for the exams. If you do take the class, make sure you go to at least one of the optional sections, and do all of the readings.",
    "Great course that goes in depth in topics skimmed over in a regular evolutionary biology class. It was interesting to look at biology through an anthropological perspective, and the lectures were engaging. However, since the tests are few and far between, expect a lot of material to cover, especially if you don't stay on top of readings. The format of exams this year also switched to short answer, which made it more difficult to recall information, versus a multiple choice test. But if you're willing to put in the work for a class that's a lot more engaging than \"gut\" classes, this is an awesome science credit.",
    "From the perspective of a science major, ANTH 242 is a great class to get a SO credit. A lot of what we learn is a repetition of other science courses or is relatively logical (i.e. if one thing goes down, the other might go up kind of thing). I have no idea what it's like for a non-science major, but as far as I could tell, Bribiescas focused on the generalities of the science rather than the details. Some of the papers are a little dense but go to the TAs and they can explain really clearly. Two midterms and a final. Straightforward, although the second midterm was scheduled extremely close to the final and the final was definitely trickier than the midterms.",
    "Yes! Can't think of a better way to do a science credit. Even if you're not looking solely for a science class, still useful to take for life. Really enjoyed it!",
    "Prof. Bribiescas is a very engaging professor, and the course material is extremely interesting. Not extremely science-y for a science credit, but also not a gut. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone, science or non-science major.",
    "The class is really interesting, not inaccessible at all. It made me think about my own humanity in a much different way. Take it if you're at all interested!",
    "Interesting and intelligible science class for non-majors. Could be improved by making section attendance easier and holding exam review sessions. Professor is accessible and interested in students.",
    "Take it. Really interesting stuff.",
    "If you need a science credit, this one is great because you actually learn a lot about how our bodies work, etc. I enjoyed it.",
    "I really enjoyed the course. I learned things that apply to real life in surprising ways -- lots of things that you'll want to tell your friends about at lunch. You'll also learn that pretty much everything in life is a tradeoff, like between survival and reproduction. For example, risking your life in the dungeons of Toads.",
    "Interesting material and a decent lecturer, but the class is pretty unorganized in terms of grading. Grading for the exams was not very clear. Overall, though, it was a fairly good science credit for non-science majors...just make sure you have a study group if biology is not an area of strength.",
    "NOT A GUT. Not worth it if you're taking it for the science credit. The exams had super unreasonable questions like \"what were the two main points of [paper title]by [author]\". The professor also asked about seemingly random points he had passingly made in lecture or about some obscure fact in the reading.",
    "I would recommend this class as an interesting science credit, particularly one that is taught well. The topic is certainly interesting, and builds nicely off of themes discussed in classes like PSYC 171. The readings are not very time consuming and generally cover fascinating themes. Be careful about the exams, since they tend to focus on facts that are very specific from class and draws heavily from the readings.",
    "Take it! I took it because it was a science credit and it ended up being my favorite class. You will learn SO MUCH.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, even if you're not going to use it for a science credit (it is also an excellent science credit). If you have time to do all the readings and go to section, it's even more rewarding.",
    "Good course. Study graphs.",
    "I would recommend it. Its a great class where you learn a lot. But keep up on the readings. It is easy to not pay attention, but if you do you will suffer for it n the midterms.",
    "I would recommend this, but maybe take it Credit D.",
    "Take it even if a non-science person. Be careful though- the exams are harder than you'd think at first. And make sure you do the readings and get the big ideas out of them.",
    "I would recommend it. It is certainly not an easy A (might be a no-A-at-all class) but it is really fun and you learn a lot. I went to every lecture (which I never do) and it felt totally effortless. You do need to do the readings though (not the whole articles, just abstract+intro+conclusion\/summary). Going to the optional section can help keep you on track, but you can also just study with a buddy and that'll work too.",
    "The class material was extremely interesting and Professor Bribiescas teaches the information in a way that makes the class very enjoyable. However, the 3 exams require a lot of memorization and each one counts for a big proportion of your grade.",
    "Very great course with interesting material. Professor Bribiescas is a pioneer in the field of evolution of men, so it is fascinating learning straight from the source in that part of the class. Definitely consider starting the class Credit\/D\/Fail, as a lot of people were surprised by the midterms. Not a gut class, you really need to show up.",
    "Anth 242 is a good science credit for non-science majors, I would certainly recommend it. The material is really interesting and Prof. Bribiescas is really engaging and entertaining. It is definitely not a gut though. There is a ton of material and you have to go to class, pay attention, take good notes, and do all the reading.",
    "You should take it! It's a great course, and the material is fascinating. Tip: You MUST do the readings (and study them before exams!), and it's very helpful to go to section even if you don't have any questions.",
    "In general a fascinating class. The exams are tricky so make sure you review your notes profusely! And do the readings. They are 40% of the exam material",
    "I'd recommend it if you need a science credit, or if you're interested in evolutionary biology and\/or life history theory.",
    "Great class with really interesting material, but study for the tests! They get pretty specific",
    "TESTS ARE IMPOSSIBLE. Ok, if you are a freshman and you still have the will and limitless time to study HARD and keep up with the readings, by all means take this class. Taking it as a senior in the humanities, however, I was shocked by how uselessly detail-oriented the tests were. AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT.",
    "Interesting class that covers a broad range of topics. Tests are harder than expected and you definitely need to study them. The readings are always included in the tests so make sure to do them. He also doesn't curve anything which makes it much more difficult of a class. There isn't a lot of work though overall so it's not too painful",
    "The course was interesting and informative. However, the midterms and finals were ridiculous. There is no curve and the exams are graded very harshly. Moreover, the questions are either too vague or to specific. They were impossible no matter how much you study. He also had questions on the exams that he promised would not be on there-including very specific questions on all of the readings. This ultimately ruined the class for me because it did not accurately reflect how much I learned. I would not take another Bribiescas class because of this. I would NOT recommend this class for anyone, even Anthro majors.",
    "A harder than expected science credit. Though I did feel as if I learned something useful. Bribiescas is great. You can tell he really loves what he does.",
    "Its a really interesting class, but its challenging. The material is a lot, and you have to take the midterms really seriously. There is no curve, so you need to learn the material really well.",
    "This is a very interesting and applicable-to-everyday life lecture course. Prof Bribiescas really knows what he's talking about and also makes it accessible to students.It is not the easiest course to do well in -- the examinations are extremely detail-oriented. If you like making flashcards to study, this course may be for you. Prof Bribiescas'lectures are extremely important for these exams, but a number of questions are pulled only from the readings, so it is important that you memorize the authors and their associated points (thankfully not a huge amount of reading).I was thankful that I took this class, for the information learned in lectures as well as the improved ability to read scientific papers, and feel that this was a very good way to fulfill my science credit. At the same time, it was not a breeze.",
    "The class is exactly what the name sounds like - or as Professor Bribiescas describes, \"Womb to Tomb\" - you get a good overview of the life history developments and learn about growth and reproduction, menopause, aging and death in humans. I think it's a good class for anyone who's interested in anthropology or just the biology of humans - learning about evolutionary processes and life processes is just something that's good to know. I'd recommend the class to everyone! But beware, it's not an easy course - the workload is light but the midterms are difficult - very specific (with very specific questions about the readings)! Even though the sections are optional, I'd definitely go to them - they help a lot. I took it as SC credit, but if you're looking for an easy science credit, this isn't really it.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. If you need a science credit and you're not a science major you will get DESTROYED by this class. It wasn't only me either, 5 of my friends had to drop this class. Bribiescas is not understanding and assumes you know way more than you would if you weren't a science major.",
    "A really great science credit if you are willing to put in the work and the study time!",
    "Loved this class, loved the material, makes you think about cool things and in new ways. Take it but if you're obsessed with your grades and don't want to risk your GPA to learn something new, know that the exams are pure memorization and can be tricky.",
    "This class focuses on an applied understanding of evolution and how this pertains to human life history, from birth to death and everything in between, including menarche, reproduction, and menopause.",
    "The material is very interesting and accessible for non-science majors. The exams are hard, though, and it is necessary to do all of the readings closely.",
    "This is not a gut class."
