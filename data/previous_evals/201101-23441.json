    "Very important but complicated subject. However, the instructor was good when sticking to her slides, but seemed to go off on tangents when asked questions or when giving examples.Overall good treatments of very difficult topics.",
    "I thought this was a good course. Martha's TA sessions are a must. I even think that they should be held weekly so we can cover more techniques of longitudinal data analysis in SAS.",
    "The material was good, the workload and the assignments were fair. The instructor was often difficult to understand and at times she had trouble striking a balance between the theoretical and practical aspects of the course material.",
    "Hard material. Not sure of how to make it easier to understand",
    "The class sessions were very helpful (both by the instructor and the TA). It provided a nice balance of theory\/explanation and applied applications.",

    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr. Lin was a good instructor. She clearly cares about her students and puts a lot of effort into answering student questions.On a minor note - next year, please post the slides as a powerpoint so that students can manipulate the size that they are printed, how many to a page, and the order. I'm sure they will appreciate it.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0The instructor is clearly very knowledgeable about the course material. She is clearly also a very kind person. However, the instructor was often difficult to understand and at times she had trouble striking a balance between the theoretical and practical aspects of the course material.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0She was fine. Difficult material is the tough part.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr. Lin explained the concepts very clearly and was very knowledgeable. Her course slides were well-prepared and helpful.Sometimes the class would run 5 - 10 minutes over the allotted time (not a big deal but some people have class after).",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Very energetic and teaches with passion"
