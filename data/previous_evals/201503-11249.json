    "This was a great course. Whether you are interested in anthropology or the Soviet Union specifically, it's very valuable. It is also very cool to see how people adapt to a radical change in the political landscape where they live. The anthropological approach is a fascinating way to study the Soviet Union and its transition through the 90s to the modern Russian state.",
    "ANTH 209 was a great intro in the Soviet and post-Soviet Russia, as well as a great intro into the field of anthropology. I had no previous experience in either of these areas and walked away from the class happy about how much I learned. The readings were interesting, and Professor Rogers kept lecture engaging as well. Note that this isn't a history class, so if that's what you're searching for, look elsewhere.",
    "If you have never taken an anthropology class before and are interested about learning more about the Soviet Union, I definitely recommend this class for you.",
    "Take this class!! I had no background with anthropology or the history of the former Soviet Union, but now I feel like I have a nuanced grasp of how the end of the Soviet Union has impacted world events today. Professor Rogers is absolutely fantastic and his lectures are so engaging and enlightening. Highly recommend this course!",
    "Professor Rogers is a great lecturer, the readings are awesome, and the people who take this class (at least the semester I took it) seem like the most random assortment of majors\/personalities but it just works so divinely. Do itt!!!",
    "Definitely!! So glad I took this class. Fascinating topic, interesting readings. Very small class size so the lecture felt like a section. Prof. Rogers is a great lecturer, walks around the room, and tells helpful anecdotes from his own field research. There is a midterm paper, a map quiz, and two papers as a final.",
    "Take this class! Analyzing the anthropology of the soviet union and post-USSR through great lectures and both short and long ethnographies. Rogers is an amazing lecturer. Reading heavy, but he covers them in lecture. Take-home midterm and final essays.",
    "ANTH 209 is a solid survey of anthropological work in the former Soviet Union. It is a gentle introduction to anthropological analysis that is situated in an interest region of study for anyone who is uninitiated in the world of slavic studies, like myself. I was occasionally torn between feeling like the work was too easy, while simultaneously feeling unprepared to produce anthropological arguments of the same quality as we were reading in the syllabus. The professor is an engaging lecturer who is very passionate about creating a positive educational experience for his students. I think my most memorable educational moments came from asking him questions after class. If you've never taken an anthropology class before, this class may vastly improve your vocabulary and fluency in making thoughtful arguments about culture.",
    "Good intro to anthropology and post-USSR conflicts on a number of levels (personal, national, geopolitical). Don't worry about never having taken an anthro class before: you'll be just fine in this one! Prof. Rogers is a very engaging lecturer who really cares about his students. Assignments are good for synthesis without being too many in number. Section was fun. Sometimes readings feel a little disjointed-- not much specific focus on non-Russian contexts, despite the course's title.",
    "This was an amazing class, and an awesome introduction to Anthropology. The subject matter might seem overly specific, but Professor Roger's mastery of the material means it was a very comprehensive and thoughtful take on the reality vs. the myth of the post-Soviet era in the West. Really really really recommend it.",
    "Take it!",
    "TAKE IT! This is an awesome class, doesn't require a lot of work and all the readings are very interesting. You'll get to learn about Russia and eastern european countries in detail and learn a completely new approach to understanding history."
