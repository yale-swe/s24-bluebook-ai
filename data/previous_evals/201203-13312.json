    "No. Don't take it. Boring, useless, and way too abstract.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about political theory in Latin America, it's really interesting, a lot of reading\/writing but it's doable if you stay on top of it",
    "If you need an intro class, sure. It's not a bad one and it won't make you tear our your hairs. She's a tough grader though from what I've heard, so work hard.",
    "FANTASTIC intro class to Lat Am pol thought in terms of the material. Professor is wonderful, try to be prepared for seminar so that it isn't too dull.",
    "A political philosophy course that studies many of the political theories that have shaped Latin-American society. The course places an emphasis on Latin-American political philosophers and their take on how Latin America was shaped from the colonial period through the present-day. I would recommend this course to students interested in learning more about political theories placed in the context of Latin America.",
    "It's a good survey reading course for Latin American political thought. You'll probably get more out of it if you have a political theory background. Also just know that Prof. Ochoa does not give extensions without dean's excuses--keep it in mind.",
    "Latin American Political Thought is a great philosophy seminar that, in addition to discussing some of the biggest moral, ethic, and practical issues that Latin America has faced in its history, it also gives the student a chance to develop his own opinions on more empirical philosophical questions that apply to every area of life.The assigned reading is pretty extensive on a weekly basis, but one will be able to participate in class without spending an exorbitant amount of time reading every week.The weekly papers and the final project are both pretty stress-free and very personalized."
