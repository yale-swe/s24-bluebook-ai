    "This course provided an excellent overview of great civilizations, except focusing on societies and cultures that are normally overlooked. It provided exceptional insight into dynamic pre-histories, coupled with the professor's knowledge and passion. The lab reports also allowed us to delve deeper into certain topics and ideas.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The labs are really cool and the readings are interesting. It doesn't really have any weaknesses.",
    "The course was very low commitment and low stress, as the lab assignments (5, each being 2-3 pages double spaced) and midterm\/final papers required little to no information discussed in lecture. This, however, made me feel as if going to class each day was a chore, since you have to go to get your attendance grade. Jargal, though very informative and a great guy to get to know, can be very dry, making the lectures seem very long (this was not too much of a problem, though, as you can spend your time in lecture doing work for other classes).",
    "The lecture content has nothing to do with the labs and final paper, therefore I found myself less engaged in lecture. This course could be improved by intertwining these aspects. Also, it should be a capped class.",
    "Strengths: interesting labs and lectures, understands that not all students are going to major in archaeology Weaknesses: not held accountable for readings, so easy to disengage with the material",
    "Pretty low workload, so it facilitates a more relaxed learning atmosphere (which I really enjoyed). The labs are also super informative and fun! Definitely had a blast actually acting like an archaeologist.",
    "The course is very interesting and doesn't require too much outside work or knowledge.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It was entertaining and interesting when you wanted to listen, but the 9am start time made it difficult to stay awake at times. (I know, Im lazy). but the labs were very interesting and fun to observe actual artifacts and the TFs and professors did not grade the assignments too hard which I appreciate as some classes will just crush you with poor grades for good work just because they can.",
    "This course is a survey over ancient cultures of the world, taught through an archaeological lens. The lecture and course assignments are complementary, allowing students to get a real feel for the field, as for many of the students, it was their first class in archaeology or anthropology. Each lecture covered a different topic, and lots of archaeological evidence was presented to catch students' interest. There were five lab assignments, each of which allowed students to closely analyze artifacts housed by the Peabody Museum. The midterm and final paper allowed students to take a deep dive into a subject of particular interest to them, and there was a lot of freedom.",
    "Easy content, low workload which was very helpful at times, interesting labs (liked going to Peabody).",
    "I really really enjoyed this class, but it was a shame that such few people came. The professor is very knowledgeable, passionate, and willing to help (along with the TAs), and the the material was very interesting. However, some people came to every class and were not rewarded for their attendance. I better system of attendance, such as the hand check-in method or a quiz that reflects class material would be better.",
    "Strength: Brilliant survey of more nuanced, articulated societies than generally covered. Also, Jargo is an incredible professor -- caring, compassionate, and extremely knowledgeable. Weakness: Most of the people in the class didn't seem to care about the course, which was frustrating.",
    "Strengths - super easy no work",
    "Strengths: LABS! they were fun and informative. I really appreciated the hands on nature of the course. TAs were helpful too for questions. Also, I loved the midterm paper\/final paper structure. Being able to pick anything you like made me more engaged and interested in the material. Weaknesses: Lectures were boring and not interactive. It was hard to pay attention some days, especially with the 9am time. Make lectures more interesting - maybe bring in guest speakers.",
    "Strength: the topics are very interesting. The professors and TAs are extremely helpful. I also learned a lot from the lab sessions.",
    "Extremely boring lectures. The trips to the Peabody were most engaging and made it a lot more enjoyable.",
    "Kind of boring lectures, no incentives to really learn the material. Most interesting and fun part were the hands-on labs.",
    "Strengths: very interesting information included on presentations. Weaknesses: Lecturing seemed not engaging and at times boring.",
    "Good",
    "The content is really interesting! I've never taken an archaeology class before so it was a really good introduction. We had 5 labs- which were interesting and helped me get an insight into the kind of evidence archaeologists go through to analyze different ancient civilizations (fossils, bones, pottery, ect). Lectures can be a little dry though and I wish he posted the slides.",
    "The strengths are the hands-on labs and the free-choice and inquisitive essay assignments. -The weaknesses are the constant attendance pressures and how at the end we weren't given instructions on the labs. I understand we want all people to be present, but don't punish those that show up and make our lives tougher please.",
    "strengths - this course is super informative and covers near every aspect of the topics that were chosen to be discussed. it is super engaging and includes lists of examples, pictures, and real life experiences to genuinely be learned. weaknesses - it got kind of repetitive, the schedule",
    "The subject matter is really interesting, but with no real incentive to pay attention at a 9 am lecture, and no relation of the readings to the grade, it's easy to simply not be engaged with the material.",
    "Professor is passionate about the material but lectures can be a bit dry, student level of engagement was not the highest either. Additionally, feedback was very minimal other than on the midterm paper.",
    "I think strengths of this course is that the assignments are relatively easy to follow and can be done with relative ease. I think a weakness for this class is that the lectures tend to have little to do with the assignments and tend to go into topics that are not necessarily related to work that the students need to do. Because of this disconnect between lecture information and what work needs to be done, the lectures are hard to follow and can at times feel quite unnecessary. An improvement I have for this course would be to make the information from the lectures relevant for the coursework so there can be a bigger connect between the two, which would increase the importance of the lecture.",
    "Lectures were very difficult to sit through. Labs were engaging and prompted hands on learning",
    "lenient professor",
    "The lab components were a great strength",
    "Lecture was sometimes dry and felt as though the labs werent as helpful as they could be",
    "Interesting material but the lecture was very hard to engage with.",
    "This course could be improved by more discussions of the scientific processes by which artifacts are uncovered. The class would have been made more engaging if the connection between the science of site analysis and the subsequent interpretation of the findings to describe the focus society was made more explicit.",
    "I think there could be a better way to track attendance, like perhaps a clicker system, rather than the canvas quizzes m.",
    "It tried to he hands-on in its teaching by us going to labs to analyze real artifacts. It also gave a good overview of ancient cultures from around the world and the archaeological practices used to understand them. However, we were never truly tested over the material which encouraged some students to not show up for class. Various methide were tried to accurately track attendance, but students were able to get around it.",
    "Professor Jargal was enthusiastic and fun to listen to. I think the engagement with the class would have been increased massively if some of the assignments were related to lecture content or if there was a short final as part of the Grade. Because the assignments were not related to the grading people did not feel the need to fully engage",
    "Easy gut",
    "The course covers some fascinating information, but I wish it had been presented in a more leading way. It was hard to know what was important and what was just a minor detail, because everything was presented the same and little to no emphasis was given to particular topics.",
    "I wish there was section to reinforce some of the lecture material.",
    "I enjoyed the material and the labs. Nothing was wrong with it.",
    "Strength: chill course, nice professor, weekly labs. Weakness: the papers felt a little overwhelming, and it was a little hard to do research with limited guidance",
    "I dont know",
    "Too big a lecture, lots of room for students to skip class",
    "N\/A",
    "This course requires very little work and it is easy to do well if you complete the few assignments on time. Because of this, it is a good fifth course. Unfortunately the lectures were quite monotonous. I wish they had been more lively and stimulating.",
    "The course dealt with various civilisations but was consistent in asking the same question: \"how & why was the civilisation\/society was formed the way it was, and how could we get knowledge based on the material evidence gained thorugh archaeological fieldworks?\" Overall I think the course was intriguing and well-organised",
    "The course provides extensive analysis of archaeological sites and the pieces of evidence they provide. However, I think the course could better portray the \"Great Civilizations\" if more aspects about their dynamics and history were studied in a broad picture, and not only tied to the specific archaeological sites."

   "comments": [
    "Yes it is a great class with a manageable workload. It's super interesting and I really liked the course.",
    "Absolutely. Gut central.",
    "If you are fine with a dry lecture, I would recommend this. It is low workload and low stress, and people seem to do well in this class, even when they do not put much effort in. The trips to the museum were actually really enjoyable, and seeing some ancient artifacts up close is something I would not have been able to experience outside of the class.",
    "yes, it's easy",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, it is a good humanities credit for any stem major.",
    "Yes!! I originally took this class completely for fun, but was engaged by the end of the course. The labs really felt like field trips and were welcome breaks throughout this semester (even if it was just for 30 minutes).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students because it is interesting and the professor cares a lot about this class.",
    "Yes very different and fun class.",
    "Yes. It is a great 5th course to add to your schedule and the material is interesting.",
    "Yes I would if you are looking for a class that has low workload and an interesting topic.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend. However, please come to the lectures. They are very interesting and make the experience better for everyone.",
    "Absolutely, but only if you're actually willing to put in work or care about the class. Professor Burentogtokh is such an incredibly knowledgeable and caring professor, and it pained me to see people take advantage of him and the class. Sure, this is a lecture, but at least minimal effort should be mustered to compensate the professor for his time and energy. This is not a complaint of the class the professor and TA's tirelessly attempted to correct students' behaviors; this is a complaint about Yale students. Do better. But, anyway, take the class if you want an interesting survey of dynamic cultures that you otherwise would not learn about.",
    "If you want a gut yes",
    "Yes, take this class! It is interactive (you go to the peabody museum and look at artifacts), the midterm paper\/final paper can be about anything you want related to archeology, and while the lectures are boring - you don't have to worry about paying attention 24\/7 because you are not tested on that material. 10\/10 very enjoyable, low workload course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. If the class follows the same structure as it did this semester, then it will be easy and engaging for students! Students must be in attendance, because the Professor actively checks every class and it does count towards your final grade.",
    "Yes. It is a very low workload.",
    "Yes. You are simply a fool if you do not take this course",
    "Yes. The structure of the course is very clear and easy to follow. The professor and TAs are also very approachable and willing to answer any questions.",
    "Yes, the information is interesting but presented poorly",
    "Big gut, but lame. So maybe?",
    "Yes. It was a very interesting class that seemed to be more focused on learning that strict grading, which I believe Yale should have more of.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course! It is a fun and interesting class to take and not too much work but you do get to learn a lot if you put in the effort!",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. I actually really enjoyed writing the midterm and final paper as you get to choose your own topic of research.",
    "Yes",
    "anthropology majors, history majors, or those interested in excavation and historical sites: take this class.",
    "Only take it if you're willing to dive deeper and actually pay attention. It's interesting then, but if you're not going to do work that won't pertain to your grade, it's a waste of a credit.",
    "If you want an easy 5th class yes, otherwise I would take something where the material will force you to engage more.",
    "I would recommend this class to another person if they want to get a relatively relaxed understanding and introduction to archaelogical studies. I think that if a student enjoys this class thoroughly, they should look into studying further into the topic of archaeology.",
    "Yes this class was very interesting.",
    "yes, easy but you can learn a lot",
    "Half of this wonderful lecture class is athletes, and what looks like the entire football team decided to participate. If you need an easy A on your transcript for this semester, I can think of no better course to recommend. Have fun!",
    "Yes, if looking to get exposure to anthropology",
    "No. Although the material is interesting, the course is not engaging so I didnt get much out of it.",
    "I would recommend this. While there is not a lot of incentive to attend classes, the lectures are fascinating and the chance to examine and analyze actual artifacts is an opportunity like no other.",
    "Easiest gut ever",
    "Yes, the labs were interesting and I enjoyed going to the Peabody museum.",
    "Yes it was a very interesting class that didnt provide a heavy workload.",
    "Yes!! Great fifth class, cool material..definetely recommend taking",
    "Yes I would. Its a mix of engagement but also gives you freedom in many ways.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to a student with a genuine interest i archaeology out of respect for professor jargalan. Many students were taking this class as a gut which diminished the overall value of the class for others",
    "N\/A",
    "I had never taken an archaeology course and so was excited for this one. Unfortunately, this course was boring and uninspiring. While I believe it is critical for Yale to offer courses with lighter workloads that serve as pressure valves, this class was only that.",
    "Yes, esp. if you're an anthropology major - not only because it's included in the major requirement but also because the course allows us to think about the origin of society"
