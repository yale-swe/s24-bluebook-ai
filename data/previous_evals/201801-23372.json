   "comments": [
    "I learned about the ecological, social and economic components that should be considered when planning, designing or undertaking landscape restoration in the tropics. I learned to think critically about restoration projects and their impacts on the landscapes and communities in the area.",
    "I learned a lot about tropical ecosystems and how to manage them. We covered some very interesting subjects and I grew and learning significantly from the course.",
    "This course was very helpful.",
    "How think about restoration",
    "This course was much more social science-y than I expected, in a good way. I learned a lot about balancing different values in tropical forests, and how to restore forest functions with different levels of resources.",
    "Theoretical and practical knowledge on restoration; insight into the lesser-discussed aspects surrounding restoration, such as social context, project management, and funding; insight into the many objectives of restoration",
    "I learned a lot about how the social dimensions surrounding a restoration project effect the project itself. I also learned about tropical ecology\/silviculture.",
    "Great class! Learned the specifics of restoration techniques and talked a lot about the social impacts of such techniques. I expected this class to be more straight lecture but Mark and Gillian introduced an element of discussion which was much appreciated.",
    "Better theoretical knowledge of the fundamentals of tropical forestry restoration, job opportunities in the space, and connections to working professionals.",
    "I had previously taken courses on tropical ecology, and this course challenged me in moving forward from single-sided scientific solutions to actual implementation of restoration projects in tropical ecosystems. The field trip to Panama provided me with enough practical tools that married perfectly with the theoretical background studied during the first half of the semester. Although there was an overwhelming amount of information provided by Dr. Ashton and by Elti, I enjoyed the flipped-nature of the course, having online materials provided in preparation for every discussion.",
    "As a practical course on ongoing forest restoration efforts it was nice to hear insights from around the world and also share some personal experiences."

   "comments": [
    "Very well aligned.",
    "They met my expectations. It was a very well-rounded course that dips its feet in a lot of different areas within tropical restoration - from social and biophysical considerations, financial and governance matters and more.",
    "Not sure,",
    "I think they aligned pretty well with my expectations. I learned more about silvopastoral systems than I ever thought I would!",
    "Extremely well",
    "The class exceeded my expectations. I especially enjoyed the guest speakers we had and our class discussions.",
    "Very well.",
    "Perfectly.",
    "My expectations were mainly in integrating the ecological and social components of restoration projects in the tropics, and in that sense this course exceeded those initial demands."

   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: structure of ecological baseline at the beginning of the semester and then delving into components later; guest lecturers; ample time given to group discussion and student's own previous experiences in this field Weaknesses: some course topics were repetitive, especially the classroom lectures during the Panama field course Improvements: consider consolidating the amount of assignment for this class, or else consider designating this as 4 credits instead of 3",
    "I think some of the click-ables and videos were not excellent. Though there was some redundancy, sometimes it was good - other times a bit too much.",
    "I wish there was less discussion time in the class.",
    "Too much busy work. so many clickable presentations, papers to read etc etc. The final test seemed kind of vague and open ended too, especially after the final presentation and project. Its too much",
    "The student led discussions were a little disorganized and I think people could have put more effort into those. There was at least one week in which no one led a discussion.",
    "Strengths: Very engaging and comprehensive discussion Weakness: A LOT of work. Perhaps disproportionately so. A paper and exam for end of term is a bit much.",
    "As I previously mentioned I liked the guest speakers and our class discussions. I also had a great time on the field trip! The biggest weakness for me was the length on the class. It was three hours! Which made it hard for me to stay engaged throughout the entirety of class.",
    "Strengths: readings were all excellent and class structure was great Weaknesses: journals due at noon on Sunday was difficult. Literally any other time would be better. Perhaps Friday at noon instead.",
    "Strengths include how well structured and organized the course was, the various perspectives that were brought in over zoom, the quality of the readings. Weakness was the regular discussion question postings and lit review assignments, which felt a little unnecessary and disconnected from the rest of the course at times. Also asking for a final presentation, paper, and take-home is a heavy lift for many.",
    "It would be nice of the presentations from the guests every week could be made available in the platform. Sometimes I felt that, because of the incredible amount of information available, i need some time to digest what was shared in class..."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in working in tropical landscapes, I highly recommend taking this course.",
    "I would tell a student that it was a lot of guest lectures - either in person or on screen. There were aspects of that that were nice. I would also tell them its a discussion-based course and structured very differently than Mark's silviculture course.",
    "Professor Ashton is a unique personality and a true expert. You can learn a lot from him but the class often seems like we are doing busy work.",
    "I loved this class. The field trip to Panama with ELTI was once of the best learning experiences I've has at FES.",
    "You will be watching a lot of videos and reading a lot of papers. Get them out of the way early in the week.",
    "Come prepared to have lively discussions.",
    "Take it, but make sure you make time for it.",
    "This course was designed to be given to several people around the world, using ELTI's methodology and online resources. The course resulted in a complete gain, given that many of the people enrolled not only were interested in tropical restoration, but many had previous relevant experience in the field. The discussions were fascinating and extremely engaging, and Dr. Ahton's expertise is invaluable.",
    "Relevant to understand what works and what doesn't work in restoration."
