   "comments": [
    "Tough, demanding, time-consuming, stressful, and fast-paced. Avoid if possible. A considerable percentage of students are already familiar with the material taught, making it frustrating for others to keep up.",
    "No, especially if you are not sold on having to take the class.",
    "This is a standard intro to calculus. I recommend taking it even if you don't \"need\" calculus for your major, because a lot of calculus topics are applicable to real life.",
    "An overall view of calculus with application to the real world.",
    "I would recommend Math 112 to anyone who needs to take this course.",
    "The course does not cater to anyone who has little or no background in calculus. Having taken calculus in high school, I found that I still struggled to get by at times. The pace is very fast and relies mostly on work you do outside of the classroom. The homework questions tend to be the hardest possible version of the material gone over in class, and, in my opinion, do not accurately asses a student's understanding of a subject as much as they asses a student's ability to navigate tricky algebra or wording. Don't take the course if you have a weak or no background in trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus.",
    "I recommend it if you are looking to learn the foundations of calculus. It really reinforces the basics. Take if with John Hall because he is very attentive, nice, and a great lecturer.",
    "Its too much work really. Between Psets and webassign it's hard to say how much you actually retain",
    "It is a standard Calculus course. The work load, with Webassign in addition to weekly problem sets, is a little heavy. I would recommend this course to a student if they were really intent on learning calculus.",
    "It was Calc I, which is focused mainly on differentiation and about a week or two of integration. I would recommend this course.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless it is an individual prerequisite. The tests are really hard for which the class poorly prepares for.",
    "Would recommend to any student who had to take calculus. Would certainly recommend John Hall."
