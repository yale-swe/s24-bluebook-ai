   "comments": [
    "This course helped to thoroughly hone my analytical and close reading skills with text. I especially enjoyed learning about professor Alexandrov's approach to reading literature, from just the text itself, while being careful not to include outside biases. In addition, I very much enjoyed our in class discussions in which both the students and professor Alexandrov actively participated.",
    "Close reading skills; writing of concise, original papers; newfound appreciation for literature",
    "This class exposed me to some incredible Russian literature as well as allowed for me to work on my writing.",
    "I learned a lot about Russian literature and about writing. I got to practice writing shorter papers which was helpful and developed a love of many of these authors.",
    "I learned how to interpret texts closely and concisely.",
    "Writing\/analysis skills, knowledge of writing styles \/ thematic interests OF different famous authors.",
    "I was privy to an intensity of literary analysis I had only seen in my wildest dreams this semester with Professor Alexandrov. The way Alexandrov approaches texts is not unique, but the rigor with which he does so was new to me, and truly inspiring. That, and an in-depth exploration of a few wonderful novels and short stories was what I took from this semester."

   "comments": [
    "At times, I found the amount of reading assigned to be a little daunting. Other than that, I did not find the course to have any weaknesses- it was both a class that covered enjoyable and intellectually stimulating subject matter as well as one in which all students were actively engaged.",
    "Loved everything",
    "The class covers great works, and Professor Alexandrov brings up wonderful ideas in all of them. The only weakness was that, at times, I felt that this class was more of a lecture than a seminar. This evolved throughout the semester, but I think the course could be improved by a focus to stimulate more thoughts from students.",
    "I loved the class, the two hour block was long though and sometimes draining.",
    "The course's strengths were the selection of readings and the class discussions. They were both fascinating and insightful. I can't think of any substantial ways in which the class could be improved.",
    "Main strength was that the seminar style allowed us to have good moderated discussions and get good feedback from the professor. Weakness was that some weeks there was too much reading to finish and the 2 hour class time was a bit long.",
    "Professor Alexandrov is an incredibly smart human being, and watching him crack open impenetrable texts effortlessly was an experience for the ages. His syllabus was eclectic, mixing fun, accessible texts with more difficult and esoteric ones, but his guidance was assured. The pace was always manageable, and class was almost never boring. Plus, it will never be taught again. So much like humanity in The Kreutzer Sonata, it reached a peak whose natural implication is complete destruction.",
    "Wonderful set of texts that we read, really enjoyed the two hour format, which I felt allowed for a greater depth of discussion (as sometimes more subtle points would have been broken up by a shorter class length). Not too many complaints with the class: perhaps a slightly greater variety in the structure of papers, just to facilitate the learning of different paper writing styles?"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. While Russian literature itself (at least based on the works that we read in class) follow similar themes, I think the course as a whole is very helpful in working on one's close reading and analytical thinking skills.",
    "Russian literature is like no other literature. Discussions started in class were always continued over coffee with friends out of class.",
    "This is a very fun course to explore Russian literature if you're new to it.",
    "Yes. Definitely. Great class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. No matter what your major is, the content of this course is universally interesting and entertaining.",
    "If alexandrov weren't leaving, probably.",
    "Yes, 100%, but he's leaving :(",
    "Wonderful class with a great professor -- Alexandrov truly has a broad and deep understanding of the texts discussed in class, as well as of writing and comparative literature beyond. Felt that the course helped both my understanding of writing about literature, and reading to understand literature."
