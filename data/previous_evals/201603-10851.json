   "comments": [
    "Professor Jarvis' class is amazing. I was exposed to a vast repertoire of postcolonial French literature and impressive intellectual theory on translation, influence, and canonization. I also came to understand better how market capitalism and Western hegemony interfere in the \"pure literary\" space of books, rendering all literature political.",
    "I learned a lot about how to be a better critical reader and how to analyze all aspects of a text. This course really taught me to think beyond the role of a book as a story, but as an agent that carries political weight.",
    "- Cultural appreciation of literary forms. - Gained insights of literary translation. - Gained insight of the perceived inequalities in literature and the ways we could tackle them. - Gained knowledge about literary criticism that tackled issues that I never thought of before.",
    "I developed a much deeper understanding of the pitfalls of translation as well as extroversion.",
    "The way I view the world has truly been altered by this course. I have learned so much about literature, about the \"world,\" about reading and how to read in general. In addition to reading components, I have a strong grasp on history and its flaws, about writing and its limitations, and about privilege constructs."

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this course! The workload is manageable, the intellectual rigor is challenging, and the discussions are phenomenally interesting. The only suggestion I would make is that writing prompts (for weekly responses) should not focus so exclusively on form\/aesthetics. I think it would be helpful and interesting to vary the prompts more to probe the works being read a little more deeply.",
    "This course does a great job of pairing critical texts and literary works.",
    "I would appreciate it if the reading responses prompts were gradually more specific throughout the course. This will allow us to concentrate on specific aspects of the literature or theoretical essays that we have read and will enrich class discussion. The class materials are very rich, although very challenging for Freshmen sometimes. But I think this is part of the learning process.",
    "I found the stucture of the class to be great. The weekly reading responses helped keep everyone on track and the essay topics allowed for personal initiative and were appropriately challenging. I wish the class provided a WR credit.",
    "This course is truly amazing with one of its strengths being the small class size. I felt as if everyone was engaged in course material and tried their best to dissect complex problems. No weaknesses come to mind!"

    "Yes! I loved Professor Jarvis' course. The subject material is interesting and the discussions were phenomenal as well! I can't think of a better introduction to theories of decolonization, literature, translation, and power.",
    "I would recommend it, but only if you are willing to do a lot, and I mean a lot, of reading and writing. The work load is massive, but there is great intellectual payoff.",
    "I do. Although it sounds very specific, it really tackles questions that we may ask in our everyday life such as: the merit we give to specific ideas, courses, literatures and not others, insights into translation studies, and the legacies of colonialism.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is intellectually challenging and Professor Jarvis is wonderful.",
    "Most definitely!"
