   "comments": [
    "I learned a ton about astronomy that I had no idea about coming into this course. Amazing course.",
    "Scientific awareness (learning how to think about theories, uncertainty, etc.) + cool knowledge + new appreciation for space",
    "WHERE DO I EVEN BEGIN. This course was amazing. I feel like I have a greater understand of how science works and how it is relevant to everyone in our everyday lives, which I guess is the point of the science distributional requirement!",
    "Debra is clearly very enthusiastic and passionate about Astronomy! This makes her a great lecturer. She really tried to ask us a lot of open-ended questions in order to get us to \"think like scientists.\" I feel like I learned a lot about the uncertainty of doing science in a still developing field, and I do understand what she meant by trying to think like a scientist. I feel like I learned a lot about the universe, the formation of the stars, how life begins, etc.",
    "Quite frankly, I don't think I've ever learned more raw knowledge from a class. This was a course for which I had literally no background whatsoever, and I came in and learned so much about the way the universe works, how life came to Earth, and many other interesting and important concepts. I think that I also gained a better idea of how to approach scientific problems and began to grapple with the idea that some of the best science is predicated entirely upon educated guessing. I loved loved loved this class.",
    "This class is a great introductory science course at Yale. I learned new ways to think about the universe, its past and its present. Even though I am not a science major, this class made me really think about the future of the Earth and what life on our planet will look like in the future.",
    "A very general understanding of the universe.",
    "I learned about our universe!",
    "How to think about unknowns.",
    "Although I doubt what I retained about specific information for long, I learned a lot about the scientific process as a whole and feel comfortable talking about scientific issues.",
    "I learned a ton about the origin of stars, the Earth, the solar system, the universe--science knowledge that everyone should know! Also learned how to do a P-set efficiently, which is a skill everybody should get. But more than anything, got better at attacking problems from multiple angles.",
    "I knew nothing about astronomy before this class, so all the material was new! I gained so much insight about the universe we live in and how life came to exist on Earth.",
    "I developed a way of thinking that is different from the one I use for my typical science courses, like physics, biology, and chemistry. I learned a lot more about the solar system and the universe, and have a better appreciation for \"non-traditional\" sciences.",
    "Basic knowledge of astronomy, very interesting class.",
    "I learned about space. How it works, where it came from, and exactly how life developed on Earth.",
    "This is a great introductory course into Astronomy, and perfect for non-science majors who are interested in the field.",
    "I was able to enhance my critical thinking skills and gained a strong survey knowledge of astronomy and the building blocks for life.",
    "Leaving Professor Fischer's class, I can honestly say I learned more about the world around me than I had ever considered before. The approach to astronomy in this class is definitely scientific, but grounded in developing a better understanding of our time and place in space. I was able to develop new insights regarding the field, but more importantly was given the ability to explore the evolution of life on this planet.",
    "My knowledge and understanding about the universe, and the origin and development of life greatly increased",
    "Imagine that you took the entire lifetime of the universe so far - 13.8 billion years - and scaled it down to the length of a calendar year. So the Big Bang happened at midnight on January 1st, and it is now 11:59 pm on December 31st. That means: Our solar system didnt exist until August. The first life on Earth began in September. Yesterday, the dinosaurs went extinct. At 11:58 pm today, the first humans migrated out of Africa. 22 seconds ago, we invented agriculture. 5 seconds ago, Christ was born. 1 second ago, America was colonized by the Europeans. And modern technological humans, who live the way we do now, have existed for only milliseconds. This scale is called the cosmic calendar, originally popularized by Carl Sagan, and it's only one of the very cool things that you'll learn in this course. Ive always known that time and space are mindbogglingly enormous, of course, but Id never really been able to imagine a number as big as 13.8 billion years until I thought about it on a scale I use every day. Our place in the world is so unimaginably small. And yet life evolved here, and it could have evolved elsewhere as well. This class doesn't necessarily have the answers to all of those questions, because science hasn't gotten quite that far yet, but it will teach you how to think about them.",
    "I thought that the class did an excellent job of giving us the information necessary to see the big picture behind exoplanet discoveries.",
    "This course is a very broad overview of the origins of the universe, as the title suggests. The syllabus tours students through the theory of the Big Bang, the formation of solar systems and the Earth. It also looks into methods such as explanatory exploration, climate change, and the formation of life. The material of this course spans 13.8 billion years, so its worth repeating: the course is a very broad study of the universe as we know it. At times, this broad scope brings with it a feeling of general disorganization to the courses structure, which is certainly a challenge for any student who finds organized course structure important in learning. However, the disarray of this courses material can be seen as a reflection of the very nebulous subject of the course; the universe is hard to compartmentalize.",
    "I learned what it was like to take a science course at Yale, and it was not very fun. In the beginning, I thought it would be a cool course about space, but it was not. I don't feel like I learned a lot, since much of it was based on memorization without much explanation of why, partly because the explanation was too advanced, and partly because that was not how the course was designed. We often had to absorb facts and regurgitate them on the exams, psets, and quizzes.",
    "Thinking about the universe in terms of different scales, learning to reason with limited data and evidence, piecing together models of the cosmos, examining our beliefs about life itself",
    "You learn so much! Such an awesome course.",
    "I was reminded of the tiny place we occupy in the universe in terms of space and time. I learned about the science behind climate change. I learned about how likely or unlikely it is that life develops on other planets.",
    "I gained a better understanding of our place in the universe as a species. I learned about how the universe, solar system, and galaxy began, what it's like now, and what it's going to be like in the future. I can make educated guesses about the existence of life elsewhere.",
    "I learned so much about space, planets and stars. We covered a lot of material and I feel like I have much greater knowledge on many aspects of astronomy. I also truly realized the vastness of space and gained an appreciation for our universe. The most important thing was learning about how science works and we learned new things through combining and building off knowledge in science.",
    "An exciting understanding of the origins of life on Earth and the search for life in other planets! Since I took this class I've grown extremely curious about whether we are alone in the universe or not. Also loved the focus on the uncertainty of scientific knowledge and on making educated guesses to learn an estimate life in the universe. The course definitely left many questions unanswered but was all the best for it!",
    "I learned about recent developments in astrophysics and exoplanet hunting at the survey level, as well as background material needed to understand the findings. The topics covered most thoroughly included: - Exoplanet detection techniques & their limitations - Drake equation - History of Earth's evolution - big-picture organization of universe",
    "Ability to kind of write a scientific paper, learned lots of new information, ability to synthesize information and draw conclusions",
    "A lot about the Universe",
    "I learned so much about space, our presence in time and space, and the evolution of earth, the galaxy, and our universe. This class is definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Yale and I have developed a new sense of understanding and admiration for space.",
    "I learned a scientific approach to problem solving as well as general scientific literacy in the field of astronomy.",
    "I gained a general knowledge of the methods, practices, and strategies that are used by scientists to work around obstacles in data collection and analysis.",
    "Without having any legitimate background in astronomy, this course taught many various interesting things about what happens outside of our world. It also offers a more in depth look at the development of Earth and life on Earth than one would have from high school experiences.",
    "I learned a basic knowledge of astrobiology, as well as the origins and history of the universe, the solar system, and life on this planet. We also discussed how we're searching for life elsewhere, and the fascinating discoveries being made about exoplanets everyday.",
    "This course taught me everything from star formation, to the origins of life on Earth, to planet detection techniques that astronomers use for finding earth-like planets that can potentially support life.",
    "I learned SO much about the universe and our place in it, as well as learned and reviewed a myriad of scientific and mathematical skills I never thought I would need or want to use again.",
    "I learned a lot about the Universe and the systems within it. I learned how to use Yale tools to create and observe planetary systems. We went to the observatory once and we looked through a telescope and learned a significant amount about stars and their alignments.",
    "Really cool class. Learned a lot about the formation of the universe, the development of life on Earth, exoplanets, and how we search for life outside of the Solar System.",
    "I definitely learned so much about astronomy this semester - although in the grand scheme of the field, we only brushed the basics. Learning about the different methods of exoplanet detection was extremely interesting - especially when we could apply it to our own exoplanetary system! The project\/paper was a great way to give the information more relevance and Professor Fischer really taught us how to both apply and question the information we knew.",
    "I learned basic scientific skills like how to read and write a scientific paper",
    "I learned a good bit about current theories for the origin of life, as well as a lot about the Kepler system which I chose, but beyond a slew of facts and a few rare general concepts I didn't get much.",
    "I developed a lot of knowledge about astronomy, our solar system, the universe, and the way in which we are searching for other planets, and, ultimately, for life. I also learned the basics of doing scientific research. The course improved my problem-solving and critical thinking skills, and it helped to give me a perspective on my place in the universe. It also helped teach the importance of scientific research.",
    "I gained perspective on our place in the universe, as humans on earth and as earthlings in the universe.",
    "How to estimate values and make conclusions with very little evidence.",
    "I learned little from ASTR 130, aside from a handful of cool-sounding vocab words whose meanings were never clearly explained.",
    "I learned to understand how various scientific studies Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, Geology, and Astronomy connect to provide insight about the probability of life existing on other planets in the universe. This involves the study of quantitative graphs and simulations as well as qualitative data about extinctions, star types, etc.",
    "Professor Fischer skipped over the specifics of some basic astronomy that I learned in previous classes (ex. Doppler Technique, galaxy formation and classification, etc.) that I think sometimes would've made the course difficult to follow if you didn't have a relevant background. However, I definitely learned about how the Earth came to seed life and how we could find life elsewhere in the universe in the future. I particularly enjoyed the third portion of ASTR 130, during which we talked about the future of humanity here on Earth.",
    "I think this class was so great because it was motivated the whole time by really cohesive principles (how did life develop, where else has it developed, how do we find it once it has developed). I certainly learned a lot about exoplanets and stars etc, but it wasn't just a \"fun fact class,\" which I appreciated. It definitely makes you think about our place in the universe.",
    "For a non science major, I really learned a lot about various areas in science including; biology, chemistry, and astronomy. They all seemed relevant to the whole course. I could even make a connection between nuclear fission in stars and present day politics. Amazing class.",
    "Greater insight into the field of astrobiology, the interplay of astronomy with other fields of science, and ultimately a better understanding of the human place in the universe.",
    "Felt like I got more comfortable with some basic science stuff. Much more comfortable with the idea of scientific guesswork.",
    "I honestly learned so much about the universe in this course. We started with a thorough history of how the universe has evolved, then we moved into the evolution of life on our planet, and we finally discussed the chances of life occurring on another planet within our universe using components of the Drake Equation. The course was extremely well thought-out, organized, and incredibly run.",
    "You learn a lot about exploratory sciences. A lot of other science classes at Yale focus on just learning the material. This class both teaches you the material and then asks you to apply it and draw your own conclusions.",
    "This was an eye opening course with an amazing professor. I learned a lot of general as well as specific information that peaked my interest in space and microbial life. I was a huge fan of this course.",
    "I felt like I developed a great understanding not only of ~space~ (duh) but also of how to apply a variety of methodologies, frameworks, and disciplines towards a single topic. This class employed everything from physics-style equations to memorization a-la-Bio to even some basic chemistry. I thought it was an excellent way to survey a lot of scientific methodologies while being unified around one subject.",
    "ASTR 130 is a great crash course to astronomy for students who don't plan to major in science. I learned a lot of basic facts about the formation of the universe and the development of life on our planet (and potentially others). I loved that the final project encouraged us to make our own calculations and contribute to the work in which real-life astronomers are currently engaged.",
    "This class was very interesting as a whole. It was very intriguing to learn about all the various planets and potential habitable planets in the universe. It made me realize how small earth is compared to the rest of the universe at life forming elsewhere is a possibility.",
    "I actually kind of learned a lot in the course. Space is pretty cool and I'm glad I know more about it now.",
    "None."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: great material, great professor, great TA's Weaknesses: more time reviewing material could be helpful, clearer grading policies?",
    "Very well organized and Piazza is a lifesaver. Weaknesses - hard to tell the relevance of some of the readings",
    "Strengths: Slides were helpful and descriptive, but not so much that it spelled out everything for you. Problem sets were enjoyable. The research paper and what led up to it was very informative. PROFESSOR FISCHER IS THE BEST 3 Weaknesses: The second unit was a little dull compared to the first and third ones. This was especially prevalent because Professor Fischer's lectures got weaker here and she seemed more unsure of herself. I also felt the guest lecturer on aerosols was pretty weak. Some of the quizzes were pretty frustrating because the questions were so vague (particularly the quiz regarding methods for exoplanet discovery!!)",
    "This is a \"science class for non-science majors,\" which the professor herself has acknowledged. Many students take this class to simply fulfill a science distributional requirement, and so may not have felt as enthusiastic about the subject as the professor. Unfortunately, I think she took this quite personally. One of the strengths is how much she cares about this topic, but a weakness is how it's organized. Oftentimes, I was not sure why we were learning about something; it only became clear weeks later. I think if she made it clearer how a specific topic fit in with everything else that we were learning, it would have been a stronger class.",
    "The biggest strength of this class is the engagement with which Professor Fischer instructs. She is truly a phenomenal lecture and an incredible woman. She's one of the most qualified scientists in her field, yet she still manages to present very complex content in a way that feels quite accessible. I really appreciated this. I think the biggest weakness of the class was that some of the content felt like it was a bit out of Professor Fischer's area of expertise, and I felt like she kind of glossed over it and perhaps assumed background knowledge that I didn't have. For example, in the first third of the class we talked a lot about the origins of life, and she kind of breezed through a bunch of stuff that I didn't know about amino acids, proteins, RNA, DNA, etc. However, I think that she does an incredible job of explaining the things that she is an expert on, like planetary detection techniques and some of the geological history of the Earth. Overall, I think she could improve the course by making sure to go slow over some of the more memorization-heavy content, like the stuff about the origins of life.",
    "This course was fantastically organized. The lectures were very informative and matched the information on exams. Having the lecture slides on Canvas as well as a place for discussion on Piazza was incredibly helpful. Professor Fisher was great at keeping the class engaging and fun. Additionally, having a class on life in the universe taught by a prominent figure in exoplanet research is invaluable. I believe that there are few things that should be changed about this course. If anything, I felt that some sections moved a little to quickly but, other than that, I cannot think of any other weaknesses of this course.",
    "-course guide on YBB should mention that there is a ton math used in this course, way more than implied at the beginning, and you don't even get a QR for it. -the problem sets take 6-7 hours which is absolutely absurd for those of us who are not planning to be astronomy majors and just wanted to take this bc it seemed interesting -on top of the 6 hour psets we have quizzes which take several more hours.",
    "Strength: Debra Fischer is an AMAZING human. 10\/10 human being. She cares so much about her students and that really shows through in the way she has organized her course. She is always open to feedback about how to make it a better experience for all her students. Cons: Course could be tedious at times, and sometimes Professor Fischer just reads straight off the slides during lecture, which takes away some of the motivation to go. Also, the second midterm was WAY harder than the first, and that came as a surprise since we weren't warned about that.",
    "Weakness: Highschool amount of work Strength: Interesting material",
    "Professor Fischer cares a lot about what she teaches and it shows. She's able to present incredible complex information to humanities students in a way that is both challenging and accessible. Problem sets are sometimes frustrating but all doable.",
    "Lectures could be a bit more cohesive--the broader themes of each lecture could be made clearer. But overall, it's really interesting material and covers a lot in a manageable time frame.",
    "Prof. Fischer is a wonderful lecturer, and she cares so much that her students learn the material. I thought all the assignments were very reasonable, and the exam study guides were incredibly helpful. I would say the one thing I would improve is not spending any class time breaking students up into groups - I feel students don't use the time very productively. I would also be interested to learn more about the Leitner observatory, and what types of work goes on up there.",
    "This class is well taught and the information is relatively easy to understand. It would be helpful to have an idea of what questions on the exam are like. I felt that the problems on the exam are presented in a vastly different way from the problems in the homework. Having a similar balance between the two would be nice.",
    "There was a very strong support network for this class; the teaching fellows were always answering our questions, even at late hours of the night thanks to the use of the website \"Piazza\" by the class. Professor Fischer herself even answered many of the questions, which was wonderful because normally professors of large lectures aren't as engaged with every student (she was wonderful!). Whenever there was a problem with a part of the course (a software issue for example) Professor Fischer was working overtime to fix it, and I really appreciated that.",
    "The best strength of this class is Professor Debra Fischer!! She is amazing and I really appreciated how much she actually wanted us to learn. I think one weakness of this course is that it is so broad, so I didn't feel like I fully understood every topic. The workload was manageable with a pset and an online quiz almost every week. I found the 2 midterms to be very straightforward and mostly covering the things listed in the study guides we were given. The final came a bit out of nowhere in terms of unexpected questions, but overall it was fine.",
    "This course is overall a very strong one. I really appreciated the psets, the quizzes, and the study guides - they were all really helpful. I only have a few suggestions: I wish all of the quiz material had been covered in lecture, because that made the quizzes difficult at times. Also, I wish the final exam had been one with more factual answers and fewer ambiguous ones, because it was hard to know exactly what was expected of us. I know we learned the facts that would help us answer a question like \"How long do you think the human species will last?\", but in the high-pressure of an environment of a final, it's pretty stressful to answer a question like that.",
    "Very interesting material. Wish we had spent more class time going over the exoplanet detection methods.",
    "I think the strengths of this course are that the material is really interesting, the professor is clearly very engaged, and you get to learn about a broad range of things. The weaknesses are just that the class at times feels too formulaic -- outside of the really cool semester project, there isn't much outside homework, tests, and quizzes which can get somewhat tedious.",
    "Strengths: -Students gain a baseline literacy with regard to the methods and ideas involved in the study of the universe and the search for the development of life -The nature of scientific uncertainty and the tools of working with limited information are embedded in the course -Subject material is generally interesting -Professor Fischer is an extremely knowledgeable and caring instructor. Weaknesses: -Online format of homework and other assignments is annoying and difficult to work with. -Course structure is a bit disorganized, which can make it difficult to prepare for exams.",
    "The percentages assigned to each type of assignment are flawed. There are about eight online quizzes, but because of the relatively small number of questions on them and the amount they count for towards your grade, they often end up bringing your grade down. The weekly psets take hours and are not counted for enough. The major strength of this class is its predictability; almost every week, there is a pset (due Wednesdays), readings, and an online quiz. There are two midterms and a final, for which there are study guides that are pretty close to the exams.",
    "Professor Fischer is an absolute gem how does everything she can to teach this glass to everyone.",
    "The main weakness of this class is the final, which I don't think is well constructed. The questions on the Drake Equation are nice food for thought, but they don't reflect reality in any meaningful sense, i.e., they're just WAGs that students come up with. The study guide for the final is also pretty misleading, in that it doesn't lead the student to focus on the areas that will be tested on the final. People study for the final as though it will be based on the study guide, which is a pretty fair use of a study guide, but then there are tons of questions that either a) everyone presumed would not be asked because they weren't on the study guide (e.g., what are the six elements necessary for life) or b) the study guide explicitly said we did not need to know (e.g,. how many O type stars are there in the Milky Way?). People also waste a lot of time coming up with actual numbers for low, best, and high estimates of parameters in the Drake equation. People stress about how correct and precise their numbers must be, which is just not the best use of their time during Finals and also for this class. The study guide could be designed such that it emphasizes other parts of the class, such as the ones that aren't just total speculation, and the ones that students are expected to know for the final. There is a fine line between 1) asking students to synthesize information and 2) not teaching the material that will be tested. The study guide for the final is misleading and makes it seem like the final will be more like 2), which is very unpleasant for students.",
    "I'm not sure this can be avoided given the fact that the course isn't QR, but it ended up being a lot of memorization rather than problem-solving or critical thinking, at least on tests. But the class was really interesting and covered a vast breadth of material. Sometimes I felt like we were just skimming the surface about a lot of topics and not fully understanding them, but I think that's true of many intro science courses for non-scientists. The class had more strengths than weaknesses by far, though! The lectures were so engaging, clear, organized, and creative. Assignments really drove home the ideas covered in lecture, and the semester paper asked us to bring together what we learned in a creative way.",
    "Professor Fischer was amazing, the TAs were helpful, and the material was incredibly interesting and well taught. But the only thing that needs improvement is how some of the material is assessed on homeworks and quizzes. Often at times I felt like some material wasn't covered in class and when asking for help on Piazza, the responses were often things that the TAs already had knowledge of, or looked up online. The material was interesting but sometimes wasn't all available in lecture or readings and required a fair amount of online searching. At times it was like there was a bit of assumed knowledge on assignments that wasn't covered in lecture and required us to use Google.",
    "I liked the overall layout of the course into three coherent units. I think it could be improved by shortening the first unit and lengthening the third one.",
    "Strengths of this course are that the material is interesting, and Professor Fischer is really enthusiastic about astronomy and a very sweet lady. Weaknesses are that the course can seem a bit disorganized, and there is A LOT of material covered but you just don't know what is important sometimes (key concepts could definitely be emphasized more)",
    "The strength is definitely Professor Fischer. She cares so much about the class, about her field, and about her students. Without her, the class would just be another average class.",
    "The material is interesting and Professor Fischer's approach to it is interesting as well. Looking back on the semester, we systematically approached a somewhat impossible question of how do we find life elsewhere. The real strength of the course is learning how to approach questions which seem impossible to answer. As for weaknesses, the lectures sometimes felt scattered and the homework occasionally felt like busy work.",
    "Sometimes it felt like the course bounced around from place to place with no clear picture of where it was going or why. Also a better explanation of how things fit together in the course would've made more sense of many of the themes and discussions.",
    "It's a very approachable introduction to astronomy, and often, the material is fascinating. I thought the pace was good, and I never felt lost.",
    "The course material was fascinating. However the course organization (not at all a deep problem) could have been better (e.g. sometimes piazza, canvas, etc. gave differing answers to a question). Overall though, a good course.",
    "Strengths - The modules are perfectly ordered and the way everything comes together at the end with the Drake Equation was great. Weaknesses - I think the course would be made easier with an online, free textbook that caters directly to the modules.",
    "I couldn't have asked for a better course to fulfill my science credit. I learned a ton and the weakest parts of the course were the classes that Debra Ficher didn't teach (guest lectures).",
    "Debra Fischer is a phenomenal professor. She is engaging, friendly and approachable, and extremely qualified. The course itself was difficult. The workload was unexpected - we had a load of reading, a problem set, and a quiz every week, and we were not warned about how much math would be involved. The math was totally unnecessary for learning basic astronomy, and students should be warned beforehand. The course should be labeled as a QR.",
    "This is not a gut class. Weekly psets and quizzes, 2 midterms, a paper, and a final. I'd say that overall this was a good course with many strengths. The material is super interesting and the assignments were definitely doable (not super difficult). I think the busy work could be cut a bit on the psets.",
    "Many people take this class because they've always found the stars beautiful and fascinating, and thought it'd be fun to take this course. Others were looking for an intro science course that wouldn't be as confusing or difficult as, say, chemistry. A 'weakness' of this course is that it really takes up a lot of time and effort - much much more than expected. To be fair, I can't think of any part of the course that really needed to be made less unnecessarily strenuous, besides maybe a few of the quizzes, but as an aggregate this class took up a lot of time. However, it was necessary to come away with a rewarding feeling of comprehensive understanding. (This is a conflicted answer, apologies!)",
    "Strengths: Fascinating material with a great professor Weakness: Sometimes moved a bit too fast",
    "A good course for an intro to astronomy. Slightly frustrated with the last third of the course--there were too many unknowns for a solid foundation. I understand that's part of the scientific process, but it made studying difficult.",
    "The strengths of the course lay in the ambitions scope, and the really cool concept of covering the entirety of life, the evolution of planets, and how to find life. The weaknesses lay in the attempts to put everything together, which lead to strange, whiplash-inducing transition between topics and the loss of a coherent flow.",
    "One of this course's main strengths is Professor Fischer. She is incredibly dedicated to the course and to its students, and she did all she could to make it an incredible experience. Another of the course's strengths was its ability to reach students of all levels. It was accessible for non-science majors and was interesting even to students with a significant background in science. One way to improve the course might be to replace the mass extinction material with a quick unit on SETI, which would provide an interesting perspective on the search for life.",
    "The course succeeds in packing in A TON of information, from the beginning of the universe till today, from global warming on earth to possible life on Mars. I think this is also a weakness because the breadth of information made studying for every exam especially dizzying.",
    "No weaknesses, this class is amazing!",
    "Strengths: Extraordinarily inspiring. Professor Fischer taught me how to love science, and inspired me to continue on studying astronomy. Weaknesses: The course covers a huge amount of material; while we were exposed to a wide breadth of subjects, we were not able to study each in much depth.",
    "The course is pretty disorganized. The lecture slides are really everywhere and hard to understand. That said, they are very comprehensive.",
    "I think that ASTR 130 is truly a terrible course. It is poorly taught and poorly organized. Professor Fischer is a clearly a nice person and a brilliant astronomer, but by her own admission, she designed ASTR 130 to appeal to both science buffs and humanities majors. That's an impossible balanced to strike: ASTR 130 is one of the most incoherent courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "At the beginning, Professor Fischer didn't really outline how each part of the course fit into a bigger picture, which she ended up clarifying later on. We also spent a significant portion of time on exoplanets but never really had a lecture dedicated to what an exoplanet is or what role it plays in the greater scheme of the universe. (I and some of my friends also thought that we'd talk about aliens...so we were sad when we didn't lol) Overall, though, Professor Fischer clearly comes prepared to class everyday and is an avid user of Piazza, which really helped me as a student!",
    "I thought this class was overall very strong. The one change that I would make however is that it seemed that there was little incentive to attend lecture. One thing that another professor did was upload a skeleton outline of the lecture slides every week, but only upload the whole thing after the relevant homework was due which kept people coming to lecture. You might want to think about that.",
    "This class did well in offering Piazza, the quizzes, and the homeworks, they were all super useful. Lectures were well organized and presented important information. Maybe we can make do without the readings, unless we have more questions from the readings in our quizzes and homeworks, I kind of thought the readings were a waste of time since they did not offer anything new that we were not learning in class.",
    "Strengths: excellent professor, fascinating material that was still fairly accessible, helpful TA's, fair assessments. Weaknesses: assignments could be a bit open-ended and subjective, and the week-to-week workload was quite a bit. I might consider eliminating the weekly quizzes from the course assignments, perhaps making the course assignments and material more quantitative, and shorten the length of the in-class midterms. Overall though, I think the course is strong as-is.",
    "Course was good in that it was an accessible science class for non-science majors. Was interesting and challenging without being impossible or inaccessible. Was kind of a bummer because we didn't really talk about aliens at all.",
    "The strengths of this course cannot be overstated. You actually remember why you love learning again. We all had a fascination with the universe at some point in our childhood, and to actually learn about how the universe has come to be and how life has evolved in such an organized manner is a real treat. The workload was light enough to be fun but heavy enough that I still felt invested in learning the material, the study guides were really helpful for the midterms and final, the TAs were phenomenal, and Professor Fischer is an absolutely amazing lecturer. One thing I would suggest is for the times when we have small group discussions in class, have some major concepts we want to cover. I remember in one of these sessions it took almost the entire 50 minutes just to do one parallax problem. We can do more if we are expected to do more during these times! The only other major thing I would suggest is if the lectures could somehow be recorded. I understand the counterarguments: that the reason this would be bad for students would be that they feel like they can just cram the lectures before the midterms or not come to class. Consider the following however. First, I think that those that are really interested in the course material will still come to class, and I think that will make for more productive class discussions. And second, the reason it would have benefited me is because I had to miss class quite a bit as a result of out-of-town medical school interviews. Given that most of the students in the class are upperclassmen, it would have been a real blessing to have access to at least the audio for the lectures that I missed, because I feel like the notes aren't completely adequate, and also because Professor Fischer teaches them so incredibly well. Otherwise, amazing!",
    "I think this class is a strong class. I would not change much.",
    "The lectures were very interesting and I enjoyed attending class. The format of the quizzes and homeworks were enjoyable and left sufficient time to complete. Some of the work we did for the course felt somewhat like \"busy work\" and we never really touched on it for midterms or the final, but those concepts were enjoyable and the work was generally interesting.",
    "Strengths are the above -- you really get to exercise your SC skills in a whole lot of ways, so if say memorization isn't your strong suit you can shine on the equations, etc. Necessarily this course is a little scattered because it's covering so much different material -- I didn't mind that but I could see how some people might. I will say there was a major gap between the type of work on the problem sets and quizzes vs. on the exams, with the former being very specific and the latter being much more conceptual -- for example, because the exams were no-calculator we didn't get to really implement any of the equations we'd mastered working with on the homework. The paper will be a godsend for any humanities major but again, it's very conceptual and the p-sets and quizzes are much more rote memorization\/copy-pasting from the slides so I imagine it was jarring for some folks to suddenly have to develop their own strategies. Piazza is perfect.",
    "STRENGTHS: 1. An interesting, well-paced curriculum. I never felt like I couldn't learn everything as long as I devoted enough time to studying the material. 2. An incredibly dedicated professor and group of TAs. They don't have to post all the material on Canvas, but they do. They don't have to answer all our (often silly) questions on Piazza, but they doand they do it fast. Professor Fischer is amazing, and we don't deserve her. I'm so glad that she decided to teach this class. 3. Amazing online resources. Touched on above, but I'm going to keep raving about them, because they are really that good. Piazza allows students to anonymously post questions and receive answers in a public forum that any student can see, saving teachers the pain of answering the same question multiple times and giving students an invaluable resource. As far as I'm concerned, every course should have a Piazza page. WEAKNESSES: 1. None, reallyor none that anyone could change. There's a lot of material that just barely skims the surface of more interesting and complicated concepts, but this is an intro astro course designed to be followed by non-science majors; there's always going to be a lot of material like that. If anything, it's good that I'm frustrated: it means that this class has successfully encouraged me to take a higher-level astronomy course.",
    "The strengths of this course are that it is very interesting so the majority of the class attends every lecture. Professor Fischer is also very sincere and kind so she accepts student difficulty. It is an intense course workload so it is pertinent that the student stay on top of his\/her work",
    "The formats of the exams were a little unclear-- I never really knew what to expect on how the information would be tested, which was difficult. But otherwise this course was super strong! Engaging lectures and reasonable homework."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! Professor Fischer was incredible and you learn a lot of really cool things",
    "Yes, great class where you'll be amazed by the universe. Not too hard but definitely not a walk in the park.",
    "YES YES YES. This course was amazing. The amount of material covered in just three short months was astounding and I thought this was an excellent introduction to astronomy. I feel like I can now hold a conversation about astronomy and actually know what I'm talking about. ALSO PROFESSOR FISCHER IS AMAZING! What a great role model for women in STEM. I highly recommend this course to anyone looking for a science credit and anyone even somewhat curious about outer space or the origins of life on Earth.",
    "If you are really interested in Astronomy and you want to take an introductory class, I would recommend it! However, expect to put in a lot of work. There are weekly problem sets, weekly quizzes, 2 midterms, one semester paper, and one final exam.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for anyone who is interested in learning more about the universe, the Earth, and how our current environmental situation fits within the cosmic calendar, or even anyone who is looking for a fun and interesting science class. I'm definitely not a STEM major, and I felt that this class was both engaging and reasonable. If you're looking for a class that's as rigorous as Bio 101 or Chem 163, this is not the class for you; if you're looking for a gut where you can get by without going to class or studying for the tests, this is not the class for you. You will do work in this class - there's two midterms, weekly online quizzes and psets (some of which take a while), and a final and final paper. However, Professor Fischer provides study guides for every test and basically walks you through writing the paper. I think my overall opinion of the structure\/workload for this class is that work will be expected from you, but you will know exactly what the expectations are and how to succeed. If people aren't doing well in this class, it's not because they're bad at math or science; it's because they didn't take advantage of the resources or attempt to intellectually engage with the content. Overall, I highly recommend this course. I learned so much interesting stuff that I'd quite frankly never even thought about before. In fact, I've learned more new information from this class than I have from any other class at Yale.",
    "I would highly encourage other students to take this course. Professor Fisher is an incredible teacher and she genuinely cares about her students. This course forces students to think more critically about the universe and what its future may be. I think the science majors and non-science majors alike would find this course to be enjoyable and interesting. The opportunity to actually run simulations and write a paper about an exoplanet system under the guidance of an accomplished figure in the world of exoplanet research is incredible. Aside from the fascinating material and great professor, the work load in this course is quite manageable. It is by no means a gut course, but the amount of work is definitely less than some other courses at Yale.",
    "11\/10, would recommend. Especially for people who need a science credit but don't want to take an intensive biology or chemistry or physics course.",
    "-I will probably never take astronomy again, this class has ruined it. Will 100% not recommend to anyone that asks about it -the whole class has a figure it out yourself feel to it, which is extremely frustrating if you have tried to, asked for help, and pretty much been shot down, or just not responded to all together.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student! I took it for my science credit, and while it took a little more work than I was hoping, I think I got things out of it.",
    "Definitely. A must take science credit.",
    "Absolutely. Great and worthwhile way to earn a science credit.",
    "It's a great science credit! You have to be ready to work, but you learn really valuable stuff.",
    "I would definitely recommend! I knew nothing about astronomy beforehand and came out learning so much. Prof. Fischer is so wonderful, and unlike many lecturers, she cares that the students understand the material and can apply it to the world we live in. Homework and exams are extremely reasonable and easy to do well on if you put in the work.",
    "This course is a great science class where you learn about the universe. I would definitely recommend it to another student who wants to take an easier science at Yale than the typical biology, chemistry, and physics classes offered here.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Take this course if you are either a STEM major looking for a science credit or a humanities major that knows a bit about science. Science is sometimes about mathematical uncertainty. Sometimes it's about monotonously plugging in numbers. Sometimes it's about synthesizing abstract concepts into mathematical relations. It is not about the professor giving all of the answers to her students so that they can plug and chug and leave.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! Professor Fischer is amazing at her job and cares so genuinely about her students. She is very passionate about the field and her work, which had an inspiring effect on me and on others. The material is very interesting and very relevant (you'll know why once you take the course); the opportunity to learn this material from someone like Professor Fischer is not something that should be ignored. Take this class!",
    "If you need a science credit, I would definitely recommend this course. The grading is fair and straightforward, the problem sets are not that difficult, and the exam questions come directly from study guide's Prof. Fischer makes. At some points, I was frustrated with the course and my decision to take it, but by the end there is no doubt I learned a great amount and am more than thankful for the insights about our place in space that this course has provided me. Overall, I'd recommend this as a good, fairly easy, and very interesting Sc credit. Debra really is an incredible person and she does a great job (even if she is a bit disorganized at times). Her passion for the subject shines through and makes the material very enjoyable.",
    "Yes. Especially for non-STEM people, Deborah is a great professor that will help you understand complex topics very easily.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who needs a science credit and wants something that is manageable and interesting! Professor Fischer is really great and you can tell she cares about her students even though most of us were not science majors. There's work every week, but you can usually get it done pretty quickly.",
    "Take this class! You'll learn about so many different subjects - biology and evolution, ecology and environmental science, a little bit of physics and chemistry - and while you're at it, you also get to do cool things like go up to the observatory to look at stars. What's not to like?",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about the universe.",
    "If you're reading this, you are probably a humanities person looking for a science credit. You can probably find better options for your purposes. The main problem I had with this class was the amount of busywork we had to do on both quizzes and psets. I didn't feel like I was learning anything from those assignments. If you want a \"gut,\" do not take this class. It takes a lot of time without much pay-off. In retrospect, the course was not as bad as I had thought it was while doing the work. The final unit really ties things together very nicely. But don't make the same mistake as I did, i.e. thinking that this class would just teach you cool stuff about space. I did get some of that, but I was often disappointed with how much chemistry, biology, and geology we were learning. Granted it wasn't much of that, but it still felt like too much for an astronomy class, even if it is called origins and search for life in the universe. I would only recommend this course if you're taking it with friends. It actually gets kind of fun when you're doing the ridiculous psets with your friends. Debra is a very nice woman who is overqualified to teach this class. But her enthusiasm and passion were awesome. The TAs are fine, some better than others. S\/o to Allen.",
    "Take this course if youre looking for a very broad overview of our universe and the search for life elsewhere. Professor Fischer is a wonderful person and an honor to learn from. However, note that the course jumps around quite a bit and is not a very tidy summary of explanatory searches; there is a lot of uncertainty in this subject area, and the courses broad scope often makes it difficult to study effectively.",
    "No, I wouldn't. It masquerades as a gut, but actually the weekly work is underratedly time-consuming, but for dumb reasons. There are often rote calculations or simulations that need to be done, and they aren't very satisfying once done. I hated the psets, partly due to the time commitment, and also the general sense of dissatisfaction. There answer to questions I didn't know was often either \"Google it\" or \"That is beyond the scope of this course.\" The lectures, for the most part, were pretty interesting, but that was not reflected in the work outside the classroom. I do not feel I grew much as a student or person.",
    "Yes. Anyone interested in getting a survey of Astronomy and the cosmos would be a perfect candidate for this course.",
    "Yesssss",
    "IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GUT, READ THIS REVIEW. This class is work. It is not a huge amount of work, but a ton of people finish DS or are Philosophy majors or whatever and are just looking for a Science credit, and they think oh this class will not be work. I did this. This is bizarre, because Professor Fischer goes through the syllabus at the start of the course, and it is also publicly available. This class has a quiz and a homework every week; it has two midterms; it has a final and a final paper. We all knew this going in. For some reason, we like didn't believe it or something. If you understand that this class has work attached to it, and if you are willing to do this work and study for the tests, you will be fine. Professor Fischer is not looking to secretly and maliciously hurt your GPA. If you do zero work for this class and don't study for the midterms, you will probably get a lower grade than you expected\/wanted. Basically, this class is a real class, so if you take it, don't moan all the time about how you're actually doing work for it.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's a fascinating subject and the professor is so dedicated to teaching and so good at it. But you can't reason your way through tests; you really have to put in the time to memorize information.",
    "A good, fairly easy science credit, but it is not a gut. It does require effort to do well. Professor Fischer is great but if you start to struggle, get help early because the material builds off from the beginning. Still a pretty good class that I would recommend taking if you need a science credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students as an easy yet intellectually stimulating introduction to astronomy.",
    "Amazing science credit option! Professor Fischer is an unbelievable professor and you'll learn so much stuff in this course that is so incredibly engaging you'll leave wishing you were an astronomer!",
    "Yes, take it! the course goes surprisingly detailed in some areas, and the semester paper is cool. I wouldn't call it a gut due to the mean scores on the exams.",
    "You learn a lot about astronomy and the universe, so I would definitely recommend this course to an interested student. To a student trying to take this as a \"gut\" class, just be warned that the assignments are not as easy as you think they will be. The first midterm was very easy in my opinion, but subsequent homework assignments, midterm 2, and the final were much harder.",
    "Yes. It teaches you a lot and puts everything into perspective.",
    "Definitely take this if you are interested in science, space, or anything related.",
    "I would if they are interested in learning a scientific approach to finding life elsewhere.",
    "I would recommend this to another student who know they are interested in astronomy otherwise I would advise that they stick with more traditional sciences.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who would be interested in the topic. If you aren't particularly interested make sure to take it with a group of friends to distribute the workload amongst.",
    "If you're at all interested in astronomy (or if you think space is cool), this class is great. It's not really a gut, but most of the work you have to do isn't too hard. And if you're into the topics, it's not bad at all. And Professor Fischer is great!",
    "It's a really interesting course that goes a long way toward answering some huge and deep questions.",
    "Yes!",
    "The class is pretty straightforward and so I would take it if you have the time to take it. Given that this course had 9 PSETs, 2 Midterms, a Final Paper, and a Final, I would advise students with some free time to take the course. Really good way to learn the basics of our solar system and other solar systems!",
    "Yes absolutely. This is the best science credit you could possibly take. The professor is so engaging and it's such an incredible opportunity to take a course taught by the best in their field who also loves teaching it.",
    "As is, I would not recommend it. I think a few changes need to be made. The focus should be on basic facts about the universe since it is a beginner's astronomy course. There was too much detail and math involved, and for someone who is taking this to get a science credit out of the way, it was more difficult than expected. It's a great course for people who are interested in science, but I would not recommend it to others.",
    "Would recommend this class if your looking for a science credit but also willing to put in work for it. Interesting material and felt like I learned a lot.",
    "Professor Fischer is really a prominent expert and accomplished scientist in this field. But most importantly, it was an honor to learn from someone who was always willing to listen, exuded passion and enthusiasm at every lecture, and truly wanted to help her students. I definitely learned so much about astronomy this semester - although in the grand scheme of the field, we only brushed the basics. Learning about the different methods of exoplanet detection was extremely interesting - especially when we could apply it to our own exoplanetary system! The project\/paper was a great way to give the information more relevance and Professor Fischer really taught us how to both apply and question the information we knew. However, be aware that this class is not curved - you'll have to do well on every assignment in order to get a good grade. That means you'll be really invested\/involved in this class every week, which may or may not be good(depending on your view) or what you were looking for.",
    "Great Stuff",
    "An interesting SC credit for non-STEM majors. There's a trip to the observatory and it's well-taught.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The course is very interesting and covers a broad range of material in the field of astronomy. It was accessible to non-science majors but was also interesting for students with a good science background. The workload mainly consists of readings, weekly problem sets, weekly online quizzes, 2 midterms, a paper\/project, and a final. Professor Fischer is incredibly kind and dedicated to her students, and she wants to make the course as great as possible.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who isn't traditionally inclined towards the sciences; I would normally consider myself in the non-STEM category, and yet I was fascinated by the material in this course. I loved that we were encouraged to ask questions that would normally be thought of as silly, like \"what came before the Big Bang?\" or \"where does the universe stop?\" But be advised that this is NOT a gut. I think many come into this course with that perception, but know that this class comes with a considerable workload.",
    "Definitely! Debra Fischer is incredible.",
    "I'm a humanities major, but Origins and the Search for Life in the Universe was the best course I have taken at Yale. Professor Fischer is absolutely brilliant, and she managed to teach a class of mostly non-science majors how to love science, specifically astronomy. She answered most questions on piazza herself and rarely relied on TA's to answer questions by email or in class. Every lecture was fascinating and eye-opening. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!",
    "I wouldn't recommend it if you are interested in theoretical astrophysics. If you expect to be mind-blown, don't take it. Watch documentaries instead. If you want an easy A, I don't recommend it either. if you want a fun science credit to try your hand at being a scientist, I would recommend it.",
    "I would not. It is neither a gut nor an interesting science course. I took it with a couple friends, which was fun, and the TAs are sometimes helpful.",
    "I would recommend this to students interested in different types of sciences and want an overview of all of them under a very interesting and insightful context. I would recommend this to students who would like to get a science credit but are unsure of their ability to complete a harder, pure math\/science class.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Fischer cares so, so much about her students and is such a genuine person. She creates the classroom into a collaboratory space and never made me feel stupid for not understanding something as a student. The course material was fair and well-delivered, though the layout of the final was slightly confusing. Professor Fischer puts a lot of emphasis on understanding the material at large rather than worrying about grades, and although I respect this approach, I felt that it was unnecessarily forced at times (like by not revealing information on the layout of the final, for example). Overall, though, her interest in pedagogy definitely makes me respect her as an instructor. Final note: Don't think that you're going to learn about aliens in this class!! Because we didn't!!",
    "Yes. Very interesting approach to the Universe.",
    "Absolutely amazing class. One of my favorites at Yale in my seven semesters so far. I'm a science\/math kid and still found it interesting. The class is really diverse in majors and years which is great. The expectations are clear, although somewhat high (94 for an A, 90-93.9 for A-, etc). The exams were manageable, but definitely review lectures slides and homeworks. Homework was reasonable, but you should get a headstart on it so you don't get caught off guard when it's longer than usual. The weekly quizzes are a pain, but not too bad.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone, but specifically to non-science majors. This class is by no means an easy A, it will challenge you to think and Professor Fischer makes you think, you will use some math skills and learn a lot of science, but the material you learn and the skills you learn make this class so worth it.",
    "Overall, I would definitely recommend this course; this was a great course and a worthwhile way to not only fulfill the Science requirement, but to delve deeper into some of the most exciting frontiers in science. The material covered a variety of different aspects of astrobiology, from understanding the origins of life on Earth, to exoplanet detection techniques, to understanding current threats to lifes existence on Earth and other planets. This interdisciplinary approach proved to be greatly enriching and fascinating, and the entire sum of the course really helps put our existence in the universe in perspective in many ways. Prof. Fischer was a very nice and engaging professor and clearly passionate about the course material, and it was quite enriching to learn from someone who is a leader in this field. Workload-wise, the course was a fair bit on a week-to-week basis; there were weekly homework assignments and online quizzes, two in-class midterms, a final paper, and final exam. The homework assignments were not too strenuous, the TAs sections were helpful in clarifying them (Allen in particular was an excellent TA), and the final paper, while open-ended, borrowed heavily from the orbital simulations run for the homework assignments. Quizzes could be tricky, however. The in-class midterms and final were fair, though the second midterm was quite long and rushed, and all required a reasonable amount of advanced preparation. There were also sections at the observatory in September and November, which proved to be enjoyable as well. The course was generally not that quantitative unlike other courses in the Astronomy department that Ive taken (and the subjectivity\/open-endedness of the homework and final paper\/exam could sometimes prove frustrating), but I dont think this would detract me from taking the course again. It also was not overly strenuous or difficult, but did require staying up-to-date with the material and having reviewed the study guide and other materials in preparation for exams. In short, I am very glad to have taken this course, which elevated a mere Science requirement to a fascinating exploration of our collective place in the universe and was likely one of my favorites this semester.",
    "I'd recommend with some hesitation. It's a good course for non-science majors, and I liked that it was challenging but still accessible. Didn't like that there were weekly problem sets and quizzes, plus two midterms, a final, and an observatory trip. Professor Fischer is really cool and definitely knows her stuff, but often her lectures were structured in a way that didn't make a lot of coherent sense and didn't really seem to revolve around any particular point. Take the class if you're interested in space, the fate of life on our earth, and stuff like that. Don't recommend if you're not interested in it at all.",
    "Allow me to explain to you why this course has been one of the best courses I have taken at Yale, and why the negative feedback you will inevitably read in these evaluations should be taken with a grain of salt. You start out the course learning about how the universe began. It's incredibly fascinating and you immediately are sold on the material. Professor Fischer gives a few amazing lectures during shopping week and it seems like this class will be a real gut SC credit. After you've sealed your course schedule and gotten it signed, excited for what you think this course will bring in terms of an easy grade, suddenly you hit a pretty science-heavy lecture on the basis of life, from bonds to amino acids to viruses. You suddenly realize that this class is not, indeed, an SC gut, but rather a class you'll actually have to work a bit towards to get a good grade. I'M PRETTY SURE THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE ARE GETTING UPSET. Here's a disclaimer: this is by no means a gut SC credit, but IT'S NOT THAT HARD IF YOU PUT IN EVEN AN OUNCE OF EFFORT, AND IT'S SO SO WORTH IT. Professor Fischer is an absolutely incredible lecturer. She spins a narrative that takes us from the Big Bang, through the evolution of the universe, through the essential starter pack of life, and stops to ponder whether the perfect storm of factors that caused life to exist on this planet could exist anywhere in the universe. She is literally one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale, she's incredibly approachable, and she always has a smile on her face because she's just so passionate and invested in her teaching. It's so refreshing to find a professor that cares about her students and the material just as much as her research, and I loved coming to class when I could. The TAs are also phenomenal. Though there were some really nasty questions posed by some students on Piazza, the TAs handled everything with extreme poise, and the criminally underused office hours were SO helpful for the homeworks. As long as I'd thought about the questions a little bit before coming to office hours, I could get close to the right answer from the TAs, and that exponentially minimized the amount of work I had to put in. There were two midterms, a final, and an easy paper, and the study guides LITERALLY had EVERYTHING you needed to know for the tests. If you made a conscious effort to learn the material to the extent of the study guide, rather than getting it from a friend, this class was easy to do well in and incredibly enjoyable. Friends, please take this class. You'll remember how much you loved to learn as a kid, you'll get some really invaluable information from the course, and I hope you love it as much as I have. What an incredible way to end senior fall.",
    "If you need a science credit, I would definitely suggest this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student. It is very enjoyable and not overly difficult. If you are exploring different courses and don't know what you want to take, I would especially recommend this one. It will keep you engaged and you will learn a lot of great things about our universe.",
    "A good science credit for non-science majors, but it definitely covered A LOT of material. Expect to do a lot of work and learn a lot of interesting stuff about a lot of interesting things.",
    "I would recommend this course to a non-STEM student who's interested in considering the topic from the perspective of many different disciplines. Be forewarned: this class is NOT about aliens (for weeks I still had it in my calendar as \"ALIENS!\" -- despite clips from Contact it really is not going to reveal the secret discovery of terrestrial intelligence, sadly) but it is about our universe and a number of approaches to it. Sometimes the class feels like physics, other times biology, other times vaguely chemistry-like -- it's a great course if you're unsure of your strengths and want to try a bunch of different things. Definitely a little scattered and can sometimes feel like an accumulation of information, but I think that's just the nature of a big survey course. The homework is really managable and is very much 1:1 with the lecture slides, although the final paper and exams are much more conceptual so you do need to make sure you understand the topics beyond just memorizing the slides. A good balance of a lower-key Sci class that isn't just gutty and simplistic. Also Debra is absolutely fantastic -- she is so passionate and lovable and really makes coming to lecture worthwhile! (She also understands that most people in the class are not STEM folks and caters accordingly.)",
    "Absolutely. Everyone deserves to experience the ray of sunshine that is Professor Fischer.",
    "Yes i would recommend because it is very interesting and not bad of a class if you stay on top of your workload. Also cool to learn about the universe.",
    "Do not take this class. Do yourself and Yale College a favor and relegate it to the dustbin of history. The quizzes are disporportionately difficult, homeworks are pointless. You will learn nothing. If you must take this for the SC class, fine, do it. But I just want to warn you that there is way too much work for this class, which everyone knows is just a \"gut\" SC class. The worst part is that I don't think I have actually learned anything for all this work. At some point, this class was a gut. This is no longer the case. You will spend an entire module on whether life exists outside of Earth, then you will be introduced to the Drake Equation. If you look at actual scientific and statistical analysis of the Drake Equation, scientists and statisticians don't actually think is a useful tool! So why did we even use this inaccurate tool? UNCLEAR, like literally everything else in this class. Also there is a field trip to the planetarium. It is cold and take a Saturday night away from you. tldr Don't take this class unless you're a sadist."
