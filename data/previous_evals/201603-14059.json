    "I will never watch movies the same way. As a STEM major who had never engaged in analysis of film before, this course changed the way I think about plot, characters, cinematography, acting and directing. There really is no need for previous experience, just desire to push oneself beyond the superficial viewing and watch closely."

    "This class deals with interesting themes and films, but it felt disorganized and a bit all over the place. Additionally, at least half of the films dealt with the Greece and its diaspora, which isn't inherent in the title. I think greater geographic distribution of the films would be beneficial to the class.",
    "Yes, it's not bad it terms of work, and you will learn a lot while touching upon interesting topics and watching movies you haven't heard of!",
    "I loved this class! Such a cool way to talk about migration as well as an introduction into a genre of film that I had never been exposed to."
