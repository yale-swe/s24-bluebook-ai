   "comments": [
    "Surprisingly pleasant lab experience. I dislike physics, and liked this lab. Really reasonable workload for a half credit (unlike most other labs). Not mind-numbing or like following a recipe.",
    "This course will be boring. You can't help that. But, the instructors really do try to make it enjoyable. The work is minimal, and the people are all very nice. Most of you who are looking at this have to take it, so just do it. It's much more relaxing than General Chemistry labs.",
    "Very chill lab compared to most other labs you'll ever take at Yale. There is a lab practical, which is kind of difficult, but since you have access to all your previous lab reports, notes, etc. it's not as bad.",
    "The course is not meant to be exciting or fun. Most students are pre-med, so demonstrations are typically aimed at this audience. The course provides physical demonstrations of the topics described in the 180 or 170 Physics courses. This application of the concepts outside of the lectures was very helpful when trying to understand the topics. Typically, the only people who take this class are required, but I recommendit is done during the same semesters as the actual physics lectures.",
    "Regular science lab. Too much work for 1\/2 a credit. Obviously, don't take it unless you have to.",
    "Really not bad and also a bit enjoyable! take it only if you need to, but it's my favorite science lab so far",
    "Get ready to spend 10 hours each week writing up lab notes and the weekly report. (Everyone I talked to spent this much time!) This class is frustrating.The subject matter does not correlate AT ALL with the subject matter of physics 170. This is a huge problem. I had no previous exposure to the material. Even though I had an A in physics 170, I found myself getting C\u0092s on the lab write ups even though I put in extra work to try to learn the material in the labs. This was extremely frustrating.This class was among the worst I\u0092ve taken at Yale.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you need it to fulfill major or pre-med requirements. Experiments can be long, tedious, and frustrating, and the lab reports are a pain. That said, it is a manageable course and the instructors are trying to make the work load reflect the half credit that you will earn.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to, and if you're premed you have no choice. I will say that it's not too intensive, you just have to hand in your lab notes from class and a one page lab report every week. A lot of the experiments are pretty boring and you're just confirming basic laws of physics, but the lab is not too bad. The final practical was also reasonable. Make sure you get a good TA who is willing to take the time to explain concepts to you and help you work through the experiment.",
    "This physics lab was fairly easy. It's a standard physics lab that supplemented PHYS180. It helped to understand the theories that we learned in PHYS180. I think that if you're taking PHYS180, you're taking it because you have to, so then you will have to take either 165 or 205. I think if you are not so great at physics, 165 would be better suited for you.",
    "Take it if you have to, but it's not that enjoyable. Try to get an easier TA \u0097\u00a0some of them grade REALLY hard.",
    "I would say that it wasn't really necessary. It ended up being a lot of work per week, and the only lab that actually helped me with concepts was the gyroscope lab.My recommendation doesn't really matter because most people who take this class do not have a choice.",
    "It's probably a course you have to take. So, take it if you have to. Overall, not a bad lab. Weekly quizzes and lab reports become a nice consistency in life.",
    "Definitely. It was pretty chill for a science lab",
    "Very fine course, labs usually took less than 3 hours if you read the lab hand out beforehand. Out of class work is a lab write up each week which is one page (single spaced) plus graphs.",
    "Only take it if you have to, but if you have to don't stress too much. I've definitely had worse labs at Yale.",
    "Let's face it: you're taking it because you have to. It's not terrible, though. The instructors and TAs care and will help you through it.",
    "Alot of work. Only take this if you need the requirement, otherwise it's not worth the bang for the buck.",
    "If you're taking this, it's probably because you're pre-med. This was the first semester of the re-vamped course, and it was kind of rough. Though the experiments were helpful for understanding some basic concepts of mechanics, grading is pretty unfair (you turn in a pointless \"1 page addendum\" to all lab notes) and the class focuses WAY too much on error\/uncertainty. Also, why is this only a half credit?",
    "you probably won't take this class unless you have to but it's not that bad. work is totally manageable",
    "I hope you're committed to science.",
    "NO! But i mean you probably have to take it if you're a premed, so you're stuck.",
    "What is the class doing at Yale? Seriously - never have I been so appalled by the lack of purpose and structure in a class before - ever. The pre-lab quizzes are terrible, the lab experiments are mind-numbingly stupid and the teaching assistants, too, are totally insanely inept at what they do. I don't think I would have so much resentment for a class if it didn't serve such a purposeless existence, but I'm sorry, this one truly did not do anything for my educational benefit and certainly not my sanity.Also, the teachers - Casten earnestly does try and make sure the class goes smoothly and he really has made an effort to change the class, but his colleagues are total numbskulls. Sid Cahn is an absolute tool and has limited patience and a lack of any genuine concern for his students. All he cares about is showing how brilliantly genius he is with anything related to Physics and he is teaching Physics lab for crying out loud.",
    "This class is fairly easy, and was mainly a review of experiments that I did in high school physics. Make sure to get a good TA that will help you along in the process.",
    "I definitely wouldn't suggest that anyone take this lab unless they have to but it was perfectly fine. It's less work than other labs and it seems like they're making labs shorter and the work less every year because they realize that everyone's premed and no one wants to be there so that's nice.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "It is advisable not to take two labs concurently. This lab is very mechanical and time consuming.",
    "PHYS 165 is the intro physics lab. You do mechanics, kinetics, etc. It's the first lab at Yale that you will take that gives the right amount of work in exchange for 1\/2 a credit. Assignments consist of quizzes, a final, and weekly lab writeups (1 single-spaced page) that accompanies the lab notebook. The physics lab department is really nice and laid-back. There's no intense cut-throat environment. Honestly, prob. one of the best-designed lab courses that I've taken at Yale.",
    "Physics 165L is a demanding course. There is a lab report every week. The concepts are clearly explained. The final practical determines your grade basically, since it stratifies the class. Equipment used for the final practical is made available the week before thanksgiving, so there is an opportunity to practice.",
    "I would not. You will learn physics concepts, sure, but you could learn just as much via wikipedia and 10 minutes with a gyroscope. The course is too juvenile in nature, with highschool esque labs. And if they thought they could grade a true curve off of highschool labs and '1 hour' lab reports, they were mistaken. Grades were sporadic and one of the easier science classes at the school became one of the more high stress ones for many students enrolled.",
    "Not a bad class. Several things though: This class is still improving, trying to fix things from the past, etc... so, not very clear at all about what was expected. I really only knew what to turn in based on what the TA marked down on the previous week. Also this may be the fault of the lab handouts themselves, which often were not clear about what the reports needed to include. The quizzes are pointless -- please get rid of them --sometimes the questions had nothing to do with the lab material. Lab reports were nice -- but although they were supposed to be short and succinct, they didn't end up being so -- students just had to make font smaller or cram a lot into a tiny place, and they did take a good deal of time. The faculty, however, were great to work with and willing to make themselves available -- this part I really liked about the class. If you need to take PHYS lab, don't worry, take it -- it's not that bad.",
    "Just your average physics lab. A pain in the ass, but necessary.",
    "This is your basic intro lab course. It's not going to be especially interesting, but it's not going to be painful either. If you have to take it, do. If you don't...why are you taking a lab for fun anyway? Labs cover very elementary physics concepts and generally last the allotted 3 hours. One page write ups are expected after every lab, and there are pop quizes, but the work load is very manageable. The practical at the end of the semester was a bit nerve-wracking, but fun nonetheless. As I said, not so bad.",
    "If you are taking this class, you obviously have no choice.",
    "For a lab class I'd say it's pretty good. Reports are short, you work with partners and it's a good introduction to physics from a practical perspective. Follows the phys 180 material quite well even though it says it doesn't.",
    "165 is your basic partner-based physics lab. The TAs were nice and helpful but the experiments themselves could get a little tedious. You'll spend the full 3 hours in lab (and often finish calculations at home), but the intstructors do limit your out-of-class write-ups to one page. If you need a physics lab, it's an okay option.",
    "If you're interested enough in physics to want to take a physics lab, you should be taking 205, which applies the material in more creative and difficult ways. Otherwise you don't have a choice.",
    "I would summarize physics 165L as a basic physics lab that deals with the main principles of mechanics.",
    "It's not so bad, and it helps that you don't have to do a full lab report for every week. Instead, it's a one page summary\/analysis of the lab.",
    "Physics 165L is not very much work, and if you have a good lab partner it can be enjoyable. The labs themselves, however, are tedious. Also, always read the labs thoroughly before going to class and any corresponding wikipedia pages so that you are prepared for the quizzes (which often include identifying formulas).",
    "I would recommend it because it is a really easy way to fulfill your lab credit for physics. Lab reports are short and fairly easy.",
    "Pretty good for a basic lab course. Labs take no longer than 3 hours (they kick you out when time is up, but everyone finishes in time). Write-ups are limited to a 1 page summary, so there's not much work to do outside of lab, but that means you really need to pay attention and work efficiently and neatly during lab itself.",
    "this is your run-of-the-mill general physics lab - not much to say about it. If you're taking physics, you'll most likely have to take it",
    "Physics lab really isn't too bad. I think it's better than it has been in the past. The lab write-ups are short and the experiments are interesting for the most part.",
    "The physics dept retooled this lab course to include some biology applications and reduce the overall amount of work required for the course. Labs are now capped at 3 hours and there was only a 1 pg lab writeup due each week instead of a long formal lab report. The experiments were generally pretty boring, but at least the amount of work was pretty reasonable. Definitely choose your TA carefully as they can very dramatically and have a significant impact on your enjoyment of and grades in this course. Ultimately you'll take this if you have to, but please don't take this for fun.",
    "It was a good course, and from talking to students from past years, I learned how much they reorganized the labs and concepts to make the course seem more cohesive. None of the labs are particularly awesome, but all were instructive in learning about topics in physics. The labs were also fairly short in length, so most times you won't have to spend the full 3 hours in class. The final lab practical is also very fair.",
    "If you're looking at this evaluation, you've probably already decided to take this lab because it's a requirement. This class is not really difficult. There's a lot of help from TAs during the lab, and the lab reports are not very long. The most difficult thing about this class, probably, is just figuring out what is expected and making sure to include those things on your reports. There is not much guidance on what to include, and it's very frustrating to get points taken off just because you haven't included something. Also, it is important to make sure you understand why you did things in lab for the practical final.",
    "avoid.",
    "It was fun and I learned about physics!",
    "It's not the most exciting lab course, but it can be fun, and it's well organized. Not too much work.",
    "You'll probably be taking this because you are premed and thus have no choice. The final practical will be terrible, but other than that this lab is fine.",
    "I would imagine you would take this class only if you're pre-med. Regardless, it's not a terribly painful lab, compared to many others.",
    "Nope, I would never wish this upon anyone else unless absolutely necessary. Don't take it.",
    "Really fun lab, actually. The labs are really well planned and set up. The grading is a little haphazard and depends on the TA, but the course does not have much work and is really easy.",
    "You probably have to take it if you are looking at this. But it is probably the worst lab i have taken. The experiments are not interesting and there is a hard practical at the end.",
    "good class, a lot of work though for 0.5 credits",
    "Well, there's no real reason to take physics lab if you don't need it for your major or for pre-med requirements. With that said, if you need to take this lab it should be a pretty painless experience. The instructors know their constituency is roughly 95% pre-meds that don't especially want to be taking the class, so they make a real effort to keep the class reasonable. They also go out of their way to show how the material is relevant to medicine, which is pretty interesting (ie, discussing a paper and doing a demonstration that used force profiles in pulling apart nucleotides to sequence DNA.) It's a true half-credit lab, meaning you'll probably be putting in half the time into it as your other classes. The lab reports are one page (yes, ONE PAGE) long. You can expect to spend about 3-5 hours on this class each week, including the lab report and reading the next week's handout. My TA was very laid-back and helpful, so the lab environment was pretty enjoyable. The final--a lab practical--I actually found pretty interesting, and I realized that I actually learned some useful techniques during the semester. Overall, if you need this class for a requirement, just take it and you'll be fine.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. The write-ups were nitpicky and time-consuming.",
    "It is a lot more work than a lot of one credit classes but it is fun to apply what you have learned from the classroom to real life.",
    "don't take unless you need to",
    "Yes, but only if you need to.",
    "I was a good introductory course, although TA's usually differed in their expectations. The lab reports were very doable (one page), though the lab write-ups were long. Whether you enjoy the course or not really depends on your TA and your love for the material.",
    "Good course. Learned some interesting concepts and saw some great demonstrations. The revised class now doesn't lend as much information in the procedures anymore so it take a lot more effort to understand what to do in lab, but it's manageable.",
    "You probably have to take this class for Pre-Med requirements so there is no point in recommending.",
    "If you're thinking about it, then you'll have to take it.",
    "substantially more fun and enjoyable than chemistry lab!",
    "If you have to take it you have to take it!",
    "Great lab - if you like physics (and even if you don't) you will learn a lot. The class does have a pre-med vibe, even though I am pre-med and found the physics interesting. The lab handouts are very clearly written - which is great - it really helps learn the physics at hand, and even helped me learn concepts for PHYS180. Take very good lab notes (to hand in), and each week you also hand in a one-page (nice and to-the-point!) lab summary.",
    "I found this lab course very helpful alongside Physics 170. The topics complimented the coursework well and provided a better understanding of the material covered. I would recommend this course for students taken physics. Good lab for pre-meds.",
    "No I would not recommend this to another student. It is absolutely horrendous class at Yale. Avoid it and take something better.",
    "The demos are fun and this lab is not a lot of work. It will probably be one of the better labs you take at Yale since they try hard to keep the work level to a minimum.",
    "Physics 165L is a well-structured course to test and enhance your understanding of universal physics principles. Some people see it as a necessary evil, but I thought it was a pretty enjoyable experience that definitely managed its objectives. The workload isn't too bad, as you only have to type a 1 page summary every week (assuming you take good lab notes in class, which I strongly suggest you do), and I would also suggest you study the labs ahead of time so that you know what you're doing in lab. I would recommend it to anyone taking Physics 170 or 180, and if you're just a premed taking it because you have to, I suggest you not set such low expectations for the lab course and try to make the most of it. You will learn a lot, and you'll probably enjoy some of it too, as long as you aren't set on disliking this course from the start.",
    "It's a pretty good lab course, probably designed as well as an intro physics lab course can be. The instructors really care about making the work in the course as much as a real half-credit course workload should be. You have a one-page lab write-up after every lab, which serves as a lab summary\/results\/conclusion. You also have to make sure your lab notes are complete, though, which I often couldn't finish in lab, so that will take up some time as well. The lab practical was designed really well--it was actually kind of enjoyable to solve the problems with what you know and learned!",
    "Physics 165 was one of the less pleasant lab courses I've taken at Yale. The labs themselves are usually not very interesting, repetitive and generally painful in terms of trying to collect good data. The course is well taught however, and most of the work is done in class, with only 1 page lab reports due every week.",
    "You would probably only be taking this lab for major or pre-med requirements. If so, it's not a bad lab with about as much work as an average lab course. The practical is particularly challenging.",
    "A very nice course. Lab handouts were a bit long and tedious, and the new lab handout format tried very hard to get away from the \"cookbook\" type that they ended up making an entire lab handout sometimes without telling us what to do at all. The TA's then had to explain the entire lab on the board, which is a little silly when the procedure could be in the handout. Overall though, the TA's and professors are very nice, and made the class fun and lighthearted. The practical exam was the only difficult part of the course, and it was overly ambitious.",
    "If you have to take an intro physics lab, just take this one. The experiments are quite simple, and everything you could possibly need to know is explained in the lab handout. The only out-of-lab requirement is a one page addendum which will take you 30 mins to write, max. The other labs don't require anything out of class, but the experiments are more involved and poorly explained and all around more stressful. No one ever had trouble finishing the experiments in my section.",
    "Only if you have to. Lab reports aren't bad at all, just 1 page, but the 3 hours labs are really tedious and not particularly interesting. 3 hours is just way too long for such boring experiments.",
    "Yes, since greater insight into concepts covered in class was gained. Those not covered, however, did not seem to be necessary or significantly insightful.",
    "I mean, you take it because you have to.",
    "Short lab reports, difficult to get a good lab report grade.",
    "take for requirement over 205L",
    "Physics 165L is a long-time work in progress for the physics department, and I think they're really heading in the right direction with this course. They've worked hard to edit the protocols and for the most part it shows. Some experiments are painful, the latter ones not as much. Figure out what the TA's are looking for in a lab report, and you will survive. I appreciate the work and enthusiasm the instructors put into the course and will own up to liking physics lab from time to time this semester.",
    "The lab itself wasn't bad. I actually quite enjoyed most of the experiments, and had a great lab partner so time passed quickly. My experience, however, was tainted by my TA, Eric Norrgard. If possible, I would seek out a different TA who has more consistent grading policies and vocal teaching style.Lab manual is nicely laid out and lab practical was very doable. There is nothing in this lab that should intimidate you. You will probably take this if you have to; I would posit that it's not thrilling enough just to take because you 'feel like it.'",
    "Take it if you have to. They have actually taken great effort to make sure that this lab is not as painful as it was in the past (6 hour labs!!!). It is enjoyable, and the assignments do not take a horribly large amount of time.",
    "It's aite I guess. Got a decent grade in the class (I think) despite getting scores that might seem lower than normal. Avoid Eric H. The lab practical is where most of the grades get determined I think. Collisions lab was really long but some are really short too.",
    "It's ok. One-page reports. Do lab notebook write-up in class so you don't have to spend alot of time on it outside of lab.",
    "The lab reports are graded harshly. If you always do things last minute, you can get away with a B+ in the course.",
    "Phys165L is a basic intro physics lab. It is light years less painful than other labs in the Chemistry and Biology departments, and the workload is very appropriate for a half credit. I would highly recommend the lab, even if your major only requires you to take physics lecture. If you're pre-med, you gotta take it; it's less like chugging the cough syrup that other pre-med labs can be and more like swallowing a spoonful of sugar. What a relief.",
    "If you have to take a physics lab, PHYS 165L is a good choice. It is a well-run lab and was not very difficult. The experiments were not that interesting but they do teach you about basic principles and at times I felt like I learned more from the lab than my actual class. Every lab can be completed in two hours if you work efficiently. Make sure to get a good partner and it will make lab a lot more fun. Woody was a great TA so try to get him!",
    "Yes, the labs were fun to do and the write-ups were just a page long.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this lab to other students. It's a fun lab and not a lot of work.",
    "Phys 165L is a good intro lab. It covers a lot of material, but by the end you really feel you have learned a lot of physics and that you are able to design your own experiments to discover\/verify useful physical information. Prof. Casten is great at making the material interesting (i.e. designing the experiments and writing the lab handouts)and easy to understand, so I highly recommend taking this course. Grading will be difficult, but you'll just have to try your best when writing the reports.",
    "Most people will probably take it as a prerequisite. So, if you do take it, expect it to be a very reasonable, fair amount of work. In fact, I found it relatively less work than many of the other lab courses I have taken. The labs, grading& assessments are generally very fair. Though, be careful of the TA you get. I think someextra effort will have to be taken on the student's part to ensure that s\/he truly understands the concepts well.",
    "I wouldn't take this Physics Lab unless I had to. The experiments are dull and long. Some experiments did help me understand concepts from lecture, but most were annoying.",
    "yes, if you are pre-med",
    "PHYS165L was a well-intended course that fell quite short of the mark. Though I never really had high hopes for a physics lab course, especially after seeing how mind-numbingly dull and unhelpful the lecture course (PHYS180), this course was the least looked-forward to 3 hours of my entire week. My partner and I spent the three hours either attempting to make the most perfect graphs on LoggerPro to try to satisfy the instructors, or waiting with the rest of the class for the TA to clarify something that was simply left out of the handouts. Overall, I'd only recommend this course if you've already shopped PHYS205L and decided that that was too difficult for you. Also, only if you're fairly certain about being premed.",
    "This class is a basic physics lab for premeds. Unless you have to take it because you're premed, don't.",
    "Great course. I had Scott as a TA and he was wonderful! Was a lot of fun : )",
    "It's a pretty standard intro physics lab course. If you're in 170, the material is not going to overlap very well at all, but it's not a problem. Some labs are certainly more interesting than others (the heat lab is kind of a pain, for example), but that's to be expected. Having to do only one-page addendums instead of full lab reports is definitely a plus. The final practical exam is not too bad, either, and at least it's something different from your more standard paper finals. Chances are, if you're taking this class, you have to, but it's not terrible.",
    "Good couse. They've scaled back the work so it's more about learning the concept and less about tedious calculations. As long as you do your work each week and talk to the TA about what they are looking for then you will do well. The quizzes are not bad either."
