    "Although this class was probably more interesting than the \"gut\" science classes (Issues Approach, Biological Anthro, etc.), I don't think that outweighs the fact that it was a pretty difficult class just to get the science credit. It wasn't a lot of WORK per se--the readings weren't that necessary, and there were just a couple of quizzes, a midterm, and a final paper\/presentation--but most of the other kids in the class were pretty smart and as such the quizzes were all pretty hard, so I feel like this class might tank the old GPA with not that much benefit for me. Grading\/difficulty aside, it's not a bad course, but not really a great one either--at times the classes could be interesting, but at times they would just be kind of reading off the slideshow, memorize some stuff for the next quiz. In hindsight, I probably wouldn't take this course unless you are really interested in the subject matter (i.e., want to go to Africa this summer to work on public health or something). But if you're just looking to get the science credit and think, \"Oh, this sounds pretty neat\" I would reconsider. although it's not the worst option.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. You may think that it will be a painless way to get a Sc credit, but that is not the case. I found myself bored with the topic of vector-borne diseases by the end of the class, the readings were abysmally dry and unhelpful, and the quizzes seemed impossible. The professor feels that memorization should not be the way to study for the quizzes and midterm (as there should be a \"synthesization of material,\" in addition to understanding the \"big idea\"), but you'll find yourself studying the minutiae in order to do well. The assessments were too abstract, and the professor was not clear about what she was looking for, in terms of answers. The best part about this class was the lack of the final, but that was perhaps its only redeeming quality.",
    "HLTH 155 is an excellent seminar, definitely take it if you can get it. The heaviest focus is on malaria and lyme disease. There is more of a science component than I expected which was challenging but rewarding; it is designed for non-science majors so despite there being a focus on biology, Professor Belperron teaches it in a way that is very understandable. Professor Belperron is extremely accessible, accommodating, and understanding.",
    "Overall, this was a really good course: I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student, especially if you're a non-science major who has had disappointing experiences with distribution reqs in the past. This class is the perfect balance: interesting and just challenging enough to help you learn, but not so difficult that it will frustrate you or take up all your time. As Prof Belperron says, it's not a gut: you learn a lot of valuable things, learn to think critically about the material, and engage with your classmates and the professor. Strengths: the material is fascinating, and Prof. Belperron presents topics in a very approachable way; assignments are well-spaced and fair; the small format of the class allows participation but also a fair amount of lecture-style learning. Professor Belperron is really enthusiastic about getting to know students, and is passionate about the subject matter, and knows how to adjust it to a non science audience. Weaknesses: hard to think of many. I didn't find the reading questions particularly helpful: in general, the readings weren't the most thrilling. But the class material makes up for that!",
    "I would recommend the course for students who are very, very interested in the topic as the information on diseases, hosts and vectors can get dry quickly.",
    "Great class for non-science majors looking for a science credit. It's not a gut, but it has a very manageable course load and covers an interesting subject.",
    "This is a really great science class for non science majors. I now understand the immune system and have gotten a deeper understanding of policy related to combatting large scale diseases. I recommend this class, it is not a whole lot of work and the material isn't that hard to grasp. There are many tests and quizzes but they are curved and one of them isn't weighted particularly heavily. The professor is an upbeat and helpful person. :)",
    "Great course for non-science majors--but this is definitely not a gut. If you have some background in biology and are willing to put in the time to study for the rather difficulty quizzes and midterm, this will be a valuable class, especially if you're interested in global health. Prof. Belperron is great and goes the extra mile for her students.",
    "It's a very cool class covering an interesting subject, just be prepared to memorize a lot.",
    "This course is a great overview of vector-borne diseases and the challenges that come along with trying to prevent them. By the end of the course one does not know about every vector-borne disease, but instead some of the major ones and how they are examples of ways of approaching treatment and prevention.",
    "This class is certainly not a \"gut,\" but for non-science majors looking for an interesting biology class in which they will learn a lot (you will be a malaria, dengue and lyme EXPERT!)- TAKE IT! You need to study for quizzes and be very prepared for the midterm, but professor Belperron's expectations are reasonable given her teaching style. The readings were pretty supplemental. Everything you need to know you learn through class lectures and discussion, though you will do better if you do the readings and get an idea of how things work before the lecture. If you pay attention, study, and contribute to class, you should enjoy it and do alright. Belperron is a tough grader, but she is fair, and gives as much partial credit as possible, which is much appreciated.",
    "This course teaches about the mechanisms involved in vector-borne diseases from vector, host, and prevention -centric perspectives. It is applicable for students who are interested in science, but may not have committed to a STEM major. As a public health enthusiast and HSHM major, I found this course to be relevant to my interests. The course is challenging and requires participation and in-class focus, but it is possible to do well if one \"sticks with it\" until the end."
