    "French 314 is a class based on the deep and rich knowledge Edwin Duval has of Renaissance French lyric poetry. I have a hard time envisioning French 314 without Professeur Duval. It is a small class for people who want to read challenging material seriously. Do not take this class to slack off; it is not a great amount of work, but the work required needs to be done thoroughly and well. If you like French poetry, this class will be a great pleasure for you.",
    "Yes! It is a difficult course so i would recommend it if you are fluent in French and are majoring in french. Be prepared to write a lot of essays (4) and to have a final exam on poems you've read throughout the semester.",
    "Survey of 16th and 17th French poetry...if you're not interested in the topic\/material, be wary, because the readings are pretty dense. Four short (3-4 pp) analysis papers and a final. Prof Duval is a nice guy, and provides very extensive feedback on written work. Since this is a small seminar, be prepared to talk a lot (however, you can still get away with not doing all the reading, since the poems are generally short enough to read in class as you discuss them).",
    "This is a great course for someone who has background in reading poetry in general, especially poetry of this time. Also having a general knowledge of the Greek and Roman gods helped students comprehension. If you didn't have this knowledge you had do even more work. Also a small class so you are always noticed.",
    "Pretty much exactly what it says on the tin. Prof. Duval is very knowledgeable and generally good about stepping back when students start discussing. He's also a tough grader: there's a very specific kind of analyse de texte that he wants. Get ready for a lot of reading, though: I personally lost interest in the middle (so much du Bellay and Ronsard), but that was more due to me and my feelings on the middle poets than any failing of the class."
