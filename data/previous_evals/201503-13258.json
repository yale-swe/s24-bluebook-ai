   "comments": [
    "Topics are interesting.",
    "good - get to know what is happening in the field in a global context",
    "",
    "i wish the speakers were better",
    "Great seminar! Weakness: Don't order take out from Panera, I think those were the most disappointing dinners.",
    "I thought the course was really great. Michael and the Global Health Working group did a nice job finding speakers whose interests spanned across many topics within public health.",
    "The speakers varied in quality. The best ones were the people from outside Yale in order to get a non-academia perspective.",
    "Loved it!!!",
    "The course is a wonderful introduction to some core topics related to global health. The seminar did a wonderful job bringing in interesting speakers, however, I felt that there could have been more time left to engage with these accomplished speakers.",
    "The course hosted a wide-range of speakers who discussed global health topics. The majority of the speakers were engaging, however it would be beneficial to see a wider range of topics. Many of the speakers were from the same regions of the world and had similar research topics. In the future, it would be great to see speakers from other areas such as Latin America who discuss different topics related to sexual and reproductive health and other areas.",
    "Average. Strength: - Gave a structured setting to listen to different aspects of global health. - We appreciated the dinner. :) Weaknesses: - Should have given students brief reading material, other than presenter's bios, so that we could come more prepared to the lecture. - Should have listed ways to get involved in the topic area.",
    "Ok course. I think the speakers could be a lot more engaging and go into a lot more depth than they did. I felt a lot of the topics presented were scratching at a surface, and I think it would have been a lot more engaging if they went into a lot more depth.",
    "Very interesting topics and great lecturers. Fantastic dinner served after the seminars.",
    "Very very very very good guest lecturers (with 1 or 2 exceptions). 1 or 2 guest lecturers were sleep-inducing machines. The free food at the end of each talk was a great +.",
    "This course covers a wide-range of interesting topics and is a nice introduction to different global health topics.",
    "This seminar series was pretty solid, some of the speakers were better than others especially in the beginning.",
    "Excellent",
    "Great course with a great selection of speakers and discussion topics.",
    "I think it's hard to group all interests in the general category of global health under one umbrella. There were lectures that I enjoyed, like the ones on mental health, and lectures that I could not force myself to pay attention to. I don't know how much I really got out of the lectures in general. I like that there was not required work outside of the classroom because it allowed the lectures to be for enjoyment, but I also think this reduced the motivation to give my full attention. I also think the objective behind the lectures was fuzzy, some of them I didn't know how they related to me or my interests at all. I think a better way to do it would be to give students in the global health concentration a list of the speakers and make it required to go to five of them, and then have students write a reflection about connecting the different lectures that applying them to their careers as public health professionals.",
    "Overall, the seminars were very insightful.",
    "Excellent speakers who were all very engaging. Weakness: Too heavy an emphasis on infectious disease. I would be very interested in hearing more from people who have helped develop health care infrastructure in developing countries or who have worked in the fields of Surgery and Ob\/Gyn.",
    "I liked the diversity of topics presented and the current relevance of them. I felt like they tried really hard to bring in speakers that we would want to hear from.",
    "Great course! Loved the variety of topics we were introduced to, as well the guest lectures."

    "Recommend it",
    "Yes, it is great to hear directly from speakers working in the field of global health.",
    "A mixed bag -- some of the speakers were really really great, and some were pretty boring. I guess it's hard for the team to know in advance who's going to be a good public speaker and who isn't? Still, the topics were pretty interesting. Night class is kind of unfortunate, however.",
    "",
    "if you are unsure if you want the GHC or not, just go to the seminars because there are some interesting ones (though there are a lot of uninteresting ones) and there is dinner, which makes any monday better.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I think these types of seminars are great ways for students to be introduced to the many niches that make up public health.",
    "Not all lectures will be of interest to you, but you have something to learn from each one.",
    "Really great speakers.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interesting in pursuing a career in global health. This course provides a wonderful opportunity to network with not only Yale affiliated researchers, but also professionals throughout the field. The information learned on various topics is very pertinent to issues any global professional would face today.",
    "This course hosts seminars related to global health topics. I would recommend it to students, especially if they are interested in global health and engaging with professionals in the field.",
    "I wouldn't recommend signing up for it. I would recommend keeping track of the speakers and coming to any lecture that is of special interest.",
    "Yes I recommend it! Very interesting and not time consuming, so you just soak up the learning!",
    "Yes. Just do it.",
    "This course is a fun, no work class where you can listen to lectures each week across interesting global health fields.",
    "This is required for MPH students in the global health concentration. It is pretty solid and not a huge time commitment. All that is required is attendance to the speakers.",
    "Excellent",
    "Very insightful and thought provoking. A chance to meet and listen to a lot of relevant personalities in Global Health. I would recommend to anyone interested in Global Health.",
    "Some parts of this course are fascinating and others are dull. It all depends on the individual and his\/her interests. Personally, I don't think I got that much out of the course, but I am sure other did.",
    "There was a lot to learn and opportunities to network. The seminars may not address exactly what your interested in learning regarding global health and could be representative of other major topics and theme surrounding global health.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. This was a great seminar series with exposure to excellent speakers.",
    "Interesting lecture series covering a wide variety of topics in global health. Great for putting health into a global context regardless of where you will end up working (i.e. even if you plan on staying in the states and never doing international work).",
    "Would recommend everyone to take this course."
