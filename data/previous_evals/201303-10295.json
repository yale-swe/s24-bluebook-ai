   "comments": [
    "I would 100% recommend this course. It will teach you so much about important current topics that you may know a little about but want to learn more. The structure is really cool if you're mind is okay jumping around every 3 weeks and the lecturers are all very accomplished, knowledgable people.",
    "I would recommend this to a student who is looking for a pretty broad overview of several popular global affairs issues. I really enjoyed the course as a whole, and I think that I learned a lot of practical knowledge from it about current events and writing policy memos. The instructors were all good, especially Generals McChrystal and Lamb and Professor Sky. Take this course! It's also an easy workload.",
    "Great introductory class, but modules might be disconnected.",
    "This course was fantastic! I came away with such a greater perspective on global issues. The readings were sometimes heavy, but the lectures were all absolutely fantastic. Take this course!!!!",
    "If you are interested in global issues--whether or not you feel informed about them--GLBL 101 is a fantastic sampler platter of the pressing issues that our world faces right now. These problems, largely speaking, are ones which our generation will most likely need to solve. The great thing about this course is that that's exactly what they have you do. The course is separated into four modules, each on a different world issue, and each culminating in a \"Policy Memo,\" in which students must formulate a cohesive argument in favor of a certain policy or against a certain proposed solution. If you take this class and put in the required effort (that does NOT mean you have to do 100% of the readings), you WILL leave a better thinker and a more informed citizen.",
    "It was not the best class, but it wasn't the worst either. I would take it if it fits well into your schedule and you want to learn about the topics.",
    "This class is great introductory course for anyone who wants to pursue a global affairs major or who just wants to learn more about global affairs in general. It whets the appetite and leads students to want to learn more about the issues they are introduced to in class. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking to get an introductory look at international issues. It covers several topics and is, for the most part, very interesting. There are very long readings, but the work load other than that is minimal. Some modules are better than others, but even the bad ones only last a few weeks. If foreign policy seems kind of interesting to you, but you don't know much about it, I would give this class a try.",
    "Look through the module descriptions in the syllabus carefully. It all depends on your familiarity with the material. If low, then I would probably say yes. If medium to high, then no. This course won't blow you away but it will force you to engage with pretty interesting literature.",
    "Yes. You get to hear from some interesting people in the field.",
    "Global Affairs is a good taste of four very different topics. Be prepared to cover each of them in 6 lessons, but I think you definitely get a feel for each topic. The transitions between each module are quick, so be prepared for the transition. Try to understand overarching concepts so that the modules will come together for you by the end of the course. The most important skill to take away from this course is probably the policy memo writing, and that's what makes up most of the coursework. Definitely consult with your TA for clarify on what s\/he wants from you. This is good practice for an important skill that you'll probably use if you're interested in policy at all.",
    "100% Recommend -- for the professors of each module. They are INCREDIBLE. Such accomplished people, it's a true privilege to learn from them. The lectures can sometimes go slow and sometimes get complicated, so make sure you find other people in your class (who will inevitably exist) who definitely know whats going on and can help break it down for you. But it is definitely a class worth taking, if not for the material than for the teachers. It's a cool intro class into a few specific topics, but if you're looking for a general IR background it may not be for you. It's only on 4 topics so make sure you are ok with only learning about these 4 things. Ultimately the lessons learned from these topics can be applied to situations in the future (and in the present), so it's really a great class.",
    "No- I felt as though the topics were so broad that I came away with a very very superficial view of certain issues. I guess this was the purpose of the course but I found that unsatisfying.",
    "GLBL 101 is an interesting course: It is structured as 4 \"modules,\" for each of which the University brings in a different expert from around the world, you learn from them for three weeks about a topic, write a policy memo, then move on. The lectures were usually pretty good (I mean, you won't be able to learn from General Stanley McCrystal in any other undergrad course...), although in the middle of some lectures they were a bit dry and kids wouldn't show up. The course will assign a ton of reading, but don't be intimidated; you only have to write memos and literally no one does all the reading (30-50% will suffice). It's not that hard of a course, and it's pretty interesting: I feel more prepared to make educated policies going forward after taking this course. Also, if he is still a TF next time they offer this course, try to get Michael Eastman: he is brilliant and cares about his students.",
    "This is a fairly easy, straightforward class that nevertheless does a great job of getting you to appreciate the complexities and challenges faced by those making big decisions. It shows that the question often isn't between right and wrong but rather between options each with their own right and wrong aspects, and which you should choose given that they're all flawed in their own ways.Furthermore, each of the subjects is pretty interesting while doing a great job of embodying the theme of the course. Afghanistan to AIDS to global warming to the Middle East, all subjects are interesting and will teach you things you didn't know, even if you're well versed in them already.I wouldn't say that this course will particularly stand out in the catalogue of courses I've taken at Yale, but it is definitely a solid class that doesn't require much work while still providing valuable intellectual stimulation.",
    "GLBL 101 was a really great class. You get to learn about four different modules within the semester. Although this gives you an introduction to a wide variety of global current issues the broadness of it prevents an in depth analysis of any of the topics. The TAs are all excellent - they are all available to help with the policy memos and preparation for the final. There was a lot of reading assigned and if you want to be able to write the policy memos and be prepared for the final you have to do the reading. Some of the reading (especially in the Afghanistan and Middle East modules) were kind of irrelevant but other than that most of them gave you the information needed to tackle the policy memos and the final.",
    "Take it if you think you do not really know what is going on in the world and wants to start out with a overview into what studying global affairs is like. If you want to delve deep into a discussion of a very well-planned topic in a intensive seminar, this is not the class. This is a good class for anyone else to want to get an overview though.",
    "Offers a good overview of four current issues, but the class is a bit disjointed between modules. There is little time to actually dive deep into the complexities of some of themodules (e.x: the Middle East). A copious amount of reading (but you can get away not doing it). The main takeaway is how to write a good policy memo.",
    "definitely take it, very interesting to learn about current global issues.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend this class to another student. Much like other large lectures, I did not really gain a useful skill and I only learned facts which I could have gotten from reading a newspaper, at the end of the day. If you are looking to take a class with big names, like McChrystal, where you can often skip lecture with no consequence and still succeed in the end, this is a good choice. If you are looking to further your understanding of the world or gain critical thinking skills, this may not be the best choice.",
    "This class is great for somebody who is interested in gaining more perspective on the presented issues.I would highly recommend this class, the only downside is that it does not count for anything.Students should not be thrown off by the amount of reading because you can still do well without completing all of it.",
    "Global Affairs 101 is a great introduction to the resources available at Yale and was particularly helpful in learning how to write a policy memo which will be an indispensable skill moving forward with Global Affairs courses.",
    "An incredibly interesting course that briefly yet thoroughly delves into 4 separate topics: Counter-insurgency in Afghanistan, HIV\/AIDS, Climate Change, and the Modern Middle East (with a large focus on the Israeli Palestinian conflict). I would recommend it to anyone genuinely interested in attending the lectures and doing the readings.",
    "Awesome course!! Global is an excellent survey course if you want to analyze real life situations and complex problems, really dig deep, and think of creative new solutions to solve them. Don't take it if you're not willing to do the reading though, because it's important to really help you understand the larger picture. The lecturers can be pretty hit and miss, with some definitely not being as good, but it's almost just worth it to take it for the Generals and their Afghanistan unit in the begining!! Final wasn't too hard, just general essay questions. You'll be having really engaging conversations with smart peers in section about things that actually happen and matter, not just theory. Definitely recommended.",
    "I would recommend global affairs to another student, especially if they're interested in the global affairs major. It's also cool to have such incredibly qualified people teaching.",
    "GLBL101 does the best that it can for an intro class. Four topics in a short semester is quite a lot to take on. Some modules' lectures (AIDS and the Environment) were weak and didn't add much from the assigned readings, but the other modules with the Generals and Prof. Sky made the class worthwhile. In some modules the readings are a bit heavy, but they are all relevant which makes it interesting. I would recommend this course, but with caution-- the lectures vary a lot so be prepared to be inspired one week and (unfortunately) bored the next.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, one either interested or not interested in Global Affairs. While the course does have a great deal of reading (approximately 100 pages per class), the course offers insight on topics one otherwise would never learn about. In addition, the guest speakers and lecturers are experts in their fields in the modern day world. What more could one ask for?",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone. It teaches you a lot about the world, and you get the chance to experience some very renowned speakers.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. The course covers four current topics are is incredible interesting. The policy memos take a significant amount of research and analysis, but they are also very helpful in understanding the modules. The information I have taken away from the four modules is very beneficial in becoming an informed citizen.",
    "GLBL 101 is a good introduction into the topic, and the lectures\/modules are generally interesting. The modules change from year to year though, so I would check the syllabus to see if the material interests you. The class was great since it helped introduce me to the policy memo format, and I thought that writing them was very helpful. Sometimes the readings can be a bit excessive and that can cloud what you are learning. It's also sometimes a hit or miss with the lectures as well. Definitely take it if you are interested in the Global Affairs major.",
    "A a course that shouldn't be taken by anyone who are truly in pursuit of scholarship. If you're interested in IR, then take Intro to IR by the Poli Sci department. I mean, why would you take the former (which has barely been started for some years and still needs major improvement) over the latter, which has been well-formulated by some hundreds-year-old department??? The only reason is the hype about General McChrystal teaching the class. Alas, as anyone with experience will tell you, fame doesn't always translate to good teaching. Furthermore, as remarked, Global Affairs hasn't figured itself out yet. Indeed, I will, for your and the major itself' sake, I'll go as far as saying that they hire McChrystal to mask their own insecurities and flaws. Academic marketing is a thing. Think about it, this is the former commander of an entire US counterinsurgency operation in Afghanistan! someone who clashed with the president when he's declined the number of troops needed to fight the war! Why makes him teach a fleeting and pretentious intro 4-weeks module of Afghanistan (which ANY good professor in the subject can do well) while we could have had him teach about counterinsurgency effort and that subject alone for an entire semester?! That, Yale, is how a major institution utilizes resources. In short, Global Affairs is a hollow program that tries to markets itself with great big famous people who either don't know how to teach or have to teach rudimentary stuff that a normal prof can do at better job at. So decide for yourself. (And if you're that much into McChrystal, just come to lecture without being in class and talk to him afterwards, he's a cool guy otherwise. I even have a silly picture with him an General Lamb at the end lol).",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in international policy, because it gives you a little synopsis of some major issues. Also it's awesome to have such esteemed lecturers. I wouldn't recommend anyone take it just for fun, because if you aren't interested in international policy I imagine it would get boring and possibly frustrating.",
    "Gateway to Global Affairs is great for giving you an introduction into a breadth of topics you otherwise might not have as much exposure to. There is a lot of reading though, so be prepared to figure out how to skim!",
    "This class is most relevant for people who are interested in majoring in global affairs, even if you're not a freshman. I was a sophomore and not entirely sure whether or not I wanted to apply for security or development, and this course helped me decide very easily. On top of that, most the lecturers are extremely interesting as people and learning from their experiences is so worth i. Even though I was only interested in the first and last modules, I would say it's worth taking if you're interested in global affairs.",
    "Interesting class, though lectures can sometimes be boring. There is an insane amount of reading, but not all of it is necessary. The TF you have makes a big difference, as a great TF really makes the class much more interesting.",
    "Gateway to Global was a fantastic class! The rotating guest lecture format, policy memo assignments, and debate-based sections made this fast-paced course unique and extremely rewarding. The guest lecturers are all insanely well-qualified in their fields, very talented at teaching, and enthusiastic to engage with students (both inside and outside of class). The Teaching Fellows are also far more knowledgable and better qualified than the typical TF. They primarily use section to foster debate amongst students, delve deeper into the nuances and minutiae of the module at hand, and draw interesting parallels with current events. I actually looked forward to section each week. I can honestly say I learned more from this course than from all my others courses combined. Take this class!",
    "Not too hard and interesting! Take it if you're looking for a broad perspective on interesting issues.",
    "A course that varies in quality depending on the topic and educators of each module, but is an overall good class for someone considering the Global Affairs majors. There is very little out of class work besides the four policy memos spread throughout the semester. Making the memos is easy as long as you have a good section that helps you break down ideas for each memo. If you are not interested in multiple parts of international relations, I would not suggest this to you. However, if you want to explore the different parts to discover what aspect of global affairs you like the most, this is the best course for you.",
    "This is an engaging lecture course, and while some lecturers are drier than others, each unit is interesting and effectively taught. Some of the subtopics are a bit basic and involve common sense, but the course challenges you to formulate opinions both in discussion and in policy memos. At the end of the course, you will be able to think, speak, and write about your opinion on these topics in an educated if general fashion. Even if the global affairs major isn't for you, I would recommend the course for that reason, though the reading tends to pile up and usually is pretty superfluous to what is going on in class\/section\/papers.",
    "This is a great survey course to take and it gives you a really broad view of what exactly falls under the title of Global Affairs. Even if you are not in the major, it is a wonderful way to acquaint yourself with relevant things happening in today's world. It also covers a bunch of different topics, so you are bound to like something. The guest professors and TAs are all really special people with experience in the field, so it is worth taking just for that purpose. I wouldn't say there is a lot of writing, and I definitely wouldn't say it is creative writing, but if you really don't like to write, you might consider a different class because there are four short papers, one every three weeks.",
    "Global Affairs 101 01 surveys a range of international issues and allows us to think critically about different perspectives\/solutions to the topics.",
    "I would not recommend global 101 because it gives too little time to each f the topics it covers. It would be worth it to take a few classes to get a good introduction to global affairs topics.",
    "Global Affairs 101 01 gives a wide range of topics covered in global affairs. Through guest lecturers, the course covers many different aspects and focuses on policy memo writing. I would recommend this class to another student because I thought the guest lecturers were very interesting, kept the class feeling new, and covered a diverse array of topics.",
    "This is a solid introduction to the field of global affairs, but hinges substantially on the module instructors. It does not go extremely in depth, but instead scratches the surface, like a sample in a grocery store.",
    "Great Class. Originally took this class just for General McCrystal and General Graeme Lamb's segment on Afghanistan but I ended up enjoying the other three sections. Each section takes a viewpoint which promotes interesting discussions in section. The policy memo's are not too difficult as they are much more interesting to write than simple essays. While having four policy memo's is a lot of work, the readings-with the exception of the General's segment-are essentially supplementary so the work load is not too challenging. I would definitely take this class.",
    "Global 101 is a great class. You get to hear a lot of high profile speakers and the topics are all pretty interesting. I found myself liking a few of them more than the others, but I still enjoyed the modules that weren't as in line with my interests. You put in a lot of work on the memos, and I would like to stress to you that the readings are very much required and it would be a wonderful thing for your health if you actually read them when they were assigned and did not try and tackle them all during reading week. But I would totally recommend this class to another student. Lectures were informative and section was actually really great. Just pray you get a good TA because that will really help you out in this class. I would definitely take it again.",
    "Take it! It will expand your views on contemporary global issues. The class is broken up into four modules, all equally important.If you want to know what's going on, take this class.",
    "Yes fantastic course about prevalent global issues.",
    "Very interesting and entertaining if you find current events intriguing like I do.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to learn about current topics that are affecting our world today. I went into the class with very little knowledge of global affairs and came out feeling as though I really had learnt a lot. I think its a very good way to decide whether you may have an interest in Global Affairs, and if, by the end of the class, you decide you don't, it really won't be a class that you regret taking.",
    "Very interesting survey course with two international security and two international development modules.",
    "Gateway to Global is a survey of 4 major issues faced in the international community today. It's taught by 4 different lecturers--one for each module--who are experts in their field.I would recommend this to other students, but only those who find current events and politics interesting.",
    "I'd recommend it--it's nothing special, but if the professors teaching it are cool, then you get some exposure to interesting topics.",
    "Great class for anyone with an interest in international relations\/public policy, a lot of the value comes from the readings so be sure to do them.",
    "A great intro to global affairs, some modules are definitely better than others but it's definitely worth taking",
    "Very interesting course that I would recommend to any student at Yale regardless of their major. It gives you great insight to 4 issues that you may not have understanding of.",
    "A great summary of the different issues that constitute Global Affairs today, and a really unique class. McChrystal and Lamb's unit on the evolution of conflict was fascinating, and I also enjoyed Nicoli Natrass's HIV lectures a lot. If you are considering Global Affairs I would definitely recommend trying out the class, there isn't too much work (4 policy recommendation memos of about 3 pages - one for each of the 4 modules) and you learn a lot of interesting information about the biggest issues that the world is currently facing. It wasn't a perfect class but it was one of my favorites at Yale so far.",
    "I would summarize GLBL 101 by describing the system of the four modules, and describe the modules we had. I would also explain that the modules change and might be better or worse the next time the class is offered. I would also describe the workload, which was the most difficult of any class I had this semester. I would recommend this class to people interested in Global Affairs or public policy more generally, but not necessarily to someone only casually interested.",
    "As a graduate student who has been abroad, much of the course material may seem too simplistic or straight-forward.",
    "It's an interesting course with great guest lecturers and it is more of a series of thought exercises than concrete teachings on global affairs.",
    "Global Affairs is basically an introduction to major areas in the field of international relations. Its an awesome course and you should definitely take it. It provides a framework for evaluating international relations issues and making policy recommendations."
