    "Okay, disclaimer: I knew NOTHING about hip-hop going in. NOTHING aside from the songs I grew up with. Quite frankly, I didn't even know hip hop was more than just music and fashion (as in, I was unaware that b-boying\/b-girling and graffiti were a part of hip hop culture). I was very clueless about a lot of things - even about albums from the present day that many of my classmates love listening to (i.e. albums like \"To Pimp a Butterfly\" or anything by Chance). In any case, through this course I learned both history and analysis of hip hop. I think often times I was on the quieter side simply because I was trying to take it all in. Hip hop is not one thing or another, as I heard many different aspects and many different definitions of what it was throughout the course of the semester. I learned how to analyse music without any musical sense whatsoever (seriously, I can't sing, play an instrument, or even read music), and I learned to analyze rap by more than just its lyrics. It was overall a very enriching class.",
    "I learned about the incredible depth of hip hop culture, as well as how to view works of art with a critical and socially aware eye.",
    "I learned the magic of hip hop, and now am able to articulate a passion I've always felt. How amazing is it to see scholarship done in the area of hip hop! That, and all the nuances race, class, gender, nationality, everything bring to it! I learned so much STUFF, but also how to think critiquely about music and image and have confidence in my own ability and authority in liking something.",
    "I learned so much about the history of hip hop, the four original elements, and extensions of hip hop. I also learned how to analyze film and music more in depth.",
    "I was able to discover how Hip Hop as an art form is an integral part of American society and how it operates as a tool to represent communities of color. The art of Hip Hop expands into a culture, that also operates within its sphere of issues and influences. The class allowed me to look at the complexities of Hip Hop besides just listening to music, and to ask broader questions as how do lyrics, styles, sounds, movement, and visual aesthetic combine to comment on a particular issue, situation, or idea. The class also allowed me to observe how cross-cultural productions develop and how Hip Hop has has an influence on global pop culture.",
    "This course taught me so much about Blackness and black aesthetic tradition in America as well as giving me an unbelievably detailed understanding of the foundations and iterations of hip hop as a musical genre. Discussing hip hop in class, hearing student presentations on regional, visual, and international aspects of hip hop culture provided a framework of knowledge that you can't get in any other class.",
    "music analysis, history, aesthetic assesments",
    "This class fundamentally changed my conception of hip hop, not just as a music form, but in all of its aspects. It helped look at works through a different lens, and also analyze the artwork you enjoy, and how it reflects itself in hip hop, and how hip hop deserves to be challenged.",
    "This course offered insights into hip hop's history, culture, and aesthetic strategies. Besides developing a solid understanding of the topic, the course allowed students to build their music listening skills while being encouraged to speak."

   "comments": [
    "I think the course readings were exceptional. I have done so many readings this semester, but none were as interesting as those that I had to do for this class. I learned a great deal about the history of hip hop and the ways in which things influence a genre both through academic writings and magazine articles. I also learned so much about the ways in which a genre is created through the presentations students had to do. However, I do think we often got too caught up with the presentations to discuss the readings more - which was a little frustrating because of the fact that the readings were so interesting and rich in many different ways. The presentations had value, but I feel as though we did miss out on the value of the readings a little because presentations tended to go over time.",
    "Strengths: Incredibly fun. I enjoyed coming to class because Professor Burrell fostered a relaxed yet stimulating learning environment. Plus the subject matter is really interesting, especially as someone who loved hip hop going into this class but didn't know a ton about it. Weaknesses: Maybe didn't love doing forum posts to check for participation, but that's about it. Probably no way around that.",
    "This course did a great job of engaging the class and creating meaningful discussions. We used different resources, which exposed us to different formats that the world engages hip hop. To improve the class, more resources that reflect queer and female members contributing to emceeing could be included. I think this would help during discussions of homophobia and misogyny in the commercialized hip hop industry.",
    "I found the class to be incredibly engaging where classmates were required to give presentations on original hip hop works and ideas. This allowed the class as a whole to engage with course materials and design a curriculum that was prepared not just by the professor but by us as well. That only made me more invested in the overall material being discussed. One of the weaknesses of the course was that I wish there were a few more formal writing assignments, but overall, the course was incredible.",
    "This is the single greatest class I have ever taken in my entire life, I honestly wouldn't change a thing.",
    "Student Presentations were a huge strength",
    "I thought this class was outstanding overall. It was really interesting and engaging, and it forced me to think about think i listen to and do every day in a far more critical way and gave me a new perspective on hip hop as a whole. I think the class could have benefitted from more structure, and more direction in some the the assignments.",
    "The main weakness of this course was time. We had so much material to cover, and only so much time to discuss it given we only met once a week."

    "Absolutely! Even if you think you know hip hop, there's still so much more to learn!",
    "Absolutely. This is one of the best classes I've taken in my 4 years at Yale. The subject is so incredibly interesting and taught in a fun, engaging way. Take it if you can.",
    "Absolutely. If you love hip hop, then I don't even see why you're reading this evaluation because you should already be taking this course. And even if you don't love hip hop, there is so much to gain from learning about the culture and history that pervades every realm of interest.",
    "take this class if you are interested in hip hop!! it is a great way to learn about hip hop and its power to move people and create community",
    "100% would recommend. Great class taught by a great professor.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Hip Hop is consumed almost every day in a variety of forms and it is important to understand where the art form emerged and how it continues to involve. A necessary course for anyone who wants to understand the social impact of Hip Hop as a culture.",
    "This is hands down the greatest class at Yale. Jalylah is an unbelievable professor who knows more about this stuff than anyone else in the country. If you get a chance to take it, seize the opportunity.",
    "Yes! Amazing class",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I thought it was fun and engaging. It was a fair amount of work but was definitely manageable and the work was not a trial to do, in fact I sometimes looked forward to it. It gave me a new perspective on hip hop, which is something I thought I was pretty knowledgeable about.",
    "Yes!"
