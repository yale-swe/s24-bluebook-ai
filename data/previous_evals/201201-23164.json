   "comments": [
    "Drama and Demos is pure magic. Professor Robinson is the best professor I have had at Yale so far. Not only is the workload manageable, the grading is fair and the class is more than enjoyable. Professor Robinson keeps the class interesting with his incredible sense of humor and his deep knowledge of Greek literature and civilization. Do not hesitate to take this class. You will not regret it!",
    "This course was very enjoyable and rather stress-free. Professor Robinson is such a sweet guy, and although the content of his lectures can ramble a bit, his corny sense of humor and uplifting spirit are always entertaining. He is always open to discussion, but, given the opportunity, he will talk non-stop until the end of class. It is quite rewarding to read so many extant Greek plays, although I often felt I didn't have enough time to do more than skim them.",
    "Yes, I would recommend CLCV 218 to another student. You read a lot of great plays, and there are only 3 papers. Also Professor Robinson really knows his stuff.",
    "Take this course! No qualification. This is, without doubt, one of the most inspirational courses that I've taken at Yale. It is a broad survey of Greek Drama that nevertheless explores each text with great depth. It really allowed me to appreciate how moving Greek drama can be and how well it reflects, magnifies and encapsulates the human condition. Timothy Robinson is an absolute sweetheart. He is extremely knowledgeable, highly flexible in terms of papers and treats his students as his equals. If you are taking an intense schedule you may not have time to complete each reading but you will feel compelled to finish the readings when you have spare time."
