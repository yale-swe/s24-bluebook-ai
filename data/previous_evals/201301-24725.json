    "I would say that if they want to become familiar with essential, classic works, this is the course for them. However, I'd also tell them that the course has incredible potential, but that occasionally professors come in who have clearly not read the extensive readings required of the students, and that the readings are not always discussed in the seminars as thoroughly as we read them. I'd also tell them that they are likely to hear some extremely abstract notions that have little to do with the subject matter at hand.",
    "The dinners and special opportunities are nice perks to a class's that's otherwise a rushed attempt through a lot of material. Take it for the prestige of the program, not for the intellectual experience",
    "GS is a seminar that has an incredible reading list. The class sessions are hit or miss. There were some incredible class sessions (like the one on Lincoln), but there were also some major missed opportunities (for example, the Sun Tzu class did not at all examine the impact that Sun Tzu has on China today, and the cold war class was not taught by the Pulitzer Prize winning author of a cold war figure, instead it was \"taught\" by students).For graduate students, I neither recommend this course, nor do I not recommend it. You should evaluate what other opportunities are out there and make an informed decision based on your career and academic goals. If you take it, you will learn a lot, but you could probably learn the same material by reading through the reading list on your own. Also, you need to be prepared to listen to relatively naive undergrads pontificate on senseless ideas (I don't mean this pejoratively, since I was just as naive as an undergrad, not to mention, the undergrads in this course are brilliant; however, a lot of their comments in class will drive you a bit crazy)."

    "The syllabus for the course is excellent. It lists plenty of supplementary readings which I hope to get around to reading in the years to come. The core reading, meanwhile, you shouldn't leave college without getting around to.",
    "It taught me how to think of issues from a grand strategic perspective."
