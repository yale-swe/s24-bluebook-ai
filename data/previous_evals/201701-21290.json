    "Speaking, writing, reading, grammer, presentation skills",
    "It helped me understand more about Chinese culture, grammar, and idiomatic meaning. The intersectional focus on history, philosophy and language helped improve the learning experience. I also better understood China today through some of the topics we covered.",
    "I began with basic oral abilities but learned so much written Chinese and formal Chinese. I dramatically improved my reading comprehension and writing abilities. Learned to use more formal vocabulary and also communicate more complicated thoughts using advanced sentence structures."

    "Strengths - very engaging class, learn lots of material.",
    "Strengths: pretty much everything Weakness: none really",
    "Strengths: small class sizes and interactive student-teacher engagement, consistent learning, high standards, very helpful advice from the teacher and during office hours Weaknesses: the play assignment came in too late and caused extra stress just when finals were coming around Improvements: not much to say here except rescheduling, altering or removing the play assignment.",
    "Very good instruction and a lot of student involvement in the form of many different types of activities (student presentations, daily quizzes, essays). Time commitment was very high and started to take away from my ability to complete other coursework. Daily quizzes and classes becomes a bit overwhelming as a regular schedule. Still learned so much as a result of the time invested in learning vocabulary and practicing writing."

    "Very fun class - learn lots of Chinese, including interesting grammar structures, lots of vocabulary. The workload is on the heavier side, especially since you'll have homework basically every day but is manageable most of the time. Wang Laoshi is very energetic and keeps class fun.",
    "Yup. If you're serious about chinese. This class is basically a cult in which you enter barely knowing anything, and emerge a more confident, memeier versin of yourself that knows a fuck ton more than you used to.",
    "One hundred percent. The level and quality of learning, engagement and instructor support are in the top echelons in comparison to those for all other Yale courses.",
    "This is a wonderful class! Fast-paced and tough but you will learn so much, and with a great professor as well. Wang Laoshi is funny, approachable, and talented - I would not have learned so much Chinese without her as my professor.",
    "Definitely recommend to anyone who has a baseline level of chinese ability. I didn't take CHNS 152 and jumped right into CHNS 153 so the first couple weeks were really difficult and required a lot of time to get my vocabulary up to par. The workload actually increases over the semester but you get better at memorizing vocabulary and become more efficient with studying. Great course and really fantastic learning experience, but do be prepared to put in quite a bit of time."
