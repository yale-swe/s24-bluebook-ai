    "Important subject for many research area. Great to reinforce the understanding in the core material.",
    "Good for theoretical basis and derivations, but not enough practical results to be useful to engineers.",
    "A little boring but a good class.",
    "Phys 512 is a wonderful introduction to stat mech. I had never taken a formal course on statistical physics before and this definitely gave me a good understanding of the material. At times the pace can be somewhat fast, but it is never unreasonable and the problem sets help clear up a lot of concepts.",

    "A lot of problems in my research is related to stat mech.",
    "I learned the methods of statistical mechanics. Something especially useful for me was getting the basics of phase transitions, which are important for my field of research.",
    "It taught me how to use partition functions in a more in-depth way than I learned in high school. It also taught me good approximation methods for integrating density of states. It remains to be seen how much of this will be relevant to my research, but I suspect it will be more relevant than other courses.",
    "I hadn't taken a stat mech course before so it was very useful in that sense.",
    "I had never before taken a stat mech course, and I now feel as though I understand the material fairly well. It definitely did a great job of helping me understand the field."
