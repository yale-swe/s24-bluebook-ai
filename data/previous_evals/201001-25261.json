    "This is the best course I've taken at Yale! Since Yale has a huge collection of British art, we were able to look at original works in the British Art Center. It was awesome. We learned a lot about the history of the British Empire in India and we studied all kinds of art from that period and later.Tim Barringer is also a really professor. He's very enthusiastic about what he teaches and the class was never boring. I would absolutely recommend this class for any person in any major.",
    "Absolutely. Take anything Professor Barringer teaches. This course was really interesting.",
    "TAKE IT. It is art history, but it is also a lot about cultural relations in general.",
    "Take this class at any cost.Barringer is one of Yale's real gems, and the material is truly amazing. Be ready to work hard and read a lot, though.",
    "This class is great--my favorite of the semester. If you are interested in British art and colonial history, it's fascinating. You learn about the history of the British in India, from the first traders to independence, and the art styles that emerged from the colony. You talk also about ideas such as art education and the history of museums as an imperial institution. Overall, a great class with very manageable work.",
    "Visual Cultures of British India was an interesting class, and I really liked the variety of the lectures. However, sometimes I had a bit of trouble pulling things together because of the variety. Some of the guest lecturers I had difficulty following. Also, make sure that you like picturesque landscapes, since a good deal of time before the mid-term is spent focusing on such.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to other students. It was informative, inventive and made me understand British art from another angle."
