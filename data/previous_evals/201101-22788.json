   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in learning about logic and machines in a very abstract way, this is the course for you. Be forewarned: there was no homework, which made it hard to stay motivated to remain on top of the material. This made things very hard when the (difficult) oral exam and take-home final came along. But Sun-Joo is great and the material is trippy. You'll learn some pretty cool results by the end of the semester.",
    "This is an extremely interesting and rewarding class for those who are well-equipped for taking it. But if you don't have the proper background in (one or all of) logic\/computer science\/set theory, it will end up being a headache. Make sure that you come in having seen these topics before, even if you've been told otherwise, because this material is too interesting to sacrifice getting the most out of simply because you aren't well prepared.",
    "If you took and enjoyed Math Logic, you must take this class. Sun-joo is honestly one of the best teachers at Yale. This class is listed as a seminar but it's just a 2-hour lecture. BUT, the lectures are always extremely well prepared and the material is very interesting. Sun-joo is also really funny!In terms of workload, there is much less work than Math Logic. It's a really chill class.",
    "Excellent course. Both Sun-Joo and her lecture notes are amazing. Don't worry if you fall a little behind some weeks - looking carefully over the notes you'll be sure to understand everything. Presentation, Oral Exam, and Take-home final are the perfect way to evaluate your knowledge of the material.",
    "I liked this class, so yes I'd recommend it. But I'm a Math& Philosophy major, so this class is kind of made for me. If you're at all interested in logic or philosophy of math, this is a great class. Besides, you get to actually understand G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorem and its proof (definitely worthwhile).",
    "This class is great - you will prove Goedel's First and Second Incompleteness theorems over the course of the semester. Professor Shin is an engaging lecturer, too :)",
    "A fun and friendly run through the proof of Godel's first and second incompleteness theorems.",
    "Best class ever",
    "This is a great class. Make sure to follow along from week to week, and review in between, since it progresses surprisingly quickly, and there are very few assignments to check your progress and understanding.",
    "For a math student, this will be an easy and interesting exploration of the limitations and foundations of mathematics. You will have to put up with philosophy kids and it won't be as rigorous as you would like - the concepts can be challenging though.",
    "Computability and Logic was great - you learn about a diverse set of topics in computability including Turing machines, Abacus machines, and recursive functions, all of which build up to the conclusion of proving Godel's incompleteness theorems. Very mathy course and if you have a math background you will see lots of proof techniques in your math courses show up in this class. It helps to have taken a logic class previously (267 preferably) to understand some of the logic concepts though.",
    "My favorite class this semester.If you are at all interested in logic or the limits of computation (and are not afraid of a little math), take this course. Prof. Shin is a brilliant teacher and is adept at making arcane-looking mathematical ideas perfectly clear.",
    "If you have taken Mathematical Logic and enjoyed it, then you will enjoy Computability and Logic. The main goal of this course is to prove G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorems, but on the way you take a long detour into computability (Turing Machines, Abacus Machines, the equivalence of Turing computable functions, abacus computable functions, and recursive functions) to prove the reasonableness of Church's thesis, which plays a small but crucial role in the larger proof. The only assessments for the course are a presentation on part of theequivalence proof, an oral exam on a key topic in the Incompleteness proof, and a final exam, which tests your understanding of the logic of one of the proofs.",
    "It was very back loaded with work, but you really won't get this kind of exposure in any other class at Yale.",
    "The material is profound. But we reached the most profound conclusions at the last minute of the semester this time and didn't have a chance to really analyze them in class. Thankfully, the take-home had some good questions that directed us to do so ourselves to some extent. I found the material pretty challenging, perhaps because I hadn't taken any course in logic before. Be sure to stay on top of the notation. She doesn't assign much in the way of reading or homework, but you should at least make sure you understand her lecture notes each week, and sometimes that will mean sitting down in a cool hour with George S. Boolos. 2 hour lectures are always a long time to sit listening, but it's crucial to be attentive the whole time in Computability and Logic because you put the definitions you learn in the first part of lecture immediately into use in the next part of the lecture.",
    "Computability and Logic is a wonderful advanced logic course designed to prove and explain Godel's incompleteness theorem. It is very rigorous, and taking Mathematical Logic first is worthwhile. If you've taken Math Logic, you already know how interesting this subject can be. Professor Shin is absolutely wonderful, and the workload is extremely reasonable."
