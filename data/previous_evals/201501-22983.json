    "Great course that will get you up to speed and ready for the more advanced content of 211 and beyond, but beware of HIGH variations in the amount of work between different sections. Shop around and check syllabi carefully to ensure you're not doing 4 assignments between every class...",
    "Good class! I took it Credit\/D just because I was interested in the material, and I had a good time. There's some counterpoint-writing and stuff about chords, which is fun, and then there's stuff about form and analysis, and that wasn't as fun for me",
    "A really great class. John is a wonderful instructor -- Yale is losing a thorough mind. Don't sleep on this class! It is a challenging course. I definitely recommend it over 205."
