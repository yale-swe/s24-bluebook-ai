   "comments": [
    "Useful course",
    "pretty good",
    "Excellent class - I have learned a lot about data management. Now I am confident in my SAS skills and applying these skills in Epi studies.",
    "It's relevant content to our careers.",
    "Could split up lectures into 2 days. Provided very thorough notes, but very rushed.",
    "learned so many useful SAS codes, love the class",
    "Excellent course",
    "I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot. I found the labs to be very helpful to reinforcing important course material.",
    "Strengths: was very informative, labs were very usefulWeaknesses: hard to sit through a 2 hour lecture about SAS without seeing it being done",
    "Overall excellent, would have enjoyed more in depth or broader material. There wss time to include more advanced topics in the course.",
    "I was so scared of this class at first, but it turned out to be really good! I learned so much from this class. As intense and difficult as some of the material was, the instructors are VERY helpful. The skills you learn in this class are really useful. And once you know what you're doing, some of the assignments are quite fun.",
    "I thought the course was excellent overall. While Dr. Desai is engaging and encourages student interaction, it would be nice if the lectures could be more interactive (though in a class this size I don't know the best way to do this). I think that it would be helpful to require students to go through the labs in advance of the lab session so that the lab time can be used to clarify lecture content and answer questions. While it doesn't seem feasible, it would also be helpful if there were sessions geared towards students who are either really struggling or who don't need to see the code line by line.",
    "SAS is not scary at all.",
    "A great course, an in class sas quiz or two might help",
    "The most useful class I have taken this semester- although I might suggest having students take it in the fall instead of the spring. It felt a little backwards to take Biostats 505a and discuss and use sas while not really knowing what we were doing....and then to actually learn it in the spring.The labs are tough and the exams are brutal but manageable- I know I have learned a ton and will be able to apply what I've learned to my summer internship and career.",
    "Very good course - as an AP student interested in academic medicine, this course was very useful for me. I feel that I learned a great deal about SAS and stats in general.",
    "Professor Desai was excellent but the format could be improved. It would be much easier to learn the material in smaller groups and to practice the skills as we learn them. My lab TA was excellent but there was an assumption about baseline knowledge of computer programming. Perhaps next year you could try to divide labs into levels so that if people want to use a brute force method they can learn that and reinforce those skills and people with experience could learn more advanced methods to accomplish the same thing. . . .",
    "This was a programming class and I felt that some who find programming easy had a better experience with this class than those who didn't. For myself, I was not a fan of SAS. However, I did learn a lot from Dr. Desai. At our first lecture when he told us that we would be able to create tables and be able to analyze them, I thought that I would not be able to do it. Yet to my surprise, I was able to do it.Dr. Desai did mention before that lecturing about SAS is not the most ideal way of teaching SAS. I noticed that he does recordings for a separate class. If we were able to see those lectures and watch it and do SAS on our own time, I think we would be able to benefit. I also think it would be nice to be able to have a lab session where Dr. Desai teaches you how to do SAS. Therefore, the students would be able to follow along and practice what theyare being taught. Think of it as a computer class if you will.I also feel that fifty minutes for a lab is not long enough to cover what we learned in class. The lab should really be extended because that is where students learn the most.",
    "The course gave us tools that we would actually use when writing papers and conducting epidemiological analyses.The labs were helpful and allowed us to practice. However, labs 4-6 were somewhat redundant.It would have been helpful to be given more opportunities to practice the procedures covered in lecture as the labs often covered the same topics.",
    "Love the course. It's practical, funny and interesting",
    "such a helpful class. I learned so much!",
    "Great course, wish there was more lab time and less lecture time. I wish they would teach the concepts in lab while we code and run through problems.",
    "It really taught me SAS. Particularly the midterm and the final forced me to rely on myself and use SAS, and I think that it was beneficial for building confidence and skills with this software. It was an excellent complement to the Biostats\/Epi course.",
    "An excellent introduction to SAS and also a good overview of statistics. I felt like I learned more about biostatistics in this class than I did in biostats505b.",
    "good way to learn SAS. need to figure out a way to allow equal access to the TAs for people without SAS on their laptops. they totally dominate the TAs",
    "Great overview of methods and data management including sas tips. I really feel like this course gave me a thorough understanding of sas. My only regret is that I didn't take this class before some of my other biostats classes! Labs and exams were well written and very instructive exercises.",
    "Great way to learn SAS and biostats.",
    "As the name of this course implies, this course gives skills that can be directly \"applied\" to epidemiology. The course is geared this way, and was successful in doing so. The labs were the most helpful part of the course, providing guided practice to help us shape our SAS skills. The lecture notes were also very helpful in reinforcing the concepts and are a great resource for future work in SAS.",
    "This is an excellent course, I dont see many ways for improvement.",
    "Really helpful; taught me the most about how to actually use SAS",
    "The course provides a really good introduction to SAS programming. It goes over everything right from the beginning so that you finish wit a working knowledge of the program. The strengths of the course are the great, detailed instruction and the labs. The labs are so helpful and are really where you learn how to use the program.",
    "useful not hard",
    "Strengths: Good mixture of applied and theoretical concepts. Homework and lectures were focused and applied directly to each other. Very useful to see students published work utilizing these concepts, and useful to be asked to apply them in context of lab.Weaknesses: Lectures were too long. Should be broken into 2 sessions per week.",
    "We learned a lot of useful content regarding statistical analyses and SAS.",
    "Great course! The labs and midterm were excellent at enhancing what is learned in lectures. The lecture notes need to be more organized - although they're clear in class when they are explained, looking back on them is quite hard.",
    "Amazing course. I never understood SAS until I completed this course.It was a fantastic experience and I can't say enough good things about it.Very very practical and the material sticks when your done.",
    "excellent.",
    "Excellent course, with a great instructor. You will come out of this class with the tools necessary to conduct a wide range of analyses via SAS. A must take course - one that I would recommend taking during your first year at YSPH.",
    "Great class, where I learned a lot of skills I feel I can use right away. I wish the class had covered more material, however, or taught more about biostatistics. It really is a class that is meant to be taken along with biostats 2 or epi 2 (to get the most out of the class), though you can take this class without the others.",
    "I thought this was a really strong course in SAS programming! I would have liked for it to be better integrated with what we were learning in Epidemiology and Biostatistics, as many of us were taking all three simultaneously. If all of the courses covered similar topics at similar times, or if the instructors just talked to each other about the course content and structure it would be really beneficial!This is a really important and practical course for entering the public health work force!",
    "This was one of the most beneficial courses I have taken at Yale. The skills we have learned in this class provided me with a wonderful foundation for conducting analyses of public health data.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and I liked the way it was structured.",
    "VERY USEFUL COURSE!Strengths: I learned a great deal in this course, and the labs were a great tool for really reviewing and using the skills learned during lecture. I got a lot out of the labs, including learning from my mistakes. They also forced me to really work with SAS throughout the semester. I especially liked how there was a common example used throughout most of the labs, as this created a sense of cohesiveness. I also thought the exams were an awesome chance for us to synthesize everything we learned throughout the semester to answer a realistic research question. Although a little intimidating, this was an invaluable experience! I also loved Lesley's lecture on SAS tips and tricks...can't get enough SAS! Weaknesses\/Possible Improvements: The lectures could be a little hard to follow sometimes, but I think this is just the nature of the material, which would only be perfectly presented if every student could follow along with SAS on his\/her computer throughout the lecture!",
    "This course was an excellent introduction to real SAS programming and analysis.Overall, the intense workload of the course is what made it so succesful in teaching the students the material. The only way to learn it is by doing it, and this course demonstrated that.Since the course is intense and mandatory for many students, the primary instructor made very stern and sometimes abrassive comments to emphasize the zero tolerance policy on cheating. I feel that as sad as this was, this might have been necessary (although sometimes it did go overboard).Nontheless, the course was great and allowed me to really learn how to use SAS and gave me real life skills that I will likely use in the future.",
    "Great!! Monday's AAMIE lectures were my favorite time of the week. The professor explained the material in such an entertaining fashion that I did not want his class to end!Strengths--professor really cares about students and has an engaging and entertaining lecture style.Room for improvement-sometimes the labs were very long and we did not get to complete them in class. You could either have shorter labs, or better yet, more lab time.",
    "Important information regarding how to use SAS to manage data sets were conveyed, albeit painfully.",
    "One of its greatest strengths its the integration of laboratory work and class material.",
    "very practical and useful. Liked the contents of the course too. It's very organized.",
    "I learned a lot in this course but did not always benefit the most Dr. Desai's teaching style. Labs were very very helpful.",
    "The strength of this course is its structure; it is designed to actually impart skills. You must pay attention in lecture to understand the slides and you must do the labs to practice what you learn; doing the exams is part of the learning process, and the combination of these three leaves you with lasting knowledge. It is also not very time consuming; paying attention in class helped the labs go by quickly.",
    "Excellent all around! SAS seemed intimidating until I took this course.",
    "This call was my favorite course this semester. I really enjoyed learning how to code in SAS and and gain practical skills that I could use throughout my career. A course like this is needed in the 1st semester of the MPH program. The work load was quite a lot and some of the labs took a while, but I enjoyed overcoming my frustrations and figuring it out. The lecture was quite mundane at times, but still useful. I will definitely use the notes from class again. It could be improve if the lab sessions were longer. I felt that they were too short and the TA office hours did not necessarily fit my schedule.",
    "it is incredibly useful for learning SAS, I learned more than I though possible. I went from SAS-phobe to SAS savvy. I feel so much more confident than I did in January.",
    "This course allows you to become very familiar with SAS and specifically with the analyses that we will likely use in our own research theses and summer internships. It is very practical, but also quite a bit of work, especially if you are previously unfamiliar with writing code.",
    "Very informative, very good.",
    "Strength: clear guidelines and very clear learning goals. Weakness: little room for critical thinking. Also the lecture slides were somewhat difficult to follow (i.e. too many chi-square tables!)",
    "Multiple ways to address the same problem were presented, which was great.",
    "The course's major strength is the lab component, without it the topics taught in lecture would be obsolete. The course itself was very strong in the beginning but eventually died down towards the end. The topics became less SAS technical and more about interpreting the results\/output. While it is extremely important to be able to make these interpretations I would have liked to learn a bit more SAS or a more in depth review of the topics that we did cover.",
    "Excellent. Most useful course at YSPH. I still use my class notes for my current internship."

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai was a great instructor. He was clear and it was obvious that he cared deeply about each student's understanding of course material.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Excellent, teaches the material exactly as he expects it back on labs\/exams.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is EXCELLENT! He is so charismatic, fun, and passionate. In class he can be intense, but when you meet with him one-on-one he is really laid back. He really cares about getting to know his students and values what each of us has to contribute. He has high expectations of us, which is good because he has a lot of faith in us! It was so much fun to be in Mayur's class.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai has a very clear and logical method of explaining SAS applications of statistical methods in lecture. As I mentioned previously, if the lectures were more interactive it might serve to reinforce course topics, but overall I enjoyed the lectures and found them quite helpful.The labs are the strength of this course. I think they are a great application of the lecture topics, and challengestudents to apply core concepts. The way they are designed is helpful in guiding students while still challenging them to think through steps of an analysis using SAS.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0-Can be critical and cynical during lectures. Sensitivity to students' concerns is not his main concern.-Lectures clearly and slowly. He is pleasantly methodical in teaching SAS code.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He is the best professor and inspired me a lot on professionalism. He is naturally born mentor.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0A great man",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Clearly is a SAS- expert. One on one he seems like a great guy, but his many conversations about academic integrity seem to be misguided,considering that most students approached the course with the honesty and academic integrity one might expect from us.Overall he's a great professor who has helped all of us alot- I think most students would agree that this was one of the most useful classes all year.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is a great professor. His notes are very good, and I'll keep them for future reference. In fact, although I didn't go to class often, I was still able to use his notes and move forward with the course and do well in labs.Mayur is an asset to Yale, and he is the biggest reason I came here for the AP program.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0I think he's fantastic. Sometimes his disdain for students is not well disguised.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai has very high standards. I often felt that he was very intimidating because of these standards.Also, Dr. Desai would often randomly call on people to answer questions. I was always afraid of being called on because I am not good in those situations. Answering questions in such a big lecture hall is difficult for introverts. His way of putting students on the spot reminded me of the great words of Susan Cain, who often discusses the power of introverts: \"For kids who prefer to go off by themselves of work alone, those kids are seen as outliers often, or worse as problem cases. And vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert, even though an introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable according to research.\" I felt that Dr. Desai saw quiet people as problem cases, afraid to speak up. However, that is not the case. It is just the way people are, and I feel that teachers need to understand this concept.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai was extremely knowledgeable and his lectures were well-planned and coordinated with the labs. He was attentive to students' questions when they were asked.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr Desai is absolutely the best instructor in YSPH, for he can always make the class interesting and we can eventually learn a great deal at the same time.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0learned so much. he explains everything so well! I wish he taught more classes!",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Good professor, engaging and can be helpful.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He was very open to answering any and all questions in class, and managed to cover quite a bit of material in the short semester. He was approachable outside of class to get extra help, and you can tell he cares about his students learning.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai was an entertaining presenter and did a great job of providing us with the essentials for data analysis. I disliked the cold calling. Some people are just very shy in large groups, myself being one of them, and this made me dread going to class. Apart from that I thought the lectures were excellent and the homeworks and exams were very good learning experiences.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0mayur is great, but can be really condescending in class, which is weird, because he's so nice and accommodating otherwise. the cold-calling was a real turnoff.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Fabulous as always! Somehow made programming fun!",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0One of the best teaching faculty at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Prof. Desai was an entertaining and thorough lecturer. However, I sensed a condescending tone at times. I felt a bit patronized, especially in the lectures around the midterm. I understand the importance of maintaining the honor code, but one firm warning is sufficient. Otherwise, however, he did an excellent job at shaping the class, especially in creating perhaps the most practical opportunity to learn SAS at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is amazing, he knows the material and has a gift for making a dry subject interesting and applicable to everything else we learn at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0The instructor is really good at engaging the class and getting across the material. Learning about SAS programming is slightly daunting but the professor is able to break it down really well so that you get a good basic knowledge.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Strengths: Instructions for homework, midterms etc. very clear and direct. Tests were fair and good approximation of combined lecture and homework material. Lectures were focused and to the point.Weaknesses: slides should be updated to reflect SAS 9.2 or 9.3 as this difference is confusing.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Articulates very well. Lectures are done very well. Integration between the lectures and the labs is also very good. I felt like we spent a little bit too long on the \"table 1\" analysis though.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Excellent instructor - very attentive to students and questions, and is always willing to help!",

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0very helpful",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Great Professor, with a great sense of humor, who is knows the material backwards and forwards, and takes all questions asked of him seriously and is always ready to answer them fully and thoughtfully . What is great about Professor Desai's class is that he really conducts it like a seminar - that is to say if you have questions during class he is ready to answer them. His speaking style is conversational, so you always feel that you are engaged with the course. Most importantly, he is great about fully and completely answering questions, is great about responding to emails, and encourages students to come to his office hours. Professor Desai did an exceptional job with this course.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor Desai is a very clear and concise lecturer! The slides are very good and he provides a very clear introduction to basic concepts in analytical epidemiology.At times he allowed a couple of students questions to dominate the discussion when it may have been more appropriate to ask for those questions to wait until after class.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai keeps what could easily be a very dry subject very fun and engaging. I really enjoyed coming to lectures, and found his slides easy to follow and great resources looking back while coding.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is an excellent teacher and he did a great job of explaining concepts and giving good examples. I can now appreciate and use SAS without fears because of Dr. Desai's class.I really liked the midterm and finals because they allowed me to see my progress in the course",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Strengths: Dr. Desai's knowledge, humor, and research experiences make him a great instructor for this course. I really liked that he included lengthy examples in the lectures, as this is really the only way to begin to understand some of the concepts covered in the lectures without SAS in front of us. I also REALLY LIKED that he included research projects by former students in several of the lectures. This beautifully illustrated the potential we all have to apply the concepts learned in the course in our own work. It was inspiring. Weaknesses\/Possible Improvements: I thought the lectures were sometimes a little difficult to follow along with in class, although this is a difficult course to teach because it is not as though everyone can have SAS open in front of them. Sometimes the lectures jumped from one example to another without any clear link between them and the lectures just felt a little \"messy\" at times. I also did not like that Dr. Desai seemed easily frustrated when students were a little lost and called on random people to answer questions. This just created tension for everyone. Perhaps if the lectures could be made a little smoother, there would be an increase in participation.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur was a great knowledgeable instructor that really knew the material well and how to convey it.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Amazing! He holds us to the highest standards, and while it might be a bit intimidating, it is also a great compliment-he believes we can meet those standards of academic excellence.He made me laugh during his class, but I still learned so much on it--this is the perfect combination. He seems to really care about students, as well. He gets his point across in a clear manner. Only nice things to say about this professor! I read that he won the teacher of the year award, and this was totally well deserved.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur Desai is knowledgable and has a lecturing style that bring even the most boring subject matter to life (and trust me, this subject matter is incredibly boring). However the way he goes about drilling the honor code and cold-calling on the class is downright disrespectful. He does not teach us as peers or as future co-professionals, instead he preaches at us like we are middle-schoolers deserving of a reprimanding hand. This is the sole reason why I chose to stop attending class. We are all professionals and deserve to be treated as such, not threatened to be taken to the judicial board at any inkling of an academic issue because \"who will they believe, me or you?\" - Mayur.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Excellent!",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0The instructor is very professional and dedicated to teaching this course. He maintained a good bit of interaction with students during classes to get students focused on the class content. Would be better if he spends less time on dealing with administration matters during the lectures.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Helpful lectures, but would appreciate more information on interpretation of SAS output on lecture slides. Grading seems subjective.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is a great instructor, and definitely wants students to learn the material. His slightly sarcastic persona can come off a little strong in a big auditorium, but he is always just teasing and means well.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0So incredibly AWESOME. Only he could take a course on SAS and make it fun! I know my friends and I looked forward to his lectures each week.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0TEACHER OF THE YEAR. He is an excellent instruction, I appreciated how he was strict and kind at the same time.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is fantastic. He makes class interesting. We all enjoyed lecture and we learned a lot.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is a very animated professor, a huge asset for a course whose material could otherwise be quite dry. I liked that he often incorporated previous students' publications into our lecture material so that we were able to see how our efforts in the course can be very directly applied to our future research. I do wish there was more communication to students as to why we are not anticipated to receive our finals or final grades for some time.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0The instructor is very nice, knowlegable, and very patient.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Very dynamic and engaging. Oftentimes a little verbose. Some classes could have taken up much less time.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai was very animated. I'd imagine teaching data management is a challenge to make interesting, but he did. I thought the exams were excellent, great learning tools.He explained questions well, but came off as being aggressive and somewhat intimidating.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is a great lecturer. He is extremely charismatic and engaging and that made lecture enjoyable. However, one suggestion is to break the lecture up with a small break as two hours sometimes is just too long for a student to focus. While we did cover a lot of material, I think his lectures could have done without so many redundant interpretation examples and more focused on examples of SAS coding techniques.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Loved attending his lectures. I emailed him once with a question and he got back to me within 10 minutes. Unprecedented rapid response from a professor."

    "Instructor: Kathryn Ann Egan \u00a0Very patient, very good.",
    "Instructor: Kathryn Ann Egan \u00a0Although Katie was usually readily available by email, she was sometimes difficult to get in touch with in person. A couple times I arrived for Friday morning office hours and she came late - inconvenient considering I had class right after. Many of the other office hours and all of the other labs conflicted with my course schedule. Therefore, when Epi exams conflicted with the Friday lab I didn't have a lab to attend. When I expressed this to Katie she seemed to have her hands tied, but I would have greatly appreciated a little extra flexibility (such as an additional later lab that was offered after the second Epi exam).It seems a little ridiculous that courses overlap with each other like this, so perhaps professors can better coordinate schedules (especially when nearly everyone is taking the same required courses)?",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Lesley was a wonderful TA. She cares a great deal that all of her students master the material and was extremely helpful. Lesley's lab sections were instrumental in reinforcing lecture material and she a a great way of presenting course material that is clear, concise and easy to understand.",

    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Very nice and very approachable.",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Lesley knows SAS very well, always confident in her knowledge and able to answer questions. Lab section often seemed rush, not sure if there is any easy remedy to that though, and I don't think it's at all due to anything in Lesley's control.There were a few rare occasions when she seemed slightly frustrated when students were lagging behind or not grasping a concept (for example, not understanding data steps by the time of the midterm). SAS has a very steep learning curve and once you understand SAS and know the coding, it can be very frustrating when someone does not understand it as well as you, but impatience will not help the student. I say this, not because this frustration\/impatience hindered my learning or (hopefully) anyone else's, but it might be something to be cautious about in the future.The candy bag really did make coming to section a little more exciting!Thank you, Lesley!(I also went to several of Sefa's office hours. Knew the material well, helpful, super friendly, and made me feel very comfortable asking questions.)",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Lesley is fantastic, there is no better TA for this course. Her knowledge of the material is inspiring.",

    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Lesley is an AMAZING TA! She was always upbeat and did her best to keep the group engaged with questions during the labs. She also had a really excellent handle on the material and was able to answer all of our questions. She was also willing to work with us to figure out mistakes in our code and to review any concepts during lab or office hours. I also thought she did a great job reviewing and emphasizing key concepts throughout the semester, so that when it came time for the final, we felt very comfortable with the material. Also, her lecture on SAS tips and tricks was GREAT!! A real highlight of the course!! I have had so many great TAs, including Lesley, while at YSPH!!",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Excellent!",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Just fantastic! Great at explaining things, and great at providing feedback on our writing. I really appreciated all her help throughout the semester.",

    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Lesley was an excellent TA. It is obvious that she knows her stuff. She was quite strict, but it made me a better student. She would make an excellent professor.I went to Josefa Martinez's office hours and she was quite helpful.",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Excellent - she provided great instruction and was useful in providing an alternative, but equally competent viewpoint from lecture.",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Lesley was absolutely wonderful. She was dedicated and extremely invested in seeing us (the students) succeed. I appreciated the fact that she always gave little SAS extras at the end of lab. While I felt that I could always keep up with her, she did lecture rather quickly but overall she has really great.",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Lesley is incredible. The way she taught us was almost Pavlovian (treated right answers with candy) but it worked. Our section was way ahead of the others in terms of recalling, writting and trouble shooting SAS code. She also taught me how to write great summary of results paragraphs."

    "Great course that I would certainly recommend.",
    "I recommend every student in MPH take this course. Can't be better.",
    "Very interesting course, you learn real skills in data management and u learn how to program sas",
    "Be prepared to work hard, but it's definitely worth it.",
    "Course is challenging and will require more time to prepare than other courses at YSPH. The final and mid term aren't easy, but I learned a ton while taking this class and don't regret it.I recommend it to anyone interested in research.",
    "I think it was an excellent way to learnimportant methodology that we will likely use for our theses. I really like Professor Desai and I appreciated his effort to be entertaining while still making is point - especially about decreased productivity and multi-tasking.",
    "VERY HARD WORK! However, if you put the time and effort into this class, you will learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as a way to gain practical knowledge in SAS.",
    "Great and indeed a must to take.",
    "such a useful class",
    "Good course. I would suggest paying the most attention in lab and just doing the labs over and over again, best way to learn SAS is on the computer.",
    "TAKE IT! It is the only way you will really learn SAS",
    "A very good introduction to SAS and analytic techniques.",
    "take it to learn SAS",
    "Great overview of sas and data analysis in general. Should be a required course for anyone at sccchool of public health.",
    "Must take this class to understand statistics and learn SAS",
    "This class is perfect for learning practical SAS skills that will help in your other classes and in your work.",
    "Take this course, it is one of the few courses at YSPH where you learn something that you may not already know.",
    "The course is a lot of work but worth it if you want a good introduction to SAS.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. I find it very practical and will be very useful for my summer internship.",
    "Excellent. Teaches SAS and statistics skills in a complete fashion to improve individual student knowledge. Would definitely recommend to another student. Useful for analysis outside of classroom and useful for thesis topics.",
    "Essential course for anyone who will be doing quantitative analyses. Most definitely recommend.",
    "I would fully recommend this course. I think it should be a required course for EMD, not just optional. The things we learned in this course are the skill that will help us once we enter the workforce",
    "Great course to get practice playing with data and cleaning data. I'd definitely recommend it to all students.",
    "Totally worth it.One of my best at YSPH - among the top 2",
    "one of the best courses",
    "A practical class that is a lot of fun. One that you will leave having learned a great deal of material. You will be very comfortable using SAS after you have completed this course.",
    "The most practical and applied course I've taken in my time at Yale, and a greatintroduction to SAS and statistical programming. If you want to do any kind of research, this class is really essential, unless you already know a lot of SAS, which is the bulk of what this class teaches.",
    "This is a really great introduction to SAS programming and analytical methods in Epidemiology. This is a really important course if you want to work in research or in practice. I highly recommend it!",
    "Anyone involved in data analysis should take this class. It will be useful for many years to come!",
    "Yes I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I believe this course is especially effective when taken in conjunction with Principles of Epidemiology II and Introduction to Statistical Thinking II, as these three courses essentially cover the same topics and when taken together ensure a VERY good understanding of important statistical methods for public health students. The heavy integration of SAS in this course is its biggest strength. The code was not just handed to us, which forced us to really become comfortable using the program, and the use of an example that tied the labs together, rather than ten disjointed examples, was really ingenious because it ensured the concepts flowed together nicely. I feel much more confident in my statistical abilities and my SAS skills after taking this course!",
    "This is a great course to learn how to use SAS and analze data.",
    "Take it! This was my fave class this semester! You have to work hard, but you will enjoy it as well.",

    "This is the course that teaches you how to use SAS. You will learn to do all the types of analyses that you may need for your MPH thesis and future research. Highly recommended so you don't have to cry every time SAS gives you an error message and you have no idea what to do. One of the best classes I took this semester!",
    "fellow student, you must take it!! it will make you SAS-literate.",
    "THIS CLASS IS A MUST TAKE. WE NEED A SIMILAR COURSE DURING THE FIRST SEMESTER. This course is a perfect example of how to create a stimulating educational environment at YSPH.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! There is absolutely no reason not to, unless you're already a SAS-master",
    "I am extremely glad that I took this course. I will be using the skills I learned during my summer internship and in writing my research thesis. Though it is a lot of work, you will be get a ton of practical skills out of the effort that you put in.",
    "This course is very helpful to students in public health. I will recommend it to another student.",
