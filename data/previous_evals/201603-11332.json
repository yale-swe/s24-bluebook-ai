    "You really get a great background in music theory. For me, it was everything that I expected and I found it incredible entertaining along the way. Great class.",
    "I literally didn't know anything about music before taking this class and now I can read, recognize musical patterns, and have some aural recognition skills!",
    "I didn't have specific goals when taking the course except that I really enjoyed music. I new that there would be a general logic to understanding music. The course presented this in a deeply broad way where everything was interconnected. Music is both mathematical and intuitive. I really enjoyed the course."

   "comments": [
    "Would have liked to learn more chord progressions, especially jazz progressions. Other than that, it's a strong class for learning the basics. The second half is probably a little too light on actual new subject matter. Daily homework are effective.",
    "Strengths: well taught, homework reinforces concepts in class Weakness: one issue I had was that a lot of the time it felt like there was a disconnect between reading music on paper and listening to music",
    "I was one of two graduate students in the class. Like most courses I've taken outside my graduate school, the schedule and timing of workload doesn't always mesh well with my core classes that take priority. This difference is pretty noticeable when observing college students and how they work compared to graduate students. Maybe this is outside the question... I do wish that I was able to do more preparation for each lesson. I enjoyed hearing other students explanations which is vastly different from the dialog that happens in my own discourse.",
    "I wish there was more music composition."

    "Be prepared for near daily music assignments. Take it only if you are willing to make the commitment. It's not an easy class. Don't take it Credit D if that means low commitment for you. Most of those who take it have some music background. I personally don't think its good as an intro class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone at Yale that is interested in music, or learning more about music. To anyone disinterested in music, I would not recommend this course.",
    "Yeah! Knowing literally nothing about music going in I would absolutely recommend this class - it was really eye-opening and I feel prepared to try to pick up an instrument",
    "If you want to learn music theory, this is a good class to take."
