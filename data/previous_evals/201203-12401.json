    "if you have a reason to write fiction and choose to do so, take this course.",
    "If you get in, you MUST take it. Unbelievably amazing class. Caz is totally cool and very funny, and he really takes the time to get to know you and your style of writing. His critiques are always on point, and he has some really fabulous suggestions that will make you go, wow, why didn't I think of that? And then by the end of the course you find yourself suddenly able to think of those things you never would have considered beforehand, and it's all thanks to Caz and the excellent workshop-style setup of the class. Your writing WILL improve, and you'll have a blast for two hours per week. I loved this class so much!!! TAKE IT!!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if she really wants to improve her writing.",
    "If you've taken Intro to Writing Fiction, you'll be well-prepared to take this course--it's structured the same way. Have a few story ideas in mind and be ready to write them in as short a time as one week. You'll have a great time working with Caz--he seems super strict at first, but he's warm-hearted, super supportive of his students, and deeply knowledgeable. This course will definitely help you make strides as a writer."
