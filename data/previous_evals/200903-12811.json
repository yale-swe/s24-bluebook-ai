   "comments": [
    "This class is a mix of grammar (faire causatif, discours indirect, subjonctif, etc.) and readings. Learning new grammatical structures is helpful in general, though sometimes a little boring. Readings are generally very interesting, but sometimes a little on the long\/tedious side. Work is basically every night, with either grammar, listening, reading, essays, or presentations to do (and often a combination of several of the above). Work takes a decent amount of time and the fact that it's every night is a killer.I would recommend this class to anyone looking to continue with taking French to reach higher-level classes or to fulfill a language requirement. The class itself is a good solid French class, and if you're interested in the language you should have fun. It's nothing to write home about though.",
    "Very appropriate level-wise for students who have taken high school French but are not completely fluent. Would recommend - the workload is large but necessary, and the resources provided are very helpful.",
    "I definitely recommend French 140. You read very interesting texts, learn a lot, and you improve a lot in your conversation skills, pronunciation, and listening abilities as well.",
    "We read lots of short texts about women in different situations, as well as two longer selections that were really good and interesting. Grammar and vocabulary were main focuses, as well as writing, but to a lesser extent. I would recommend it because it was a great refresher on high school french.",
    "A good continuation of French 130. You do almost the same thing, only that in 140 you read more books.",
    "Take it with Mme Koundi. Loved this class. It's great!"
