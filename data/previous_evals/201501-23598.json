    "This course provided me with he opportunity to learn more about the intersection of gender and agriculture, which is very important yet not widely covered issue. Besides aspects of food security were well covered throughout the course. I believe Yale needs more courses on these matters and I've encountered only this one. Professor Doss was always very helpful with explaining the material and recommending additional sources for studying.",

    "I liked lectures of Prof.Doss and the reading material which helped improving my understanding of the curriculum.",
    "Using the FAO data was really interesting. Good combination of production, nutrition...",
    "I liked the breadth of the material it covered and the neutral approach towards many politically charged policy issues. The breadth made it great for an outsider like me who had no background in the study of agricultural development and food security. the approach was very open minded and quite interdisciplinary. It's proven to be of practical help also, as I have discovered good resources for answering future questions. in addition, the class environment was very pleasant."

   "comments": [
    "A better classroom and more students would improve the lectures. Also, the two assignments should be split into four so that students can get feedback and adjust as the semester moves forward.",
    "Readings could be more effectively incorporated into the course. Class time should engage students more actively with questions beyond the material presented.",
    "I believe class participation part needs to have a bigger weight in the grade as this will make the classes more interactive.",
    "The assignments need to be changed to better fit the overall goals and themes of the class. Right now they feel more like a lesson in using Excel.",
    "I would have liked to have had more on trade policy, the role of the WTO with subsidies. More on public policy.",
    "1) It would be nice to watch documentaries as assignment once in a while. 2) There could be more emphasis on the type of non-agricultural work done in agricultural households, as we have often discussed household's investment decisions. 3) there could be some more demographics and migration considerations: How do households decide how many children to have? When do male or female members leave the household to work in non-agricultural jobs? What are the projections for the share of the global population living in the countryside in the next 100 years? Why is it important to study agricultural production systems?"

    "I think it was a good choice to make the policy memo a group project. It gave more space for discussion.",
