   "comments": [
    "The Plinies are a pair of understudied but really interesting authors, and there is literally an endless supply of interesting paths to explore in the Naturalis Historia and the Epistulae. I highly recommend it!",
    "If you love weird cultural and historical trivia, spend a lot of time on Wikipedia, and love Latin, definitely take this class! Both Plinys are a treasure trove of fascinating and\/or ridiculous anecdotes about ancient lifestyle and thought, and reading them definitely gives you a new (and extremely useful) perspective on the ancient world. Professor Johnston is a great teacher. Highly recommend.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class or any class taught by Professor Johnston!",
    "A lot of work but very interesting. definitely worth it.",
    "This was an excellent Latin course, which I would absolutely recommend to a fellow student. In it, you will read selections of Latin that are rarely taught but incredibly interesting alongside some incredibly well-known pieces. It requires a decent amount of translation, but Professor Johnston is more than fair.",
    "Take this class!! There is quite a lot of translation preparation for homework, but it is really interesting material. and prof Johnson is a great professor - really understandable and reasonable with work load. Take this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class with Professor Johnston. He is just as at home teaching in a conversational format as he is in his very successful lecture classes, and this particular course was a home-run. His expertise in Roman culture added a great deal of richness to our interpretation of Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger through their respective historical moments. The workload is very manageable, and I think you get to see an interesting selection of texts from two different genres of Latin literature. The class has occasional quizzes, a midterm, a 10-page final paper, and a final exam, but the midterm and final are no problem if you've been keeping up. The quizzes generally cover what has been assigned for class, so as long as you've been on track, it's not stressful. All course expectations were clear. Again, the best part of this class is the joy of learning from Professor Johnston, who has an enthusiasm for the Classics that makes you feel validated in geeking out for 75 minutes twice a week. Our class had some fascinating discussions and laughed a lot, and I don't think you can ask for much more than that."
