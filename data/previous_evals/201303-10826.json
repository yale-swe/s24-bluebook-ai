    "A really great class. Small size (7-8 students per section), great teachers, and good improvement in Japanese speaking and writing. I think most people in the class took L1 and L2 last year, but if not, the teachers will make sure you catch up on anything that you haven't learned that that class covered. It moves really fast and has a lot of homework, but it's definitely manageable. You can get by not doing a lot of it, but that really hurts your ability to learn the language, so putting in the time is worth it. I would strongly recommend this class, it's a lot of fun.",
    "You know what you're getting into, assuming you've taken L1 and L2. Expect 2 hours of nightly work, otherwise you will not succeed.",
    "it's very hard but the teachers are gems and the material is doable."
