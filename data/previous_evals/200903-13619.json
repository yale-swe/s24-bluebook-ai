    "I felt the organization of the course could be improved. We learned a lot from case studies, but they did not follow a logical progression (such as that which is outlined in the book). Maybe if we had followed the outline of the book rather than jumping around within the book, the order of the cases would have made more sense.",
    "Instead of all case readings, have supplementary readings that provide different perspectives.",
    "1: I would have appreciated a little more variety in the readings. Perhaps, in addition to presenting cases, each week a student could discuss a \"current event\" involving zoning or land use of some sort.",
    "Shansky is a magnificent teacher. Excellent use of socratic method!",
    "Question 2 - often the material could have been made more clear by having clearly defined topics. when the instructor discussed something with writing on the board, sometimes it was hard to catch on to where the discussion fit into the overall framework of the topic"

    "Learning from practical examples. Also, being invited to hearings and learning from Marjorie about real cases on which she is working.",
    "It is useful class for life skills. Many of the things learned are useful to know, even if they are not directly linked with what your interests are.",
    "Learning from Attorney Shanksy's extensive experience with local land use law. It was also neat how Attorney Shanksy offered to take us to community meetings, too.",
    "The instructor's in depth knowledge",
    "Class discussions",
    "ProjectHate to say this, but the midterm. It really forced me to think about what I'd learned.",

    "Ms. Shansky. She is very knowledgeable and enjoyable to listen to.",
    "class discussions",
    "Vibrant narrative on the part of Atty. ShanskyInteresting case readings",
    "Prof.Shansky who was lively and engaging.",
    "Marjorie is awesome. It's clear that she is an expert in the subject and excited about teaching it. She was great.",
    "The information learned is very important for any individual living in a municipality to know. Not only was it a course that advanced my academic interests, on a personal level it also made me aware of key issues to consider when developing property and working to conserve natural resources on a local scale."

   "comments": [
    "See above re: organization.",
    "I liked this class a lot, no suggestions",
    "I think that if it were a little bit clearer what we were supposed to get out of the various cases and lecture, it would be a much stronger course. I think that I tended to focus on the wrong parts of the readings and sometimes of the lectures. It would also be useful to clarify precisely what the connection between the lectures and the readings are each week.",
    "I think I would have learned more if the course focused more on themes and not so much on individual cases. Summarizing cases together in class that we were assigned to read as homework is not the best use of class time. I would have liked to hear Attorney Shanksy lecture more. We needed to talk more about the links between cases more, too.",
    "An outline of the subject material. It seemed a little bit too free form at times.",
    "More focus at the beginning of the course on defining and clarifying the roles of various local agencies and laws.",
    "There needs to be a better way to learn the cases. Maybe we can break into groups and present more frequently, writing things like 'Facts\/Holding\/Reasoning' on the white board. It's hard to get what we need to know out of the cases by just reading and listening to someone present.Also, the class focuses mostly on cases, but the midterm was mostly practical stuff. I think practical stuff needs to be taught separately from cases. There are no black and whites with the practical, but understanding who does what and when, what the midterm focused on, was hard for everyone to learn, and is probably the most valuable part of the course.",
    "A little more variety in readings\/class assignments would be nice.",
    "Course organization\/scheduling",
    "Some of the legal concepts were not as clearly presented as one might hope. I think the format of students presenting cases would be better if students were asked to present the takeaways from each case more clearly. I think a room where everyone faced each other would be more conducive to good conversation.",
    "More structure to the lectures would be useful. Concepts + applications. The course was application-heavy, and so the important concepts were frequently lost after going over the readings.",
    "The organizational framework. Although cases and presenting of cases is useful. The class was mostly student presentations with random comments and interludes by the professor. I would have liked to see more teaching on her part to present the topics and then we could have group discussion for how the cases relate to the topics."
