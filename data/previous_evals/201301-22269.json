    "If you like to\/hope to\/think you might want to write a play you should take this class. I couldn't recommend it higher.",
    "Terrific course. Deb is as encouraging as any teacher you're ever likely to have, but as with all creative matters, you must be ultimately your own foremost source of motivation, and if you work hard, you'll produce something meaningful.",
    "You write a play -- you're pretty much on your own for writing\/organization. Class is mostly for reading scenes aloud\/ coming up with ideas you may or may not put into the actual play.",
    "Take it!! It will change the way you write!",
    "You write a play. The first half of a typical class involves answering a series of \"fill in the blank\" exercises and free writing to help you think about your play and generate content. The second half of a typical class involves staged readings of scenes that you and your classmates wrote.Deb is wonderful. She knows about the failure of language. She tells delightful and demented stories. She likes the word \"demented.\" Her feedback (which I wish she gave more of) is very helpful. Meet with her outside of class, too.",
    "TAKE ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT.",
    "Definitely take this class. It makes you work, and that is hugely important. Also, just take anything with Deb."
