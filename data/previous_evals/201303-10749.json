    "Above all else, get a good PI!The actual work in this class isn't much: 2 page summary of project, a 5 page grant-style summary of project again, and 10 hours a week in lab.That being said, all of the above are graded by your PI, so pick carefully!Would recommend especially since I need this to graduate.",
    "Definitely recommend if you have a lab you like and a project you're passionate about.",
    "You know what you're getting into. Try to find a PI who is supportive of the actual time constraints of the course - for most people, the 10-12 hours per week requirement quickly turns into 15-20 because of their PI and mentor.",
    "Research for credit is great, even if you're not an MCDB major. It's a great way to get both experience and a credit!",
    "Know what you're getting yourself into with MCDB 485. I really wish I didn't have to continue my research next semester, but I'm forced to do so based on the structure of the class. This class will take at least 15 hrs of your time (depending on lab professor). Also, note that there is VERY LITTLE support \/ guidelines provided by the instructors, which can be problematic.",
    "This is an independent course - you are on your own so make sure you have a supportive PI!",
    "Cool research opportunity.",
    "Independent research, make sure you like your research topic, and have an involved mentor.",
    "Sure, take this class if you want to do senior research! I've really enjoyed working in my lab, so just make sure you are in a lab doing work that you enjoy.",
    "If you are a biology major, do it!",
    "Senior research..On your own",
    "Yes, I would recommend this for he senior requirement.",
    "Again, it really depends on the lab that you will end up joining, so my best advice would be to do a lot of research before hand to ensure that you will join a lab where you will have the necessary resources and support to carry out your research, and that the lab environment will be supportive and fun.",
    "Good course to get through senior thesis requirement, if you are looking at getting some lab experience",
    "Read the small print ahead of time.",
    "Your senior research project - 2 short papers and a presentation are due, along with the time you put into lab. I felt adequately prepared for the course because of MCDB 303L I took the previous semester"
