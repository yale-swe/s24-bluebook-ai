   "comments": [
    "Cons: Incredible amount of work. Be prepared for multiple all-nighters of frustration.Pros: everything else. You will learn more than you have in any other class. you will realize that 99% of your liberal arts education has left you unprepared for a career in business. Learn something about the real world, and take this class.",
    "It's tough -- but if you're willing to put in the time you'll learn a ton and really enjoy it. Definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and definitely an experience not worth passing up in your final year.",
    "I would recommend the class provided you know what you're getting into - heed Schmertzler's warning during the first class. You need to have a strong background in finance to do even remotely well in this class. Each week you will be assigned a case, which take a long time to complete. You also have lots of group assignments which makes it difficult, coordinating a team. Spend a lot of time preparing for class because he will call on you whether you like it or not.",
    "If you are at all interested in finance, definitely take this class. The first couple of weeks are very difficult but it gets SUBSTANTIALLY easier after that.",
    "Excellent introduction to private equity investing, with a consideration of LBOs, venture capital and new category investments. The seminar provided an understanding of the importance of debt covenants\/terms, negotiations and frameworks for analysis. Understand that you will need to have a solid background in modelling, interpreting company financials, reading a 10-K in order to be able to take this class. Assignments\/preparation for class basically involve a lot of late nights and a constant feeling of confusion. Know that you will be wrong more often than not. However, Schmertzler is an excellent professor and does a great job of teaching how to make sense of things; as such, class discussions were highly fulfilling Definitely take it if you have the basics of finance down.",
    "dont let him scare yea. he is quite the puppy actually. just buckle down and take it. you will thank me - or not.",
    "Professor Schmertzler teaches an outstanding course. I don't think I've learned more from any other course at Yale, and I expect to retain the most content from this course of any that I've taken. Likewise, he demands an outstanding amount of work. The first three weeks were at least 20-25 hours a week of work, and after that, the load drops to 10-15 hours a week. That being said, if willing todo the work, it's a phenomenal course.",
    "I would recommend this course with some caveats. The class can be very hard at times. Each week can sometimes feel like about 2 weeks of work (especially in the first couple weeks of class), which actually ends up being 2 weeks of work to do in the 2 days before class since you tend to procrastinate. This meant Saturdays and Sundays were often completely devoted to this class. It wasn't uncommon for me to wake up early Sunday morning and end up working on the case for Monday's class until late that night.In addition to being prepared to work, you should actually have some interest in the material. Don't be one of those people whosigned up for the course not really sure if they cared much for this stuff. It shows in your work and during class. Professor Schmertzler is a keen guy and can often tell if you aren't really engaged or aren't doing the work. You should really have a strong interest in finance, and even more so a strong interest in private equity\/investment banking style transactions. A lot of people in the course had a previous finance internship, but only the people who did investment banking actually knew what was going on in the first few weeks. That Sales& Trading internship? Useless. Asset Management? Useless. If you didn't learn to model during your internship, LEARN NOW, before you take this class. He expects you to either already know how to model or be able to learn extremely quickly.Be prepared to defend your work. Profesor Schmertzler will not shy away from grilling you on just about anything you say that doesn't sound completely right. Even if it's right, he will still question you to be sure you understand what you are saying. Class often ends up being a series of embarrassments as he asks everyone how they went about doing the case, and the proceeds to tear apart all the work you just slaved over for hours.Overall, you will learn a ton if you decide to take this, but you will often wonder why you are taking it at all. This was easily my most stressful class of the semester. Still, definitely one of the best classes I've taken here.Finally, be prepared to have no idea what you grade is going to be. There is no grading rubric, and the Professor doesn't give too many comments on your work, since you will turn in less than half of what you actually produce for each week's class. As I am writing this, I literally have no idea what my grade is going to be. If you are one of those \"must have straight A's across the board (even in Senior year)\" people, be prepared to be really stressed out throughout the semester about how you are doing in the class, as you will have no idea.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale. A must-take if going into finance.",
    "I would highly recommend private equity investing to fellow students. While a lot of work, you really learn how to evaluate a business and understand different types of transactions. Every class consists of a case as well as lecture, and there is a lot work every week outside of class, including readings and cases. However, the work is completely worth it. If interested in business or finance, this is a course that must be taken.",
    "Great course. Unique in the way it's taught--every class is based on a simulation or a historical case study. Welcome to the real world; you will never take an investing class like this at Yale. The class, however, moves very quickly and requires you to do a lot of work on your own, especially because the professor is hard to reach. Be wary of taking this class without any knowledge of valuation techniques or corporate finance."
