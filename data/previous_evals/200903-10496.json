   "comments": [
    "Japanese 835 was a course focused on exploring the concept of \"modernity\" in Japan in the \"long\" Taisho period (1905-1932 or so) through contemporary literature and recent literary criticism. I would highly recommend the course to other students, as it forced me to gain familiarity with relevant primary sources, both canonical and slightly outside the canon, as well as recent interests of scholarsin my field.",
    "I would highly recommend this course as a solid grounding in Taisho\/early Showa literature.",
    "This course involved a healthy amount of reading each week of texts from or about the first three decades of the 1900's in Japan. The reading usually consisted of a work of literature and one or more supplementary pieces of criticism or theory that offered insight on the work in question, so there was usually a clear starting point for discussion. The amount of reading each week was manageable, but much of it was in Japanese including old orthography and kanji, so students who are not confident in their Japanese reading abilities should think twice about taking this course. Otherwise, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in an engaging analysis of literature and culture in the Taisho and early Showa Japan. Though of course no class can be exhaustive due to time constraints, this seminar covers a good deal of ground and has plenty of material that could lead to further investigation."

   "comments": [
    "This course deepened my knowledge of important literary texts of the early 20th century, more recent engagements with literature from that time period, and potential avenues for future research. The engagement with primary texts forced me to closely examine the works themselves rather than rely on commentaries and readings by scholars, allowing me to formulate my own readings and interpretations with my classmates. Moreover, being able to explore recent scholarly work on the primary texts helped me gain an understanding of what issues are currently of interest to scholars in my field, as well as how I might offer new approaches and readings in my own research."
