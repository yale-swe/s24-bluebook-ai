    "Instructor: Peter Anton Christensen \u00a0The TA was not helpful or patient in explaining questions on the homework assignments. It was often more confusing to ask questions of the TA than to just not ask a question at all. In class, the TAs often asked questions that were either not directly relevant or too nuanced to be productive and they sometimes ended up using a lot of class time to get into debates with the professor that should have been time for student discussion or lecture.",

He was very willing to spend extra time if you are committed to learning the material. He was less willing to directly answer questions to the effect of \"how do I do this problem\". Some of us got used to having these answered by TAs during F&ES 505 last fall, and I think it's a good thing it didn't happen again this time around. This F&ES 800 was an intermediate-level course, after all."

    "Great class overall. Readings were awesome and lectures supplemented well. The only advice I would have is to be able to cut students off from asking so many questions as to ensure that you get through the material you look to cover.",

    "Kenny G is great. He's very enthusiastic and knowledgeable.",
    "Professor Gillingham is a lovely person who clearly cares a lot about his students. He's also obviously a talented economist, and it's exciting that we get to learn from him early in his career. He does often wait too long to get answers for questions, and generally use the socratic method in a way that I think isn't entirely successful. I could see his teaching ability improve over the course of the semester, however. I'm sure he will be great someday. He's very helpful in office hours and over email when we have questions about problem sets and projects.",
    "The readings were really great. I appreciated the thoroughness of the Professor in choosing readings that matched the lectures and were accessible to students with a variety of past academic\/professional experiences.",
    "Problem set language was not clear, and Peter never clearly answered a question with \"Yes, that's right,\" or \"No, that's not right.\" which was incredibly frustrating. More helpful to give clear answers than to advise us to look over numbers again. Felt like the beginning of the class was a little fast, and the middle\/end was a little slow as we got bogged down in dense material or class discussions. Also, the end of every class was too fast as Ken sped through slides (too fast to take meaningful notes!). Workload felt a little heavy with problem sets that were sometimes deceptively difficult\/took a long time, plus the group project, plus reading a lot of dense material for class, plus studying for the test.",
    "G-Ham's a genius, but his teaching style still needs a lot of refinement. He should imitate the style Mendelsohn uses. The pace of slides was not consistent, and he asked too many questions of the class - really unnecessarily.",
    "This is a great class. You can tell Ken puts a lot of effort into the class. He comes to class prepared every day and has strong grasp on a number of topics relating to energy economics and policy analysis. I think the class had just the right amount of class discussion (something that is not always easy to pull off).",
    "There was some overlap in course material between this class and others at FES, so the amount of new material was limited. Additionally, the course moved along slowly at times because the professor would open up the class to questions but not realize when to move on to get through the material. The questions and comments usually came from the same people who tended to dominate the conversation, thereby limiting the value-add of open discussion. While I appreciate discussion based classes, the format is very difficult and not the best fit for a class with 50 students.",
    "I really enjoyed this class!",

    "Ken's enthusiasm for the material and great readings",
    "Professor Gillingham is very intelligent and prepared. He challenged students with the final project and with the readings. I like that he assigns the latest work in his field, rather than recycling old readings. He also challenges students to come to class prepared to discuss them. If I were him, I would cold-call students, as it was clear that many of them didn't do the readings. At the same time, there were a lot of readings, so maybe a better strategy would be to assign fewer readings, but raise the expectations for the ones you do assign.",

    "Great readings and discussions",
    "The final projects provided a great opportunity to apply some of the key lessons learned to specific topics that interested us.",

    "The course content was interesting, Ken is an excellent instructor, and the final projects were very interesting. I learned a lot by attending the final presentations of all of the student projects.",
    "The readings were very well selected: relevant, recent, and challenging on the technical side without being overwhelming. Dr. Gillingham actively encouraged student participation during lectures, which I felt kept everyone engaged and encouraged people to do the readings. Also, the team project was an amazing experience! Dr. Gillingham had high expectations, so we pushed ourselves and came up with something we were all very proud of.",
    "I learned a ton from the project - definitely keep this in the next iteration of the class!The format of the class - with lectures front-loaded and project time at the end - worked very well.",
    "Some readings were very interesting and useful but in general daunting in length which isn't always conducive to actually learning from them.",
    "The assigned readings and the discussions about multiple topics relevant to those interested in energy.",
    "Three things:- The course has some depth to it, and material seems to be taught at the leading edge of what the academics in the area are thinking- The material is extremely relevant to anyone interested in energy- The readings are similarly high quality",

    "Class discussion tended to lead nowhere. The Professor needs to ask less open-ended questions.",
    "invite guest speakers",
    "Not too much really. As mentioned above, try to move a little faster as to get through all the material.",
    "Class size was perhaps a bit too big to go deep on some topics; likely had something to do with it being the first time it was taught. Smaller class would make it more interesting. Perhaps some balancing of the workload as well: some classes are more about delivering conceptual content (i.e. problem sets, exams) whereas others are about developing a very significant research project. This one tried to combine both, and I felt a bit stretched thin because I do want to go deep on the project but needed to spend time on problem sets and test as well. Maybe consider having this be a bit more of a foundational class in energy that doesn't have as much in the way of big projects and also have a separate (and smaller) advanced seminar where you can really dive deep on some topics and do a meaty project.",
    "No more cockfighting in class btwn TFs\/instructor - stay focused.",
    "I would have preferred two more lectures at the end of the year, rather than the project meetings. There's always more to cover in energy economics. We rushed through the urban section at the end, for example.Professor Gillingham is still a bit rigid and uncomfortable when teaching. I know he's young, so I'm sure he will improve.",
    "Reading synthesis",
    "Lectures can get bogged down with off-topic comments from students that disrupt the pace and slow learning (especially with a large class).",
    "My only request is that Professor Gillingham post the readings earlier to allow us more time to complete them.",
    "the teaching assistants interrupted class time with questions that did not help our learning. Professor Gillingham should have put a stop to that. Peter was also rude in his responses when we had questions about the homework. the lectures also spend too much time going over readings. it takes away the incentive to do the readings because then lecture is duplicative. Then, because nobody has done the readings we're discussing, class if awkward.",
    "- Less discussions between TFs and the instructor- Sometimes discussions on side issues went on for far too long- In order to advance faster it would sometimes be better to give less students the chance to voice their thoughts- Ending class on time",
    "It would have been nice to make the problem sets more applicable or more like the final project. For example, the quantitative portions of the problem sets could be designed such that you more directly develop quantitative analytical skills that would be use for the final project.",
    "Moving through difficult class material without getting caught up in unnecessarily argumentative class discussions with the TAs. Simplify\/clarify language on problem sets, especially for #1 and #2.",
    "The format of the class. Sometimes the class was being dominated by questions and prolonged discussions on one topic, and there were less room left for actually covering the materials.",

    "See #15",
    "A little more focus on quantitative aspect of energy economics during class time would be helpful.",
    "The assignments were not always directly linked to the content we were learning in class. There were several occasions when we did not have the required knowledge\/ skills to complete all of the assignment questions based on the knowledge we had been presented with in class, and thus for some assignments, it required many students working together in a group and asking the TAs questions in order to figure out the answers. If there is a skill we need to know to complete an assignment (ie. Calculus), this is a skill which should either be presented in class or in a TA help session.",
    "I think we could have used a little more guidance on the first problem set. The expectations and methods for the modelingexercise were a little unclear, which led to a lot of floundering without knowing if we were moving in the direction the assignment was designed to push us.",
    "I understand the desire to get students engaged and talking during lecture, but there is a balance that needs to be maintained. Near the beginning of the semester, lectures would get bogged down by student comments for 30-40 minutes at a time. There were a few lectures where we made almost no progress forward through the material in an hour and 20 minutes. Balance is key!",
    "Upload the lecture slides the afternoon before and not right before class because there is no time to print them out, especially since it starts earlier than most classes.",
    "The instructor is getting a lot better, but still doesn't quite seem that comfortable in lectures. And his powerpoints are very informative, but can be a little dry for 8:45 in the morning.",
