    "Reading about scientific topics and writing about scientific issues. Discussing science and science reporting",
    "I really learned about the industrial influence on all health and medicine issues.",
    "This course opened my eyes to the field of epidemiology, something which I am now fascinated by. I appreciate (now that I have completed it) the extensive literature that this course demanded as it forced me to look to the present and past literature, including scientific journals, academic articles, and press releases, surrounding issues that I was largely unfamiliar with.",
    "This course really improved my understanding of the responsibility of the media in faithfully conveying scientific information to a wider audience. I learned a lot about the importance of scientific journalism, and the relevance that it plays in the dissemination of essential information. Having to come up with questions about the readings assigned by Professor Bazzell, and reading the questions that my peers had come up with, taught me how to critically analyze texts and extract the important prompts that they suggest. Reading multiple sources that, often times, differed in their perspectives on a certain topic also taught me that it is imperative to be well-versed on both sides of an argument in order to be able to more holistically converse about it."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Really interesting material, good discussion Weaknesses: Not a lot of feedback",
    "It was a fascinating course which extremely interesting readings. However, it was very long, and there was often no structure. Thus, the class periods often felt pointless or repetitive. I actually liked it when the professor used presentation slides.",
    "Strengths: this course covers many interesting topics and pushes students to look to different presentations of those topics to understand it. I also love the guest speakers. Weakness: I do wish this course fulfilled some distributional requirement- considering the amount of scientific reading and content that we do it would have been appreciated if the course could have been applied to fulfill a distributional requirement. I also think that while extensive readings are helpful they can also be counterproductive - structuring this course in a way that limits the readings so that calls discussions can be more comprehensive and insightful would have been wonderful.",
    "Strengths: really interesting readings, fascinating topics selected on the syllabus, conversation\/debate-style discussions were very engaging. How course could be improved: maybe have one class or two entirely dedicated towards giving the students a little bit more guidance before they begin to write the final paper."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I found the material and discussion to be very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course, as the subject matter was extremely interesting. However, I would caution students that the teacher speaks very quietly and that there isn't much structure. Thus, class periods are not very engaging.",
    "Yes. This course was fantastic. It pushed me to educate myself on issues that have stakes in current society instead of just basing my opinions on one article or press release. It also opened my eyes to the field of epidemiology, which I am so glad to know is a field and a potential career prospect.",
    "Definitely! I think that any student who is set on pursuing a career in medicine\/public health, or interested in scientific journalism, should absolutely take this course. The topics selected for discussion and the reading material that Professor Bazzell assigns are incredibly eye-opening. I now have a much sharper outlook on problems that I could only superficially talk about before. In addition, not only will you acquire a lot of knowledge about important matters, but you will also develop your perspective as both a consumer and producer of scientific media. Participating in this seminar was a transformative experience for me."
