    "Take it. It's awesome.",
    "Great class for cross-country studies on the applicability of various economic policies and schools of thought. The coverage of economic theory at the start of the class is just enough without being too technical or burdensome, and the case studies are great. This class isn't advanced, and will leave you with a lot of questions, but it does a great job at looking at economics through a mix a empirical studies and theory. Also, professor Moore is one interesting guy - definitely go to his office hours.",
    "Great class--highly recommended to any econ majors who want to get their hands on less theoretical material. It's case-based, so you'll get a sense of economic narratives--Professor Moore is also a very fun, very engaging professor.",
    "This is a case study-based course. It's a lot like intermediate macro in terms of content, but is taught entirely through real-world examples. Professor Moore is fantastic, he's funny and keeps discussions lively. He doesn't tolerate any nonsense, though, so do the reading or he'll call you out. This was my favorite seminar, definitely take it!"
