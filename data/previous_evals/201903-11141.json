   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - class discussions were amazing Weaknesses - very little feedback throughout the semester",
    "strengths - the book choices were strong, interesting, and all relevant weaknesses- more literature on north africa, reconfiguring seminar structure to have it feel more like a free-flow of ideas rather than super-structured",
    "Most of the books connected with each other in interesting and relevant ways that were very conducive to discussion.",
    "While it was useful to have questions guiding each class, they seemed too many that this felt too restrictive. A number of the books did not seem particularly relevant to intended themes that the class. Also while students were required to provide reading responses they were neither provided with feedback nor did their remarks seem to be featured very much in class discussions",
    "strengths - excellent reading list; best discussions I have had in a class; helpful feedback on final writing assignment weaknesses - If pushed to select one, I would suggest having the final assignment slightly more structured such that toward the end of the semester several students per class offer a brief 5-minute overview of their research paper progress with a limited time (2-5 minutes) for class feedback. Although such scaffolding is not necessary for a graduate seminar, I personally find it helpful and enjoy learning about the projects of others."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, a good introduction to African social history",
    "Absolutely! Dan is a fabulous seminar leader and offers provocative questions that extend the significance of the material beyond the text itself. I enjoyed the reading list greatly, even those that I would traditionally not consider within my area of interest, and consider it to be my favorite class of the semester. Although I often felt limited by the response papers due for each book, I ultimately found them very valuable for guiding my thoughts during discussion and they certainly will come in handy during orals prep."
