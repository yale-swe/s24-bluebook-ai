    "This is a survey of the literature in international relations, with an emphasis on the big theoretical debates. It is useful for students who plan to take the comprehensive exam and for students who want a better understanding of the set of puzzles that constitutes the subfield.",
    "Heavy work load, but definitely worth it if you want to study IR.",
    "This course is a survey of the international relations literature - it fulfills this purpose well. I'd recommend it to anyone who would like a starting point for understanding the key theoretical debates in this field, or for those seeking a refresher in advance of comps.",
    "A challenging introduction to the major discussions in IR. I would recommend ONLY if you are very interested in IR."

   "comments": [
    "This course did three things for me: 1) It pointed me toward some possible areas of research to which I might contribute; 2) it rekindled my intellectual interest in IR; and 3) it gave me a good start for preparing for the comp. I think this course was very helpful.",
    "It particularly deepened my knowledge of the discipline by pushing us to engage in the major debates of the discipline from a critical position.",
    "Like I said before, it was a excellent review and analysis of issues in international relations. I had not studied most the of the issues we discussed before I took this class. It helped me learn about other perspectives and arguments, giving me a much better sense of what current scholars say about the pressing issues in IR. With that, I have a better position from which I can critique existing scholarship and identify the best questions which are yet to be answered. One of these unanswered questions could be the basis for my future research projects."
