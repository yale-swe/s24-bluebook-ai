   "comments": [
    "A great survey of the American politics literature and skills on formal modeling.",
    "I developed a better understanding of the formal models that are used in the discipline, and in particular, the strengths and weakness of different types of models in connecting questions concerning institutions and political behavior.",
    "This class was an excellent overview of how game theory can be used to understand both institutions and behavior in American politics. The weeks built upon one another in unique and interesting ways that not only made me feel more adept at reading papers of this kind, but also highlighted key tensions and questions that remain in the literature on voter and politician behavior.",
    "I gained a greater understanding of the state of the literature of American Politics, particularly as it has been studied by formal modelers. This a was highly useful synthesis of models on individual political behavior and on the actual process of passing laws."

  {
   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths include the rigorous formal models presented through its assigned readings as well as other academic skills relevant to publishing and general engagement in the profession. No apparent weaknesses.",
    "I think this course is difficult in the sense that how technical we can get into the models depends on the distribution of prior technical ability. That said, the course was good in being able to draw out the substantive intuitions of the models while being as technically simple as possible - there was a good balance of substance and actual modeling. I think for the same reason, the course suffers from being unable to focus on one or the other in as much depth. That said, I think if this was taken in addition to Political Behavior and Institutions, that's not as much of a problem.",
    "This was a great discussion-based course that ensured all students were engaged and participating. I wouldn't have minded a bit more empirical work in the readings, as well as a unit on partisanship. Other than that, I can think of no major weaknesses."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommend for any serious student of both American politics and political science in general.",
    "I think this is a necessary course for graduate students focusing on American Politics mainly because of it's ability to bridge the behavior and institutions literature. Moreover, it's a useful introduction to seeing how modeling is used specifically in American Politics. The weekly responses seemed tedious at first, but it actually ended up being very useful when it came to reviewing the material.",
    "Very useful for the American subfield exam. Also a great class to take for game theory skeptics, as it does showcase the usefulness of models very well."
