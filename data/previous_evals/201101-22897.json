   "comments": [
    "Everything you ever wanted to know about the Iraq War. I took this class because I wanted to learn about why we went to war, and I feel that I've learned so much. Definitely take this class if you're interested in international relations today.",
    "An excellent, incredibly thorough analysis of the Iraq War, from the relevant history of the early 1900s up until today. Great look into the decisions and decisionmaking of the Bush administration, and how Obama's turn in the White House has changed (or hasn't changed?) everything. I would definitely recommend it for someone interested in the topic, BUT I think everybody at some point should take a course with Jolyon. One of the best professors I've encountered at Yale.",
    "This class is good if you really want to know everything there is to know about Iraq. The professor also lets you explore almost any topic for the essays which is nice if there's something you really want to focus on. The discussion was not terribly engaging, but perhaps with a different set of students it would change.",
    "Yes! Professor Howorth is a very accomodating and knowledgable man. I felt honored to be taking this seminar with him, someone who has travelled so extensively and been involved with the EU for so long. Although some of you may have taken the lecture class with him, you really should experience him in a seminar. The class wasn't very difficult, yet incredibly interesting for those intrigued by the current state of affairs in Iraq. The only real assignments are a seminar paper at the end and a five page paper for the midterm. I highly recommend this seminar!",
    "This course is great, whether you know everything about Iraq (which is doubtful) or know nothing about Iraq. Moreover, it's great to know current events in thorough.",
    "This is a good overview of Iraqi political history as well as the 2003 invasion and its aftermath. Prof. Howorth is brilliant and fun, and he cares about his students. HIGHLY recommended.",
    "Interesting portrait of the Iraq War -- brief history and then in depth analysis of the development and future of the war. You will get as much out of this class as you put in. Prof. Howorth is an expert on France, and extremely knowledgable about the war in general, so you can really get a lot out of this class if you want to.",
    "it's really comprehensive; we learn about the mandate period, baath period, lead up to Saddam, how Europe armed Iraq, the first gulf war, sanctions regime, lead up to war, etc etc.",
    "This course is AMAZING. I actually usually like lectures more than seminars, but I loved this class. Every discussion was great, and though this always depends on the students in the class, it also had a was largely due to Professor Howorth's efforts. I especially love the way Professor Howorth has a student present each week on a specific topic, rather than just summarizing the readings that all the students were already supposed to have done. Also, the fewer readings and only 4 bullet points for the semester helps decrease the workload so that you can really focus on analyzing the readings rather than just skimming through as much as possible. Professor Howorth's own bullet points really added to my overall understanding of the material and provided a lot of new points to discuss during class. Definitely one of, if not the, best classes I've ever taken, and I looked forward to going to class each week. Professor Howorth is an excellent professor, go to his office hours for literally anything, and he is always willing to help.",
    "By all means, take this class! It is thoroughly enjoyable. Prof. Howorth began the class several years back in an effort to explore and explain the events leading up to the 2003 Iraq War, and the class provided me with a deeper understanding of the issues surrounding Iraq and its conflicts since its formation as a British mandate. Ironically, Iraq's stabilization probably means that 2012 will be the last year that Prof. Howorth will be teaching this seminar; if you have any curiosity about the events in Iraq and what they mean for the future of Iraq, the Middle East, the international community, and the United States' foreign policy, take this class!"
