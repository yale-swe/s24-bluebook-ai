    "I would recommend this as a seminar. Just be aware that you will not watch a movie every class period.",
    "interesting course, very history\/work heavy. you HAVE to do the reading because you will be presenting at least three times in the semester. the syllabus is very daunting but is not necessarily followed. i guess take it because there are legit no interesting world histories and this is definitely interesting. and you get to watch movies for homework! but doon't be fooled there's also lotso reading",
    "I don't think this class will be taught at Yale anymore, but if it is, anyone interested in Indian cinema should take it."
