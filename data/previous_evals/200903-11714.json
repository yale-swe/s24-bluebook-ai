   "comments": [
    "Stressful in-class, but no lab write-ups. Pretty helpful. I wouldn't recommend it, but most people don't take lab for kicks.",
    "It's a lot of work in a boring, confusing and occasionally impossibly frustrating course. Take it if you have to.",
    "Interesting lab work for the most part. Occasionally the labs were just a little long and very draining.",
    "Yes. No homework so its good...but the labs can be a bit time consumng. Grades depend mostly on lab notebook and practical...which was not bad.",
    "Decent class, a legitimate half-credit, but hope you get an awesome TA and prepare yourself for LONG sessions in the lab.",
    "This lab goes with Physics 200 or 260. It doesn't require much prior knowledge of physics. There are no lab reports - you read and prepare the labs beforehand and then just do everything during the lab period. This does not mean you should not take this lab seriously though. You should read and prepare the labs well - understand as much as you can, look up references, and be prepared to ask questions for things you don't understand. Otherwise you will be confused during lab and will take forever, and when the practical comes around you will feel very nervous and regret that you did not take it seriously. If you are prepared for the lab it will be a lot of fun.",
    "This course is designed to give you an idea of basic procedures in experimental physics. Since it is a required course for Physics majors, I guess they have to take it, but there are significant shortcomings in this course. First, the labs are overpacked with stuff. I was rushing through them every time and I really did not learn anything new in them. Second, the grading is very arbitrary and not conducive to wanting people perform well, since they're going to end up with a simple checkanyway. Third, I did not get much help or advice about how I could improve my performance, only general phrases like \"I think you are doing fine\". Nobody tied to the course really seems to care about it, from students to supervisors.",
    "A basic introduction to laboratory skills in physics, especially error analysis and signal collection.",
    "I was there because I had too. I'm happy it's over.",
    "Don't take it unless you absolutely have to. It does not get you excited about physics, but instead just shows you the tedium of the experimental physics that was done a long time ago. Basically the only useful thing you learn is error propagation and some data analysis, but these are taught in sucha brief and unsubstantial way that I don't feel like I was really taught properly. The labs are long and tedious and will most likely not be the part of your week to look forward to. It's nice that there is no work outside of class but at the same time you are evaluated on the work you do in class. It's very unclear what the standards are and since there always seems to be a time constraint it is very difficult to do a good write-up (especially without knowing what they really expect).",
    "The course is relativity simplistic but it does help to familiarize you with the lab and basic lab procedures. So for the amount of time it takes is is worth while.",
    "A poor course that doesn't teach much. The only useful things it teaches (error propagation and how to use an oscilloscope) might very well have been taught in 2 or 3 afternoon sessions. The labs are uninteresting, but in all fairness, they're only there to either provide a context to use an oscilloscope or for you to use error estimation techniques, not teaching you physics.On a brighter note, no work outside of class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It's great because it doesn't have any lab reports, plus it actually teaches you useful laboratory skills.",
    "Long and tedious. Eats your afternoon and is generally miserable. Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "This is a tough lab. Don't take it in conjunction with PHYS 200 if you haven't had sufficient preparation w\/ electricity&magnetism, because that seems to be the emphasis of this course (last 1\/2 was dedicated to circuits etc). No lab reports outside of class, but the lab itself is draining and stressful (have to finish it in the lab period).",
    "Physics majors have to take it. Nobody else should. If you can, try to get Jack Sandweiss for your section; he's fantastic.",
    "Sometimes a little dull, but good overall.",
    "Very boring lab.",
    "It's nice that you don't have to do lab reports outside of class, but it still takes up a chunk of time on your lab day. Some labs are fun, but others are just tedious. Take it if you have to(or in place of 165L because I've heard 205L is much better), but if you don't need it, you would probably just get frustrated.",
    "I'm assuming you have to take this. It's a terrible class, I wouldn't take it if I didn't have to, and I LOVE physics. If this was a decent course I would love it. I hear good things about the second semester though..",
    "if you're taking it, you probably need to. it's not terrible, and it's nice to not have lab reports outside of lab. not fun though",
    "No work outside of lab, though the grading is very arbitrary and each lab is tedious and long. You will always stay past the end. Lab practical in the end is difficult.",
    "This is a fun course. It's very laid back and you get to play around with a lot of cool stuff. It does tend to take a lot of time (from 1:30 until usually 5 or 5:30) but it's very laid back. I would recommend this course.",
    "The course can be difficult in that the labs are long and can be monotonous, but there isn't much work outside of the labs beyond reading the handouts and preparing for lab.",
    "The course covers some of the concepts in Physics 200 but some that were not covered. I would recommend taking it along with Physics 200 only if you have had a good amount of physics instruction before.",
    "yes but beware of the lab material, i suggest you take this a semester offset (meaning if you're starting physics 200 in the fall, take this lab course either in the spring or next fall) because we do electricity, a bunch of random topics not covered in the first semester of physics. also, beware of the final. when it gets close to reading week and all, annoy your instructors about the final andask them about it, for fall 2009 it was very, very poorly organized. on top of that, the final was impossible.",
    "Take it if you have to. Otherwise don't. It's a very poorly designed course. You learn nothing about physics, which is pathetic considering its a PHYSICS lab. The labs also have no logical sequence to them. You hop from 1st and 2nd semester physics topics without any connection between topics. However- grading is easy because there are no lab reports (only notebooks)",
    "Make sure you learn how to use the oscilloscope.",
    "The labs are long and hard, but the instructors are willing and able to help.",
    "This course prepares you to do measurements in physics. Probably the most important thing taught in here is techniques in error propagation as well as detecting and describing linear relationships between variables. Unfortunately, it can be pretty boring at times.",
    "A fine course. The nice part is that there are no write-ups outside of class, just in-class notes (and you'll almost always get a check, so no reason to try super hard). THE PRACTICAL IS A BITCH THOUGH. Okay fine maybe not worthy of CAPITALS, but not fun. Make sure you actually read the labs. I never did, and I paid for it at the end. I think...",
    "I would only recommend this class if you need to take it to fulfill a requirement."
