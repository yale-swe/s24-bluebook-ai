   "comments": [
    "This course was comprehensive and taught me a lot about the fundamentals of neuroscience, mostly with animal models. This course would be interesting for students of psychology (neuroscience track) and other related fields in social sciences, since this class sheds much insight not only on animal behavior, but human behavior as well (e.g. drug addiction). The exams really test you on a lot on the nitty-gritty details, so be prepared to review the names and functions of various drugs, neurotransmitters, and brain regions. It's good if you already have a knack for these sort of things-- maybe you've already taken classes in biology or organic chemistry?",
    "I would probably recommend other Core B classes for psychology majors. I feel like they could be easier, having both a lighter workload and lighter amount of material to cover.",
    "Great class if you have a good biology background and are interested in the material. You must do a LOT of memorizing. The class average is quite high though (high 80's).",
    "Detailed, but very interesting. You'll be frantically taking notes the entire class, but it's easy to do well in the course, especially since everything is so straightforward--there's just a LOT of material. But it's a really interesting subject so you'll enjoy it!",
    "Good, solid class. You get what you're expecting, and you learn the material. It's a very helpful class, although not always the most interesting (if you're not normally a neuro-type psych person). Professor organizes the lectures very well.FYI-- Most the time I was just annoyed that I bought the book, as the exams are based totally on slides and lecture.",
    "This is a basic overview course of Neuroscience, and covers more global things like what parts of the brain do what. I would recommend it because it is interesting material, and pretty straightforward in its grading.",
    "Great survey course that covers a lot of material very quickly. Strengths - quick pace keeps you on top of your work b\/c there isnt room to fall behind. Knowledge is tested via 5 tests and an final exam because the large amount of information needs to be tested in manageable chunks. That said, the tests truly were manageable. I really enjoyed this class.",
    "Only take this course if you're good at rote memorization. Nothing's explored in depth and the course superficially touches on as many things about the brain that can be covered during the semester.",
    "If you're interested in neuroscience then this is a great class. If not, don't bother.",
    "A lot of work and memorization but definitely worth it. This is one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Yale. Lecture is clear and straightforward, and the tests are fair. Plus, the brain is just really interesting. Definitely take this over Brain and Thought if you are deciding between the two. You will actually learn something from this class.",
    "A lot of memorization. Take it if you like the material and are good at cramming information into your head.",
    "I would definitely recommend Psych 170 to those who are genuinely interested in the brain and nervous system. There is a lot of information to cover, but it is manageable as long as you go to class and study in advance for the tests. The format of testing is nice because Professor Schafe breaks up the material into 5 tests and a final instead of having two huge tests and a final. Overall, this is a great class!",
    "If you are interested in this material, it is a really fascinating class. You needn\u0092t read the book to pass the class because Professor Schaffe covers 40% of the book in 90% of his lecture and the other 10% of the lectures is not in the book. However, the book is fascinating and much more interesting than the lectures.",
    "Very thorough course. Tons of information. Lots of exams. The exam was more difficult that I had expected.",
    "Overall very informative course although it was a LOT of memorization. Information was interesting though.",
    "Comprehensive overview of neuroscience, with less focus on brain parts and more focus on certain systems and drugs. If you've taken Brain and Thought, this course is not necessarily more difficult, but the material is more intense, because tests are more often and there is no regular section.",
    "Take it if you are at all interested in the brain. PSYC 120 is also available for those who don't want such a tough course. This class goes through a lot, but the 6 tests make it manageable. Professor Schafe is very well-organized in his lectures, so it makes studying all the more easier.",
    "I would recommend this class. You learn lots of info on neuroscience. Though it's a lot of work, it's definitely very rewarding.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, but this course is very science-y so be prepared. There is a lot of material and many exams, but the pace is good and the exams are spaced out nicely. Personally, I think having the many exams helped me learn the material better.",
    "This class was well-organized and direct. I didn't always get the big picture during a lecture, but looking over it later everything fell together well enough.The first read-over of the lecture slides is spent understanding everything again. Each time after can be actually spent memorizing the material. Every detail is important to know. And although that requires a lot of time to study, it almost makes it easier because you know what's expected of you.If I could have changed my habits in any way, I would've reviewed the material more gradually. Take advantage of the fact that this class has no assigned homework to study the material before hand.And the book isn't very necessary, it's true. Maybe to clarify concepts, but the internet can do that too ;D",
    "Good introduction to neuroscience if you think you might be interested in it.",
    "Yes,if you're interested in behavioral neuroscience. A lot to memorize and tested frequently but I know a ton now.",
    "I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a Sc credit. You have to work to do well. Review the slides a few times, but other than that, very manageable, which I appreciated.",
    "Study the lectures. Don't really need the book.",
    "If you have a good science background, take it. It's great.",
    "yes - especially to any premeds or students especially interested in neuroscience",
    "A good course, and, if you're looking for a science credit, a very real, legitimate learning opportunity. A lot of information, but well-organized, although often presented in a way that's hard to take in the first time.",
    "yeah if you wanna know about the brain and how it functions",
    "Fundamentals of Neuroscience provides an overview of the workings of the human brain and nervous system. Topics include anatomy and physiology of the nervous system; sensory and motor systems; reproductive and ingestive behaviors; learning, memory, and emotion; and neurological disorders. The course was taught very well and was highly interesting. In some cases, the material emphasized rote memorization over conceptual understanding, but this was not characteristic of the course as a whole. I would definitely recommend the course to students who are interested in the material.",
    "This class requires a lot of memorization of somewhat tedious material but it can be very interesting. There is a lot of material to memorize but Professor Schafe seems to try to make it interesting at times.",
    "Very straightforward class. Lots of memorization, but that's to be expected of a basic neuroscience course. If you prepare well for the exams, they aren't bad; if you don't prepare well, they are very difficult.",
    "Psych 170 covers the basics of neuroscience. All you need to know for exams is the information from the class lectures, and the class slides are posted online with blanks that need to be filled in during class. The lectures aren't too exciting, but you really don't need to read. The averages on the exams were always very high though, so make sure you know your stuff.",
    "Psych 170 gives a very good overview of basic Neuroscience, but it is occasionally dull.",
    "Overall, a good course. Professor Schafe's a pretty good lecturer and you get a good, although by no means comprehensive, foundation on different areas of neuroscience.Work basically consists of very detailed memorization of lecture slides.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the brain and Brain and Thought was too \"non-sciency\" and wordy for you.",
    "I love the class; if you're not looking for that much further neuroscience experience, B&T or 160b might be better, but even the strictly behavioral and animal studies in 170 are fascinating. It's not that hard, you just have to devote time to studying, about as much as you would for a language class - you don't need to read the textbook, just bring the lecture slides to class and fill them in, then study them a night or two before the exams and you'll do fine.",
    "I'd recommend it if you are interested in psychology and physiology",
    "Pretty easy class until the final, which destroys everyone.Know that he will drop the lowest in class exam even if he does not mention it until Reading Week.Also, everything on the tests are on the slides, so it is not necessary even to go to class if you get the fill-ins for the slides from other students.",
    "If you take this class, you will definitely learn a lot about neuroscience. That said, the class consists entirely of lectures accompanied by dense 60-slide powerpoints, six exams, and a few movies. If you don't want to memorize a lot of things, this class is not for you.",
    "I would recommend Psychology 170 to a student who is interested in a broad overview of neurological processes underlying animal and human behavior, but the format of the class does not provide for a thorough understanding of these processes given the detailed nature of so much material.",
    "PSYC 170 isa very thorough introduction to the physiology of the brain. It is very mechanistic and strongly emphasizes the molecular level of the circuitry. This course is almost entirely memorization. I would recommend this course to a student seeking a very thorough mechanistic understanding of the brain.",
    "As a neuroscientist, I can tell you that it is best if you want to memorize many different drugs and chemicals and brain pathways. People in this class set a pretty high standard of performance on the tests, so don't expect much of a curver mccurverson.",
    "Yes. I think this was a great introduction to neuroscience because it taught the fundamentals about the brain with detail but without overwhelming students."
