   "comments": [
    "This is a good class to take even if you have no prior experience in art history. It is especially interesting to revisit topics and artists covered in other art history courses through a very different lens.",
    "This is a great taste of an interdisciplinary investigation of two histories. The focus is more on the art, but the history of science portions are complete and interesting even without being related to the art side of things. The lectures are the most interesting part of the course.",
    "I'd say skip it unless they've added a history of science professor to the course. As it was, the history of art stuff was pretty cool but the course was described as exploring the co-history of art AND science and it pretty much failed on the science side. It was also a pretty significant amount of work. If you're not sure about the course, this is probably one you should pass on. (i.e. Don't take it if you're not super excited about it.)",
    "The course was good if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in the ways in which art influences and is influenced by other disciplines. If possible, however, I would try to take the course when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being taught as a section rather than as a lecture course.",
    "I would recommend it if the student is genuinely interested in theoretical aspects of art history. Because the class is not so much about art itself such as forms and expressions, than what it signifies in the history of human knowledge."
