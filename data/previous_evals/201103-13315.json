   "comments": [
    "Has the potential to be a good course. I think I could have had a great experience if I had a great professor. Shital is not too good, though. I would not recommend this section.",
    "One of the best English classes I have taken.",
    "It is a good class for people who enjoy studying literature and talking about very abstract ideas. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in studying literature or majoring in english. I would say it is not as helpful for people who are thinking about taking non-English classes that require writing.",
    "I would recommend it because the course readings were indeed an enriching experience and the depths of analysis to which the Professor goes are very intriguing as well! It generally broadens you horizon and makes you think deeply and in another way about our existence as humans.",
    "lots of writing but an interesting course!",
    "Yes, if you have some writing experiences. The readings are interesting!",
    "I would recommend this class to other students because it gives an opportunity to discuss great literature in an intimate setting and learn the basics of an argumentative essay.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student. The material we cover forces you to rethink concepts and definitions that most people take for granted. Exploring the idea of what a human is gives you a completely new perspective to view the world through.",
    "Definitely take this if you want to whip your writing into shape and prepare yourself for future Yale writing courses.",
    "English 115 involves reading a number of books, essays, and poems and writing 4 essays in total. The class definitely prepares you to analyze and write about a variety of literary forms as well as think about the class through an analytical lens.",
    "This course is good, if you have the patience to ensure that you can give adequate time to reading the texts very thoroughly and spending an equal amount of time thinking about the text as well."
