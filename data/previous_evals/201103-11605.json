    "The class is okay. You will learn a lot because Zedillo knows a ton, but I have some issues with the class. First, the structure is super repetitive - every day, several students present on parts of the reading, and with all of Zedillo's interjections and \"explanations,\" this usually takes up the full two hours. If the presentations end early, he will lecture (and he's very boring) for the rest of the time. You will probably do 3-4 presentations for the semester in addition to the midterm and the final paper. Weekly Reading responses are also required. Second, the reading is ABSURD. There were weeks where I had more reading for this class than all 4 of my other classes combined. I've never had a class with as much reading as this one.",
    "A fantastic, challenging course that shows all sides of the globalization debate. Strongly recommend this course. It is truly a privilege to have a course with Professor Zedillo.",
    "Great class, but A LOT of reading. ALso, the class time itself is kind of a waste because it is mostly student presentations on the weekly reading rather than actual debate.",
    "This class is a good overview of the history and current debates surrounding international economic integration. The readings are really informative, interesting, and comprehensive. That being said, there's a lot of it (usually over 350 pages a week) and a 2-page reading response due every week. Also every student presents an average of 3 times a semester. Add a midterm and a final paper, and you're looking at quite a bit of work. I also felt I learned a lot more from the readings than from the lectures\/presentations themselves. If you know what you're getting into, take it.",
    "A must for economic seniors. Even a must for IR students and EP&E. Excellent summary of what globalization has been, is, and should become.",
    "If you are interested in globalization then definitely take this seminar. The required reading alone will give you a good grasp on the topics and challenges that globalization faces today, and of course, Professor Zedillo is very knowledgeable on the subject. Prepare yourself for a lot of reading, weekly reading responses, and student presentations."
