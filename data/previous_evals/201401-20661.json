    "I would recommend The French Enlightenment to any French major as well as any student interested in French\/European history or philosophy. You'll get to see the roots of many modern French ways of thinking and witness how France developed as a country.",
    "Yes, absolutely, in spite of the early meeting time.",
    "If you are interested in the literature and political philosophies in France in the period leading up to the Revolution, then take this class. The readings are of fairly standard difficulty for an upper-level French seminar and they are very interesting if you like the topic of the course. Professor Kavanagh, in addition to being an expert on the subject, is very friendly, and gives the students plenty of opportunity to speak and discuss during seminar. Upon completing the course you will have read some of the most classic works by Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu, and others. I highly recommend this class!"
