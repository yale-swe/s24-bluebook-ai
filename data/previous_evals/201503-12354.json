    "I would tell a student that Math 112 is much more difficult than calculus in high school. I did very well on my ap exam and was thinking that I would be able to tackle math 112 but it proved much more challenging than I was expecting. I don't know if I would recommend the course to someone who hasn't taken calculus before because I think it would be pretty confusing and difficult.",
    "yes, great professors, comprehensive curriculum",
    "Math 112 was not a fun course, don't expect to have a good time taking this.",
    "I believe Math 112 is a great course for understanding the basics of calculus and getting a solid math base.",
    "If you've taken BC calc, this class will be a breeze. Otherwise, I'd recommend anyone to take Math 112 who is looking to satisfy a distributional requirement. The class is do-able if you put in the work. Just be super careful during tests of careless errors and explain fully what you mean or you won't receive partial credit."
