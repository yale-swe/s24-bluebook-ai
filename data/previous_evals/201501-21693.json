    "This course requires prior understanding of chemical engineering principles. It demonstrates the practical aspect and aids the theoretical understanding.",
    "It is a good lab and a class that you have to take. It is nice to get good lab experience.",
    "The senior chemical engineering lab design course is a wonderful way for students to apply their knowledge of four years of chemical engineering courses in one comprehensive module. The lab covered several pertinent topics including molecular beam epitaxy, complex fluids, heat transfer, membrane separation, and diffusion. The course however had many errors in the lab manuals where key parameters were left out of equations or incomplete information was given. The course could be improved with brief lectures at the start of each lab that cover important references or sources of information that can help supplement the lab report, a discussion on results expected to be received, and analysis of why those results should be expected.",
    "Be prepared to work pretty hard, but you'll get a rewarding cross-section of your engineering life.",
    "Not that bad. The labs themselves are pretty straightforward to complete I actually finished most of them early. You complete five labs during the semester, and each lab is completed over two 3-hour lab sessions (with one session per week). The lab report for a given lab is due two weeks after you complete it. Youll be split into groups of about 3 people, and each group will rotate through a different experiment each week. The topics themselves are pretty cool and relevant to current popular research areas in chemical engineering (they change, but we did gas separation membranes, catalytic resin reactor kinetics, molecular beam epitaxy, heat transfer, and colloidal suspensions and spectroscopy). The labs do not always follow what the lab manual says just try to learn the concepts vaguely and have a sense of the lab work youll be doing, and ask lots of questions during the pre-lab discussions. The lab reports are graded VERY strictly (I did very well on pchem lab reports and struggled to get high scores on these lab reports). Be concise, make sure everything you write is correct, present all your data, use appendices well, and you should be OK. Meet up with your group members to analyze the data and go over the findings together before finishing your reports. Read over your reports and try to learn from the corrections you get. Try to get in a lab group with people you like and who you can work with, as youll be with them the whole semester."
