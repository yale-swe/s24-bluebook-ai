   "comments": [
    "This class can be a lot of work at times (such as the week when we read all of Invisible Man), but I would definitely recommend it to someone interested in the material who is willing to put in the effort.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Professor Greenwood is a great teacher - warm, knowledgeable, interesting, and real with it. We read many seminal works by African, African-American, and Caribbean authors, which is awesome because I had not yet had a chance to read them (nor did I seek them out). Easily one of my favorite classes this semester.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It would be useful to have some prior knowledge of important Greek Classic texts however this is not necessary. There is a lot of reading but it is all very enjoyable.",
    "In this class, we read a lot of literature on classics in Africa and in the black diaspora. It gave me great idea of the kinds of ways classics have engaged with cultures other than the more expected white Europeans. It was also a fun way to learn about the socio-political experiences of people in African countries, in the Ca.ibbean, and in the U.S. I came into the class from a different academic background from most people in it, having read little Graeco-Roman literature in my past, but I found it easy to catch up, and to form views of my own. Every week, you go through some readings and submit a 400-word reading response on the classesv2 forum. There are two longer papers, one mid-semester and another at the end of the semester. The professor is really kind and knows how to bring out the best part out of your contributions to the class, and the students she attracts are the same way.",
    "This is a great course on post colonial discourse and the classics. It is at once an introduction to that discourse as well as an in depth look",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class as one of the rare college experiences where you're honestly excited to do the reading and self-reflection every week. The workload is definitely manageable if you keep up with it and as far as instruction and class format, you won't find a kinder or more intellectually thorough professor.",
    "AMazing class if you're at all interested in cultural appropriation\/ intersection of politics and literature. Manageable working load - 500 reading response a week but only 2 2000 word papers.",
    "Take this class. The pieces we read and the discussions we had and the papers I had to write have entirely changed my life perspective re: education and the classics. Really important works and ideas to be aware of as participants in yale's system of higher \"elite\" education.",
    "This is a great class, even if you don't have much background in the Classics or in Black literature. You'll a learn in this class from both Professor Greenwood, who is an absolutely phenomenal professor, and from your classmates. The discussions we had in this class were always very lively and dynamic, and I found the themes we explored incredibly interesting. Professor Greenwood does a great job of introducing themes and ideas to the discussions. The works you'll read in this class are also really wonderful, and the discussions will definitely challenge you to think about them in an interesting way. I would definitely recommend taking this class if you're interested in learning more about black classicism!"
