   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "This course gave me the vocabulary to talk about race and religion in early modern texts. I think this course fills a void in the English department - I feel very lucky to have been able to take it, and I think all English majors should take this course or a course like it.",
    "I learned an enormous amount about how race functioned in early modern England, in and out of the theater.",
    "This course deepened my close reading skills, taught me how to think about texts through different critical and interpretive lenses, and taught me how to weave other scholarship into my essays.",
    "More close reading skills, new plays and other texts that I wouldnt have the opportunity to read in other Yale English courses, new ways of analyzing texts too in conversation with other scholars and with primary sources",
    "This class allowed me to expand my knowledge of classic or canonical early modern texts by analyzing it through the specific lens of race, religion and gender. I also was able to develop and write a 20-page research paper.",
    "A really in-depth analysis of how the issues of race, religion, and gender have affected both the literary tradition and its staging, through the present day.",
    "Prof. Nicholson's class was an often-challenging, but consistently rewarding, seminar through taking it, I learned just how much effort (and effort of a particular kind) has to go into writing a full-length English research paper, and also got the chance to apply the critical thinking skills I'd acquired in previous courses on literature and race to read Early-Modern texts in a way that felt fresh and thrilling. Prof. Nicholson herself was wonderful an energetic, brilliant, and supportive presence who always seemed to be the most awake person in our 9:25 seminar. I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to the demands of higher-level coursework.",
    "Professor Nicholson is excellent, and she developed a set of themes during the course that became very incisive ways of looking at these Early Modern English texts.",
    "Wow! I knew literally nothing about this time period and now I feel like I know all about racial attitudes back in the day. Also gained a great familiarity with reading material from that period, feel comfier with literary criticism, writing 25 page papers, etc",
    "This course introduced me to several Early Modern plays other than Shakespeare that I would never have otherwise encountered, and helped me gain an appreciation for those plays even when the class consensus was that the play was ridiculous! I also learned how to think more critically about a text in a historical context, and also to think critically about the history of scholarship surrounding plays.",
    "This course had a strong emphasis on research and literary theory, as well as primary sources and background material, with the goal of reading these sources to improve our understanding of a literary text. The cumulative project was the creation of a reasonably long research paper engaging with all these sources to construct an original argument. Throughout the course, we were presented with various critical frameworks useful to approach a theatrical text, read a variety of plays and primary-source background material, and developped writing skills with occasional short assignments in addition to the final paper."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - diversity in the syllabus (canonical texts and lesser-known texts), theoretical framing of the class, instructor Weaknesses - I think it might have been helpful at times to have more structure to discussions. For example, doing small group or partner exercises where we close-read a passage together and then share to the group, etc - I think this might have been helpful for more quiet students participation-wise as well!",
    "I adored this course - no weaknesses except that I wish there had been a more racially diverse group.",
    "This course was really amazing. The discussions were incredible, and Professor Nicholson was very generous with her time.",
    "Very strong!",
    "This course was absolutely perfect in construction. I see no improvements necessary.",
    "A fascinating course and a great syllabus- I just wish it had a few more modern corollaries!",
    "If I had to suggest one (very tiny) way this course could be improved: I would have liked us to engage a little bit more with the primary sources we read each week, since they seemed to get a bit marginalized over the course of our discussions. Other than that, however, this course was absolutely stellar it was one of the first seminars I've had where every meeting felt like a real conversation between the professor and students, and Prof. Nicholson was an unbelievably supportive professor, always willing to make time in office hours (even when I started going for what felt like too often) and always ready with brilliant feedback about the direction of my work.",
    "The strengths are all in Professor Nicholson. Weaknesses might be that, if you don't have a background with analyzing plays, it can be a little difficult to feel prepared for class discussion.",
    "Cathy is an amazing seminar leader, one of the best Ive had. I thought our discussions were almost always super lively and engaging. Didnt find any of the exercises very useful except the draft maybe those assignments could be changed?",
    "I felt this course was basically perfect the way it was, with just the right balance of texts and criticism from different writers. The plays and the criticism we read went together so well and produced some really interesting discussions in the class. The one thing that might have enhanced the class even more was if the supplementary primary source texts we read were even more integrated into discussion; it felt at times that they were an interesting sidebar but it wasn't always immediately clear to me how they connected to the text. However, that was a small thing that would have just made an amazing course even better.",
    "This class is excellently put together to help students approach the potentially staggering prospect of writing a lengthy research paper, with built-in benchmarks and approachable writing exercises throughout the semester. The syllabus features a great range of material and well-chosen critical essays. To be honest, no big weaknesses spring to mine. Some of the texts were stronger than others but all brought something important and useful to our discussions. Class discussions were always a delight if sometimes unorganized. More specific discussion questions from the professor would have been useful but this didn't get in the way of great discussions and a great class."

    "I think every English major should take this course. Cathy Nicholson is one of the best professors I have had at Yale - she is generous, rigorous, and such a great section leader. The discussions we had in this class were incredible and mind-blowing; I learned so much about how to talk about race and religion in early modern texts, but even more than that, I think what I loved about this course is that it showed me that we *can* and *must* talk about race and religion in early modern texts.",
    "Please please take this, especially if you're an English major! It's not that much work, which means you can really dig in and think hard about everything we read and talk about.",
    "If you have a chance to take a seminar with Catherine Nicholson, do! She really challenges you, facilitates amazing discussions, and will challenge you in the best way. That said, it's not a course to phone in or slack on.",
    "Yes! Professor Nicholson is excellent",
    "Absolutely! This course is an incredible way to reconcile readings of Shakespeare courses past with the present moment. Cathy Nicholson is one of the best professors Ive had at Yale; her insights throughout the semester as well as her syllabus changed my understanding of these texts and made me a better reader, social thinker, and writer.",
    "YES. Professor Nicholson is incredible and it's an amazing class- one of my favorites! Take it!",
    "This is an amazing class, but you should take it only if you're really willing to handle the workload studying race in the Early-Modern period is a different challenge than studying it through modern texts, and you have to be responsible and careful with your insights. But Prof. Nicholson is also really refreshingly willing to hear out and incorporate new and exciting readings of the texts sometimes ones she hasn't thought of herself into our discussion. It will expand your understanding of how to read literature, of the status of canon, of literature in the public sphere just everything all at once. I can't recommend it highly enough.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! I shopped the class for an English major requirement, but I found Professor Nicholson to be a very insightful facilitator, and discussions were always interesting.",
    "Yes!! I really truly didnt want to take this course I was dreading fulfilling my pre 1800 requirements for the English major but this ended up being one of if not my favorite class of the semester. Not only is Cathy an incredible prof, who makes everyone feel intelligent and has this amazing breadth of knowledge that keeps class fascinating, but it feels wildly interesting and strangely important to think and talk about these constructions of racial otherness in preimperial England. Also especially fascinating to read plays bc a) these anxieties\/stereotypes\/markers of difference were so obviously put on and performed and b) bc theater was so instrumental in shaping early modern conceptions of race so it also feels influential in this unexpected way!",
    "I hope that anyone who is able to can take this class. It was such an interesting way of thinking about these plays, and the discussions we had were always interesting and unexpected. Even discussions about the better known plays like Othello or The Tempest plays where the themes of \"race\" or \"religion\" might have seemed blatantly obvious brought up new ideas and nuanced interpretations that I had never thought of before. I looked forward to doing the readings and going to class every week.",
    "Absolutely! This is an excellent course. Prof. Nicholson is wonderful, enthusiastic, and approachable. It's a decent workload but the course is structured to make that manageable. If you're interested in understanding early modern texts as cultural artifacts and learning about how cultural understandings of race developed, this is a great class.",
    "Yes! Professor Nicholson is fabulous and the plays and other readings were all quite interesting."
