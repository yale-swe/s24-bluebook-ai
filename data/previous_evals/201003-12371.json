   "comments": [
    "If you are taking 301 just to learn diff eq, then I don't know if I'd necessarily take it. The course is a bit too ambitious, and you end up cutting some material off at the end, including diff eq. Take it if you want a realtively easy review of linear algebra and calc I-III.",
    "This was a great course that covers a very extensive range ofmaterial. It perhaps covers a bit too much and there was not enough time to go over vector spaces and differential equations in the end (luckily, Professor Baker was fair about not putting material that we didn't have time to cover adequately on the final exam). I didn't really appreciate Shankar's textbook enough until studying for the final exam -it is great. He highlights many important\/unconventional applications of the material and covers it in a way that is instructive and enriching once you understand it a bit more.",
    "It covers some useful topics. I'm not sure if it would be better to take real math department classes, since that would go into more depth.",
    "This is an alright course but, focuses too much on the earlier stuff and basic calculus whereas I believe it should focus more on differential equations, linear algebra and other stuff less people are familiar with. In retrospect I might have rather taken diff. eq. from math department but this class wasn't very hard and you could learn very well from the Shankar's book becausealthough the class doesn't go over all the book covers.",
    "Yes. A good course for anyone that wants to learn new math, review old concepts, etc.",
    "If you want to work on your math and review\/possibly learn more about calculus, this is a good refresher course to take-- it keeps you sharp. Also, there's a bit of complex analysis, which is interesting. I wish the course had spent more time discussing and working with eigenvalue equations and function spaces.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to solidify their basic math skills"
