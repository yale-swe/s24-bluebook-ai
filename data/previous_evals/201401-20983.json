   "comments": [
    "A great class for those who are interested in careful analysis of Milton, Eliot, Wordsworth and Pope. You will learn how to analyze these texts closely and learn a lot about the English literary tradition.",
    "The second part of a survey course focusing on the major poets of the English Language, from Milton onwards. I would definitely recommend ENGL 126 to another student, even if they're not considering the English degree, as I feel like a more literate person capable of understanding the important works we studied. Everybody I know could find that kind of instruction valuable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I know that the curriculum is roughly the same in all 126 sections, but Prof. Glaser reads Elizabeth Bishop as the extra poet and I think her poetry rounded up the material well. The assignments are manageable and Prof. Glaser makes class fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially if you like Bishop, who is not covered in other sections, if I'm not mistaken. The types of exercises and assignments in this class were diverse (from blog posts to meter analysis..). The work is not overwhelming, but be prepared to be on top of reading when plowing through Milton.",
    "The English department has picked a curriculum that's timeless and engaging, so if you have a good teacher (and Ben Glaser was one), it's definitely worth taking. That said, it's a lot of work, so you should probably either really enjoy poetry or be a fast reader\/writer before adding this class.",
    "Better than 125 and if you're an English major you'll have to take them both!",
    "A very worthwhile course for any English Major or anyone else really. Wonderful poetry."
