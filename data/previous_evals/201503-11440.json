    "LING 624 01 is a class that, in addition to introducing mathematical concepts, teaches students how to reason formally and how to apply this reasoning to linguistic analyses. I would definitely recommend LING 624 01 to another student because it definitely introduces important foundations for linguistic study and is very well-taught.",
    "This is a fast-paced introduction to mathematical topics that are important for linguistics. With emphasis on \"fast-paced\". This is an excellent and very well taught course, and is highly recommended for those who are not afraid of writing mathematical proofs or are willing to lose the fear."
