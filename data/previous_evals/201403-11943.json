   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was a pretty straight-forward course on verb conjugation, basic grammar, and vocabulary.",
    "Spanish 130 was a good review course for all of the material that had been taught in both L1 and L2. Speaking became a larger part of the class than it had before because of the amount of grammar review done in class. It is very clearly outlined in the syllabus which makes planning extremely easy.",
    "Take this course with this professor. She made me enjoy and learn spanish. She really understood each individual in the class and how to help each person succeed.",
    "You have to take this class for a requirement, so you should take it with the greatest teacher, Profesora Reymundi. She was really excited to teach us, and she sometimes brought in cookies\/candy on Fridays!",
    "Involves lots of grammar review with some new vocabulary. Largely centered around in-class speaking practice, including daily partner activities. Reminds me very much of a high school Spanish course.",
    "This is a great class you learn a lot and the department does a great job",
    "It is not too much work, and you're grammar will improve a lot.",
    "SPAN 130 is a typical language course. It's a lot of work every day, but the number of new things you learn makes it completely worth it.",
    "If you've taken Spanish here before, you probably have a pretty good idea of this class. It's a very structured introduction to intermediate grammar and speaking. You will spend more time on the latter, and leave feeling more confident in your ability to read and write. There was lots of speaking, but mostly in a small group context, so your improvement on that front requires alot of self-discipline. It's quite a time commitment, meeting everyday and having an average of 30 minutes of work a night. There will be nights you spend much more though, reading an original story (which is itself a cool experience, but a bit of a drag if you're busy). Professor Reymundi was wonderful, and I would totally recommend taking the class with her.",
    "I would recommend it, I enjoyed it more than L1 and L2."
