    "Highly recommend. Really fun, immersive lab that will expose you to some anatomy\/dissection, insects and birds, some cool skulls, and even some stream ecology fieldwork. Very diverse as the name suggests. Our class also got to participate in the Yale Nature Walk as a final lab project, which was super cool and really fun.",
    "EEB 223L is a really fun lab. You get to do super cool dissections, field trips, and bond with a great group. There is so much to learn about the world around you and Prof Wells and her TF team put a lot of work into making this lab excellent and engaging. You write lab reports every week but most are \"mini reports\" which are very simple and often fun to write up. A few are full reports which are a lot of work, but honestly it's good practice. I recommend this lab to anyone curious about evolution or ecology, or who loves learning about cool animals!",
    "Definitely take this, especially if you're premed",
    "This was an absolutely fantastic course. If you need to take a bio lab, this is the perfect one. Professor Wells is engaging and extremely interested in the wellbeing of every one of her students. Not only do you get to do dissections, but you also get to go on field trips. What other class gives you that??",
    "E&EB 223L is a straightforward introductory evolutionary bio lab. The lab is laid back throughout most of the semester, but can become a handful due to a tree project and some of the longer lab reports. Overall, the lab course was enjoyable and allows you to observe a variety of specimen ranging from bacteria to mammalian skulls. I recommend the course to any pre-med that needs another bio lab.",
    "Really fun. As much work as a 1 credit class.",
    "Take EEB 223L--it is probably the most enjoyable standalone biology lab to be found at Yale at the moment. Not only is the work totally manageable, but Professor Wells is amazing and will make you genuinely interested in the biology you're learning. She really tries to make the class as engaging and fun as possible, and it shows.",
    "Take it! Evo bio is awesome, organisms in nature are doing some crazy stuff you probably don't know about but need to learn to admire and understand before you graduate, and the people leading the class are super caring and helpful. Really, there's no going wrong. Just keep up with the weekly lab reports. They take a bit because you will want to include all those pictures on your iPad and write tons about it.",
    "I would definitely recommend E&EB 223L to my fellow students. It is an exciting, hands-on class that really helps you to understand the diversity in the world around us.",
    "If you're tired of studying biology on the microscopic level, or you just want to try something new, take this class! It has been my best lab experience at Yale. Marta is incredibly enthusiastic, and the TAs are wonderful too. You do some really cool stuff--it's so much fun--but you also learn a lot! Be prepared for a few longer lab reports, but overall the workload was more than manageable.",
    "It was a phenomenal course! Professor Wells is absolutely amazing. It was not a lot of work, my TA was really helpful and labs were fun. Definitely take it if you want an easy bio lab for your premed requirements. This is the perfect lab for you if you're taking 5 other credits!"
