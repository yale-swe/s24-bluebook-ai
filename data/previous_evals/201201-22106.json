    "Farsi will likely be the most crucial language for our generation to speak. In terms of the vocabulary there is a lot of overlap with French and English. The accent is not difficult to imitate. The grammar is also very simple and consistent so overall it's an easy language for an anglophone to pick up. I can't believe how much I have learned in two years. Honestly, anyone can master Farsi. When I graduate I know that studying this language will have been one of my greatest accomplishments at Yale."
