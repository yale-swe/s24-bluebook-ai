   "comments": [
    "It is an interesting class, but it did not help improve my Portuguese. I learned about Brazil, but I would have loved the opportunity to speak and become more fluent, something the professor did not really help with.",
    "Yes, take this class if you're interested in practicing Portuguese and learning about Brazilian culture, art and history.",
    "Taught as leminar- not many students but no discussion. No work or exams.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this class for both people who have no knowledge on Brazil and for those who are already very knowledgeable. In class discussion is great and will help you gain perspective on this course.",
    "I think the course matches what the description says: a very broad view about Brazil. Paulo is a good and funny professor. The only weaknesses of the course are that we never followed the syllabus (so we're always lost with deadlines and the topics for the day) and that students didn't say much in class, which is bad since you expect some conversation in a L5 course. In general, I feel like I'd take this course again, since I enjoyed the material and Paulo was a very dedicated professor to his students. The work is very spread out throughout the semester, so you barely notice that you're doing work for the course (two papers, short readings and some short writing responses\/presentations). In short: valeu a pena e eu faria a aula de novo!"
