   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student if they are very interested in language, especially Italian. The student must be prepared to spend a lot of time in class, but it is all worth while.",
    "If you have a knack for languages or are really interested in learning Italian, absolutely take this course. You make so much progress in a relatively short amount of time and really see your work pay off. It is intense, but not overwhelming so--mostly just in the amount of class time that there is. You have to stay on top of the lessons every night or you will fall behind, but it's not too much to handle. It really is a great introductory to the language. However, if you're not sure, this class is probably not for you. You have to really want to immerse yourself and to learn the language.",
    "Without a doubt, take this course if you have any interest at all in Italian. I would recommend taking it if you have a background in another Romance language though. Everyone in my class was already familiar with Spanish, French, or Latin, which definitely helps. It's been one semester and I feel that I'm already essentially fluent. The course is also great because it's filled with students who want to learn the language instead of students who are trying to fulfill their language requirement. Farina is brilliant, very knowledgeable, and very encouraging. He pushes you to the limit and at times, the workload can seem overwhelming but worth every second of it. Best instructor I've had at Yale thus far. He will not disappoint, and neither will the course.",
    "Take it. This course was fantastic - easily one of the best I've taken at Yale so far, and Michael Farina is great. He's so passionate about the language, and presence in class made Italian a lot of fun. His teaching style demands a lot, but his expectations are for the most part realistic and ultimately made us better students.There is a lot of work (quizzes every day, tests every week, and compositions due every week), but at the end of three months you will come out of the class feeling like you've really grasped Italian.",
    "IF YOU WANT TO LEARN ITALIAN TAKE THIS COURSE RIGHT NOW",
    "I would recommend this only if you have studied another language before. Its extremely fast paced and if your not sure how languages work, it will be hard to keep up. The great thing about this class is you know almost all the grammar you need to speak in a semester, which is awesome.",
    "take it",
    "Great class. Very fast paced but you will enjoy the challenge. TAKE IT if you want to study Italian. You will not regret it.",
    "I would only take this class if you are serious about learning Italian. It is a long class to have every day. The daily quizzes are extremely helpful but you must prepare for them. I would highly recommend it as a class but you have to already have the will to become fluent in a new language that will get you up every morning and make you prepare for the quizzes every night.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course. I would say that it is certainly intense and requires a lot of daily study but you will learn a lot. The challenge is incorporating it into other daily activities so that the knowledge is maintained."
