    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The first half of the course focuses on the incorporation process and towards the middle you read and analyze legal cases involving corporations. Very useful information for an aspiring entrepreneur. At the end of the course, almost every lecture has a guest speaker (generally a Yale alum who started his own company). A notable speaker from this year was Miles Lasater of HigherOne.It's great. It had less work than most courses I've taken at Yale, but I definitely got a lot out of it.",
    "I would recommend this class, but you have to be interested in VC. Otherwise, it might be quite boring.",
    "this is a great class, take it if you can! the cases are fun to read and you learn a lot about starting your business.",
    "Excellent class. The second half of the semester is a little slower, but you learn a lot of extremely useful material and the professor is great. There should be more classes like this at Yale.",
    "Very interesting course! A little too law-focused for me personally, but I learned a lot. It gets pretty technical\/pre-professional, which is an interesting deviation from standard liberal arts courses.",
    "This class is a fantastic and fun seminar that requires some reading and some work, but not a crazy amount. I struggled a little bit in the beginning, but overall I loved this class and the people in it and the extremely useful knowledge about business and law and life that I acquired. If you are interested and can get it, take it!",
    "I came into the class knowing pretty much nothing about VC's and start-ups. But the end I was able to talk to start up company's and hold my own in the conversation. Also hearing speakers come in really helped clarify what exactly the start-up world was like. I felt I got a deep understanding about what are myths and truths in business-building. Also got some FAB book recommendations about being business savy.",
    "I'd definitely recommend VC& the Law to anyone interested in the entrepreneurial field. The class is fun, interesting and very educational."
