   "comments": [
    "The Matlab code could be much clearer, which I think would significantly improve this course for people who don't come in with a lot of programming experience. Also I still want to know why it would be necessary to re-impute a variable that does not depend on model parameter when doing data augmentation in MCMC.",
    "This was a very good course. Difficult, but manageable. I think it could have used more guest lecturers, as these were very informative.",
    "I really enjoyed the course. I think a summary of all the methods we learned at the end of the semester would be helpful. It doesn't need to be super extensive, but just a wrap-up slide or two saying this is what we learned and the types of scenarios that you would use to analyze that particular data. The course is difficult, but it is not unreasonable!",
    "Great course, but very difficult. A little more introduction to big concepts at the beginning of the course would have been very useful. I found myself getting confused fairly often, which may have been minimized if I had a better grasp on the basic material.",
    "Overall, the course is really good and you learn a lot of valuable concepts and methods that will be useful in the real world. It isn't an easy course, and unfortunately, without a proper background in probability,a lot of the reasoning behind why we use a model is lost. The final exam really did help to wrap up the course and was a good reflection of everything we had learned throughout the semester. The problem sets were (at the time) not fun to do, but looking back at them, they were not that difficult. Definitely very helpful for the final exam. They were also spaced out well in the semester. The course would work a lot better if there was a pre-req for another statistics course.",
    "This class was really useful, and I found myself being able to recognize different quantitative ID epi methods in the literature and apply what we learned to other examples outside of class. I think that in the future, it might be helpful to cover just a bit more of the basic probability and PDF\/CDF material that I (and I think others) had less of a background in. Maybe just one class or one half a class more, and some take-home practice problems or to include some of that in the first problem set so that we really sit down and think critically to learn those topics right from the get-go. I found the problem sets very helpful for better thinking about how to apply the material.",
    "It is a tough course but fantastic. I feel like I learnt a lot in one semester, the labs were really helpful to understand the content better and I really appreciated the fact that we were working on real data most of the time.",
    "This class was a LOT of information and code. Ginny and Joe made a valiant effort of guiding us through it all, and I think they might have even succeeded most of the time! Strengths: both Ginny and Joe are extremely smart and qualified. Ginny is super patient and very approachable. The material is quite interesting and challenging. I actually found the homework satisfying (once you got the \"ah-ha!\" moment) as well as didactically useful. I learned a lot from the people I worked with, too! Weaknesses: code could be explained better. I know this isn't a computer science class, but I think you get so much more out of it when you actually know what parameters you're playing with. This was done some of the time, but not enough. We probably should have asked for more clarification during lab, but we usually didn't get the R code very far in advance so we were often looking at it for the first time during lab (and thus didn't have time to really digest what we were seeing). Improvements: I think Ginny's already on this, but due to the sheer volume of information, it would be helpful if this was split into two classes, or we got some sort of primer from a pre-req.",
    "Good course overall.",
    "This course was challenging but interesting. It was above my mathematical skills but I still really wanted to learn these methods and tried very hardtop get there. I would say that perhaps the expectations were a little too high. Collectively most students were a lot more confused than we were following along. I would suggest spending more time discussing why one model might be used instead of another, and the strengths and limitations of each model. Some of the math and coding was just so confusing I don't think I will be able to apply any of that in future. But the basic methods and being able to basically consider the strengths and limitations of published material, that is something I think I gained from this class and could be strengthened.",
    "This course and content are absolutely crucial. The concepts that students are exposed to are some of the core reasons why I went into public health. I don't personally understand why it is not a requirement for people getting an MPH in EMD. With that being said, I don't think this course gets the attention or time it deserves. The amount of time we have in lecture and in lab are not nearly enough for students. The lecture is very useful but unfortunately there is no reward system for doing the readings. Having graded short thought provoking questions attached to the readings would make students do the readings. We are so overwhelmed with work that we have to prioritize. And we tend to not pay as much attention to things that don't have points attached to them unfortunately. Secondly, the lab and homework are not sufficient for us to master the concepts. Students need many more examples working with real data or at least real settings and scenarios to learn. All in all I would say this course along with the surveillance course in the spring need significant expansions so that students can have the opportunity to really build expertise and working knowledge.",
    "I definitely learned a lot in this course. I think that personally I didn't fully grasp every concept, but it was more due to a lack of background knowledge on probability theory and distributions than what what covered in the class. Ginny's slides are very informative and she uses a lot of examples. I liked that lab was structured to be instructive but also somewhat interactive. The labs are really helpful for the problem sets as well, and it is also helpful to be able to work in small groups for the problem sets."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a03",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Great teacher. Really knew her stuff and could provide some of the new, evolving methods.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Great instructor. My only complaint is that sometimes questions were asked that weren't super relevant or beyond the scope of what we needed to know (to the point of confusion to many members of the class). It would be nice if you could recommend that those with more advanced questions speak to you in office hours. I do realize that it is a difficult balance, but many times, I stopped paying attention because the answers would confuse me. It was difficult to refocus or know when to refocus my attention once the answer was given.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0STRENGTHS - Ginny is approachable and answers questions patiently. She also provides good feedback on problem sets - She's receptive to feedback - She's an awesome person WEAKNESS - Could provide an extra slide or two before\/after introducing a model to just summarize why exactly we are using a model (in terms of situation and not necessarily in \"probability talk\") - It is more work: But if you want to ask us questions about certain concepts, maybe don't provide us with the pdf that has the answer already on the slide. You could leave it blank and provide us with the full version after class, or make us pay attention and write notes on our own. A lot of the reason why no one answers is a)we don't understand, b)the answer is written on the next slide and nobody wants to be THAT person.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Ginny was very responsive to our concerns and very open to feedback. She did a good job of presenting difficult information that was new for all of us. One thing: sometimes students would ask questions that seemed way outside the scope of the class, and while interesting for a bit of time, there were a few instances where it seemed like it might be more appropriately discussed in office hours. Not a huge deal, but perhaps something to think about going forward in juggling how to best manage class time.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Professor Pitzer is doing a great job trying to keep everyone in the loop and answering all our questions in class. The readings were really helpful and definitely made it easier to understand the class. One suggestion would be , for the slides that have questions to be answered by the students, to remove the answers and post them later.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Strengths: Approachable, funny, definitely cares and asks for feedback Weaknesses: Sometimes explains concepts too technically--some of us learn better through analogy and more narrative explanations",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Really excellent. Cared a lot about student progress and tried to get us all through this material. I don't think any other professor was as considerate and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Dr. Pitzer is extremely knowledgable and very competent. She speaks very clearly and does a really good job keeping your attention which is not common so kudos to her. I do not have any significant criticism.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Ginny is a great professor. She really wants everyone to get something out of the course and is really receptive to questions and comments from the class."

    "If you want to get the most learning out of this class, do every homework yourself, and then compare your answers with your partner, but be prepared to sink upwards of 6 hours per homework. You can mitigate this by splitting up the work with your partner, but you won't get as much out of the class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in modeling. One of the better courses I have taken at YSPH.",
    "Great! I definitely recommend taking it!",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in modelling and in just being able to understand how infectious diseases are analyzed quantitatively. You need a strong statistics background, but overall it isn't too bad. You also get to learn how to use MATLAB.",
    "Great but challenging course for learning about how and why infectious diseases differ from others and methods for representing them.",
    "A great course, that every EMD students interested in infectious diseases data analysis should take !",
    "Great if you are willing to put in the time on problem sets. I really liked the R section but I also thought the Matlab code was fairly intuitive. Definitely helps if you are comfortable coding and asking \"dumb\" questions--don't worry, everyone else is just as lost as you are. All in all, I think it was one of the more interesting EMD classes -- a must if you are at all interested in modeling.",
    "Unless you have a strong math background, be prepared to struggle. This class will teach you about methods that you will learn in no other class. Put in a significant amount of effort and you will come away with a foundation to build off of.",
    "This was my hardest course at Yale so far. But also possibly the most important. I highly recommend taking it.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in quantitative analyses of infectious diseases."
