   "comments": [
    "Great class if you're at least somewhat into art. It is a very painful class though if you are someone who would get annoyed by all the talk about the emotions and feelings of art.",
    "Yeah, I'd totally recommend HSAR115 to another student. Lectures were incredible; section (held in the YUAG) was a great supplement. The material was fascinating and really enjoyable. I would caution other students that Nemerov takes a more emotional approach to art history than a historical one - so accept the fact that what he says is super subjective and take it with a grain of salt.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Take it. To all those kids at Stanford who will have Nemerov next year, I hope you appreciate him.",
    "I mean, Nemerov is gone now - sorry for you. But this course is worth it anyways, if only to get to know art. My liking and appreciation for many forms of western art has gone up so astronomically during this semester that it is hard to describe. Worth it even if it was taught by a computer.",
    "Great intro course, as I'm sure the rest of the evaluations say. Sad to hear Nemerov is leaving; hopefully the next prof will be as great. Sometimes the ideas that Nemerov says are over your head and oftentimes he makes up words, but other than that he is amazing.",
    "AMAZING lectures and then section in the art gallery with TAs! AMAZING, although now that Professor Nemerov is leaving, it's hard to say what it will turn into.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken. It'll be hard to gauge how it'll be now that Nemerov is gone, though.",
    "I would recommend this course for everyone - not very hard and very interesting material to give you a broad survey of western art.",
    "Well since Nemerov is no longer teaching it, it won't be the same course. That being said, you really are not missing much because Nemerov definitely far from the best teacher in the department. If you're looking for a real intro art history class, take the first part as Professor Jung really is a wonderful teacher. Nemerov is just a self-centered man with a lot of ideas that have very little coherence or basis in the art itself. There's a reason some people think the study of art is bullshit; this class almost made me hate my own discipline. It's worth your while to take a REAL art history class with someone else in the department, someone who will actually teach you how to think about and analyze art.",
    "This introductory art course is a MUST TAKE at Yale. It can be applicable to any type of student and is very interesting. The lectures are great and the work load is not bad. You can really enjoy this class. Especially if you take it Credit D.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student simply to become a more cultured world citizen with a general sense and knowledge of art. Nemerov is extremely good, and listening to his lectures twice a week really made my semester.",
    "History of Art WITH Professor Nemerov is an incredible experience. Every Yale graduate should leave with the basic coverage of art history that this course provides. It is a shame that Professor Nemerov is leaving the school, because I think the course will never be the same without his magical presence.",
    "Great survey. The material everybody wants to learn in a survey class, and everyones favorite material. Unfortunately it moves really fast because of how much material there is to cover. But its very fair.",
    "Yes yes yes yes yes. Although Nemerov is leaving so it doesn't really matter now. But this was one of my absolute favorite courses at Yale. It taught me how to think and talk about art!",
    "The class as taught by Professor Nemerov is absolutely a \"must-take\" at Yale and will undoubtedly serve you well in your attempt to become a cultured and thoughtful person. The future of the course is somewhat up in the air, though, because the main highlight was watching and listening to Prof. Nemerov. Anyone can look at slides on a screen, so an art history class is really made or broken by the lecturer.",
    "History of Art is basically listening to a very impressive lecturer give his ideas about certain pieces of art throughout history and drawing parallels between different pieces of art. To learn the history and understand the context of the pieces though, you have to do the reading. I would say anyone should take this art, if not to be a little more cultured when they walk into a museum!",
    "A must for liberal arts education.",
    "Take it if you want to get a broad appreciation for art. I recommend it Credit\/D.",
    "Amazing class. Nemerov is the best. No idea what it will be like in the future without him, but if it is even close to the same, take it!",
    "Excellent course. I would definitely recommend it. Grading apparently can be variable, though I found it to be quite fair. The workload was definitely not bad at all: you really don't need to do the readings from week-to-week, though I would reccomend browsing through them before the midterm and final. But really, the course is primarily lecture-based. Sections in the art gallery can be very interesting as well. Overall, I learned a lot and am definitely glad I took the course.",
    "I would recommend this course, although if Nemerov is going to leave that might be different. It is enjoyable and interesting, although it's a strange survey. It's weird to have an art history class that devotes an entire class to James Ensor but hardly any time at all to Van Gogh. We learn what Nemerov wants to teach (and he doesn't hesitate to push his own opinions), which may not be the most thorough survey, but is interesting nonetheless. It was enjoyable and you get a new breadth of knowledge.",
    "YES!",
    "Professor Nemerov is this class. I am so glad I took it, I have no idea if another professor will make this class as great, but it truly is wonderful to have an idea of how and more importantly why art changed from the Renaissance to the present day. I will never go to a museum the same way again and I am so glad for that.",
    "This class, with or without Alexander Nemerov, is a must-take at Yale. A new way to look at history and the world. And an opportunity to take full advantage of the incredible art collections we have access to here. This class makes me feel like a more well-rounded, informed citizen.",
    "This is a must take for everyone, regardless of interests or concentrations. You will leave with a new appreciations of what art is and why art is so powerful. There are no weaknesses. The lectures are informative and enjoyable and the papers and exams were a great way synthesize the information",
    "Why didn't you take this course while Nemerov was still teaching? You FOOL! I can't help you because I don't know who will teach it this year or whether it will be good. I'm also graduating. Sayonara.",
    "Nemerov is leaving so it is hard to say. If the new prof focuses more on context, take it.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. Work is totally manageable. Prof Nemerov's lectures were brilliant - not sure how the new prof will be though..",
    "I mean...it is what it is. Prof. Nemerov is brilliant, but his interpretations are often a little out there. This isn't a standard art history survey--this is listening to him wax poetic about interpretations that may be genius or may be complete bull. I still haven't figured it out. But he's leaving, so I guess this is useless.",
    "Take it if you want a basic understanding of art history. There are better courses out there if you have some background. Might be different after Nemerov is gone.",
    "Definitely. This is a fantastic intro art history course. Simple and fun.",
    "Definitely take this class. It is a knowledge that will be useful for life. It is a shame that Professor Nemerov won't be teaching it again though as he is leaving.",
    "i would definitely recommend this. Not too much work and amazing class.",
    "Take it. Nemerov was the reason I took this class, and it's definitely true that it's a shame that Yale is loosing one of its absolute best lecturers, but having a basic background in art history is actually really fun! The paintings are beautiful, and you actually get to see what we have at the Art Gallery.",
    "I would highly recommend the course for those interested in obtaining a survey of western art.",
    "It won't be the same without Nemerov, he makes the class. Although it would've been helpful to have a more concrete understanding of the -isms throughout the centuries. It was more or less unclear what general kind of art we were studying each lecture, as Nemerov would go straight into Nemerov-flower-speak.",
    "Take it before you graduate if the professor taking over is anything close to what Nemerov was.",
    "It's an overview of art from the Renaissance to the present. It gives you a good, general idea of art trends, but it's not for people who want to get an in-depth knowledge of a certain era in particular. It also arms you with the tools to look at and judge works of art. I would recommend it for someone who wants to learn how to appreciate art.",
    "Decent, seriously does not live up to the hype. It's a decent amount of work and lots of memorization, good for a credit\/d class but not for grade.",
    "History of Art was a very interesting course. Having never taken an art history course or humanities course quite like this one, the concept of note taking, preparation, and understandign is very different from what many people are used to. The class is relatively low on work and that is a strength, since if it were burdensome, no one would appreciate taking the course. The strengths of the course was definitely the opportunity to visit the Yale Art Gallery for sections, where we would learn the art of analysis of paintings. There was clearly a skill to looking at pictures long enough that you would understand the hidden meanings, the subtleties, and you begin looking for clues where you decrypt the message within. Also, after taking the course you begin to appreciate the wealth of paintings which Yale has accumulated and are at the disposal of the students of Yale. I would definitely take this course if you have never had an art history course, since it will give you insight into periods of European history and American history which you have never had before and provide students with a new perspective.",
    "Much of the allure of this class depends on the professor. But if you're planning on becoming an art history major, it's a nice overview.",
    "With Nemerov yes. yes. yes. yes.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS.Do the reading, its not that much and it will make it great along with incredible incredible incredible lecture.",
    "If Nemerov weren't leaving for Stanford next year and were teaching this class again, I would recommend it hands down - it's phenomenal!",
    "If you are a history of art major, you kinda must take the class. It is rather boring, generic and arbitrary in terms of its topics but its pretty fun to spend time looking at pretty images.",
    "I took this class Cr\/D\/Fail but if you take it for credit and not a grade you end up doing most of the work anyway because there is a baseline amount of paintings that you must memorize. Unfortunately Nemerov is off to Stanford so this class will be entirely different. Not sure I can render I judgment on whether you should take it or not.",
    "This class is great if your goal is to learn about art history--you WILL learn it by the end even if you just go to lecture and do nothing else. If you want it as your HU requirement, it is going to require a bit more work, but I think that it is still worth it. In no other class do you get to passionately write about your opinions of art. Just make sure you study for the exams.",
    "YES. Will change the way you see art. I was skeptical of this course and am so glad in retrospect that I stuck through with it and learned so much about art history.",
    "An examination of a different artists and their works (1300s to present).",
    "Yes, it's important for everyone to get out of their comfort zone academically and pursue a course like this that challenges you to critique and understand art both independently and in an academic setting.",
    "take it, i bet it will be good even without nemerov",
    "If you somehow are only able to take one course at Yale, take this one.",
    "Everybody should take this class. Prof. Nemerov's lectures were absolutely amazing, and you will gain a true appreciation for art. The exams can be difficult, but as long as you keep up with the readings and put in the effort you will do fine.",
    "Incredible paintings, lectures like poetry, life lessons and a reverence for beauty -- perhaps the best defense for the humanities at Yale.",
    "This course is a great course for basically anyone. From looking at dozens of the most famous works in the history of western art, you really gain a good sense of what makes things great art, and really get to appreciate every art movement. I came into the class not liking Baroque or Modern art, and left finding both kinds of art really really interesting. The best feeling is going to a famous museum and being able to recognize artworks you\u0092ve never seen or that you\u0092ve seen in lecture and immediately know the artist by the style. Sections are great! You basically talk for 50 minutes in the Art Gallery and get to look at some really cool paintings by quite renowned artists.Note: Make sure you have a good TA, because that could make a big difference, as they grade very subjective exams and essays that you'll write (a 3-page and a 10 page one).",
    "This is easily one of the highlights of my Yale career. I think that History of Art teaches a lot and that everyone should take it\u0097even if Nemerov isn't teaching.",
    "This was the best class I've taken at Yale so far. I was not the least bit interested in art history before this, but not only am I fascinated by it now, but I feel deeply changed by the process of taking these kinds of viewpoints at the world. The workload was sometimes tough--you have a lot of memorization to do for the midterms and finals, and there's a long paper. But it's all very manageable if you decide to do it. A lot of people take this Credit-D, but you don't have to. It's definitely not harder to get a good grade in this than in any other class at Yale, and the work you do towards that is really rewarding.It's sad to see Nemerov go; he was fantastic. But if the course structure stays the same despite the change in professor, I recommend taking it anyway. The TAs are all really good, the readings are good, the tests are fair, and so is the grading.",
    "Take this class. Amazing! Great introduction to art. It will change the way you appreciate art.",
    "A phenomenal class, but this may largely be dependent on the instructor of the course; Prof. Nemerov is such a poetic, inspired lecturer, and I'm not sure if other professors would be the same. Either way, this class definitely changed my appreciation of aesthetics and made me much more conscious of the process behind both creating and evaluating art. My only wish was that there was a lecture on Impressionism; Prof. Nemerov chose to skip over this movement, but again, other professors may be different.",
    "YES!",
    "I would recommend this course, I learned how to think like art historian.",
    "Please, this was my favorite class at Yale, hands down, period. I have nothing bad to say (except for making us memorize the exact dates of all the paintings), except that I wish class was longer and Professor Nemerov could teach more classes here at Yale!!! Now that it's going to be a different professor, I don't think my comments will be relevant at all because the soul of the class is gone. This new professor, whoever he\/she is, will not be able to live up to Nemerov, so I'm sorry you missed him.",
    "I suppose Nemerov will no longer be teaching it, but the class is still definitely worth taking, with a ton of very interesting history, especially if you haven't taken much art history before.",
    "Yes!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student who wants to learn a bit about art. There's a lot of memorization involved but if you're willing to put in the work you can do well.",
    "I think I would recommend it. Of course, I don't know what next year's professor will be like. But honestly, if real estate on your schedule is limited and you really only want to be able to discuss art at a cocktail party or just have some working, practical knowledge of art, buy a book like Gardner's Art through the Ages and read that instead.",
    "A survey of major art movements and pieces from 1400-1990 with a special emphasis on painting.",
    "I loved this course. I didn't buy all of Nemerov's arguments, but I learned so much from this class. I now look at art completely differently. Sections can be great as well, if only because they give you a chance to learn more about YUAG- a resource right in your backyard. It is well worth shopping around to find a good TA. My TA, Bradley, was wonderful. Grading on the papers seemed fair, although if you're bent on getting a solid A it might be best to take it Credit\/D\/Fail. After all, art history papers can be tricky if you don't have much experience with the subject.",
    "It's a good class that you should definitely try to take, but now that Nemerov is leaving, I don't know how it will be.",
    "TAKE IT IF YOU WANT TO LOVE LIFE. In all seriousness, I cried on the last day because I was so sad it was over. It won't be the same without Nemerov, but the course material is fabulous and you will learn so much about art and about yourself.",
    "I would recommend this class, but Professor Nemerov is leaving, so I would encourage the student to shop the course with its new professor.",
    "Take it. It's a good starting art history class and important to take for students looking to take a wide range of liberal arts classes at Yale.",
    "Take this class! It gives you a great overview of the history of art. Essential before you graduate Yale - unfortunately you can't take it with Nemerov anymore but you should still take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend to students who are interested in just expanding their horizons a bit and learning something outside their comfort level.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Although Nemerov will no longer be teaching it, Yale has so many great resources for art\/art history, and two beautiful galleries, and to not take at least one art history course before graduating would be to miss out.",
    "Great class if you are looking for a basic understanding of art.",
    "This is the last time Prof. Nemerov teaches at Yale, and the rumor is that it may take some time before the art history department puts together another rendition of this course with a new professor; the content was wonderful--students across all majors should know about the broad history of Western art (mostly painting in this course); I hope that future versions of this course are as good as this one was",
    "HSAR 115 is awesome. I don't know who is teaching it this year but Nemerov is incredible.",
    "Yes. Excellent perspective on history and life. Nemerov was the best lecturer I've ever had. It's too bad that he won't be around anymore. Still, take it! You won't regret.",
    "Yes i would",
    "Recommend it.",
    "Obviously take it. Nemerov is leaving, I think, but the material is so cool that you'll love it anyhow. Honestly, if you do not know anything about art, you will benefit from this class greatly.",
    "Take it credit\/d! That way you still learn a lot but it's not stressful!",
    "Unlike a lot of courses, you can take this class Cr\/D and still get a lot out of it, as long as you go to lecture and section. If you are at all interested in art, take it.",
    "Since Nemerov won't be there this time, I don't know--it just won't be the same. Hopefully they'll have someone close to as good.The course was fantastic, but it's hard to tell whether that didn't have everything to do with the professor.",
    "NO because Nemerov is leaving",
    "Take it. It is a very useful course, even for people who are just moderately interested in Art History.",
    "Sure, but Nemrov is no longer present...",
    "Lectures on different artists from 1300 through the 2oth century.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Excellent Intro to history of art",
    "This class, with Professor Nemerov, was amazing - the lectures really made the experience. Nemerov is so passionate about the material and just has a way with words, and hegot me excited about art in a way that I had never been before. The workload for the class is extremely light from week to week, although there is a short paper and a longer research paper you'll have to put some time into. I thought the papers were very enjoyable to write though. Section is in the art gallery - you discuss paintings with your peers and TA; it's great. I took the class Cr\/D (which I decided after the first paper and midterm), so I wasn't stressed about memorizing paintings\/artists\/dates for the final.... But I can see how that would have been pretty stressful and a lot to manage. A lot of people take this class Cr\/D - it's a good one for the option. HOWEVER - I know Nemerov is leaving next year, so the class may be very different (including the assignments) and not the ABSOLUTE must-take that it was with him... I would say just shop it and see how it is!",
    "FANTASTIC class. It's a shame Nemerov is leaving, cause this class was one of my favorites.",
    "Take it.",
    "Defibitely take it if you'd like to learn about how to enter a museum and look at art critically.",
    "This course was a great for anyone who wanted a course in art appreciation. Although it did give some of the trends in styles throughout history, it was less about what the actual discipline of art history and more about the professor's love for the paintings. Still, the lectures were wonderful and I learned a lot about the process by which an individual scholar evaluates paintings. Sometimes the assigned readings were too esoteric and felt unnecessary. The exams are also much harder than they seem.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You go over a lot of information, but it really gives you an over view of art history. The lectures are engaging and there isn't too much reading to do.",
    "Great overview of art from the Renaissance to Present. You get a very good feel for art in different regions and different times. You learn about most of the famous and great artists and their masterpieces. The course covers enough material that you are able to gain a good understanding and it's not to broad or over-arching. I would definitely recommend taking this course to anyone who is at all curious about art history.",
    "take it! It'll be completely different now that Nemerov is not teaching it, but it is still a foundation of knowledge that is fulfilling and interesting and will make going to museums much more fun! (my sisters had to drag me out of the Met when I went just after the course). Great class, you get to look at great art, and you get to sound very educated whenever you go to a museum. And not too difficult!",
    "I am so glad that I took this survey course; I now feel confident in attempting to take something from paintings and say something about them.Nemerov will be gone, so it's hard to advise; half the reason to take the class was his beautiful lectures. My TF, Yan Yang, was wonderful; if you have the chance get in her section.",
    "I would recommend this class. I had not had any experience with art history before and it was definitely worth taking. I have learned a lot. The lectures are interesting to listen to. There is section once a week. You write a short paper (2-3 pages) and a research paper (10-12 pages) along with the midterm and final. Take it Cred\/D\/Fail. Although if Professor Nemerov isn't teaching it, I don't know if it will be as good.",
    "It was....OK. Nemerov had interesting insights into the paintings that we saw in class, but it wasn't really an intro art history class. Nemerov was more interested in presenting his own theses and going off on tangents than actually helping us understand the history of art. That being said, the textbook, readings, and section were all great, and the class did help train my eye to look at art better.",
    "One of the best courses offered at Yale.",
    "Definitely take it. Probably one of the only classes you will really use in your life when you go to museums around the world.",
    "II would recommend it.",
    "Not your typical art history survey! We go chronologically, but don't expect to touch on every canonical work of western art. Still a great lecture though, I would definitely recommend it as a fun fourth or fifth class.",
    "Great class. Could feel like bullshit at times, but Nemerov really drew you in and made you feel and understand the art. A must-take for Yalies (although he's leaving!)",
    "Yes, I recommend this course, although I don't know what it will be like when Nemerov isn't teaching. I took this course not sure that I would actually stay in it the whole semester because I didn't like the first few lectures too much, but it got so much better. It was one of my favorite courses and broadened my mind (I'm a science person.)",
    "It was a fun class but it was also hard because of all of the memorization required for the midterm and final exams. If you want to learn the material with less stress, then it's a good class to take Credit\/D.",
    "You have to take this before you graduate! Too bad Professor Nemerov is leaving, because he made the course really unusual and fun.",
    "Yes! Nemerov was fantastic. I think the class largely depends on the professor though, so I can't speak to future years.",
    "I'm not sure what this course will be like without Nemerov, but this year it was fantastic! It's more about the art than the history, and it seems like people either love it or hate it, but I loved it. Even without Nemerov, I think everyone should take an art history class at some point, and this class has great subject matter and gives you an appreciation and knowledge of a lot of really amazing art.",
    "Definitely a course to take during your time at Yale.",
    "You must take art history before you graduate college. It's as simple as that. Unfortunately if you are reading this, it means you will not be able to take the class with Nemerov, but still being able to understand and appreciate art will change the way you look at life as well as your other studies.",
    "Do it, but if you're not doing it Credit\/D, be willing to work hard. You don't need the expensive textbook; I didn't buy one, I just studied hard.",
    "Lives up to the hype, but only because of Nemerov. He is the course -- the course is him. Word is he's leaving next year, and I fear for the fate of this class as a result.",
    "This class was fantastic. It allowed students to explore the world of art under the guidance of a truly amazing professor (Professor Nemerov), and was nothing if not enjoyable. The material was varied, rich, and interesting, and the readings were relevant and helpful. I'd highly recommend this class to anyone with even a small interest in art and its relation to the world.",
    "2pg essay, 1hr midterm, 15pg essay, 3hr final. Sections once a week in the art gallery. Learn about most of the big hits (mostly paintings) in art history since the 13th century.",
    "Yes! A definite must take course at Yale."
