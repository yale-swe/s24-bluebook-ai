   "comments": [
    "244 was a great class and you'll learn a ton of things, but lectures can get boring at times. I would definitely recommend taking the class, and you'll learn tons from the assignments and in class, but the lectures aren't the most exciting things.",
    "Yes if can find intellectual stimulation in creative math thinking.",
    "I definitely recommend 244. A lot of people take CPSC 202 over this course, but in the end I think we were a lot happier with the material that we learned than them.",
    "This class is a lot easier than when it was taught last time by Matt Hirn (from reading the course evaluations, and hearing from a friend who was in the class last year). I think Hirn learned from the course evaluations. The problem sets aren't long, maybe 4 to 6 hours each week. And if you have difficulties with the homework, he's really available and willing to help. The exams are all proofs, so beware of that. I hope he changes that if he teaches the class again. He didn't cover as much material this time: It was all graph theory, and we didn't get as far. We just did trees, connectivity, planarity, matchings.",
    "It sounded real simple at first(probably the reason I took it), but it got really hard later on, for me at least. The subject might not be what you think it is. Half of the time you can't even see real world applications. If you are incredibly smart and are ready to kill some brain cells, take this course. If you just think that \"mathcings\" and \"colorings\" sould like fun stuff, seriously, don't take it.",
    "Hard class. If you're deciding between this and 202, I would take 202, and yes, I was thinking about a comp sci\/math major, but it really is quite difficult and I was confused most of the class. Even if you understand the material, its really not applicable on the tests, its more of how developed your mathematical skills are and how you can relate things, rather than understanding the material and memorizing the proofs. Hirn is okay, and pretty helpful actually, but it's probably not worth it.",
    "Lectures were kind of pointless, as you could skip class and read the book and be at least up to par. Overall decent class, nothing special",
    "I enjoyed this course. Most of the material was interesting and it's good for students who haven't done a lot of proofs but want to get better at writing them. Still, I was pretty disappointed that we didn't get into combinatorics. The course was almost all graph theory, so students should certainly consider cpsc 202.",
    "If you like math that makes you think, in particular discrete math, take this class."
