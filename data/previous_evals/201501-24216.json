    "Take it if you are interested in how America is run like a religion. This concept of \"civil religion\" which you will learn about in the first reading is a major theme of the course. You will not focus as much on religions in America, but the idea of civil religion is even more interesting to me.",
    "Interesting class, particularly if you are familiar with religion. Take it if you want to learn more about how religion has shaped the American identity and how that in turn has shaped American foreign policy.",
    "It's a survey of major wars in American history and what role religion played in them.",
    "Yes, I would! If you are interested in the United States and the role that Religion has had in its pasttake this class! The readings are new, mixed, and interesting. Professor Stout is incredibly knowledgable on the topic, and there is never too much work. The work is manageableyou write two 3-5 page papers, and then one long, final 20 page paper. You also do a 'starter' one week, when you do extra research on the reading and present at the beginning of the class. Overall, a very enjoyable experience, that I would certainly recommend!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class for a fellow student.",
    "Incredible class!! Fantastic teacher, and really interesting material that makes you think about America's penchant for war, and the role religion plays in this relationship. Take it - it's a great history seminar that covers a theme throughout American history.",
    "An opportunity to investigate the connections between America's religious history and it's political engagements domestically and internationally.",
    "Interesting class.",
    "A decent class, but disappointing. It provides an introduction to religion in America in focusing on religion and war, and is a good brush up on American history. Religion's influence on one war is usually left behind after its allotted week, and seldom compared to others. This causes them to the wars to run together and you come away knowing religious rhetoric was used and religious communities were involved in every war, and almost always supported it. The main book for the class makes a lot of assumptions and is very repetitive, but the professor likes it as a textbook. Stout is nice and energetic. Knows a lot about religion in America, conveys some of it to you, but isn't the best at making his expectations for assignments clear. The assignments are different from any I have done at Yale, but it's a neat way to stretch your brain- just make sure you know what he is asking for."
