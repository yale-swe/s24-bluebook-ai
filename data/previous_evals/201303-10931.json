   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It seemed applicable and for someone pursuing engineering, that is always better than a super theoretical course and so I would recommend this class over math 120.",
    "Yes, definetly. workload is managable and course is not hard.",
    "A different take on multivariable calculus focus on real world examples and explanations for the equations and theorems learned in class. Not applying them to their full extent as much as learning where we can apply them.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to take on a fair bit of amount of work. You should be prepared to self-learn. The psets are not hard but do require some time and attention.",
    "This is a good multivariable course that you should take if you're confident in BC calculus material or have taken a little bit of multi already. I'd definitely recommend it, especially if you are looking to major in engineering.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it. I would take Math 120 instead. This class doesn't have a ton to do with engineering besides 1 or 2 word problems over the course of the semester. Friends who took the Math 120 seminar seemed to learn the material better. Don't take unless you would rather be in a lecture.",
    "If you have to take multivariable calculus, reconsider your life. Despite all the claims that engineers use math all the time, my family is full of engineers who haven't used calculus since undergrad. People who like math should try their best to place into a higher class. Nothing taught in ENAS151 is anything more than intuitive until the last week of lectures, when Green's, Gauss's and Stoke's theorems are introduced. I recommend Wikipedia for a quick lesson in each and then a higher math class. If you don't like math, you will hate it after this. The work is never the elegance of true math, only the hideous computations which you already dislike. (If my rhetoric is a little harsh I apologize for scaring you. I just finished an English\/Creative Writing essay)",
    "Very good class for prospective engineers. I would recommend it.",
    "Take it only if you have to",
    "Shop both Math120 and this and see which you like better.",
    "I would not recommend it if you do not have an engineering mindset. Final is very problem-solving based rather than using the calculus you have learned.",
    "I hear that this class is better than Math 120, which makes me feel really bad for the people taking Math 120, since this class wasn't particularly good. Maybe that's because the class size was so large this year, but I didn't think that Smooke was an interesting teacher. You learn pretty much the exact same thing you learn in Math 120, with a few oversimplified \"real-world\" examples thrown in here and there that don't really do much to help your understanding of the topic. Still, it's better than Math 120, right?",
    "This class ended up being more challenging than I expected. As many people who come to Yale feel, they were the best in their high school at math, and then it is a struggle when they come here, because everyone is on such an elevated level. The fact that this class was 'with applications' made it more difficult than MATH120. Also, there were people in the class who had taken multi before, so they hurt the curve for the class, putting people who were taking the class for the first time at a disadvantage. I am glad that I took this class over 120.",
    "A hell of a course. Difficult, not really recommended, not becasuse of the difficulty, but the seemingly poor teaching and formula vs concept approach to math. Also, there are very few applications, which I had been really excited to learn. The class was around 100 when I took it and that was too large. The TA system is odd and the course itself seems disorganized.However, if you are looking for a straightforward math course, you may want to take it. But, the curve is tough. I am probably being too harsh but this course took some of the fun out of math which may be a product of math in lecture format or just this class.I am happy its over.",
    "Great class, if you need to take Multivariable I would recommend this.",
    "I think for those who are just interested in physics not really into engineering, do take Math 120. The small seminar-like classes of Math 120 is preferred. But for those who are truly interested in engineering and want to pursue an Engineering major, ENAS 151 is very useful and tends to train you in a way that can largely prepares you not only for the engineering courses, but tries to cultivate engineering minds.",
    "Yes, definitely take this course if you are engineering student and want to see applications. Professor Smooke was great in introducing us to very real applications. However his lectures are tough to get through, and you do have to rely on the textbook for some clearer explanation sometimes. There are a lot of students in this class who have already taken multivariable and that can put someone at a disadvantage if they haven't seen the material before and the test averages are high.",
    "Great course to learn all of multivariable in a single setting. Over all pretty easy for me due to previous exposure to multivariable through Physics 260.",
    "If you are debating between taking MATH 120 and this class, take this class, especially if you are a prospective engineering major. Not only do 120 students not get a formula sheet on their exams, but this class simply moves at a better pace. Realistically, Professor Smooke has no problem taking time out of class to explain a difficult topic, and does a great job of applying the material to real-world situations. Whenever I found myself asking \"When am I ever going to use this?\", along came a sample problem that answered that very question (keep in mind that I say this as an engineering major; this might not hold true for any humanities\/pre-med folks out there). Even if you aren't considering engineering, this class is simply easier than 120. Not easy, but easier than 120. If you attend the homework sessions and ask for help when you need it, it will help you immensely.",
    "It is a great course. I found the material interesting, and Prof. Smooke made the lectures engaging.I would recommend this course to anyone who needs it for a prereq.",
    "ENAS 151 was a good math course. It had a steady pace and I liked that it was focused on applications of the math we learn't, and not just theory.I think the course was definitely much harder towards the end of the semester than the start, so watch out for that. The psets are a decent amount of work every week.Going to the lecture isn't necessary - you can learn everything from teh textbook. Smooke is a good lecturer, but the 9 am time makes it annoying.I thought the exams were good - challenging, but not overwhelming. The second midterm was the best level of challenge I've had on a test - one of the most engaging tests I've taken.",
    "I think ENAS is a great course. I've heard that it's a lot better than math 120 and it really wasn't bad. Smooke is a good guy and he is American, so you are sure to at least understand the man.",
    "I would recommend this course to any person who has the desire to learn multivariable calculus. The class is not excessively challenging, but is effective at teaching new concepts. Professor Smooke did a few interesting demos throughout the semester which were nice in comparison to constant math.",
    "Do not take this class unless you have to. The professor spends all class just writing theorems and equations you have to memorize on the blackboard. You do weekly problem sets that take anywhere from 5-20 hours (depending on how comfortable you are with the material). You take two midterms (20% of your grade each) and a final (40% of your grade. The tests are challenging because the professor writes paragraph \"application\" questions that are not similar to ANYTHING you've seen all semester from homework or in class. The TAs are unhelpful.",
    "I think this class was definitely worth taking. It was definitely a challenge, but overall I learned a lot. Smooke was a decent professor and I think genuinely enjoyed teaching. If you want to ask a question, just shout it put, because the class is too big for the professor to call on people.",
    "Compared to MATH 120, ENAS 151 is much more applications-based and this is a good thing. I also understand that MATH 120 kids did not get formula sheets for their exams, which is preposterous. Take the class with Smooke if you can--he's a great lecturer. If you're having trouble on a p-set, go to the TA sessions!I spent about 6 hours a week on the psets and often went to the TA sessions for help. It's a challenging course to master, but very well taught (by Smooke, anyway). It's also great if you're learning physics and want to understand the math behind it better. Good class.",
    "This course will teach you a lot of useful skills that are very applicable to sciences and engineering, probably not interesting for anyone else. You know if you need to take this.Harder but better taught than math120.",
    "ENAS 151 is a fairly manageable, approachable multivariable calculus class taught by an effective lecturer (Professor Smooke). While the material's applications may be lacking at times, there are a few interesting demonstrations throughout the semester. Psets are not too challenging, though tests can be a tad esoteric. One note of warning: there are many students enrolled in this course who have already taken multivariable calculus in high school, subsequently inflating averages on tests.",
    "ENAS 151 will build a strong Multivariable Calc foundation and requires about the same amount of work as an easier science\/math course. It's not very challenging, and Smooke's lectures are a good way to kill of the Multivariable Calc requirement if you're going for Science and Engineering.",
    "ENAS is a good and challenging class to take for students especially during freshman fall. Take problem sets seriously, try to pay attention in class because the presented material is surprisingly on-topic and helpful, remember the overall picture of big topics when studying for tests, and remember that you are learning for yourself, and not in competition with others. The class can be rewarding and I felt like I learned a lot, even though I (and many other students in the class) had alreadytaken the equivalent in high school.",
    "Depends on the professor. Smooke was great. Problem sets took time and tests were a little different than the problem sets but that was really the only concern. Still entirely manageable and a good way to learn calc 3.",
    "This class is probably the best multivariable calc experience you can get at Yale. Though we technically had 105 people in the class, only around 30 or so ever actually showed up to lecture consistently. I would definitely recommend it and encourage you to go to lecture, as well, because Professor Smooke is quite aware of the drop in attendance. Sometimes things that are explained or elaborated on in class (that aren't in the textbook) show up on the midterms. I think you'll find this class interesting and enjoyable if you make the effort to show up and keep up with your reading and psets.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student. I would just tell them to be aware that the curve might be skewed towards the higher end because the material is not that difficult.",
    "I would totally recommend this class for other potentially engineering majors.",
    "This is a challenging multivariable calc class. Pretty well taught but hard. Some cool engineering\/physics related problems.",
    "This course covers your expected multivariable topics: three-space, vectors, partial derivatives, multiple integrals, line and surface integrals, del operations, and the theorems (Green's, Divergence, Stokes'). However, I would not recommend this to another students, as I feel you can take Math 120 and learn the same material but in much greater depth.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is ok with learning math more independently. Compared to math 120 this class seems to have less support for in terms of study sessions. Even though there were teaching fellows I think they were more helpful with pset problems.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, but take it with Smooke and not Ismail-Beigi. I took the class in the spring last year and dropped it because he was so bad, then took it with Smooke and really enjoyed it. Take ENAS over Math 120.",
    "An excellent alternative to Math 120. It covers the same material and the exams are much more fair. Complements Physics 260 very well.",
    "If you're looking to be an engineer, have a background in physics, and need this class as a pre req, do it. If not, don't.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for engineers and non-engineers because it is very application based, especially the tests. It shows you how concepts are applicable in real life situations. The instruction is pretty good, and the workload is manageable.",
    "As far as multivariable calculus goes, I consider this class better than the alternative, MATH 120. It's more application based, since it's technically an engineering class. The midterms and final test questions consist mostly of physics word problems. You don't really have to go to class, Smooke teaches directly out of the textbook, which is pretty comprehensive. Basically only take this class if you need it for your major or if you're really interested in math.",
    "I took this class to see if I was going to like STEM in college or not, and even though I found out the answer to that question is a definite no, I'm still glad I took this class. The content itself is definitely challenging, but the book and TA's are extremely useful, and its really rewarding once you get it down. Smooke was really great, and it was fun to watch him do the demos in class and go through real world problems with math. I would definitely recommend this over 120. It's way more interesting, plus you get a formula sheet for all the tests (which they don't in 120).",
    "I would recommend ENAS 151 over MATH 120 in a heartbeat. If you need to take some sort of multivariable calculus or just want to take it for some reason, I'd take ENAS. I'm a science major but not an engineer and I still thought the class was very helpful. It's very clear and if you put work in and spend time on the problem sets it's pretty straightforward.",
    "The course overall is actually quite reasonable. The problem sets feature straightforward questions from the book, and the lectures are easy to follow. The application of the materials can be a bit difficult on the exam, and sometimes, I felt that my grasp on the actual concepts was sometimes weak. Nevertheless, for someone who is planning to major in engineering, the class was a much better choice than MATH 120.",
    "The course starts off slow and then picks up pace. We had little time for the more complex concepts that came near the end. If you want a relatively painless multivariable course, this is the class for you. If you want to learn multi in depth, consider something from the math department.",
    "good class to teach you multivariable calculus, great instructor, would recommend the course",
    "I feel as though I learned multivariable calculus well in this course. I found the problem sets and exams difficult, but overall manageable. I liked taking ENAS 151 over MATH 120 because we rarely had to think theoretically or do proofs and we got a formula sheet on the exams.",
    "It's a math class that you probably are required to take.",
    "It's a class that should be used for your major. If you're not engineering perspective, I'd say not to take it and stay with Math 120.",
    "Overall, ENAS 151 is a solid multivariable calculus course and is probably the better choice over math 120 if you are not a fan of math proofs and being super mathematically accurate. That is not to say, however, that there are no proofs in this class. In fact lectures mostly consist of deriving various formulas and the application side of math that is advertised by this class was a little disappointing.I would say that most of the learning I did for this class was by reading the textbook and doing the problem sets, but lectures are overall still worth attending (even at 9am)especially during the second half of the semester. Nonetheless, if you occasionally miss a few I wouldn't worry too much either.If Professor Smooke is teaching this class he is very nice and approachable. Sometimes he doesn't have the best or most intuitive explanations, but there are many TA's\/TF's to make up for that. So although this class wasn't phenomenal, you will learn your math, and I would recommend this class.",
    "A fast paced application based study of multivariable calculus. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "ENAS 151 is a well-taught multi-variable calculus class. I would definitely recommend this course over Math 120. Both courses cover similar material, but the I found the delivery in this class to be much better.",
    "A very good course if you need\/want to learn multivariable calculus. The homework is time consuming but it pays off. Still, by the nature of the subject, it won't be the most fun course at Yale.Smooke teaches the course material very well. Just be careful about taking this class in the morning because you need a good amount of concentration to follow the lectures.",
    "This is a comprehensive course for Multivariable Calculus although it zooms through the concepts at the speed of lighting so it's uncertain whether everything is actually really understood by students or if they're only doing the P-sets and tests like parrots. If you put in enough time by yourself to consolidate concepts the course is definitely worth it though. Smooke is a fun professor who makes an effort to keep people engaged so early in the morning but he mostly takes his material straight from the book so missing lectures isn't actually an issue if you don't mind losing a point or two of extra credit.",
    "I would--solid course.",
    "ENAS 151 was a challenging class. It starts out extremely manageable and easy to follow and understand, but somewhere around halfway through the semester, the material becomes incredibly difficult. I definitely would not recommend the class unless you have to take it as a prerequisite for other classes or a major.",
    "If you took BC Calculus (or even higher) in high school definitely take it. If not, definitely do NOT take it.",
    "I would tell a fellow student that it was manageable for me because I was able to find a good tutor. But that's just me - I need to betaught one-on-one with very small steps in math. I'm sure the class was fine for other people, and I'm sure the class was very hard for others - just like any class. I did hear a lot that this class was better than MATH 120 since 120 has more students in it and the prof is not as good, so I would tell another student to take 151 over 120 regardless of whether they're doing engineering or not. The topics we learned in 151 are important and should be known my any STEM student. This made up for the sub-par quality of the teaching.",
    "ENAS 151 is the engineering alternative to Math 120 - you learn essentially the same concepts, but there is less emphasis on proofs and more importance is placed on application. Another contrast to Math 120 is that the ENAS class is much larger since there was only one section. Though, I never felt overwhelmed by the large class size, as it is very easy to ask questions during class and get individual attention from the professor.I placed into the course and had previously taken higher level IB math. It did not seem like you needed an exceptional calculus background to do well; most derivatives and integrals you had to do on exams were relatively straightforward, though some on problem sets required assistance from WolframAlpha.On the exams, it is very common to see word problems. In the class, it is typical to go through a proof of a theorem (though you are not expected to know the proof on an exam) and a few examples as well as real world applications. I found that the incorporation of real world examples made the math more interesting and easier to understand.The weekly problem set is not too time consuming (~2-4 hrs) and the exams are neither ridiculously easy (except the first midterm) nor difficult; Some problems will not be like a straightforward homework problem and will require more thinking and understanding of concepts as opposed to recognizing familiar problems you've done before. You also get a huge list of formulas for every exam, putting the emphasis on problem solving rather than memorization.Overall, I'm glad I chose ENAS 151 over Math 120, since I personally prefer application problems to pure math and proofs. The course was taught well and the exams seemed fair."
