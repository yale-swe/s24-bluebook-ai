   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Course was well-structured in terms of the divisions of subjects. I also liked Prof. Lewis's focus on getting us to understand what was were important take-aways from psychosocial epi journal articles. Some articles were enjoyable (usually at least 1 per week). Loved the \"Unnatural Causes\" movie that we saw a few times in the course. I liked how we usually considered a couple of different health outcomes (typically at least 2) for each psychosocial exposure.Weaknesses: Class time seemed like it could have been used more effectively... discussion was often very forced. The forced discussion wasn't fun or how the course was initially described to me, so I was disappointed by that.Attendance-taking during lecture seemed a little baby-ish, and sometimes wasn't even accurate because the attendance sheet didn't make it all the way around the room.",
    "This was a great course in terms of information learned. It was interesting and challenging. Its organization was a little frustrating, however, because the size mandated that we had to attend weekly discussion sections. We also had almost-weekly assignments, which contributed to the workload. Volunteering was also a stressful experience, as we were expected to know every small detail about every reading for that week.",
    "The class was a survey course so covered a range of topics but they were all predictable. Essentially after we discussed that stress could lead to biological health outcomes any other exposure clearly fit that model (PTSD, race, SES, lack of social support). In addition all interventions were similar - reduce stress or increase exercise and improve diet. Nothing mind blowing.We also had student led presentations around the proper scale\/measure to use to quantify the amount of stress someone was under. It was nice to see the incorporation of a presentation but we were given no feedback on our presentation clarity or structure, just content. These presentations were also far too long. The critical aspect of each can be summed up in 3 or 4 minutes yet they were all 30 minutes or so long. They were not a good use of class time.I would have liked to see more dynamic conversation around what these studies mean for policy and the formation of interventions. We discussed the need for future research a bitbut the reason for future research is always glanced over.",
    "strengths: interesting topics addressedweaknesses: weekly writing assignments often were just busy workuse of volunteers in class discouraged others from participating, making class rather boring at times",
    "The course covers an interesting topic but spends too much time proving that students have completed the readings instead of generating interesting or meaningful discussions.",
    "I think there was a little too much busy work on top of having to 'volunteer' and have a discussion section. I felt as if I would have taken more out of the course had I not been so concerned with all the aspects of 'participation' that contributed to my grade. However, Tene understood this challenge and did a good job working with students later in the semester to combat this issue.",
    "The course was really interesting and touched on a lot of good topics. I really enjoyed how it was broken down into specific topics each week. Prof. Lewis was also great and lead class very well. I also REALLY enjoyed seeing clips of Unnatural Causes.Two big weakensses stand out in my mind. One, I would have liked to learn more about the theory behind the social influences of health (I recognize took this class instead of the class Social Influences of Health, but this the course was still one of the 'core' courses). I was never exposed to things like the Health Belief Model or a more conceptual, theoretical approach to pyschosocial epi. Also, I would have liked to go into more detail about pathways of some of these findings (e.g. SES on health). I realize that there is a dearth of information in the field but it would still be interesting to be exposed to more theories, even lists, of how these things might affect health outcomes.The second weakness was the overemphasis on study details in the classroom. The \"volunteers\" really only regurgitated the nuanced detailed of the studies and that took the majority of the class.",
    "This is a great course. It is ver thorough for a core requirement. As far as strengths, the course is designed in such a way that students get a very good idea of the field and are able to analyze primary literature. The only weakness is that weekly assignments were a bit of busy work.",
    "This was a great class that focused on several aspects of psychosocial indicators to mortality and morbidity outcomes. However, it was a lot of busy work. This class was designed to be a discussion-based class, and I understand that if people do not do the reading, it is unlikely that people will participate. However, to assign another discussion session and have a weekly assignment was a lot of busywork for this one class. I was really relieved to have her poll the class and give us the assignment once every two weeks than have it done every week.",
    "Excellent intro to social epi",
    "Very good and interesting. The addition of discussion sections combined with the assignments and participation was excessive. SOmetimes it was fine but other times it was too time demanding to be fair.",
    "The course was not very well organized, with unclear and changing requirements for the weekly assigments. I strongly disliked the \"weekly volunteer\" requirement. It was an extremely stressful and nerve-racking task to volunteer (we learned stress is very bad for health, which makes this requirement extremely ironic). The course focused heavily on epidemiological study design and methods, and less on the substantive issues relating to psychosocial issues in disease and public health. The real-life examples (the story of a woman in Harlem, and references to tv shows) used in lectures and sections made the class really interesting and fun. I also enjoyed the videos on health disparities; they provided very poignant summaries of the problems that exist. I enjoyed the discussion sections. The topics and examples chosen were interesting.",
    "The subject matter was interesting, but not interesting enough to enjoy having to take this required course.",
    "Psychosocial Epi was a great course since it provided me with a broad understanding of how various psychosocial factors influence health outcomes. I believe the volunteer format + weekly assignments was a lot of work so I feel that in the future, either the course should have volunteers throughout the semester and no weekly assignments, or just weekly assignments, but not both.",
    "The course attempted to teach us some of the scales used to measure psychosocial exposures and outcomes. However, the format did not really achieve this outcome. The student presentations were long and tedious; the different scales quickly blurred with the previous scale presented leaving students just as ignorant as before. The class lectures were wasted on asinine questions such as \"how big was the sample size?\" and other questions, instead of looking into how those methodological characteristics are perceived in psychosocial epi. Note, only the differences between general epi and psychosocial epi should be covered. This could be a great class, but it is not there, yet. Good use of video.",
    "Strengths: helps students become familiar with methodological issues in doing epidemiology studies.Weaknesses: It'd be better to make more connections between classes."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Pros:Prof. Lewis was responsive when the class told her that we did not need so many assignments to complete the reading.Assignments were generally very clear.When we were able to have truly open discussion (like in the last class about acculturation... for at least a portion of the time) she made sure a lot of people were heard.Usually readings were well-chosen, but sometimes they were pretty repetitive.Occasionally Prof. Lewis was funny, which helped lighten the otherwise often tense mood of students in the classroom.Cons:Prof. Lewis often made the class discussion very forced.Prof. Lewis was also pretty nit-picky and even a little intimidating at times when quizzing the volunteers... which I think made others in the class even more afraid to talk, further hampering the discussion.I very much disliked the way Prof. Lewis used the term \"volunteer\" when we were required to \"volunteer\" 2 times in the semester... effectively not making it a \"volunteer\" opportunity, but rather an assignment for the course.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Professor Lewis really knows her stuff when it comes to psychosocial determinants of health. She was very nice and helpful when you met with her one on one or exchanged emails. In class, though, she was kind of intimidating, sometimes making the volunteers feel dumb for not remembering a small detail of the article we read.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Professor Lewis maybe lectured for 40 minutes out of every class and then attempted to quiz us on readings more than have a discussion. While learning to pull out the important and differentiating components of a study is a valuable skill we don't need to practice it 50 times over one semester.The professor focused too much on differences between whites and blacks. This topic got played out pretty quickly in addition to being very US-centric. Some diversity of subject matter and opinion would have been nice.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0strengths: interesting perspectivesweaknesses: \"cold calling\" on volunteers is not an effective teaching method but she actually seemed to enjoy it...volunteers should be just that, let them volunteer since they are the ones who need to get credit for their responses",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0I think Tene as a professor is great. She knows her material and genuinely cares about the students. However, I think she gets a little too caught up in minute details and makes it difficult for students to decipher the big picture.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Strength= accessibility to students. Even though it was a large class, Dr. Lewis ALWAYS answered my e-mails promptly and offered me continued help and guidance on my class assignments. That type of extra outreach to students really goes along way in terms of perception of a class. Thank you, Dr. Lewis!",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Great - very well organized course; she encouraged participation and was very accessible to students.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0The instructor was excellent. She presented the material very well and was very responsive toeach student's needs and gave great feedback.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Professor is very knowledgeable about the subject and open to speaking to students.",

    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Dr. Lewis was good and knows her stuff. A little more understanding with the time commitment would have been nice though.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0I felt that she was a little disorganized at times and she kept modifying\/changing the weekly assignments (write-ups, class volunteering, cold-calling in class). That was really frustrating. I really appreciated her efforts to make the class interesting to students and to respond to student feedback. She is a really nice person.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0I liked that she was tough on the students. sometimes i did think she went a little far into the details of the studies.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Dr. Lewis was a great instructor! She clearly knew the material well and relayed it clearly. She was very approachable and was passionate about her work.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0She seems to try so hard to do a good job, but doesn't know what works well or not. Perhaps other teachers can help her integrate things like eliciting student participation into the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Always willing to help with the projects, very funny and very passionate about her work.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Structor strengths: Her guidance of creating a big picture of psychosocial epidemiology studies in terms of major contents and method is very helpful.Structor weakensses: Connections among classes seem to be less than needed.It would make us have a deeper understanding of socioepidemiology if instructor could have all the major themes connected."
