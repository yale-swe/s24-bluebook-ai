   "comments": [
    "Stefan's great! Can bounce around a bit in lecture, but that keeps you on your toes and he's really intuitive in his approach to teaching and good about sticking around after class to work through things and so on. As for the material, I think that 230\/231 (Hadari) was ample preparation for 305, and there's no point in taking 301 as a math major with 230 unless you just want to do Jones's thing. Fourier analysis is also hella chill.",
    "Stefan is the Ahnold of analysis (and\/or the anti-Jones). Material is interesting, problem sets are thought-provoking and reasonable, and exams are eminently fair. If you've ever wondered why trees are round, or why you should store your vegetables in the basement, this is the class for you. But at the end of the day, the highlight of the course was definitely the guest lecture: 10\/10.",
    "If you think this will be anything like Peter Jones's intro to analysis course you're wrong: it's actually an interesting lecture taught by someone (Stefan) who knows what he's doing (instead of being someone who should be in a mental institution). Stefan's lectures are well focused for the most part and he manages to make them interesting, though he can be a little hand wavy at times (he does cover a lot of material). The psets are fair and go with the material well, and the exams are reasonable. I would definitely take this course again.",
    "Stefan is THE MAN. Actually, if you are into math and have a chance to take a class with him, do it. This class went through the canonical things about measure and lebesgue integration before the midterm and then focused on fun applications of fourier series after the midterm. The tests were very fair and not too difficult. The problem sets were interesting if often a bit tricky.",
    "ALL HAIL STEFAN. seriously. Dude is the coolest. Yeah - if you take this class you are almost surely a math or physics major, and you probably have to take this class. But regardless. Stefan. He makes math come alive. You might hear that he might be descended from Napoleon.. Or about how FRIKIN cool fourier series are. Yeah, you do a crazy amount of Fourier Series stuff. But Stefan still got through the necessary course material in the first half, so whatever. Ok. Lets be real. You won't take this class if you don't have to. But if you do. You take it for Stefan. You do it for Stefan.",
    "If it's with Stefan, take it.",
    "Take this course if you are looking for a high-level introduction to real analysis. 300 is likely to be more accessible, as this course is quite challenging with problem sets that routinely required very late nights. I only took this because of the professor, and if a different professor had been offering 300, taking that might have been a good idea.",
    "A great introduction to real analysis. Stefan is an awesome lecturer and cares a lot about his students -- if you can, take it with him. The problem sets were not too long and the exams were fairly straightforward.",
    "Second semester of real. Measures, integral , Fourier series and applications.",
    "305 with Stefan was a fairly painless introduction to measure theory \/ fourier analysis. It's hard not to share Stefan's enthusiasm for the topics he presents, especially the applications he shows at the end of the course.",
    "Very interesting class that is a must take for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of calculus",
    "This class was a great time. Stefan gets really excited about pretty much every theorem and application in the course, and is also a coherent lecturer. His style is a bit loose but still not too hard to follow, and he heavily encourages class participation in lecture. This can be a bit off-putting because he's willing to stand awkwardly in front of a silent room waiting for someone to ask a question, but it ultimately gets everyone more involved with the material. The material itself is reasonably interesting, although with maybe a bit too much emphasis on applications in the second half of the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend another student to take this course. It offers a strong foundation in analysis to pursue more advanced study in any various branches of the field.",
    "Take this class. Stefan is an incredible teacher. He's very enthusiastic about the material (contagiously so), and is extremely down to earth and approachable (and loves questions). He is really invested in effective teaching, and he makes the material very engaging. The workload is very reasonable, and the material is very interesting in its own right.",
    "Stefan has a very distinctive teaching style and be sure to shop before you decide! This semester we covered some basic measure theory, Lebesgue integration, Hardy-Littlewood Maximal function and then spent half of the semester on various cool applications of Fourier Series. The material is absolutely fascinating but the level of rigor is below most of other math classes I have taken (but now I begin to wonder if this is what analysis is actually like). There are weekly problem sets which vary quite a bit in difficulty. Stefan also utilized pop quizzes to make sure people understand the basic ideas in lecture. We had one midterm and one final. I like Stefan a lot, and find him very fun to talk to after class too. He selected a very interesting set of topics to cover and I am glad I took his course. Analysis is also very useful math in all kinds of places so I would recommend the class to everyone with the proper background.",
    "This course is a very good introduction to advanced concepts in real analysis. An enjoyable must-take for any math major.",
    "Math 301, if I recall correctly--one of those courses--is rather infamous among math students. It's the first real analysis course, and I've heard only bad things about it, although I've never taken it myself. Analysis is probably my least favorite part of mathematics. That said, I liked the course. I'd recommend it to another student."
