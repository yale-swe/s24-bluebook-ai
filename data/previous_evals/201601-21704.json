    "I've heard people describe this class as the mini-DS. This class goes through a lot of the classics, and I'm glad that I read all of them. It's a lot of reading, but they're all such interesting books in their own right. It's a very rewarding class and I recommend it to everyone (even if you're not planning on majoring in anything related to this.)",
    "English 130 is a not a class for the faint of heart- yes there is a lot of reading, but it's totally worth it. These are texts which it would be difficult to read outside of a classroom setting, so this class presents a great opportunity for reading and studying these otherwise unapproachable texts.",
    "English 130 is definitely a \"Great Books\" course, with a focus on the fairly loose genre of the epic. In my opinion, its greatest strengths are the interesting reading list and excellent weekly discussions. The essays could sometimes feel rather rushed though, and the workload becomes taxing at the end with Ulysses. On the whole, I think it was a thoroughly worthwhile class and I would definitely recommend it.",
    "A class where you read the classic novels of the western canon."
