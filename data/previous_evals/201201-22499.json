    "You learn Chinese.",
    "So much work, but very rewarding if you put the time in. Recognize that you are committing to a year of daily quizzes and stress and remind yourself of why you want to learn Chinese if you want to keep enjoying it.",
    "Chinese 122 is a good course. It's fairly intensive. Expect about an hour and a half of work each night. You'll learn a decent amount, and it's not too hard to get a good grade (A) if you do the work.",
    "Good course if you have some basic knowledge of Chinese.",
    "Chinese 122 is a good course to take if you're prepared for a very fast-paced course and if you're willing to do a good amount of out-of-class work. One of my only qualms about it is that often, the material on the quizzes\/tests did not match the material we were supposed to have covered in preparation for the quizzes\/tests, which was a bit frustrating at times.",
    "Yes! Good way to improve Chinese for heritage speakers",
    "You learn more in Chinese 122 than 112, a lot of the vocabulary is new and the topics are more formal. 112 was about catching up on what we sort of already know, while 122 is more about writing formally.",
    "I would totally recommend Chinese 122. Even though it is more difficult than the non heritage track, you are pushed and that is where the most important improvements come from."
