    "Brad is a shining example of what learning is all about. You'll learn more about philosophy and life in this class than pretty much anything else you'll take in college. If you liked LTC and want to delve slightly deeper into the legal cases, this college is a must.",
    "This is not a gut. Don't let yourself believe that. This is the best course that you will take at Yale, and if it's your senior year the last course you will take at Yale, and it's incredible. If you're ready for the deep dive take it.",
    "You took 185. You know Brad. More work -weekly reading responses. But beyond worth it",
    "One of the greatest courses I've taken at Yale. And a great asset to Yale's course catalog. Where else could an undergraduate student take a course on privacy--examined through legal, ethical, and technological perspectives--built on a syllabus comprised of the most recent court cases, topical news reports, and timeless philosophical classics (and taught by a passionate professors who happens to be a practicing lawyer, to boot)? No where else, to my knowledge. Moreover, given the immediacy of the subject matter--particularly how the perfect storm of privacy law and social norms is rapidly enabling the erosion of privacy in our society--and the quality of the class, I think this course should be part of Yale's core curriculum. Everyone should have a working knowledge of its subject matter. To be sure, the class requires a lot of work; one must contribute thoughtful weekly reading responses that are subject to a difficult grading standard, there can be up to ~25 different readings per week (totaling several hundred pages), and, due to the seminar setting, students should be prepared to offer valuable in-class commentary where appropriate. By the same token, class periods are truly edifying, charming, and often filled with hilarious riffs by the professor. A true gem at Yale. Indeed, if this sounds interesting, one should take the entire CPSC 183\/184\/185 lineup. A true intellectual treat.",
    "Work: weekly reading response, about an hour or two of your time. Does make you a much better legal writer, particularly in making your writing more precise and not BSing (like you do for all your other classes). Content: Literally the most provocative class you will take at Yale. I did not take 183, but as a CS major I loved exploring technology from a normative standpoint. Professor: Brad is AMAZING. He will push you a lot but is so real and cares SO much about his students. Conclusion: You will hear that this one of the best classes at Yale, and it is, even if you never took 183.",
    "Take it. If you don't and you care about privacy and learning, then you're making a poor decision.",
    "This is a wonderful seminar and you should take it. Really. If you take one CS class at Yale, it should be this one.",
    "Assuming you've taken CPSC 183, and you know how Rosen teaches. It's more of the same but even better. Take it. It turns his lecture into a small seminar in which you get to actually know your suitemates and have rousing debates that you can actually direct and participate in. This goes the other way as well as you will have more readings and it will be very clear if you didn't to them. It always amazes me the things I learn in Rosen's classes that no one else would ever expose me to throughout my college career. It's like when people complain about not learning about how to do their taxes in high school. Brad teaches you how to do your taxes in a fun way. A class and professor that helped define my time at Yale.",
    "A WR where your reading response every week can be whatever creative idea pops into your head. The final project grading also rewards creativity. You don't have to be talkative in seminar to succeed in this class or to even be good at writing analyses of court cases. Just use this class as an honest creative outlet for your ideas and you'll get an A. If you get in, there's no reason not to take it.",
    "Amazing, amazing, amazing. If you have the opportunity to take this class, do it. There should be no doubt in your mind."
