   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend it! This course is a synthesis of economic analysis and gender studies.",
    "It's a plsc class. While I learned about feminist political thought - I nonetheless learned a lot more about politics",
    "Maybe if they change either the description of the class to match the content, or the other way around. Otherwise, no.",
    "The course was very thought provoking. The first portion built a base of ideas about the world and the second half applied those concepts and their critiques to the real world. Although there was a lot to cover, all topics were discussed in depth. It is a good bit of work, but was a very fulfilling class.",
    "WGSS 299 is a class in which we read canonical works about the political economy and feminist critiques of it and in general makes you question you're worldview and the current capitalistic society we all live in and its effects.",
    "Yes! Take this course if you are even a tiny bit interested in gender studies and feminism. It'll give you really interesting tools to se the world with.",
    "Good class, really interesting, but they definitely jumped around a LOT. The course encompassed so much that I couldn't sum it up in just one sentence. There was a strong focus on economics that I was not expecting based on the class's description.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're prepared to do the readings. It's an amazing experience. As a queer woman with little exposure to WGSS theory, I found this class to be extremely formative in helping me develop a greater understanding of how money, politics, globalization and sex work to shape the world. That being said, you have to beware that this class is definitely a challenge. It's no easy A (or even an easy B depending on how much experience you have coming into it) but if you go in with the mindset that the grade is really unimportant in comparison with the experience you'll get out of it, it's totally worth it. Also, give Joe Fischel time, he gets a lot better as the semester goes along.",
    "This is an econ class. Don't be fooled. Interesting reading list but abstract and difficult to follow.",
    "Overall a great course! The reading is fairly heavy, but the subjects are fascinating, and the lectures are great, if confusing at times.",
    "WGSS 299 is a fascinating course about the political economy, but we didn't discuss gender related issues as much as I thought we would when I enrolled in the class. It's very interesting material but if you're considering taking this class you should be aware of what it is.",
    "WGSS 299 is a rigorous but rewarding course. Expect readings heavy on theory (the feminist criticism of say, Marx was often more challenging than the Marx) and somewhat dense lectures, but an overall really rich and engaging introduction to the relationship between constructs of gender and political economics. Anticipate learning a LOT, but at the cost of a very difficult semester. That being said, the grading was not exceedingly harsh, and the assignments not difficult -- the material itself is just rather challenging to understand.",
    "Joe and Inderpal are really great professors! The course was really interesting, but it definitely wasn't what was advertised during shopping period. I expected it to be about the intersection of sexual politics and current events, but it was much more about fundamental texts on political economy (Locke, Marx, etc.) without connecting it back to the present day. Overall, I definitely recommend taking classes with them, just make sure you're prepared for what the topic is actually going to be.",
    "TAKE. IT.",
    "This is a great course. It's definitely a real class, not a gut, but if you are willing to do some work you can learn a lot. The lecturers are both great and a pleasure to work with.",
    "If you are not already knowledgeable on WGSS subjects, do not take this class. It really alienated me from the field,",
    "Readings each week - ranging from primary sources to secondary ones, scholarly articles about a range of things. Opens your mind to a more expansive perspective on concepts because you are reading theory. Everything comes together towards the end and you are able to refer to different thinkers and what not - totally worth it even if challenging at times!!",
    "This class has fantastic material if you want to study the intersection between feminist theory and political economy, which I think everyone should. The downside is that it is team taught, which just makes it slightly less linear and harder to follow as a semester-long narrative.",
    "awesome class if you want to learn about power and money. Despite not having completed all of the readings, the ideas from what I did read and the ideas that stuck from lecture will stay with me for a very long time. Joe and Inderpal are amazing! They really cared and attention they gave to their lectures and class was really great. The reading list they put together is incredible. All of the ideas I learned in this class are tools that will help me understand the big picture, the power relations and they systems of the world around me. I feel like I finally have the tools to be critical of capitalism, gender norms, and other oppressive systems. The lectures were often difficult to follow in their entirety and a little bit all over the place, especially if you don't have the prior WGSS vocabulary, but my section helped with that. Despite all this, I'm so glad this class is offered at yale. This is the empowering material that I've always wanted exposure to and feel we should all be reading and learning."
