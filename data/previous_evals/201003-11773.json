   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in learning spanish or if you're looking to fulfill your language requirement. Otherwise, take a different language- a more interesting one.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. This class has inspired me to double major in spanish and was my favorite class all semester. I enjoyed the class because the work was spread out and was not too much to handle. However, at the same time, I learned a lot about the Spanish language and am a far better Spanish speaker because of it. Moreover, the class covered a series of interesting topics that sparked my interest in continuing my studies of the Spanish language. The movies, short stories, and novel that were a part of the class were all interesting and provided for great class discussions. The class truly allowed for students to put into practice the grammar that they learned through the discussions. Even my grandmother notes how much my Spanish has improved because of this class.",
    "It's a challenging course filled with oral presentations and homework every night.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who wants to strengthen his or her grammar and speaking abilities.",
    "I recommend it. My spanish improved significantly over the course of the semester, and I think having to speak and understand it every day was the reason.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. My Spanish has improved greatly through taking this class. This class is great for improving speaking, writing, and grammar skills.",
    "Spanish 140 is a lot of work. If you enjoy Spanish then you should take the class.",
    "I would say its pretty comparable to every other Spanish class I've ever taken - if you liked them, you'll like it. Just be prepared to talk in Spanish every day.",
    "This was a very intense continuation of the Spanish program. I believe that a lot of freshmen who test into L5 take 140 with special permission, and this is problematic. I took Spanish 120 and 130 my freshman year here and along with the scant others in my class with the same preparation, felt extremely behind the freshmen in the class. This made for a very intimidating experience. Nonetheless, the class was well-taught and interesting - we graduated from the textbook halfway through the course and the remainderof the year discussed short stories, a movie and a novella. The diversity of the course material is definitely a strength. I also appreciated the diversity in methods of assessment (written, presentations, essays, etc.), though it definitely felt like every other class we had some kind of assessment, and that was frustrating.",
    "YES!"
