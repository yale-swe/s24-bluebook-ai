    "Spanish 110 is a good foundational course to learn the basics. Supersite can get annoying, but overall I recommend it for anyone looking to learn the language.",
    "I would totally recommend spanish L1 to everyone who hasn't learned spanish yet. It is incredible how much progress you make over the course of a couple month and it is a really useful and spoken language around the globe.",
    "yes maripaz is awesome",
    "SPAN 110 is a great introductory Spanish course. It can be a little fast-paced in the beginning if you have no experience with Spanish. The course itself was very organized and classroom activities were fun. Maripaz was a great professor!",
    "This class is an entry level class to Spanish. It is much fun and you can learn a lot about the language and the culture.",
    "Spanish 110 is a great course, but is a little more work due to the fact that it meets every day. However, the course was very beneficial. I would recommend Spanish highly to any student looking to start a language at Yale.",
    "you learn a lot. Sharp learning curve in the beginning. Come ready to play.",
    "L1 Spanish isn't easy. The course moves fast and the tests are hard so be prepared to study every day."
