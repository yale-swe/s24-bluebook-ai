   "comments": [
    "Yes! You get a credit for working in a lab, which if you're going for a BS you probably are already doing. The paper can be used for your senior requirement and is a good way to summarize and really get to know the work your lab is doing, because sometimes its easy to lose sight of the big picture when you're only doing little segments of the experiment in lab",
    "A large time commitment.",
    "YES! Make sure you pick a good lab though with a hands on mentor.",
    "This is a great opportunity to engage with research. Much of what you learn in other classes is work that has already been published, which means that it is at least about a year old. Through independent study you learn what is going on right now in the field and get to learn what it takes to independently conduct this work.",
    "Great way to get credit for what you do in lab anyways.",
    "This is a great way to fulfill your Psychology senior requirements and gain valuable research experience. I've found that my experiences with directed research have actually not been very \"directed.\" A better name for the course would be independent study because your timeline, progress, research focus, and experimental design are all up to you. This freedom is great and really gives you a sense of the rigors of psychological research.",
    "It is a great way to get some research experience! It will tell you whether you want to go into psych research\/ go to grad school. I would definitely recommend it for that reason.",
    "PSYC 493 is a great way to explore psychology research.",
    "Find a lab that is researching something that interests you, and just go enjoy - you will have a great time. Directed research provides a really cool \"look behind the scenes\" of psych research, which is very useful for people in the major. Plus, it's fun and the grading is easy - what I have heard from people in 4 different labs.You do have to do about 10 hrs\/week, which is more than for most other class, but there are no tests\/papers, and you are almost guaranteed an A.",
    "Lab research in lab of choice. Work with mentor. Great if you have a good lab. Would recommend to other students who want to do research.",
    "Yes, I think that doing research for credit is a very good way to meet the graduate students in one's major, and to get an inside glimpse into what academia looks like. I enjoyed working with everyone in Margaret Clark's lab, and I felt that my TA was patient, helpful, cheerful, and knowledgeable.",
    "I would definitely recommend doing directed research. I learned a lot, worked closely with faculty members, and was able to write my senior thesis from my research.",
    "Take it if it is in a laboratory with people you enjoy working with, otherwise putting in the required hours can be a pain.",
    "This course was an excellent way to gain real life experience in conducting experiments.",
    "It really depends on the professor you work with or lab you work in.",
    "It is great to have a hands-on research experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for research experience, or thinks hanging out with little monkeys is awesome",
    "Directed research with Laurie Santos is literally one of the best academic decisions I've made at Yale.",
    "Great class, learning to work directly with primate research and running testing blocks.",
    "I would definitely recommend directed research to any and all psychology majors. There is no substitute for the experience you get working in a lab, and it can be a lot of fun! Being able to learn from and contribute to a team that is working on a research project was very rewarding, and I am looking forward to continuing my work in the lab next semester!",
    "Psychology 493 is a great way to get applied experience in psychology as long as you have a good adviser.",
    "Directed Research is phenomenal. It's great for building flexibility into your schedule, and it's super fun-- I got special dispensation from the Psych department to take it 4 times.",
    "Working in a lab is a great way to see what goes on in the world of psychology. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yeah, of course. Take this for your senior research, it works out perfectly.",
    "I would recommend this to a student who likes doing scientific research. Also this course is mainly for the Psych Senior Requirement.",
    "Yes, good to do research in something you're interested in.",
    "So grateful to have had the opportunity to do research as an undergrad! A wonderful opportunity to be involved in the field and work with some incredible people.",
    "If you want to gain some psych lab experience, don\u0092t be afraid of approaching the psych labs! Just shoot them an email and set up an interview. The worst that can happen is they say no and there are always other labs out there who need research assistants. The psych faculty at Yale is extremely friendly. If you\u0092re not sure which labs to contact, talk to Laurie Santos, the psych DUS. She\u0092s one of my role models at Yale; I haven\u0092t met anyone who doesn\u0092t find her incredibly warm and friendly. She\u0092ll be happy to take you under her wing.",
    "Yes!!! Do it!! It's great. It is what you make of it.",
    "I would definitely recommend directed research. Great opportunity to conduct research and learn about psychology hands on.",
    "Make sure you have an advisor who is invested in your project and responsive to your emails. It's very, very hard to do alone."
