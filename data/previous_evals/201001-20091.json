    "I wouldn't recommend it because the actual class time was very boring (and for three hours on a Friday afternoon). Much of the learning you do during the readings and as you answer the questions, but the class time is just boring. THe professors discuss very technical issues that are really not worth discussing.It is a very hard course. I did appreciate the fact that it made me think a lot.",
    "The class is a bit disorganized and looking back on it, I am not sure I can say what I learned. But the papers were fun to read and it was not too much work",
    "Really interesting. Really, Really interesting. Great papers and cool discussions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, particularly one interested in behavioral economics, psychology, philosophy, economics, etc. It was a great foundation to a variety of topics and I enjoyed it thoroughly.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend it because it introduces the topic and relevant authors well."
