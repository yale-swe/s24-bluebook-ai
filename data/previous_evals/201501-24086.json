    "This was the best class I have taken at Yale. I suggest that everyone take it, no matter your area of study, because it will give you the language of productive critique of so many aspects of society. Assignments are fair and fun, readings are great, and Professor Cowles is a phenomenal teacher.",
    "I would recommend it. Harsh grader but super knowledgeable and manageable reading. If you are interested in the title and history of psychology do it.",
    "This was a good class! If you need a history credit and are interesting in mental health or the sciences, the is the class for you.",
    "Take it. Even if you just need the WR credit, take it. It's worth it.",
    "Fascinating look at the evolution of the issues of minds and brain in America\/Western world.",
    "YES TAKE THIS CLASS!!! The readings are so interesting and important and the discussions were incredibly engaging. Professor Cowles is awesome and totally gets college life at Yale as opposed to some of the older more established professors. He is so passionate and engaging and really makes you think...something I have not experienced as much during any other class I've taken at Yale. This class is amazing and SO important given all the discussion about mental health on college campuses. It really grounds the theories and misconceptions about mental illness and will be applied to the rest of my academic and non-academic career."
