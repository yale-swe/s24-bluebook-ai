   "comments": [
    "This class was very interesting because I had never taken a art history class that was not centered around European or American arts. This class was a great way to explore a new section of the world through their art and to learn about their culture. The lectures were fascinating and helped me learn about Japanese visual arts as well as some of their culture throughout the semester.",
    "This class will teach you to look closely at a painting and consider it both analytically and historically. Because of Mimi's wonderful teaching style, you will engage with the artworks in a way that few art history courses allow. The exams will require you to memorize a fair amount of data - but just do it and you'll be fine!",
    "This course was amazing because we got to explore different aspects of Japanese art without chronology as a frame. I got to see the inter-disciplinary perspective on this art history. I learned how to understand and look for relationships between different artists in different time periods.",
    "First class analyzing art. Learned the to methodically analyze Japanese Arts and to understand the different schools\/styles from c900 to c1850",
    "I learned about the history of painting and printmaking in Japan in this course. In particular, I gained an understanding of the different techniques and styles used. Also, it was interesting to learn about the different artists and why they were significant.",
    "I learned how to so much about Japanese art--this was a model way to do an art history survey--it touched upon important artists, styles, media, and subject matter!",
    "I don't have an Art History background, but this course was perfect for anyone who even has the slightest interest in the subject!",
    "I had never taken an art history class before, so this course served as a great introduction to analyzing visual art -- both as it stands alone before us and as it stands within its larger historical context. I think the new ways I've learned to look at and beyond the surface of a painting (or print) have particularly influenced the way I look at films, which is what I am studying. This course also captured an idiosyncratic picture of Japan across the centuries through an aesthetic lens.",
    "Through the course, I learned how Japanese, Korean and Chinese painting were all intricately linked. Professor Yiengpruksawan was charismatic, helpful, and eloquently provided much needed insight on how traditional Japanese art forms developed.",
    "I got a good overview of Japanese visual culture since ancient times."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Overall the course was great. It was a small lecture which made it seem that everyone in that class was there because they were interested in the material. Also, lectures were very engaging and it was great how they built off of one another.",
    "Mimi seems at times a bit frazzled by technology but in my opinion that makes her more endearing and relatable. I cannot think of anything else negative to say about her or the class. She was truly a wonderful professor who presented her course information in such an engaging way. I would recommend this course to any and everyone, art history major or not. The strengths of this course: Mimi presents the information in a fairly unique manner by comparison to most art history courses. And it's very successful, in my opinion. Her lectures are clear and focused. She includes lots of images so that you don't lose interest. The readings aren't necessary to do well in the class but will help you with your final paper.",
    "The only thing I would say is that I wish there were sections so that we could spend time with real art objects. But Mimi's lectures were always entertaining and engaging. I feel I really understand the history of Japanese art through the different connections she made.",
    "I feel that this course is great how it is. Perhaps it would be better if there was more engagement art in museums, such as spending a class in the Yale Art Gallery. However, I like the structure of the course with its progression from materials and styles to periods to individual artists.",
    "I would not change the material or the readings at all! I would consider making all the readings accessible either via books students are required to buy (the Mason) or on a course website. I didn't always have time to do the reading on open reserve in HAAS itself before class, and I would have felt better prepared for some classes if I could have done the reading online the night before. I really appreciated that these were 1:20 minute rather than 50 minute classes. I got so much more out of the course! While I felt the culmination at the end of the course on major artists was exciting, I wonder if that focused look could have come at the appropriate moments that we did overview classes on similar works. I felt like, at least in the woodblock section, it was difficult not to talk about Hokusai (at least in the meishoe section). And then when we returned, it was necessary to remind ourselves. Although this wasn't difficult to do with a discussion we had a few weeks ago, I think I had more trouble with Sesshu remembering his context immediately. Perhaps doing focused looks on artists immediately after the sessions they were most closely linked to, for example Sesshu after the yamatoe week and Tanyu after the Kano School session. Regarding the content, I had a bit of trouble situating myself chronologically. And I know little of the history of Japan which made a discussion of warlords and various wars difficult. I think the problem of historical context is made mute by the focus on artwork. But I almost wonder if more contextual reading or discussion regarding the patrons\/ social contexts of the works would mean I got even more out of their visuals. While I appreciated the open-endedness of the final assignment, I think my final product would have benefitted if the assignment had a bit more structure.",
    "I think the major strength of this course was that the curriculum was organized by theme rather than by historical period. So even though we jumped around in time quite a bit, it was all the more interesting to conceptualize different 'movements' as they were in dialogue with one another. The course's main weakness was that the lectures themselves sometimes became repetitive and hard to stay engaged with (and the fact that they meet in the basement of Loria doesn't help too much). I know this is a lecture course, but maybe it would be good to open up a class every once in a while to more of a discussion -- it was certainly a small enough group of students.",
    "Having a weekly study group may have enhanced my enjoyment of this course. The lack of a study group prevented me from forming any relationships with other students.",
    "Lectures were a bit confusing sometimes--rather meandering and seemed to get lost in all the details. It would be helpful to define terms earlier on like colophon and others, and more historical information would help ground the artworks in context better."

    "I would recommend this class to another student especially if they want to learn about art that is not necessarily mainstream. It was captivating to learn about a new culture and their art practices. It was also interesting to learn about how the Japanese had an impact on the European art once they came into contact, and vice verse.",
    "I would recommend this course without reservation to both history of art majors and non-majors alike. Whether you are interested in or knowledgeable about art history this class is both engaging and accessible. You will get to look at gorgeous art and be a better person for it. With a minimal amount of work, you will do really well in this course. Basically, memorize the ID sheets that she posts for the midterm and final, attend the exam reviews, and you will do really well. Take this class! You won't regret it! Team Mimi all the way!",
    "I definitely recommend this course for any student who wants to know a little more about Japanese art. The history is so interesting and Mimi breaks it all down so it's easy to understand. A great introduction to Japanese art!",
    "Yes, this is a great class and fairly relaxed format. Mimi is lovely and really gives you every opportunity to do well in this exam",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I believe that they would enjoy it immensely, regardless of art history background.",
    "Yes! This is an excellent course that acquaints students with a varied visual tradition. You will explore different subjects, styles, and social contexts for which the paintings and prints are produced and come away with an appreciation for how diverse the tradition is! While the material is expansive, the focus on painting and printmaking made it a manageable scope for the course. You will be bowled over visually by the detail of brushstroke and complexity of color in the artwork, and a discussion of the aesthetics in class is at a high level. If you want to learn about anything from the Tale of Genji (think an 11th c. female writer, possibly-female illustrators, and depictions of a women's palace life) to wacky uses for woodblock prints (including ones that served as cutout toys), you should take this course!",
    "Absolutely take this class. It was one the best experiences I had at Yale -- enjoyable with many things to learn without high stress levels.",
    "YES",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but only if they had some preexisting interest in Japan and \/ or art history (and isn't taking it just for the credit). I found this semester fascinating -- especially the last group of classes, where we focused in on individual 'masters' -- but I can see how it could become unexciting for someone who was not already curious about the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in not only Japanese art, but Korean and Chinese art as well.",
    "Course material was really beautiful and interesting. Lectures were somewhat confusing, but if you love Japanese artwork or want to see more of it, this is a good option for you.",
    "I really enjoyed this course! The lectures are very interesting, and Professor Yiengpruksawan is an excellent teacher."
