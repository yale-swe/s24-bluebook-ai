    "I would definitely recommend Spanish 140 to another student, with a warning that this is a very time consuming class.",
    "Take this class with this professor if you want to learn spanish. He is passionate, engaging, and phenomenal. I completely recommend this. It is a good amount of work, but its worth it to learn with a great professor.",
    "I would recommend the course. It's a little bit more work than 130 but is not so difficult on exams. A lot of work in partners and a lot of assessments, but overall it was an interesting course. I learned a bunch.",
    "It is a lot of work but fun. A lot of partner work as well.",
    "spanish 140 is a great way to improve your Spanish skills. There is a lot of verbal and written practice. However, don't go into it unless you're ready for a challenge.",
    "Great course to improve your spanish",
    "If you have to take this class to fulfill your language requirement, taking it with Diaz is a fair option. However, if your knowledge of the grammar concepts reviewed in the class is slightly rusty, I would recommend considering other instructors. Diaz is not the most clear, at times.",
    "L4 is an alright class. I wouldn't suggest it to another student who wasn't passionate about continuing Spanish because of how much of a heavy workload it is.",
    "You will certainly improve in Spanish, but you get out of it what you put in.",
    "Rote. If not a requirement, and the student really wants to learn, I think it would be effort better spent to try to find a way to go to a Spanish-speaking country and live there for a few months. Perhaps there's more variety among professors, but in my experience the Spanish department and this class are pretty stultifying. Language classes can be wildly fun and productive! Like a gym class with exercises and a strange assortment of students and the clear pursuit of a skill. How does this get turned into such a staid routine?"
