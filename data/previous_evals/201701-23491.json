    "I learned a lot about corporate finance. I came in knowing almost nothing, but it was a very good course in helping to promote my learning and understanding of the subject. I wish I had more time with the course because some of the concepts could have been developed even further.",
    "Capital structure Cost of financing Impact of financing on tax Impact of financing on decisionmaking (e.g. debt hangover)",
    "I learned about how companies raise financing, and how debt and equity really work.",
    "I learned a ton of stuff that is going to be applicable to my job after I graduate. I feel like I got a good foundation in the theory of corporate finance without sacrificing learning about applicable techniques. All in all a super useful class.",
    "I learned about how to evaluate the present value of different projects, the costs\/advantages of debt, different capital structures, risk management, mergers & acquisitions, converting cashflows in different currencies to PV USD, and much more. It was a great introduction into corporate finance.",
    "Lot's of practical info about how to value companies and the intricacies of finance",

   "comments": [
    "The problem sets were quite onerous and not really fun to do. It applied the knowledge that we were learning in unique ways, but the problems quickly became hoop-jumpy. Also, the feedback and help sessions for the problem sets could have been much more helpful. Otherwise, the course was structured fantastically and it was very engaging to take.",
    "- Make TAs more available, not just an one-hour session the day before every assignment due - The assignments are too long. Split each assignment into maybe two separate assignments",
    "The course was well-structured and covered many important topics. I wish the lectures had covered more material, both in breadth and depth, but I understand the mix in levels of preparedness makes this challenging.",
    "Professor Choi's teaching was a huge strength for this course. He takes material that can be very dry and makes it engaging. I also liked the regular short quizzes at the beginning of class. They helped to cement the material in my mind. One thing that was frustrating was that office hours for the problem sets were always held the night before the problem set was due, so if you had a lot of questions you were forced to wait until the last minute.",
    "Strenghts: Very engaging lecturer Weaknesses: Maybe try not to cover too many topics, (a little too spread out)",
    "The class was extremely well-organized which made absorbing the material much easier. Professor Choi is a gifted lecturer, making concepts easy to understand.",
    "Well-taught, good curriculum. Constraint on number of people working together on a problem set makes it difficult to seek help from other students.",
    "The course was great, but at times the professor went through lecture slides too quickly."

   "comments": [
    "This was a fantastic course to learn about corporate finance in a holistic manner. It wasn't too maths focused but never neglected the importance of utilizing the equations that we learned.",
    "I would recommend. Corporate finance is so fundamental and useful if you want to go into finance. Many financial concepts are good to know simply for making informed decisions in daily life even if you are not interested in going into finance.",
    "A worthwhile class that debunks misconceptions you have about debt and equity, and gives you a solid foundation in how companies raise financing. Helpful whether you want to work in finance or just want to understand stocks better. Take this with Prof Choi!",
    "If you are interested in finance or applied economics you should definitely take this course! Professor Choi is an amazing lecturer. He takes material that can be very dry and makes it engaging. The workload is super manageable.",
    "Best course I've taken at Yale so far. The material is presented in such an accessible and practical way, and it's clear from the beginning that Professor Choi is not only knowledgeable but also extremely passionate about the stuff that he's teaching. Take this course-- I promise you won't regret it.",
    "Absolutely - to any student interested in learning more applicable financial concepts that are not available in Yale College, this is a great option.",
    "Yes",
    "Definitely would recommend if interested in finance or consulting",
    "Yes, if you want to work in finance",
    "I would recommend Corporate Finance by James Choi. Put in the work and it'll be extremely rewarding. Keep up with lectures, review after class, start the problem sets early, and ask clarifying questions as needed since Prof Choi is extremely knowledgable and friendly.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. I had an amazing time."
