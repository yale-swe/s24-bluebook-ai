    "This is an extremely interesting class that covers a number of topics in biomechanics modeling (mostly in Stuart's area of specialization, the heart), and the computational methods associated with tackling them. More broadly, Stuart emphasizes strategies for engaging in any kind of modeling project, so the class goes well beyond learning about cardiac action potentials or MATLAB solvers. I went into this class thinking how could anyone possibly go about simulating something as complicated as a muscle contraction, I came out of it with the hopes of pursuing more modeling research projects in the future.",
    "This was probably the course where I learned the most practical skills this semester. The entire semester built up to helping navigate my finals project which was my biggest point of learning. Having to sit down and code a model from scratch was really something that was a challenge for me and I felt really accomplished when I had finished.",
    "This class taught me the fundamentals of multiscale modeling in biomechanical systems - mostly cardiac muscle - and really helped me understand how models are built, why they are useful, and what they can accomplish."

   "comments": [
    "Stuart is great at promoting a laid-back atmosphere that made me super excited to go to class every week. The modules are well-organized, interesting, and really fun to complete. The final project is also a lot of fun; Stuart is supportive of all kinds of ideas and offers great tips on how to make them work, but it's also fun to have the freedom of try things out on your own. The biggest drawback to the class is that it is almost too limited in its scope. I would have loved doing additional (optional?) exercises in the modules that go a little deeper into the material and the way it is coded into a model.",
    "I loved the structure of this course. I feel like a \"lab\" or practical portion of this course is really important. Those days were definitely where I helped to become less afraid of the physical process of working through modeling code. The other portion I liked was having to do a literature review with our homework. I think it was really good practice at closely reading research papers because undergrads don't get as much exposure to that as an assignment as grad students probably do. It was also fun to watch my progression as I became more comfortable with the field and understanding the readings as the semester progressed.",
    "The class environment is very engaging and welcoming, especially since it was small (7 students), Professor Campbell is friendly, and there are frequent lab sessions where you can work on assignments in class with the help of the instructor. The only improvements I might make are to spend more time focusing on the math behind some modeling techniques. I had less background than other students, so I really appreciated the in-depth explanation of finite element analysis. I wish we'd done the same for ODE Solvers and PDE Solvers."

    "This class is amazing. It's a great feeling to leave a course understanding the solutions to what seem like gargantuan problems at the beginning of the semester. Stuart is great at explaining course material, and his modules are not too stressful but really informative. It's also a lot of fun to engage with the graduate students who take the course. Definitely a class worth taking.",
    "Models: At first you may feel like you're meddling with powers you can't possibly comprehend, but by the end you will feel so accomplished about all the work you can do on your final project. This was pretty easily one of my favorite classes of my semester. I liked that there weren't very many people in it (we only had 7, half grad students and half undergrads). It really felt like a science seminar with a really nice casual and comfortable feel. The class is fairly low work week to week and the structure is as follows. You start a module with a lecture and then move into 1-3 \"lab days\" where you work on models connected to the lecture. Then you finish up the module for homework if you didn't finish in class and do a lit review. Then you go over the lit review the next day in class. So you really only have homework about once a week at most. Then the class is capped by a final project. Stuart gives you days in class to start working on this and makes himself very available to help you if you need it. Coding a model of something from scratch was really daunting and in the end was definitely not easy. However, it was also really rewarding to see what I was able to do and how much I had learned. Matlab is the most common program you work with so a background in Matlab is really helpful even if its not listed as a requirement (I don't remember if it is or not)",
    "Take this class if you can! It's a great followup to MCDB 361 if you're coming from a more basic science background than, say, engineering. Don't be intimidated by the pre-requisites. Professor Campbell is very hands on and will help fill any gaps you have. The skills you learn here can be applied toward other modeling problems in biology, and will change the way you think about computer science & math in relation to life sciences. If you are at all quantitatively inclined, interested in improving your coding skills, or just want to take a cool, outside-of-the-box bio class, this one's for you!"
