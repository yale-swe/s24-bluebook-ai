   "comments": [
    "Take it!! This class is awesome. It's a lot of reading and a decent amount of work (weekly posts, presentation, final paper), but it's worth it! Buddhist psychology and philosophy was so foreign to me, but I loved thinking about these things& stretching my mind in a new way!",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU WANT TO OPEN YOUR EYES",
    "Lots of cool readings that lean heavily toward Buddhist traditions (specifically Tibetan), and significantly less discussion of modern cognitive science evaluations of meditation. Also, one time when were meditating in class, one of the girls in the class achieved nirvana, so maybe that could happen to you if you take it.",
    "Buddhist Traditions of Mind and Meditation was a great course. The workload is very manageable, and Professor Quintman makes sure that everyone learns a lot and participates in the discussion. We cover a great deal of topics within Buddhism, including Buddhist Psychology, Tantric Buddhism, and Buddhism in the West. I really looked forward to the seminar each week.",
    "Very complicated, very interesting, and a lot of readings. Take it if you want to, but just go in with no prior expectations or desires. So the saying goes in buddhism: desire leads to suffering.",
    "Fantastic class. HIghly recommended.",
    "Not worth the hype in the reviews",
    "I would recommend it for someone interested in the subjects that it covers, since it covers them probably as well as possible given the breadth of the syllabus.",
    "The readings are long and not straightforward. You will be reading a lot of very dense material but then again it is a class worth taking. By the end of the semester, you will be amazed at what you will have learnt.",
    "This class is awesome- Quintman is an amazing professor and the readings are fascinating! You don't need too much previous knowledge of Buddhism but a strong interest is a must.",
    "This is a great course to take if you want to learn about Buddhism and how to think critically about primary texts. It doesn't attempt to give a broad historical overview of the tradition, but this doesn't bar students from participating if they don't have a solid background in Buddhist studies. I definitely didn't think it was easy but the material was interesting and I felt like I learned a ton (in terms of information and skills).",
    "YES!! TAKE THIS CLASS. If you don't know anything about Buddhism or Buddhist philosophy, or if you do, doesn't matter-- it's great. Totally re-shaped the way I think about religion and the world."
