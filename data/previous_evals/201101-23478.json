    "An excellent introduction and overview to women and children health policies. However, the structure of the final exam really should be open book\/open note in order to reflect real life situations - I think the professor would rather we be able to APPLY our knowledge gained from the course rather than regugitate facts that were memorized.",
    "It is generally very good, covering a lot of interesting and important issues.",
    "AWESOME class! I LOVED the lectures. The readings and assignments were also totally relevant. We had great class discussions and I learned so much. It was very practical for people interested in maternal-child health or for those wanting to learn something new. Mary Alice was really great!",
    "Excellent! I learned so much and the information was practical and will definitely will be used in the job force.",
    "I really liked the set-up of this class and how each class was devoted to a specific topic within women&children's health. I learned a lot about a very specific field within health policy for the first time, unlike the other classes that I've been able to take that are very broad. This is my first health policy elective versus the required policy classes, so it was refreshing to talk about specific health policy issues as they relate to unique populations.",
    "I was pleased with the maternal and child health aspects of this class. However, the class was not titled \"maternal and child health,\" it was titled \"health of women and children.\" We really didn't discuss aspects of women's health separate from reproductive health, and we didn't discuss very many aspects of children's health, other than oral health and asthma. I would have enjoyed the class more if there had been a broader focus, including maternal and child health, women's health, and children's health separately. Also, the readings assigned were pretty much unnecessary."

    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Generally very good. Mary Alice is very nice and has a broad range of experiences. Sometimes she can get mired in details (numbers, %s, $s) which are not conceptually important for policy stream\/concepts. This can also make her slides\/lectures feel a little too didactic. When she does ask question and include class the discussion is much better.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Mary Alice was wonderful! She organized the lectures amazingly well. I loved all the topics we covered and she just gave us so much information about maternal-child health issues and health policy in particular.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0The instructor was practical in the information she presented and did a great job of engaging the students. Liked the facilitated group discussions.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Mary Alice is a great instructor because she is so experienced and passionate about these topics. The slides were helpful to keep on track and Mary Alice was always very responsive to emails about assignments. I liked the two classes when she brought in her colleagues who have specific expertise in maternal depression and lobbying\/advocacy. Also, most of the class would probably disagree withme, but I would have preferred to go straight through and get let out a few minutes early rather than taking a quick break in the middle of class."

   "comments": [
    "The course is generally pretty interesting. The two assignments are not difficult, but do take some organization\/research time. I appreciated that these assignments were much more in line with types of assignments we will see as public health professionals (fact sheet and testimony), as opposed to strictly academic exercises. I would recommend this to someone with interests in women's health. There is not a lot of focus on children, outside CHIP.",
    "Take it! It was awesome!",
    "Practical information and interesting",
    "This class definitely has less work that other policy courses, specifically compared to the required policy classes, but you still learn a ton of new and specialized material which I appreciated. I would recommend this course because Mary Alice is great and there are huge opportunities in public health for women&children."
