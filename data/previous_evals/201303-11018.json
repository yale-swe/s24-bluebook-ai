   "comments": [
    "Music 309 is the study of set theory and geometry and their applications to music theory and analysis. I would definitely recommend this class if the general area of \"music and math\" interests you.",
    "This is an interesting class - a little bit disjunct in its attempt to put the music and math together, but still good. The paper assignments are difficult and demanding, but you will learn quite a lot from them!",
    "Basically you talk about music through the lens of several different mathematical models. I highly recommend this class if you are curious about how music works, if you're looking for new things you can do with math, or if you are a music major who needs a QR.",
    "I would highly recommend this course-- a study of musical sets\/set theory and the exploration of Dmitri Tymozko's geometric modelings of musical occurrences.",
    "I would recommend this course as a theory and QR requirement to Music Majors. Non-majors will most definitely find this material irrelevant to the rest of your life. The units on cyclic universes and meter were fascinating, but the course dragged with the units on geometry. Cohn is brilliant and very engaging, and the workload was very manageable. Though the material can be very difficult, Cohn is very accommodating and so this ends up being a pretty easy way to fill the requirements.",
    "This is a great class exploring the applications of group theory and geometry to making sense of musical form in terms of harmony and rhythm. It is not \"math\" in the sense that we like to think of Mathematics - ie. differentiate this function to obtain this or simplify this complex number. Think of it being able to see musical structures, chords and rhythms represented as geometric and group relations.For example, the complex numbers form a cyclic group under the operation of multiplication. From i, you can get -i, 1, -1 simply by multiplying the same element multiple times by i. In the same way, a musical scale is also a cyclic group. You reach all the 12 notes in scale from C by defining a function say...moving by perfect 5ths (which would be the circle of fifths). This is just an example that scratches the surface of what this class about.Be warned though, that this is not an \"easy\" QR class for musicians who are afraid for taking a math class. I come from a Physics background and initially found this class a little challenging because I am used to thinking of math and music in terms of Fourier functions and DSP. This class IS NOT about this kind of math. The title of the class is \"Musical Sets Spaces and Geometries\". It is about being able to apply geometric and group relations to classify and understand why for example, a pentatonic scale pops out of the group of 12 notes when maximizing the distance between the notes.You don't need formal group and set theory to take this class, you really just need an open mind and be ready to take in a new way of seeing musical forms that were so intuitive to you in a completely new light.",
    "I think that this course is a must take course. Especially being taught by PRofessor Cohn who was a pioneer in this field. Fantastic!",
    "Incredible course. Rick uses interesting and accessible math to help you unpack some great music, particularly from the early 20th century. He is a great lecturer, and also a leader in his field. Highly recommended, particularly for composers.",
    "An exploration into material that is barely covered in other theory courses. Extremely interesting.",
    "it was a very interesting new look at the structuring of music and organization of its harmonic and rhythmic content, i would recommend 309 for other musicians who are specifically interested in looking for relations and patterns in musical structures, you have to be willing to pull a piece apart at the seams",
    "This is a very interesting course, featuring a variety of units that approach music analysis from different geometric modeling frames. It's a treat to have a QR in the music department, and all the more so with Rick Cohn, who is a foremost scholar in the field, as well as an extremely nice guy!Note: this is still a music theory course, and if you do not have a solid theory background you will likely be unable to follow much of the material.",
    "For music majors looking for a QR, this is a great choice. If you aren't comfortable reading music then don't take this class\u00e2\u0080\u0094the course is half musical analysis, half math and you'll feel very over your head in the music parts. Subject material is very interesting, though definitely not earth shattering. Professor Cohn is just great, really engaging, a great scholar, and super helpful outside of class.",
    "No music major should leave Yale without having taken a class with Rick Cohn. I mean, come on, people. That said, while the grading ultimately seemed generous to me, this extremely arcane material will challenge you like never before. The course is, however, both a theory and a QR. True life, the writing assignments are hard. Rick Cohn is the only professor I've had since English 120 who comes down on shoddy delivery as hard as he does on content. This is a lesson everyone should [re-]learn; if for no other reason, take the class to whip your expository writing into shape. If you take it, lecture can seem like a conversation between Rick Cohn and that guy in your class who just knows everything. DON'T STAY SILENT; ASK YOUR QUESTIONS. No one else but that one kid gets it, either."
