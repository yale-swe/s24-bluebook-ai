   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend. Great beginner's course to Spanish, although it is not easy! We go through so much vocab and grammar in a short amount of time. I feel like I learned enough to have simply conversations with fluent Spanish speakers, even after only one semester.",
    "Yes I would recommend the course to a fellow student.",
    "I would recommend it because over all it is a well put together course, and Spanish is probably not the hardest language to start.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any person interested in learning Spanish quickly and efficiently. There's a heavy amount of work, but the learning makes it really worth it and manageable.",
    "SPAN110 is a great introduction to Spanish. Having never taken the language before, I learned way more than I thought I would have in just one semester. The workload is very manageable, and the assignments are fair and well-spaced. I lucked out with a great teacher, so I'm not sure what the other instructors are like, but he always made class interesting and fun, even if it was in the morning.",
    "It is an introductory course for learning Spanish. I would recommend it for any student who is passionate enough about the language to put in the time necessary."
