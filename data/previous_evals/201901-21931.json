    "Strengths: wide variety of topics, fantastic professor Weaknesses: larger class sizes than other Chinese courses, which limits available speaking opportunities.",

    "I audited the course, but I would recommend taking it regardless. Again, the instructor's pedagogy was remarkably effective, and, even as an auditor, I know my language skills improved.",
    "Yes! Zhou Laoshi is fantastic. Such a kind and competent teacher who is willing to accommodate your needs. This class is also only 3 days per week; while the average nightly homework is about equal to the earlier courses in Chinese, only having class 3 times per week really alleviates pressure and makes the class seem much more manageable.",
    "Yes, this is a great class for getting better at Chinese.",
    "Yeah, if you want to maintain your Chinese level and do more context work than language drills"
