   "comments": [
    "Meets twice a week, homework once a week. Very manageable as a 4th or 5th class, but know that you'll have to put time into it.",
    "It's very well organized.",
    "I decided to take ART 224 as a way to balance my analog and digital visualization courses. I enjoyed having a designated time to draw freely, by hand. I do think there is room for improvement in terms of teaching. There was a session where Brook, the TA, was flustered while trying to set up the props and lighting for the models. She blurted out, \"This is why I'm an artist and not a teacher.\" Bemusing. Perhaps the dynamics are different in graduate level art classes.",
    "Villalongo is quite a patronizing instructor, contrary to his positive reviews. I was just shocked by the contrast from the basic drawing course that I took, which was more focused on constructive criticism (the criticism in this class felt more subjective). I became very self-conscious halfway through the semester, and it was to the extent that every time he came around while we were drawing, I got really nervous because I was anxious about what he would say about my drawing this time. I also wasn't able to draw very well every time he came around, when he would ask things like \"What are you doing?\" or \"Do you even remember what we learned last class?\" which would throw you off course a bit. That being said, I did do well in the course by just pouring in tons of time, but I'm not sure if I would choose to take this again looking back (or any art class in the future for that matter).",
    "It's a very intense focus on the human figure. First half of the class is all charcoal, then we added in ink and gesso. During class (4 hours per week) you draw the model and have once a week critique of the homework. Great opportunity to draw from the live models. Weekly homework is a significant time commitment. Overall you will improve a lot and I found it fun, but it is not an easy class.",
    "I haven't and probably won't recommend the course unless it gets an overhaul.",
    "I would advise a student to take the class if they wanted to be motivated to draw a lot. However, I would warn that the class does a poor job of developing explicit skills and techniques and that the homework requirements are sometimes overwhelming and\/or logistically impossible depending on your schedule and the availability of live models at home. I would also warn against taking the class from Will. Unless you are a person who thrives on explicitly negative criticism, this class can be dreadful to attend. Especially in the morning.",
    "Lots of work but fun and helpful!",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I took it as a second semester senior having never taken any art classes here before. I think it was really helpful that I had some experience drawing before, though there were definitely a lot of people who were much more talented and experienced than I in the class. Will can be a little harsh at times, but it's meant well and he often follows it up with humor. There is a lot of time spent doing homework but it makes you improve so so much."
