    "This was a very good class. Professor Stuart is great - her feedback is very helpful and she really cares about helping her students. You read a couple of essays for each class, and write an essay a week (alternating between first and final drafts each week). The readings are very manageable and most are pretty fun to read. The essays can be a lot of work, especially if you put them off until the last minute. Start early if you can, because you'll want to have a good essay to turn in at the end of the week. The other students workshop your essays as well, which can be helpful too. Overall, I really enjoyed this class. It was a nice (if sometimes time-consuming) WR credit.",
    "Excellent.",
    "At the end of the day, this wasn't the course I was looking for. I far prefer analytical writing to personal essays and a more analytical approach to the readings. Make sure that you want to practice writing personal essays--if you that's what you want, it's a great course, if not, you'll struggle to like it.",
    "I an about as far off from an ENGL major as you can get, and I LOVED this class. I thought I hated English because analytical writing kills me, but this class is far from analytical writing and is so much fun. You get to read some really interesting (and humorous!) essays, as well as write 5 creative and personal essays which I had a lot of fun writing. I took this with Barbara Stuart who is phenomenal. She is more relaxed than the other professors (we get coupons for doing random good things in class that we can use to submit an essay late) and is responsive, engaging, and helpful.",
    "It would be a tragedy for you to graduate Yale without ever taking 120. You need to work but the end rewards are incredible.",
    "Yes! Definitely a great intro course, with really interesting readings for the most part. Analyzing them in class always led to a \"ah-ha\" moment where even if you didn't understand what the author was trying to do beforehand, suddenly it all came together as a brilliant writing tactic. Professor Stuart is also great about giving advice and helping you with your own essay, but be sure to go to her office hours to get this extra one on one time if you want to do well.",
    "I had a good experience in this class. It's a lot of reading and a lot of writing, but it's manageable, and I think it gave my writing skills a good boost. Discussions in class were typically pretty interesting.",
    "Solid course that builds writing skills. Don't expect easy grading though."
