    "HUMS 303 is an interdisciplinary study of the meaning of history. The reading list is excellent and Charles Hill is amazing at giving the basic context and fundamental symbolism of each one of the readings. I would totally recommend the course, if you can get in. Every week I was eager to go to class.",
    "In this class, you analyze the cultural foundations of our world, starting from Ancient Greece to modern day, with texts written as recent as 2014! You try to understand the paradigms in which we have lived over the centuries. What do they mean for our thought and meaning in this world?",
    "This course was one in which we learned not so much about a particular topic, but rather about a method of thinking and analysis. Professor Hill is not your typical seminar leader; he does not set a clear agenda at the beginning of the class, nor does he provide much concrete guidance on assignments or papers. In fact, he told us at the start of the semester that he was as unsure as anyone about where our discussions would lead. This may seem like a terrifying proposition, and, indeed, at times, the course seemed rudderless, especially in the first third of the semester, which consisted of a broad DS-lite survey of \"philosophies of history\" from the Greeks to the Moderns. As the semester progressed, however, and as we settled into the second part of the course, which consisted of reading one 20th century book per week, the course really took off, and we had some fascinating discussions about the problems of the modern age. Professor Hill selected students with a wide variety of academic interests, so our conversations drew upon pop culture, philosophy, economics, politics, science, technology, literature, art, and much, much more. What we learned was to look at past problems as well as contemporary ones through a \"metahistorical\" lens: that is, to think about each of them as a manifestation of a particular view of the world, of history, of society, one that permeates the culture of the time. The experience was daunting and frustrating, but also immensely rewarding and undeniably unique.",
    "Definitely take the class. You will read a lot of great books that I don't think are normally taught at Yale. Professor Hill is amazing and will help explain the texts if people are confused. The students in the class were quite on top of things, so discussions were very fruitful. I always left class having learned a lot. Readings can be lengthy at times, but they're never too excessive if you space the readings out throughout the week. Assignments are very fair: one short mid-term paper and one long 10-15 page final paper. If you want to learn what metahistories are and to read and discuss great texts (old and new) of the Western world, this is the class for you. For those who have taken DS, this is a great class to recap some of the things you already learned in DS and to expand on them. Take the class! You won't regret it.",
    "My favorite class at Yale so far. The readings were wonderful. At the beginning, there were a few classes that were a bit iffy in how much they tried to take in, but from the fourth class onwards each set of readings were phenomenal - probably the best\/most interesting reading list for any one class I've ever had. I felt like I left the class thinking about the world differently. Take a Hill class at some point at Yale.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "I definitely recommend this course!",
    "Probably not.",
    "If this class is being offered, take it. Studying with Professor Hill was one of the better decisions I've made at Yale.",
    "An introduction to the concept of Metahistory, which is a really interesting idea of Hill's creation. The course ends with an overview of the books that HIll considers to be the modern canon."
