   "comments": [
    "This course provides a good overview for how to do sociological research. It doesn't go in-depth with actual methods or examples, particularly on quantitative research, but it does give a good idea of how to form a research question and actually follow through with picking methods and the kinds of roadblocks and revisions that are necessary for good research.",
    "SOCY 160 is a broad-base course that teaches research methods and how to conduct research for sociology. I would recommend this course to anyone who has to do research either for their chosen career or even their thesis, because the course provides an assignment to work through your thesis topics.",
    "It's a course about how to go about sociological research. The questions we explored were what methods were good for research, which ones were debated. It could be a bit dry at times, and it seemed like we had a substantial amount of work for the course being 100-level. But I did learn a good amount and it was useful towards my thesis.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to anyone who plans to conduct research but has no formal training in it. THe final project is writing a research proposal and it's helpful to brainstorm for your senior thesis or projects you would like to carry out over the summer. Very practical class!",
    "Good class, not too fast or difficult, but end up with good thesis proposal.",
    "It's a good class - you need to take it with Mahler, but even if it's with someone else, it's all about sociological research methods. Could be boring, but hey, if you like the research, then it won't be",
    "I have mixed feelings about recommending. Our Graphic Design MFA is very much making-intensive and it is in the one-to-one meetings with our course director and tutors that our tailored reading lists\/suggestions appear. We are somehow in charge of determining whether we want to write\/read more or less, because the nature of our exercises is mostly visual.Then I would recommend the course for the same reason I took the course: in order to learn a method of researching and writing, and also out of curiosity of integrating a sociological element in my graphic design practice. In this sense I think the course was very successful to me.What I wouldn't recommend is to take this course in one's second year at the MFA. The amount of writings and readings can be excessive and somehow disturbing since the Graphic Design thesis writing and research is very customized. To have time to digest them is very necessary for someone outside Sociology.I feel like if one wants to take it in the first year then the course can really offer a valuable addition to one's researching skills, and also sharpen the criticism to one's own Graphic Design practice.",
    "Methodology classes can be really dry, but Professor Mahler tries to make 160 interesting. If you're a sociology major, this class is required, but you don't have to dread it - while the readings can be dense and confusing at first, they become better over the course of the semester, and Professor Mahler does a good job explaining them. The BEST part of this class are the journal entries - coming into this course, you can have absolutely no idea what you'll be doing your senior thesis on, but the journal entries force you to sit down and think about what you want to do and how exactly to go about it. It will be helpful and make you feel far more settled about what you'll be working on senior year."
