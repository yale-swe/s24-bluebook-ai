   "comments": [
    "It's a great way to get credit for your labwork. Do it. Don't take a lecture on top of lab.",
    "I would recommend it, especially if you did MBB470 in the fall because you get to continue with your research and I felt much more comfortable with my research and more familiar with the structure of the course.",
    "Decent course. Ten hours is a lot of time. Make sure you like what you're doing!",
    "This class is very much dependent upon your lab. If you like your lab, this class is great. 10 hour minimum\/week in lab, but you'l probably do more. I'd recommend it.",
    "This class felt extremely disorganized. There was no planning meeting-- we never had the chance to meet with Professor Garen or receive his feedback on any of the assignments. The requirements for this course aren't too demanding (one research proposal, one final report, and one oral presentation to your lab group), although the workload will obviously depend on the lab you are working in. I frequently found myself spending 15+ hrs\/week in the lab.",
    "I really recommend if you want to get research experience. Its a worth while experience.",
    "Take it if you want to do research during the year. Very few submission requirements, but a lot of time. Word to the wise: don't do research in two labs at the same time. Not worth it.",
    "Super chill - you do research, write a 1-pg proposal, write a 15-pg final paper, and give a short presentation to your lab.",
    "It's research for credit. If you're doing research seriously already, you might as well get the credit for a minimal amount of extra writing.",
    "Good chance to get research experience and really make some progress!",
    "Yes! Unfortunately there is not much interaction with others in the course, but research is SO essential to understanding biochemistry that this is highly recommended.",
    "Yes, a great way to do actual research and to learn about it."
