    "While the reading was dense and there was too much of it to get through at times, the class overall was excellent. I would take it a second time if I could, to absorb more of the material!",
    "This class is very current--lots of recently published peer-reviewed articles, and a lot of integration of very new models of alternative living.",
    "Probably the most important class I have taken at FES--unfortunately, it's not a standard class but one taught by a visiting professor who was brought here by students. I think we need more classes like this, which is to say classes focusing on behavior, consumption, and serious reading + deep critical thinking.",

    "The professor and her unique perspective on economics and the environment. Her own work is incredible and she filled a HUGE gap in my curriculum. I'm so glad I was able to take her class before leaving Yale. We need more classes like this at F&ES.",
    "I appreciated the opportunity to explore the space between understanding a problem and implementing a solution. The topic at hand was consumption and sustainability but the concepts were applicable to all areas of environmental and societal inquiry.I also appreciated the passion, dedication, and rigor of the professor. She was a force to be reckoned with, unlike many of the professors I have taken classes with here.",
    "Incredibly useful discussion and fascinating issues that just don't get raised in other classes.",
    "There were so many great elements to this course. It was really rewarding to have a seminar structure to discuss this subject matter--an incredibly thoughtful and articulate group of students grappling with really challenging readings and big questions of how to understand and influence people's consumption practices. Julie (the professor) effectively and powerfully explains, synthesizes, and contextualizes all of the readings, so that we had a sense of how each piece fit in the broader body of Consumption literature. So, I guess that makes the readings, the professor, and the discussion all the best. Seminar structure really encourages connections between classmates, and a lot of our conversations carried on outside of the classroom.",
    "I loved that it was so small (although I did not like the way the class size was cut down...it was not clear on the first day that the form we were filling out was an application to the class), and I loved how much people were really interested in digging into the material and really understanding it. Beyond that, people were so interested in finding what the material meant in a much larger context than just sustainability, which was really fantastic.",
    "the group of students was particularly engaged. having the chance to study with julie schor was a total privilege. and this class is NOTHING like anything else offered at this program. hugely valuable.",
    "the professor and syllabus were very good, well complemented by the students",
    "Professor Schor's openness to a place for dialogue and questioning. Excellent learning environment, nothing quite like it.",
    "Class discussions and discussions with the Professor. The course covered topics relating to a broad range of economic and cultural themes under the broad umbrella of consumption.",
    "The readings and the Profesor, Juliet Schor is very knowledgeble!"

   "comments": [
    "Less reading would allow us to go more in depth into particular pieces. I found myself scrambling to read everything and not being able to focus.",
    "Although I admired and appreciated Professor Schor's rigor, I also think it might have stymied discussion. It often felt like we were debating a point instead of exploring it. On the one hand, I support the idea that we should be able to craft and defend an argument; at the same time, it diminished my willingness to take risks with ideas in class.",
    "I really wouldn't improve anything from this class. Maybe slightly less time spent on theory, although it's admittedly hard to do as fundamentals are fundamental.",
    "I don't know quite how this could be improved, but our discussions were a bit halting at the outset. We began with really challenging readings, and people were slow to chime in. The professor is really challenging--she's not afraid to disagree with you outright, and some people may have felt hesitant to speak up about complex ideas. I think a lot of us were also itching for more practical conversations to complement the highly theoretical material we got into. It's inevitable that you begin to think about your own consumption practices and the practices of those around you; perhaps it would be interesting to have a practical component to the class, in which the group takes on some sort of project aimed at altering consumption within the community, or developing an alternative model to the way people spend time\/money\/resources.",
    "The method of cutting the class down in size.",
    "Huge demand for course and lots of people weren't able to take it. curriculum needs more coursework like it- students would take them!",
    "The course is good overall"

    "This course definitely prepared me to transition from my master's program to a PhD program. I have a new perspective on research and will incorporate much of what I learned into my dissertation research and writing.",
    "A course like this should be required for all MEM's. Very difficult to drive towards sustainability without understanding consumption on some level.",
    "This course is so important for understanding behavior and change. I'm an educator, really interested in how to access people and influence behavior through education; interested in the connection between personal practice, environmental degradation, and injustice. The class is extremely informative and gave me new lenses through which to understand why we live the way we live, and it also provided some hopeful frameworks and examples for thinking about transformation. I love that this class moved past goals of incremental change and asked radical questions about the norms that govern our most mundane actions. It is unique at FES and should become a mainstay!",
    "i've taken no class more important to my course of study. it has helped more than any other class to structure my work.",

    "It sounded interesting and I had heard good things about Professor Schor.",
    "Initially, I petitioned for this course to be offered (and for Julie to be invited back as a visiting professor) because Karen Hebert was going on leave and, with her, the one course devoted to discussing questions of consumption and commodification would be absent for the year. I have long been preoccupied with questions of why people (particularly Americans) consume the way they do, why waste is so acceptable, why aspirations to affluence are so strong and so materially oriented, why we live alone and all of our OWN things--essentially, why the American Dream is shaped the way it is and how hugely that determines not only the environmental damage that we cause but also the social and economic ills that we perpetuate. It was so helpful to begin with Bourdieu, and to think about our practices from deeply structural points of view, and to struggle from there to try to envision paths to transformation. It was the best course I have taken while at FES",
    "Because I am abnormally interested in trash, and trash is the end product of consumption.",
    "This is a very unique course that ties together many of the topics related to new economic models, consumption, and trade policies.",
    "I think sustainability and consumption are the topics that concern our current society"

    "Yes.",
    "I don't know what I expected. Our investigation into consumption was much deeper and much more methodical than I had anticipated. Julie really intelligently lays out the syllabus and brings us through the literature and the conceptual labyrinth in a logical way. She also had a nice way of keeping her cards close to her chest at the outset and really pushing us to stay focused on the readings and the weekly discussion even if we were aching to jump into questions of \"but how do we make change!?\" as a result, we were better equipped to talk about change when we got to the end of the semester. ultimately, the pace was very thoughtful, Julie is an excellent professor, and the effort of earlier conversations paid off.",

    "This is a seminar course--the reading load is heavy, but, in general, the readings are great. Julie often gave us a guide for how to prioritize the readings if we were strapped for time, and I would encourage students to heed that advice or ask her, honestly, for a way to prioritize if it gets to be too much. Ideally, do all of the reading--it's worth it, but, for me at least, it was not the kind of material that could be skimmed.ALSO, form a discussion group outside of class to keep going with the conversation. Our in-class discussions often remained theoretical and academic; if you want to get personal and explore on-the-ground experience and applications of ideas, form a breakfast club, or an evening discussion group, and get it going! This conversation is so so important.",
    "Keep up with the reading. Hang in there when the conversation gets weird.",
