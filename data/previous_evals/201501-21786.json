    "DS Philosophy tracks the history of philosophical thought from Descartes to the early 20th century. I would definitely recommend to anyone with an interest in philosophy or intellectual history.",
    "Second semester DS is (content-wise) much better than first semester in my opinion. There are more ideas in philosophy that may be confusing, but in the end they are worth delving into and exploring.",
    "Yes because it provided a solid overview of modern philosophy.",
    "Wonderful!!",
    "I would recommend this class to other students.",
    "Would recommend to another student interested in the subject matter. Workload would be a serious consideration.",
    "Professor Franks is fantastic for the Spring semester. He is an expert of philosophers leading up to Kant and German ideology, which carries you through the most difficult parts of the syllabus. His style is more lecturing, which is great for knowledge absorption. This style is weaker for learning how to build up the arguments yourself. However, hopefully, you practiced that part in the Fall and through the papers."
