   "comments": [
    "Yes, it's not for everyone but if you're looking for a different class with interesting assignments it's a great course.",
    "It's not a gut. In fact, I may have accidentally\/unintentionally put more work into this class than any other this semester, but it did not feel like hard work because it was interesting stuff -- and not the kind of stuff you can bullshit. I'm a psych major, and psych classes tend to blom onto one another and repeat material, so it's easier to slack in those classes. Here, everything was new (copyright law, etc.). It's interesting and unlike any course I've ever taken at Yale. While it's not a gut, however, Brad makes it clear that everyone usually ends up getting at least a B+.",
    "It's great. Not much work, Brad is really entertaining, and if you put in a little effort you'll get a good grade.",
    "Very different from any other course at Yale. Brad does warn you on the first day that he's unconventional to say the least (the words he used were \"batshit crazy\", but if you can deal with that then you'll definitely have a good time. If you're not a cs major or prelaw then you may feel a little out of the loop sometimes, but it's still worth it.",
    "Awesome class! Definitely go to the first one and see Brad's teaching style: it's not for everyone. That being said, if you can learn in an environment as crazy as this one, you'll have a terrific time doing so and not realize how much you've learned in the process.",
    "Amazing class, take it",
    "Fun and entertaining, learned a lot about internet culture, not structured",
    "It's very different from any Yale class you'll ever take. It may be the best thing ever or it may not be for you. But try it out!",
    "Take it! Such a fun way to learn really important material for the 21st century.",
    "Only take it if you like brad. The material is great, he is not, perhaps",
    "I recommend, if you're a certain type of person. SHOP this class before choosing to take it. Like half my friends who shopped with me were immediately turned off. I loved it, and stayed. Great choice.In your class, don't do another music video cover please.",
    "CPSC 183 is a great class and very relevant in today's world. Anyone who has ever watched a video on YouTube or has a Facebook account should take it. Even if you're not interested in technology or the law or even want to sit through Brad's very loud and \"bat-shit crazy\" teaching for an entire semester, the various topics and issues covered in the class are great to be aware of as our world continues to depend more and more on technology.",
    "CPSC was a great course. Brad does a good job making the class interactive and fun. He says it isn't for everyone, but I really find it hard to believe that someone would prefer a boring lecture to this class.",
    "You'll love it or hate it. The only way to know is to go to the first two lectures during shopping period.",
    "This is a life changing class that should be taken by every student. you don't need experience with law or technology, you should take it, and if you put in some work you will truly fall in love.",
    "A fascinating class. If you're interested in technology or law, then this is a perfect class to take. We cover tons of interesting material, Brad is eccentric to the max (but in a good way - mostly), and there isn't too much work.",
    "1) TAKE IT. It's fun and interesting and unlike any other class.2) Don't take it cr\/d. You won't understand lectures if you don't do the readings and you'll have to take the difficult midterm anyway. Also he's a nice grader. So taking it cr\/d eliminates all the good things and creates bad things.3) be ready to put in a little more effort than you do for most classes. Like, actually do the readings. They'll take maybe 2 hours. Not that bad.4) Brad will take you out to dinner with the restof the class as much as you're willing to go. Take him up on it! Your participation grade will thank you.",
    "I would recommend this class for computer science students who want to learn more about the legal repercussions of their work.",
    "I'd recommend the class. It's fun, not much work, and you learn a little bit about the law.",
    "Brad is really cool and really knows his stuff. Class is really engaging and doesn't feel like a lecture at all. Really teaches you the material without making it seem dry. The only thing is that the course is a bit unstructured. But Brad tells you this beforehand, so it's your own fault if this is the reason you dislike the course. Didn't really bother me. Also, grading for reading responses can seem kind of arbitrary at times.",
    "This class is fantastic. It's so fun, and you actually do manage to learn things along the way. The reading isn't absolutely essential, but it's interesting to do anyway. And the discussions in class are fascinating and entertaining, supplemented by Brad's legendary rants and tangents. This is one of those classes that every Yale student should take at some point.",
    "Of course! The course is fun and fascinating and good for anyone who is just generally curious about current events and discussion.",
    "Make sure you know FOR SURE that you like this class. As Brad has continually warned, the first few lectures are very indicative of the rest of the year.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student, yes",
    "I got my grade for the midterm on December 5th. Not only that, but they emailed me the wrong grade, and I got a nasty surprise at the end of the semester (also, there is no way to prove that the grade was intended for me, since they just sent an email. How they can screw something so elementary up is beyond me, I mean we pay $23000+ a semester). This pretty much sums up the \"back-end\" of the course -- grades are returned woefully slowly and somebody there doesn't know how to do their job. The class content is fun and good, and I did learn a lot, but my holiday was spoiled by the administrative parts of this course, so make sure what you get back from them (if you ever do) is actually correct.",
    "Take it! Most unique class at yale",
    "Yes!",
    "Take this class! Brad brings cupcakes to every class for people who talk in class (but everyone can get some at the end), he randomly shows YouTube videos to prove his point, and if you stay back long enough you can go get sushi with him. I would definitely recommend getting to know Brad, because he is just so cool and has a lot of interesting things to say.This can be a great fifth class. It's definitely the class I looked forward to the most every week, and that I never missed. One time, he showed us a whole episode of South Park in class.Some may call this class a gut, but I think you still need to work to get a good grade in it. You need to do well on the issue-spotter midterm, do enough work on the project, and know enough of the readings to participate and say smart things in the class discussion.",
    "I would recommend this class for a fellow student because it teaches life lessons among academic information.",
    "Take this class! At the very least, go to the first day to see if you can handle the instructor. He is very unique.",
    "I would recommend this course."
