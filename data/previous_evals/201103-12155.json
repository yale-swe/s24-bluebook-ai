   "comments": [
    "Excellent overview of research methodology through the lens of clinical psychology.",
    "Stress-free class with a great professor! Take it for your research methods requirement, all you psych majors!",
    "If one needs the requirement take it sure.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class if you're choosing between different research methods classes.",
    "Take it with Kazdin - it's a pretty boring topic but if you have to take it for a requirement he makes it as interesting as it can be with jokes and stories.",
    "I would summarize this course as a basic intro to clinical research that focuses more on if you understand the concept and practice of ideas than the basic definition. I would definitely recommend this course to other students, particularly those who may want a research methods class where they don't have to work with rats\/animals but can still have interesting and thoughtful discussions about how to properly create and run experiments.",
    "for research methods, take this one",
    "The material for this class is very boring and repetitive, but the work load is not too intense. There are two exams and two papers and a participation grade, but the exams and papers are manageable.",
    "If you are taking this course, it is probably because you are a psych major and need a research methods course requirement taken care of. That being said, Kazdin is great and is always willing to impart his humor to the class. Lectures tended to be relatively short and entertaining. Two papers and two exams (last exam on the last day of class, so none during finals week, which helps to get one final out of the way!) so although you will do plenty of reading and work for the course, it's not too bad of a workload. Chances are you need to take it anyway, so take it with Kazdin!",
    "Straightforward class. Clear lectures. Professor Kazdin makes lectures fun and interesting. You learn what to consider when designing a study--everything from validity to assessment to measurement to ethical issues. 2 long papers, 1 midterm, 1 final--all fair and not too bad.",
    "Pretty easy course. Must do the reading, but it's not bad once you know what you should focus on.",
    "Great Research Methods course, even if you are not interested in clinical psychology. I learned quite a bit about validities, how to question studies, and to think critically. Highly recommended to any Psych major, the workload is more than manageable, and Kazdin is great\/gives a compelling lecture.",
    "I would recommend this course to other psych majors. Professor Kazdin is a funny and engaging lecturer, and you will learn a lot from the class as long as you are willing to do the readings, because there is frequently very little overlap between the readings and the lectures (which often makes the lectures more enjoyable).",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student, especially a psychology who's interested in clinical psychology.",
    "The subject matter, while important, isn't really enough to keep the class interesting or engaging for a whole semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for the research methods requirement because the material focuses on information that can be extended to almost all disciplines. If Alan Kazdin is teaching it, all the better.",
    "Psych 250 is a great way to fulfill the Research Methods requirement. Professor Kazdin is a great, engaging lecturer, which makes the material interesting. The workload is reasonable, and the papers allow you to apply the material of the course.",
    "I recommend this course if you're interested in an overview of research methods but aren't entirely interested in conducting research yourself in the future. You will walk away informed, but not overwhelmed. It's a great way to satisfy the major requirement.",
    "This class is really helpful in helping you tear apart scientific studies, looking at critical components that experimental designs may be lacking that make them less convincing. This class is not focused on hands on practice of designing actual experiments and carrying them out, but rather the theoretical basis of how designs should be (minus the more statistical stuff\u0097that should be learned elsewhere). I think taking the time to understand the concepts fully before jumping in to conduct experiments is very important, which is why I think this class should be taken in conjunction with the normal research methods class (if you plan to do research later on, taking more than one research methods class is highly highly recommended). There are two exams and two 10-15 page papers, all of which are quite fair.",
    "This is a very good research methods class. Not much work, but you still learn a lot about clinical research. Professor Kazdin is interesting and fun and often ends class early (which is a nice break from a hectic schedule).",
    "If you have to take a Research Methods class and you're remotely interested in Clinical Psychology, take it with Professor Kazdin! He made a dry course interesting by discussing numerous experiments and his own work throughout the semester.",
    "I enjoyed this class much more than I expected to, given how dry the subject material can be. Professor Kazdin's lectures are what made the class worth it, and if you just read the textbook and don't come to class, you'll be missing out majorly. His quirky, deadpan sense of humor is great.That said, I did find the course to be quite difficult, particularly because it's so difficult to study\/review for the exams, given the sort of stream-of-consciousness way the textbook is written. Additionally, be warned that the grading is very old-fashioned---don't expect anything higher than a B on your papers unless your work is OUTSTANDING."
