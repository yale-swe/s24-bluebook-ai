    "A wonderful experience that is extremely worthwhile, but not necessarily a completely thorough grounding in the topic.",

    "The engagement with the psalms was wonderful, and my final paper taught me a LOT about something that I had had no experience with whatsoever before. So, very useful in that respect! While not closely related at all to my primary research interests, the course definitely gave me a very meaningful experience with an area of the field that I needed to know something about.",
    "This course did give me some references and techniques to use when talking about medieval music. I imagine that it will have little impact on my research.",
    "Exposure to the liturgy, and to its beauty. I'll need to do a little more reading to build my foundation, but the roots of that foundation are there thanks to this course."
