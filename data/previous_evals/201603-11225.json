    "Having taken calculus in my senior year of high school, the first few weeks of Math 112 were a very strange kind of review. These weeks were strange because despite having previously learned several of the concepts, they were taught in a way that I found extremely abstract and theoretical (examples being worked out on the board are not very common). The class for the entire semester was my most difficult not only because I myself am not mathematically inclined, but also because I was not accustomed to the teaching style at all. As for the second half of the semester, the concepts became easier to understand despite now being foreign (e.g. direction fields and optimization) because I learned how my role as student is far from what I expected. The class sessions themselves are more for clarification and answering questions, while the actual learning is done outside of class by the student, who is expected to read the textbook before doing the WebAssigns and the Problem Sets. Having never read a mathematics textbook, I was incredibly confused by all of the unfamiliar jargon and labyrinthine notation, but I gradually became accustomed to the ebb and flow of the text (I reccommend searching for patterns in the notations they provide if they are similar, but different in certain ways).",
    "I learned nothing at all in this course. I attended every single class and was not taught anything from the professor in class time. His office hours was horrible as well. The was incapable of teaching someone the material at hand.",
    "basic calculus",
    "I learned a lot of math.",
    "Many basic Calculus skills were learned in this course.",
    "I brushed up on and further developed my skills in Calculus. This was a much harder course than my AB Calculus course in high school.",
    "I had taken a long break from calculus, so this course was both helpful in reviewing older material and introducing me to new material, but in a university setting. I liked the focus on problem solving with real world applications, and the focus on the process of reaching an answer, rather than the actual answer to a question.",
    "I learned how to find derivatives, solve optimization, related rates, and integration problems, find limits, use L'Hospital's rule, and linear approximations.",
    "I learned more about calculus I and how to solve different problems.",
    "I got a better knowledge in basic Mathematics and feel so much more prepared now to take higher level courses.",
    "I gained development of my knowledge and skills with calculus, as well as improvement in my problem solving skills (I.e. dealing with word problems that require critical thinking).",
    "I feel like I learned a good amount of calculus, but I am leaving the class with a lot of information that I still do not understand or I wasn't fully taught.",
    "I learned critical thinking skills in regards to calculus. Instead of just memorizing formulas, this course required us to work thoughtfully through a problem, and oftentimes mix different concepts together. Additionally, this course helped me to learn proofs. My learning was enhances by knowing the reason behind calculus theorems.",
    "I developed my skills of computing math problems without the use of a calculator. Along with my skills of better understanding math concepts.",
    "This course taught me to more thoroughly analyze problems and search for their solutions on my own rather than simply memorizing equations and methods for solving.",
    "Basic calculus",
    "I learned more about mathematics at college and that it is very different from ways of teaching mathematics in high school. I also acquired better skills in writing down detailed explanations for my answers, which is always more challenging than one would expect"

   "comments": [
    "I managed to learn a surprising amount of information in a rather short period of time about calculus, as well as actually being fascinated by some of the concepts (which for me is uncommon in mathematics). It was made clear in the vast majority of the concepts taught that these methods held importance in the real world; for example, maximums and minimums are able to be found by where the derivative of a function is equal to 0 and the total distance traveled by a vehicle can be found by the integral of its velocity curve, which turns out to simply be the area under the curve. However, I struggled for a much longer time than was healthy, and this could have been avoided by taking advantage of office hours and peer tutoring, but also by somewhat shifting the teaching style to be more accessible to students, especially since Math 112 is presented as the option of choice for students who have no background in calculus.",
    "The professor was a horrible professor and the math department much not at all helpful when I tried to get extra help. There are no strengths in this course and I would not recommend it to anyone. They assign unproductive WebAssigns that do not make sense.",
    "This course should just focus on calculus and its tools- instead, instructors and exams focus too much on meanings behind formulas- which just confuses students more",
    "It was a good class, but you need to put in a lot of work and effort just to do decent because the midterms were hard.",
    "The weaknesses are the unplanned review sessions, and how the material on the test was not exactly up to the level of how it was taught in class. The strengths is that my teacher worked really hard in making sure everyone understood the topics and all the topics that needed to be taught were.",
    "Math is difficult for a lot of people to understand. I think the department tries their best to accommodate students with the grading system. It was helpful to have so many peer tutors and office hours available... I think it'd also be helpful to have more one on one tutors available though.",
    "I don't think using webassign and the textbook to teach lessons before they are covered in class is necessarily the most effective way for students to learn. Many other students and I found this method frustrating, but I thought how Lake made his packets for each class was effective and helpful for me to understand topics. It definitely was possible for me to skip or not understand a textbook chapter but still come to class and be able to learn what I missed. The packets were also helpful when completing homework. The course also had lots of opportunities to get extra help, such as private\/peer tutoring and many available office hours. Problem sets and exams definitely would have felt much tougher without this help.",
    "The teaching isn't very engaging, but the professor always made sure no one was struggling and provided ways for students to get help if they needed it.",
    "I strongly believe my teacher should have explained problems in class more often",
    "It would have been better if we had more class hours.",
    "Th course needs to assign some class problems and go over them. Too often, we receive anonymous feedback about our problem sets that most students do not look at.",
    "This class is mostly self taught. Dont expect any lectures on material mostly just practice in class. this could be improved more lecture time on topics would have been helpful.",
    "The strength of this course was the multiple resources available to enhance learning. This was vital because of the weakness of the course: the fact that classes were more proof-based than problem-based. I would have learned better by seeing or working through example problems than watching the professor lead us through a proof. It would have been more valuable for me to do the proof on my own time. Nonetheless, the peer tutors and office hours were very helpful.",
    "I would say a weakness is that sometimes the professor didn't explain certain concepts thoroughly and relied on more self learning from the book.",
    "It was often hard to focus and I felt like I was learning from the worksheets and not the actual teacher. I also think some of the problem sets were too difficult and long for the level of math we were in.",
    "Strengths: I am a problem solver and good at critical thinking Weaknesses: I am bad at remembering equations and rules.",
    "Applying the siills learned to the types of questions on the exams. They could be practiced",
    "A strength is the support of the people teaching the couse and the constant workload. The content of the course could have been taught in a more interesting way.",
    "I didn't like the structure of this class. I was constantly clueless and I heavily relied on the tutoring services. If I didn't get tutoring or attend office hours regularly, I would've done VERY POORLY in this class. I struggled the entire semester. I thought we had a lot of WebAssign problems to do between Tuesday and Thursday. I think we should have worked through more examples in a systematic way. I think we should've learned a lesson in class before doing homework for that lesson, not vice versa."

    "I would reccommend this course for students who are majoring in STEM fields or who need this class as a prerequisite. As for my fellow social sciences and humanities majors, perhaps economics or statistics are both more fitting in relation to their perspective career paths (and for me would most likely be easier). However, I suspect that certain concepts learned in Math 112 may actually make economics or statistics easier. More generally for anyone taking Math 112, the textbook is essential for knowing what is happening in class and for passing the midterms and the final exam. The textbook will at first be very difficult to understand, but with time the foreign notation will become more familiar.",
    "Absolutely not. This course was horrible and unproductive. There was no learning, teaching, or attentiveness by the math department or professors. They gave students basically no resources but expected them to now an insane amount of knowledge and make insane conceptualizations when they do not even teach the information.",
    "If you need a math credit and have HS calculus background knowledge, great easy class to take.",
    "Yeah I think most majors require some sort of calculus.",
    "Yes, because iy learn the basics needed for all other math courses.",
    "I'd only recommend this course if it's a requirement. If you're good at math, try and take a higher level class, if you're not good at math, just be prepared to spend a lot of time trying to grasp the concepts...this course is more difficult than your high school Calc AB class, so if you struggled in that class, you will struggle even more in this one.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student if they have prior background knowledge of calculus. It is possible to do well without much background, but it takes much more effort and time, since much of your learning will be done from the textbook.",
    "I would only recommend it if the student has a strong foundation in calculus.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who needs it for their prereqs.",
    "If you haven't taken calculus before, this class is going to be much more challenging for you than for the rest of the class. There will be students in the class who have taken AP Calculus AB and BC in high school and will be in the same class as you. I recommend only taking it if you have to. If you didn't like math in high school, this class probably isn't going to change your mind. If you do have to take this class, it does provide you with plenty of resources if you need them. There are peer tutors and a lot of office hours. You will understand math as long as you try.",
    "If you are afraid of taking high level Mathematics courses, then you should definitely start with this one. I think it is a very good preparation for higher level Mathematics classes at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who needs to take an intro calc class. I didn't find the content riveting, but I'm also not incredibly interested in math - and the course gave me the calc background I needed.",
    "If they are good in math i would because it doesn't have a large workload but if you are not a strong test taker do not take this class because 55% of your grade will be one or two tests",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It improves critical thinking skills and is good for acclimating to a heavier workload. It improves time management skills.",
    "I think this was a solid course in one variable calculus that is great for anyone who needs a strong base.",
    "No, it was unnecessarily difficult.",
    "I would only recommend this course to students who enjoy math and figuring things out on their own. Make sure you put in the work and it will be a manageable course.",
    "Yes, it is a good introductory course.",
    "I would only recommend this course to students that require it for their major. One does not learn any additional, important information for life, so it is not very useful for people who do not necessarily need to take it.",
    "I guess I'd recommend this class because it's a requirement for upper-level classes in many departments. However, I honestly wasn't a fan and I didn't like coming to class everyday. If you have trouble with math, you're going to have to put in A LOT of work to understand concepts."
