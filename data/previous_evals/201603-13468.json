    "We learned a lot of basic and somewhat advanced topics in time-series econometrics that are fascinating in their own right. I suspect most people in the class were in it for the \"financial\" aspect, but the material is important as just general econometric and data analysis techniques. The theory and application is pretty interesting.",
    "Lots of econometric techniques, like GARCH, splines, and MCMC",
    "Great course for time series analysis! The prof is very knowledgeable and at the forefront of the field. Good structure as well, students are required to do a presentation and that really help learn the material!"

   "comments": [
    "We learned a lot of really interesting topics in time-series econometrics; the strength is Professor Chen, who is extremely friendly, understanding, and of course knowledgable. The only weakness I would say is that the programming component in R is a bit difficult if you don't have any experience because the documentation for econometric packages doesn't have as much support online. But all in all, it was a good mix of theory and applications, with very reasonable work expectations.",
    "The class was really responsive to students' interests and went at a good pace. As far as weaknesses, maybe explain the techniques' applications in more detail",
    "I think the textbook chosen is excellent. I wish there were more R-example and basic lesson on how to handle time series data. Being able to see the code behind the prof's paper would also be cool"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Professor Chen (and also Professor Kitamura, so maybe the econometrics professors) is one of the best professors I've had at Yale. You learn a lot of theoretical and applied time-series econometrics, which is a natural extension after 136. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in powerful math\/econometric tools for data analysis, not just for people interested in finance.",
    "Prof. Chen really cares about what you're interested in learning! Put a lot in, get a lot out.",
    "Absolutely! Please take it! One of the gem at Yale and 400-level class that is actually intellectually challenging! I wouldn't recommend it if you don't already know R though",
    "Learned a lot, but you have to be pretty self-motivated for it to be good."
