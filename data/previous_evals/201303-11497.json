    "A good class if you have a clear idea of what you would like to pursue as a research project. I was hoping there would be a bit more exposure to specific problems in Latin America to give a bit more direction to students when they select issues they want to address over the course of the semester. Not particularly entertaining as a class, but has value if you are interested in researching sustainability issues in Latin America.",
    "It is a very dynamic way to understand what is happening in the field of sustainable development in Colombia specially but replicable to most Latin American countries. Professor Brewer is very good and he invites professors from the university of Los Andes every two weeks to share knowledge with students. The workload is very easy to handle",
    "I would recommend the class only if they like working in groups. Almost the entire class is centered around a large group project and then a couple other smaller group projects. The last assignment is done alone but that is it. I was lucky to have a great group who I enjoyed working with so I liked it, but if you got a group that had trouble working together or finding time to meet, the whole class would be a struggle. I also really enjoyed the different perspective we got from the visiting UniAndes professors and I had an interest in Latin America specifically before coming to the class, so their particular perspective was of interest to me. If you are not interested in Latin America I would say this course may still be interesting because it covers broad topics that are applicable to any country but it helps to care about Latin America, and even to speak spanish. Definitely look at the four main topics on the syllabus before you decide to take the class and make sure they are interesting to you because that is exactly what you will be studying and you can't really stray from those topics. Your group project will also be based on one of those topics so make sure there is on in particular you care about.",
    "Environmental Studies 353 is a great introductory course to issues of business and sustainability in Latin America. I would recommend this course as it provides the opportunity to merge concepts from business and the environment.",
    "Don't go into this course expecting it to be one specific thing. It takes shape depending on the students that are taking it and the speakers that end up coming to talk.I was anticipating a class that was more focused on environment, and while this was a factor, it was more focused on the business side of things. Sort of consulting-ish like. Which wasn't quite my thing. It was a good class, though.It is different from other classes in that is heavily group project based. So, make sure you're ready for that. My group was phenomenal, but working together was still taxing.",
    "It is a cool class if you are interested in latin america. As the syllabus changes every year it's important to check out what exactly the topics are for this semester. In Fall 2013, the class revolved around issues of organizational management and the nonprofit and development sectors. If you are not specifically interested in the specific themes, do not take the class.",
    "I would recommend this class. The subject was interesting, practical and theoretical, and the workload was not too great. The final project was a lot of fun and a positive group-work experience. Get to know your classmates--it's an interesting group. For the group project, I would recommend steering your group towards a topic you are interested in. If your team ends up picking something not that interesting, you at least have the chance to explore your own \"problem\" in the individual problem proposal."
