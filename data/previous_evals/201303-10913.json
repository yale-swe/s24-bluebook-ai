   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class if you have an interest in architecture or art history.",
    "This is a good course if you like architecture and have an interest in learning how to think about it critically and in context, and how to write about it. Perhaps not for those who are not fans of art, architecture, or history. Prof. Sherer is a bit eccentric, though if you go along with it his odd analogies and obvious worldliness can actually help in understanding the buildings and architects discussed. The workload is rather light - two papers and weekly reading responses which you can BS your way through quite easily.",
    "The structure of this class is such that each lecture focuses on one or two specific buildings that represent a larger style or time period. The work load is minimal, and sherer seemed to grade the midterm paper generously. Reading amount is not overwhelming and the responses can be done in less than an hour easily.",
    "ARCH 260 is good survey lecture of architectural history, with a heavy focus on the West. It's a good, but not great course. Architecture majors must take it, but I think with the right mindset you could learn a lot from the course even if you are not pursuing architecture as a major.",
    "Good lecture. Very interesting and you're exposed to all kinds of architecture. If you're interested in architecture at all, it's great.",
    "This class is hugely underrated--it should have had double the number of students this year in it, at least. Dan is an engaging, exciting lecturer. His lecture on Borromini had the entire class on its toes for the entire fifty minutes. The class gives you a lot about architecture with relatively small commitment: reading responses every week, five page paper, and 12 page paper. Take it!!",
    "It is an interesting course if you like to learn about history behind buildings and the culture at the time that they were built. I would recommend it.",
    "I'd recommend it --good overview",
    "An overview of architectural history till the baroque. It's not a traditional survey course - rather, it focuses on one\/two architects\/buildings, but that's something I really enjoyed.",
    "It's clear that Dan knows a lot about architectural history and has a real LOVE for teaching the material. Some people like to slam this course as being dry and something that must be taken as an architecture major, but if you appreciate the fact that you're learning from a very caring person about fascinating buildings, you'll enjoy this class and look forward to lecture. Try not to judge prematurely.",
    "I think that this class can be super interesting if you actually take the time to pay attention and get involved with the material. The readings are completely doable and the workload is composed of simply two papers, a midterm and final one. Professor Sherer is hilarious and makes the class very enjoyable however it is also very easy to zone off if you're not constantly following what he's saying.",
    "The course does give a very good overview of architecture from antiquity to the baroque, as it advertises. If you attend the lectures and do the readings, which you should, you will get quite a bit out of it. But there's just acertain elemental something missing--that spark that just makes you feel really passionate about the subject. Professor Sherer is clearly quite passionate about the subject and speaks very eloquently, but somehow it doesn't all sink into the students. It's very difficult for me to explain exactly what's missing because it seems to be such an intangible quality. But it doesn't yet quite have what it takes to go from a very interesting, informative course to a truly inspiring one.",
    "Take it if you're an architecture major. I think to get the most out of the class you probably need to go to lecture though obviously not necessary for the class. Only two papers and reading responses, pretty relaxed to accomodate studio.",
    "more interesting than I had hoped, and definitely do all the readings, they'll help you later on.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class, unless you have to take it as an architecture major. Sherer is a bit full of himself, tries too hard to be \"interesting,\" and isn't all that accessible. He grades pretty easy, but I feel like I didn't really learn anything. It's a survey course and doesn't go that much in depth, and also isn't that invested in probing theoretical questions. A lot of the readings are more historical \"fun facts,\" and, of course, boring facts. Don't take this unless you have to!!! But if you're an arch major, it's definitely not any work. You can seriously get away with never going to lecture or doing any of the readings, as long as the papers are ok. I'm genuinely surprised that with all the great academics at Yale, this class would suck so badly.",
    "Yes! Even if you're not an architecture major, it's really a great class. The workload is very manageable (short weekly reading responses, a midterm paper and a final paper that can be on the same subject). The subject matter is fun, and the lectures and great and entertaining."
