   "comments": [
    "This class was a really great dive into poetry. I learned a lot both about reading\/analyzing poetry and writing poetry.",
    "I learned about reading and writing poetry.",
    "This course was awesome. It taught me how to read poetry carefully, and use those insights to create my own art every week. It taught me how to workshop the poetry of others, and respond to the feedback others gave me on my own poetry. I developed as both a reader and a writer in this course.",
    "I gained a greater insight into the world of contemporary poetry, as well as the value of non-traditional poetry, particularly in reference to more absurdist techniques. I also gained a lot of insight into what worked and what didn't work in my own poetry, honed my own technique to be more effective, and diversified it as well. The final project in which we wrote about a book of poetry of our choice was also great, as I feel like I learned a lot from close reading another writer.",
    "I learned to write the poetry that I wanted to write and develop my own \"voice.\"",
    "This course forced me to put a new kind of effort into my poetry and look at my work with a more critical eye by giving me legitimate criteria with which to \"judge\" a poem. More than anything else, though, it introduced me to different kinds of writing, both of my peers and of exciting contemporary poets.",
    "I can better understand and analyze poetry as well as write my own poetry."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course had really strong material. The format of the class, with discussions and workshops each week, also worked really well. I really enjoyed the variety of poetry we read, as well as the different writing assignments. The only weaknesses of this course is that we often spent too long on pieces during workshop\/discussion and so didn't cover all the material we planned on.",
    "Lack of structure in class and in assignments. Failure to budget time properly meant that the first person in workshop got much more time than the second person. Also, given that poetry is so subjective, it was difficult for different types of poetry to shine in the class. It was also tough when some students had previous experience writing poetry. Course readings helped some, but since they were mostly one genre of poetry (generally modern, avant-garde poems), it was difficult to learn new styles.",
    "Strengths: Great readings, open discussions, improved almost all my reading\/writing skills in some way or another. Weaknesses: Sometimes pretty intimidating to speak up, or be workshopped, in front of way more experienced writers and poetry readers. However, Professor Gorin and my classmates made it as comfortable as possible, and the workshops were centered around kind comments and constructive criticism.",
    "I think that sometimes the weekly assignments didn't feel super inspired. I wish that maybe they were more involved---at one point Prof Gorin asked if we wanted to be sent on more adventures and I think that could've been beneficial. I also think the small group workshopping didn't really work as when we were tasked with meeting outside of classes many groups didn't meet. I think it would be good to have more regular meetings somehow regulated more closely, and shuffle groups over the course of the semester to encourage bonding within the class. I think that the workshops of this class were really interesting and that Prof Gorin brought up a lot of interesting aspects of people's poems that many people hadn't considered. I also thought discussion of particular poets like Mary Ruefle were really great, and enjoyed a lot of the prose packet reading, even if we didn't get to discussing it in class. Most importantly I wish that this class was smaller! For a workshop it just felt slightly too large to really get to know everyone well---something that can be intensely valuable in a workshop environment. Doing some more poetry writing in class could also be an interesting exercise.",
    "The course's main strength was its integration of poetry appreciation and poetry creation. Its main weakness was that much of what we read outside of class was not discussed in class at all. And there was so much to talk about!",
    "The strengths of this course definitely included being able to learn more about poetry and certain poets that you enjoy. The course was very participation involved which gave students the opportunity to voice their opinions. There weren't very many weaknesses in this course."

   "comments": [
    "I would 100% recommend this course to another student (if it's taught by Professor Gorin). The content is super engaging, and it's pretty much impossible not to become a better writer throughout the time in this class. Professor Gorin is wonderful, the small class size is great, and the discussions and workshops tend to be really insightful and helpful. My only hesitation in recommending this class is if you have frequent writers block- the weekly poetry assignments can be a bit of a challenge on the creativity front.",
    "Depends on what you want to get out of the class. If you already know about poetry, take it and you'll be fine. If you're looking to this class as a way of learning more about poetry, it's probably not the class for you.",
    "I absolutely would -- regardless of major. It was a thoroughly enlightening course that teaches you how to think differently about writing. If you can get in -- take it, you won't regret it.",
    "I think this course is a great introduction into poetry and that the instructor did a wonderful job of closely reading pupils' work and giving insightful feedback. He also seemed dedicated to the class in a way that made the environment positive and supportive. Having taken courses in poetry before, I don't think I took as much away from the class as someone new to the genre might have, but I would still recommend this class to someone eager to try poetry writing out, or who wanted to keep poetry in their life in a low-stress way.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this courseGorin is a talented professor (on the hip-er side) who genuinely cares about his students.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in reading and writing poetry, and I think it works well both for those who have lots of experience and for those who have little experience.",
    "Yes, because it makes you become a better thinker, writer, and analyzer. Writing poetry certainly makes you think in a much deeper and more meaningful way."
