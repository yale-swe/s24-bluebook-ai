    "SHOP ANYTHING ARIEL TEACHES. This was the best class I've taken at Yale. Ariel has a no-nonsense academic philosophy that ensures BS-free, substantive, dynamic discussion without intimidating students into silence. The structure of the class forces you to crystallize your sense of the readings and place them in discussion with each other, which creates a sense of cohesion and forces you to think critically. His writing standards are high, but he breaks essays up into parts and gives you lots of feedback so that you can meet them. Also the readings are accessible and interesting. You can skate by without doing ALL of them, but if you can, you absolutely should. Class discussions are too fun to forfeit just because you have nothing cool to say.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course. It is very well taught, and the readings are really good (if you're willing to do them). One of the very interesting questions it attempts to answer, which I believe makes it a compelling course to take, is: How does the nation state, as a political entity, induce its members to fight and die for its preservation? That is merely a jumping off point, but I think one well worth considering.",
    "This is great if you want to learn about a theme in depth. From theory to case studies I feel like I understand national identity and the age of nationalism much better. However, if you seek insight and depth of knowledge for just one country this course will not provide that because we spent about a week on each case study.",
    "HIST 405J is a course that deals with the operating theories and particular case studies of nationalism. It is a seminar that demands active engagement from its students and an willingness to grapple with tough questions. For students who are looking to clarify and strengthen their writing, I would certainly recommend this seminar. Similarly, to students who are looking for a course that challenges them to place abstract concepts into a real-world framework, I would direct them to this course.",
    "Emergence of a Nation-State was the most impactful course Ive taken at Yale and changed the way I think. From abstract discussions on the malleability of ideology to concrete case studies of Siam and the Confederacy, the course material engaged with frameworks that Ive found myself applying to a broad spectrum of issues beyond national formation. The professor asked the most thought-provoking questions and led discussion seamlessly, constructively incorporating every students comment, while also sharing his own remarkable insights. Ultimately, I believe I am now better positioned to make sense of historical as well as current events, and think this class would push the intellectual boundaries of any student.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's really interesting, the readings are great and especially if you're a history or polisci major you'll find the ideas and writers appearing again and again in other classes, so you'll have a much more nuanced understanding of many other courses after this one. Professor Ron is excellent, a good discussion leader and a fair grader. The assignments are thick and fast but mostly very short so don't expect this course to be an insane workload. The papers are relatively short and not hard to write but difficult to write well, be prepared to put in plenty of time to polish a couple of good ideas into an actually good paper. But having multiple commented drafts helps massively with this.",
    "This class was a great, low-key history seminar. It offers the opportunity to more firmly grasp the concept of nationalism and the nation through both a theoretical and case study lens, so it will be a very useful class for anyone planning to write their thesis on developing nationalisms or the nineteenth century. The theories of nationalism discussed also have interesting implications for today. It's a very worthwhile and highly recommended course!",
    "Take this with Ariel Ron. You will learn a tremendous amount and become a better writer."
