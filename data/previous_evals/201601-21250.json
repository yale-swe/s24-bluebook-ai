   "comments": [
    "Take Econ 111 if you took 110 in the fall. Don't be a hero and try make the transition from the micro lecture to 111, just don't do it. That said I loved 111 and if you meet the criteria outlined above take 111, you'll love it! And if Hawkins is still around, get into his class!",
    "Econ 111 is a good intro class. It's better than the lecture because it's easier to ask questions in detail when you're in a smaller class. The workload is reasonable. The midterm is fair. The curve however is brutal because most of the people in the class know what they're doing so the curve is just crazy. That being said, I don't sense a competitive environment in the class (everybody is really nice and I always see people helping each other. That being said the curve is competitive.) I definitely recommend taking if you're the kind of student who thrives in a smaller class with a slightly competitive environment.",
    "A comprehensive, but still deep, overview of key macroeconomic principles for first year students. Highly recommended for Economics and non-Economic majors alike. Certainly a harder course grade-wise given that the class is self-selecting. But the seminar environment just has increasing returns in terms of learning material right the first time.",
    "The smaller size of this class is a definite benefit to your understanding of macroeconomics. Because there are less students, there is a lot of in class opportunity to ask questions, discuss difficult topics, and get clarification that is needed. In comparison to the lecture, this class does seem more comprehensive, which can be a little intimidating, but very good for an expansive foundational understanding of macroeconomics.",
    "Econ 111 is a good course for learning macro, at least if you have Professor Hawkins. You definitely learn the material a lot better than you would in the lecture course, but it is stressful to be always on the edge about being on the right side of the distribution. Professor Hawkins had a great sense of humor that made the information accessible and enjoyable to learn.",
    "Econ 111 is a great introductory course for macroeconomics. We learned a bunch of different models of the macroeconomy and I came out of the course with a much better handle over economics as a whole. I would very much recommend this to any other student.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, because it provides information that is really important when considering the development of the world and it's nation. I a would warn my fellow student that. Because the teaching is of such high quality, there is a down curve on midterms and final exam."
