   "comments": [
    "Take it as an intro econ course",
    "A good foundational (standard) macroeconomis class.",
    "A great class for anyone who wants to understand how the economy works on a macro level. A little faster and more challenging than the lecture, but completely worth it. Definitely take it if you have the slightest interest in economics.",
    "I would definitely recommend Macro 111 to another student. In contrast to Micro, I would stay Macro better enables you to make sense of the economic and financial events happening globally today. Instead of just presenting current macro debates in a very surface qualitative way, the course introduces you to economic models in a way that is practical and useful--and in a way that Macro doesn't. Professor Simons is great--the midterm was challenging, but graded fairly by her, and I'll most definitely miss her uniquely self-deprecating humor and \"straight-talk.\"",
    "Econ 111 provides a good, basic foundation for macroeconomics. The seminar setting makes the class more engaging and easier to learn, and Professor Simons is an interesting lecturer who draws on her experience in the public sector and current events to explain concepts. However, the midterm and final exams are somewhat difficult and the review sessions weren't very helpful. Take this class for the seminar setting, but be prepared to know the concepts in-depth for the exams.",
    "It wasn't necessarily the most interesting and exciting class every, but you'll learn the basics of how markets and trade operate. The course follows the textbook exactly so it's easy to follow along. Psets weren't too bad, due about every two weeks and Professor Simon is really helpful and easily reached by email.",
    "Although it was harder than the lecture, you will definitely learn more if you take the seminar over the lecture. The workload wasn't bad as problem sets were not difficult. The professor is interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is planning on majoring in Econ or wants to take into Macro. I would definitely take this over the lecture, especially if you are someone who likes to ask questions in class.",
    "It was an interesting intro to macro course. The lectures were super useful and I liked the \"buzz groups\" exercises we would do to make sure we understood what we had just learned. Simons is great; she's really funny and knowledgeable. The concepts are interesting and it isn't too hard to get, especially if you think about the problem sets carefully and do them well.",
    "Econ 111 is a very rewarding course and goes very in depth in Intro Macro, but be prepared for a difficult class and to work hard. I would definitely recommend it, because I think it is worthwhile, and you will probably be better prepared if you want to take more courses in Macro.",
    "more interesting than macro, less hard math based. way more intersting.",
    "Econ 111 was a seminar environment, a great alternative if you have trouble learning in the huge lectures. A good intro course to macroeconomics, much easier than micro",
    "I would recommend this course only to students who plan on using Econ for prerequisites for their majors.",
    "It was great, I would recommend it",
    "The lecture course probably would not have taught as much but I heard their curve was much more forgiving and even generous. If you are serious about being an Econ major and learning more take the semina but it's probably similar to the lecture.",
    "I think that Econ 111 is a great alternative to the large Macro lecture. It gives you the chance to get to know your professor and the other students in the class. Additionally, I learn more effectively in a smaller class setting, and for that reason, I also appreciated being able to take this class instead of the lecture. Another benefit of this class is that the teacher will notice if you skip class, this definitely helped me avoid being lazy and skipping like I would have if I had been in the lecture series.One thing to consider before taking this class is that the seminar version attracts more of the Pre-Wall Street types, and the curve is significantly harder than the lecture series. Also, based on conversations that I have had with friends in the lecture, the course material for the seminar is much more difficult than the material for the lecture.That said, I feel like I was able to effectively learn all of the material, and the seminar is able to cover more material than the lecture. Overall, I would absolutely recommend the seminar to anyone who is serious about learning about Econ."
