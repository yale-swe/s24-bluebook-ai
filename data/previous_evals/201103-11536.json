    "I would take it if you were interested in policy-making - more in praxis than in theory.",
    "Go to the first class -- if you are annoyed by the lack of focus and the propensity for unsubstantiated discussion, don't take it -- it doesn't get better. However, Dr. Shaker is very nice and helpful, and I know that some people really enjoyed it -- so shop it and see if it's for you.",
    "Prof. Shaker is a very interesting personality, but the class itself goes in circles. There is not much continuity from lecture to lecture and some of the readings were redundant. Class discussion often turned into Israel-Palestine arguments which made it tough to learn anything about the rest of the region.",
    "This class won't teach you much. If you want to sit around discussing the Middle East and hear from a woman who has had some awesome expereinces as a diplomat, you might sort of enjoy it. But if you actually seek to learn something, or better understand the region, you won't actually learn anything new.",
    "Great course if you want an interactive approach to learning conflict resolution. Shaker is really sweet--but be aware that the class can be biased. If you take this into account, you can get a lot out of the readings and her own personal experiences.",
