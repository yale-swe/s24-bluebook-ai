   "comments": [
    "Strengths- covers a lot of topics, engaging class discussion, etc. Weaknesses- sometimes it can be a little dry, but that mostly comes from lack of engagement with the course",
    "I feel like we should have had more time to read Tschick, then we would all be able to read all of it and have a better understanding of the book's story. Also, having e-mail partners is not the best idea, because it's not only confusing, but also difficult if your partner does not reply timely. Other than that, I feel like the course was strong. Watching the news in the beginning of every class was also helpful to get things started every morning."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It's a good way to improve your german, and the seminar style intimacy of the class makes it easier to talk and feel confident talking in class.",
    "Yes, I would. I went into the course expecting it to be slightly boring. However, Patrick made the course enjoyable and I improved my skills in German by much more than I expected. Replying to e-mail partners was kind of annoying, especially since we were always confused about what to do in those e-mails, but other than that, I feel like the rest of the workload teaches you something, from reading to speaking or listening. In short, if you want to improve your German skills, I'd recommend this course."
