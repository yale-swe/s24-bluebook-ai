    "The course is great. The only weakness is that the way of learning new vocabulary could be a little more organized. But anyway this course focuses more on grammar and generally being able to understand and speak than just new vocab.",
    "Strengths - small class size, lots of individual attention, expectations are fair, really improve Hebrew Weakness - disorganized at times, difficult, lots of grammar"

Some people including myself complained about the workload at some points, but the actual work isn't that hard and Shiri and all the TAs were very helpful and will answer your questions. I feel like I learned a lot and I really loved everyone in my class -- it was really fun.",
    "Yes definitely! The Hebrew program is probably one of the best language programs at Yale. There is so much support.",
    "Yes - it is a good class to take if you want to improve your Hebrew"
