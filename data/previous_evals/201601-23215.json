   "comments": [
    "I would really recommend this class for anyone who is interested in learning more about China, whether they know much about the country or not. I have been studying Chinese for fifteen years and even then learned more about the Chinese language and its historical significance through this class. I believe students without much Chinese background stand to benefit from the class by being exposed to China's challenges and tensions with its neighbors, and those of us who have background in China can still learn a lot from Professor Tsu, who is very knowledgeable.",
    "A class looking at what is the Chinese identity, how was it shaped by history, and how is it manifested in the current issues of a global China. Absolutely fascinating (for someone obsessed with China) but definitely not a typical survey class, won't teach you the complete history of China. The last unit, for example, on imitation in Chinese art totally blew my mind. You don't need to be familiar with Chinese history or language. Moderate amount of reading every week, mostly all very interesting (some novels too!). Several short, painless papers.",
    "I would recommend this class as a perfect 5th class to take CR\/D.",
    "The class could be renamed 'Chinese art and culture in the World.' If soft power and analysis of language, art, culture, and discussion of topics that are not always relevant to China are your bag, go for it. If looking for study\/analysis of the workings of Chinese politics, military, historical and present territorial ambitions, etc... this is not for you.",
    "An overview of Chinese culture and diaspora to various regions of the world, some myth-busting. Basically \"China from the inside perspective... but also the outside perspective.\" Many interesting readings even for someone who is already well-versed in China, but I got the feeling this is more for people with little prior knowledge.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed the course content, and Professor Tsu was incredibly engaging. However, the lack of grading structure of the course left me wondering how I was doing most of the time, and that made it harder to enjoy. The units also occasionally felt unrelated to one another.",
    "Great class. Not a lot of work. Have to attend every lecture. Take this!!",
    "This was a interesting course that covered a range of different topics. It was a little incoherent though, and there was no narrative arc or anything in particular that tied the topics together. The assignments were easy, and not really in communication with each other. I liked the lectures individually, and the professor was great. The speakers she brought in were great too. However, the topics were too random. We spent a lot of time talking about the Vietnam War. This has nothing to do with \"China in the World.\" While the class was pretty random, it had a low workload and the individual lectures were interesting.",
    "Great course, eclectic reading list.",
    "Small lecture involving a lot of discussion, reading articles and books about China and the role it plays in the world, and a few written responses. The workload is reasonable and the lecturers are engaging. The class is very much what you make of it.",
    "A course with minimal work but also not much substance.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in learning the myths behind China's stereotype. It has been one of the most practical classes I have taken at Yale, and has inspired to travel to China. You do not need to speak Chinese. The professor is great - very kind and approachable. Sometimes topics in class can jump around a bit and be a little difficult to follow, but it is not a big problem. The workload is light - just 5 short assignments. The majority of the grade is based on participation in class - so make sure to do the readings. The readings are mostly super interesting and you would want to do them anyway. The professor organizes lots of interesting and relevant speakers to come in to talk, and once we did a joint class with two other classes reading the same novel. There was supposed to be a trip to the MET, but we ran out of time - I'm sure she will try and organize the trip again for the next class though. TAKE THE CLASS!!!",
    "I would summarize it as a nuanced look at the cultural and political history of China from ancient times until now. I would absolutely recommend it to another student. This course was divided into six units and each unit had an assignment. The units allowed us to take a more nuanced look at specific aspects of China while tracking a bigger history. If you don't mind steady reading and work throughout the semester, without any big tests or essay, you will like this course.",
    "Good overview class of China's long history and perception in the world. Great class to take for that reason.",
    "Mandatory sign-in each class. No tests.",
    "China in the World is a great class for anyone who is interested in learning about China as a whole, and gaining a very broad understanding of it. We cover a whole bunch of topics relating to China, tying in its history, language, art, politics, and economics, and it's all very interesting. Professor Tsu is a big academic scholar in the field, and she knows so much, and cares very deeply about this class and her students. However, I would not recommend taking it as a letter grade because of how disorganized the class is--taking this class as Cr\/D\/F would be the best way to go.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student! The material is very interesting and unique, and Professor Tsu is very engaging. My one criticism is the lack of substantive work for this course -- we only had 4-5 short assignments, and no final paper\/midterm. Might have been nice to write a longer paper, as I felt it would have been a rewarding way to end the semester.",
    "Yes I would recommend it."
