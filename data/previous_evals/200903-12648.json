    "This is a class about a theme that is very relevant in American literature and film. It's interesting to learn about the origins of the captivity narratives and see how it has evolved throughout time. You get to read a variety of interesting sources and the discussion is great. As far as seminars go, the reading is not heavy and the paper is relatively short. TAKE IT!",
    "The material is interesting, the instructor is not threatening, and you will learn a lot about various tumultuous periods within American history",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class!I shopped it without knowing whether or not I would take it because I've never thought to study \"captivity.\" Don't be put off by the \"narratives\" part of it. Shop it.This class was a great overview of yes, captivity in narratives but these are not tackled like in for example, English classes, instead they are analyzed and discussed as they constitute a part of American culture\/ideology from colonial times to the present day. A great overview, not too daunting a seminar for someone who simply wants to engage with the topic and be forced to think outside the box about captivity outside from jails, for example.The research paper is left up to you to choose your topic and inevitably, you end up learning a lot about your new interest in \"captivity.\"Professor Rasmussen is very flexible and works with\/engages with different viewpoints and varying levels of familiarity with the subject.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. You learn a lot about colonial America and Native American history, but you also learn a great deal about modern narratives and U.S. wars.",
    "This class is a great look into captivity narratives of the past and present. If you're interested in the history of the African and Native American slave trades this is the class to take, but you'll also get a look into captivity narratives of the present, so I feel like this has something for everyone."
