    "Quite a difficult class with someone with no experience with Irish drama coming in.",
    "This was a selective overview of the Modern Irish Drama canon that emerged after the establishment of the Abbey Theatre in Dublin. I would recommend this class.",
    "Modern Irish Drama was a Yale-in-London study abroad class that sought to analyse the universal themes presented in Irish plays from the time of W.B. Yeats's 1896 Abbey Theatre manifesto to the modern day through the use of themes such as family, language, the role of women, the use of satire and buffoonery, etc. It took a multi-faceted approach to this analysis, involving reading the plays, watching the performances, and discussions afterwards. The professor himself was Irish, and so you could tell how passionate he was not only about the topic, but about getting it right.",
    "Insular topic but still worthwhile.",
    "In this course, you read a lot of Irish plays. The reading isn't overwhelming, but some of the plays are kind of dull. McCrea is also a tough grader and was sometimes difficult to get in touch with.",
    "I really enjoyed Modern Irish Drama. Basically, the class targeted a specificliterary tradition--and frankly one I had never before considered--and explored it in depth. We read a ton of Irish plays, which were more interesting than I expected. You find that there are consistent themes that are really fun to parse out and explore in each work. It was great being able to see some of the plays performed because often find that in drama classes, it is easy to forget that the plays are not just written but actually performed as well. I know some classmates found the themes a bit repetitive, but I didn't share that experience.",
    "Take the class if you like plays"
