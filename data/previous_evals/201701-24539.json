    "Just because someone edits a major publication does not mean that they can teach writing. Roger's course was unplanned, badly managed, expectations were unclear, and had an unclear goal\/metric of success. He had clearly had conversations with Streebeigh and Klinkenborg, tried to adopt the best practices at both, and was unable to do so. I've taken both of the other courses, which were significantly better run and taught. The course struggled for three main reasons. First, the purpose of a course application is to select a cohort of students adequately prepared and interested in the course material. This course had a mixture of ESL and native english speakers with a variety of writing levels and backgrounds. The course struggled to find both a common starting point and a shared meaning of success because of this. The course could have been structured around one-on-one writing\/editing partnerships, which would have offered opportunities for growth to both sets of writers. The second reason the course struggled was that Roger needs a hearing aid. I understand that this may be a complicated issue, but the course cannot be taught again unless Roger is physically capable of hearing class discussions. The third reason this class struggled was because Roger seemed to have given little thought to teaching writing. I would expect that he'd do better at teaching a course that was entirely designed to produce articles acceptable for publication by E360 -- indeed, I think this would be a great course to teach!",
    "Roger is an excellent instructor and I have affirmed my confidence as a writer in his class. I am forever in debt to his tutelage."

Unfortunately, the discussion of them in class (which took significant time) added nothing to the quality of the readings, because we didn't have a common understanding of what was actually worth talking about with regards to readings -- and we didn't have guidance to build this over time, which means that our discussions of the readings continued to be useless. I remember a particular time when someone said that she had nothing to say about the reading - and that the author did a poor job -- because she wasn't interested in whales, so why would she have read it in detail to learn anything about the writing?",
    "His feedback on your papers in the office hours after class",

    "This is really a place for students to learn creative non-fiction writing. And most FES students should learn to write better. It is easy to claim to be a writer, but it is harder to really write something that people read and accept. There's too much grandstanding in the field of environment right now and it mounts to nothing but singing in silos. Frankly, this class ought to be a full semester long. It is better than most classes I've taken at FES..."
