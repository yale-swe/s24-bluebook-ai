    "You should take this class. Preferably after quantum. The labs are doable, fun, and interesting. It is not too much work as you are able to do lab reports together and it is worth a full credit. You should take this even if you are not an intensive major.",
    "You're probably shopping this because you have to take it. It's not bad! This is the best of the lab sequence in the physics major. You only do three labs, one presentation, and have quite a few weeks to write them all up. The labs are really really interesting in their own right and actually make one excited about the results. The TAs are much more experienced and helpful in these labs than they have been in others as well. Lammoreaux is laid back and easy going. As all lab experiences, the class is really fulfilling and exciting if your experiment gives you good data, but depressing and awful if it doesn't.",
    "This is an exciting opportunity to carry out three involved, interesting experiments in modern physics. Unlike previous physics lab classes, you will spend many days on each experiment, giving you an opportunity to delve into more advanced topics and experiments. It is supposed to be closer to what real research is like for graduate students. You will learn a lot and get a good understanding of the underlying physics, and write detailed lab reports. I highly recommend this class, but it does take up a lot of time and the schedule is not flexible (so you might not be able to take other classes that you want to take if you sign up for this). Still, I think anyone who enjoys physics would get a lot out of this class and will be glad to have taken it.",
    "As a second semester senior who needed to take this just to fulfill the intensive BS requirements, I can't say I was looking forward to 3 hours of lab twice a week. However, this was probably the best class I've taken this semester and one of the best classes in the major. This will not only start preparing you for experimental work in grad school, but it will also help you understand a lot of the theories and concepts you learn from the physics core curriculum. If you work efficiently, you probably can finish many of the labs early so that it doesn't eat up all of your M and W afternoons, but at the same time coming to lab rarely felt like a chore. Definitely take it.",
    "My experience of this course was probably not typical, since my lab partner dropped the course and I had to slog through most of it on my own. As a result though, I learned a LOT. One major disadvantage I had at the outset was a lack of ANY Matlab skills. I learned quickly though, which is one valuable takeaway. I imagine that a lot depends on the labs you pick -- I did superconducting Josephson junctions, pulsed NMR, and optical tweezers. With each successive lab, my technique and understanding really improved. Not an easy course by any means, but I'd recommend it if you really want to acquire the lab skills necessary for sophisticated experiment. NB: Whatever your experience withSteve Lamoreaux as a lecturer, he is a fantastic lab instructor! Very patient and almost magical when it comes to fixing experiments.",
    "If you are taking this class, it is probably because you have to, so there is not much to say."
