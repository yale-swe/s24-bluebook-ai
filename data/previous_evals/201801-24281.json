    "Good overview of Soviet history",
    "I learned the basic history of the Soviet Union, from its conception to its fall. The class consistently went over the cultural, political, and foreign policy themes of the various leaders along with the common misconceptions people have of the Soviet Union. The professor would also share personal stories, adding a unique and valuable insight to the course.",

    "Really didn't learn anything! Disappointing history class. I am a history major and was very excited to learn about the Soviet Union in depth, and Wikipedia gave me a better over view",
    "Professor Antonov's lectures were not particularly structured which I enjoyed. He skipped over less interesting areas and emphasized things he takes an interest in, resulting in enthusiastic lectures, which is imperative in a survey course.",
    "Strengths: Professor Antonov has a unique perspective having grown up in the Soviet Union and often shares stories in class. The lectures were interesting. The things I did read also were wonderful! Weaknesses: The reading assigned was overwhelming. I wish there was a way of knowing what to prioritize, as I ended up jumping around and skipping a lot of the readings, which I hate having to do.",
    "Great lectures, but the exams were hard get everything down that you knew in time."

    "No, there are much better history classes offered at Yale and this was highly dissapointing. Not at all what I expected. Really did not learn anything. Professor rambles on and does not describe anything in depth",
    "I recommend it--enthusiastic and funny lecturer. A slightly ambitious syllabus for a history lecture but nothing unreasonable. Reasonable exams and enjoyable assignments",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course. Professor Antonov is a great lecturer and I felt consistently engaged with the material. I was surprised by the lack of direction on our essay assignments (we received single-line prompts for our 2 papers and annotated research bibliography assignments), but perhaps that is only because this was my second history class at Yale. There was also between 500 and 600 pages of assigned reading a week, which seemed like a lot and made it difficult to even start reading. To summarize, I found the material covered fascinating, the lectures engaging, and the reading interesting but too much.",
    "Yes definitely, it is an amazingly taught history of the Soviet Union - a topic that is not as well studied nor have I taken a course at Yale prior to this that has explained the Soviet Union so well.",
    "Yes! One of my favorites.",
    "Yes. Professor Antonov is a knowledgeable and skilled lecturer and the readings are fascinating.",
    "Any student interested in learning about Russia in the 20th century will find this course highly engaging and well taught. I learned a great deal about many aspects of life in the Soviet Union, and definitely came away with an interest in learning more."
