   "comments": [
    "fantastic class - different from other policy courses with a greater emphasis on how to become an effective analyst.",
    "I had hoped this class would be more of an extension of 514, however, throughout the semester it ranged from overly broad and theoretical to at times too technical and focused on one detail. Strong potential but I think the course needs reworking to be more effective as a capstone.",
    "Structure of the class was fantastic. Readings were really informative and interesting, but can be extensive alongside the requirements of 4 other classes. Assignments are hard, but they really force you to think outside the box and get better at the craft of writing nuanced policy briefs. Best teacher at YSPH. So impressive.",
    "See below",
    "This was a fantastic course! We were able to cover a broad range of topics and work on a project that was specific to our own interests during the course of the semester. The assignments for this class were also very diverse in nature and allowed us to work in areas of policy we may not be as comfortable with, such as morality as it relates to policy.",
    "This class was a bit of a letdown after 514. I feel that the focus on the theory of policy analysis is not as practical preparation for embarking upon policy careers as other tacks. I think policy students might have been better served by a course that asked us to dive into specific policies such as MACRA or CONs for hospitals. The lack of interest in the approach was pretty well reflected by students' poor preparation for class each week. I think that perhaps an ideal Capstone would have had more writing on specific policy questions. Perhaps a weekly three to five page policy brief on a pressing issue. We're not a lazy group...I just think that we're better motivated by actual taking on an array of contemporary policy questions.",
    "Strengths: This course is an excellent end to my MPH education. It provides academic and strategic methods to thinking about policy agenda and analysis. I believe the materials I learned from this course will be immensely helpful as I move forward with my career. Weaknesses: NA",
    "excellent, very helpful and thoughtful",
    "Great course overall. Covers a very wide range of topics and a lot of material. Could perhaps benefit from a smaller second assignment - maybe practicing press releases - with perhaps a rough draft of the final project due. Too much reading to keep up with between assignments and week to week readings.",
    "Sometimes class was slow and I didn't know how it related to the rest of class. Overall, the material came together in the end and rounded out the course.",
    "Strengths: very interesting array\/variety of topics covered with definitely quite a bit of useful information Weaknesses: I think the course is too theoretical at some points; it's difficult to think through some of the concepts\/would be better to derive some more systematic ways of thinking of things",
    "Mark is great but the contents of the course were very abstract and not as helpful as 514. I wish policy students had the option to do a thesis to get out of this class.",
    "I did not hate this course, but I felt it could have been so much more. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect from this course, but what we endured was definitely not it. While I can appreciate understanding policy paradigms and thinking hypothetically, I found many classes to be a waste of time. A lot of what we went through in class felt like a broader version of HPM 514. I think we could have condensed the material we learned into 2 or 3 classes, and focused more on where health care and health policy is today. There is SO much going on, things I read about daily in Modern Healthcare, but we hardly, if ever, touched on these topics. How is the ACA doing? Are ACOs working out? What changes should be made? MACRA! That's super important, but I would've left Yale knowing nothing about it if it hadn't been for a friend. Why weren't these topics covered in the capstone course? Some classes were outright painful. Getting us students to participate was sometimes like pulling teeth. From my standpoint, I had little incentive to read because I didn't see the value in spending time to do so. I would have much rather been assigned weekly memos, briefs, or reports on different aspects of health policy and health care. Really building on my knowledge and understanding of where the future is headed, how I can influence that change, and what that change should look like. Not sit there and talk about a policy paradigm for 2 hours.",
    "Another thought-provoking, well-planned class by Mark. I think I enjoyed 514 more, but this was great. I enjoyed the assignments. The capstone was actually somewhat fun to write.",
    "This class pushed me as a student in the best ways and the papers required a lot of work. Each was fulfilling and challenging in a way that progressed my knowledge of policy making.",
    "This course is a great 'capstone' of the policy curriculum. The work is challenging but feels worthwhile.",
    "I gained a strong grasp of the theoretical frameworks through which I should approach and conceptualize policy problems. (Once we finished that first module, I couldn't help but start reading news stories or policy propositions through the rationalist, advocate, and counselor lenses). I know of other students who believe the course's biggest weakness is its failure to explore more practical application, but I'm not sure I agree - to me, that's skill that can be grasped and strengthened through actual work out in the real world, but I feel more prepared now that I have a better foundation of how to actually approach certain problems."

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0One of the best professors at YSPH. Extremely attentive and excellent at explaining concepts.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Hands down smartest professor I've ever had. He uses no notes or powerpoints and the structure of his class actively engages students to think through really insightful questions to uncover his message for that particular session. Has a great counterpoint or supporting point to every single comment that students make. Really impressive and interesting. What a shame if you don't experience Mark in your time at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0See below",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is an amazingly intelligent and thoughtful professor. He clearly laid out an agenda for each class, did a great job of engaging the students in moving the discussion along and kept the discussion on the topic (mostly).",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is easily one of my favorite instructors at Yale! I personally love his lecture style. He is also incredibly willing to meet with students and provided me with some extraordinarily helpful feedback throughout the semester on a number of my assignments.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Strengths: Mark is an amazing teacher and mentor as always. His lectures are so well structured. He understand the gaps that students face as they work through their assignments and illuminates areas that need work and refinement. Weaknesses: NA",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0excellent",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Wonderful Professor!",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Phenomenal, brilliant, approachable, and considerate.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark was always open to helping out students and is extremely knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is absolutely the definition of a \"professor\". Extremely intelligent and engaging! He is also very understanding and accommodating.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Despite my reservations with the course content, I thoroughly enjoy the professor. I highly respect anyone who can stand in front of a class and teach, without notes, for a full 2 hours. Never skipping a beat, rarely ever forgetting his point.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is an incredible teacher and a legend in the policy department. It's an honor to hear what he has to say and learn from him.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0A class with Dr. Schlesinger is always engaging and essential for any policy student. He is a true master and wizard of health policy that every YSPH student should learn from.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is one of the finest faculty members at YSPH and gives incredibly valuable, personalized feedback to every student. His manner of teaching is remarkable and admirable-- he rarely looks upon notes but manages to time every class perfectly and respond to all student questions. My only suggestion would be to use a more transparent grading rubric- sometimes it is hard to discern how one earned a certain grade (e.g., why an 8.85 vs. an 8.9).",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is such a great professor - definitely one of my favorites at YSPH. The depth of his knowledge, insight, and attention to nuances in our class discussions was refreshing and something I looked forward to every class."

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended (though it it also required)",
    "Lots of work and reading, but totally worth it.",
    "If you have to take it. I didn't find the subject matter all that interesting: Mark, while brilliant, makes this class far too abstract to be applicable to real-life policy analysis. (Think: really theoretical political philosophy stuff.) It's interesting, but it's not what I came to public health school for.... Like 514, this class is low-key hard. If you don't do the reading -- and I wouldn't recommend doing the reading, because there's too much of it and you don't need it to participate in discussion -- it's basically no work on your average week. However, the assignments for this class are really challenging and time-consuming -- I easily spent upwards of 20 hours on each of them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class and any other class you can take with this professor to a student.",
    "This course tends to be slightly too theoretical without the substance that would support a capstone in a subject that requires significant depth of knowledge.",
    "This course is a requirement for health policy students, so in a way, we do not have a choice in our decision to take it. However, even if it wasn't, I would definitely take this and highly recommend it to rising second year students.",
    "recommend",
    "This course is definitely meant for health policy students. A lot of topics are covered and it is sometimes difficult to see what you're learning, but taking a step back from the coursework sometimes helps. The projects\/assignments are really challenging - so be prepared for this! I personally enjoyed the last project the most because it is something you can walk away with from the course for your future professional careers. The first project, which is a group project, seems all too theoretical to me.",
    "Please revamp the content of this course. I didn't learn what I could have, should have, and wanted to.",
