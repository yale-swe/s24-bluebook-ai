    "Class is a lot of political science paper reading (read stats, figures, graphs, in long paper) that is dense and very specific. The class was good as my junior seminar but I'm not sure I would recommend it to another student as it needs more structure and focus.",
    "Very much a polisci class - Seekings is fascinating to listen to.",
    "Take the course. You learn a lot but the dynamic is determined by who is in the course. Stay up on the readings.",
    "Yale is already short of classes that offer a useful or accurate perspective on contemporary African politics. If you want to begin to understand how diverse and complex African states and politics truly are, this class is a must-take."
