   "comments": [
    "basic and advanced statistical and quantitative skills. Insight into how to write scientific papers, analyze data, improve transparency when stating results, etc.",
    "I learned how to analyze various datasets, the theory behind certain statistical tests, and how to use relevant software packages to run analyses that are meaningful and scientifically sound.",
    "I feel much more confident in reporting statistical analysis after taking this course.",
    "I learned how to conduct statistical analyses of data gathered from psychological studies. I also learned how to use SPSS and I was introduced to R.",
    "I gained a thorough understanding of statistical methods and how to apply them to my research. Although I had taken several statistics courses before (and had covered a lot of this material), this course was invaluable in cementing my understanding of various statistical tests and principles. I gained fluency with computing statistical tests by hand and using SPSS.",
    "Even though I have taken statistics before, I learned a lot from this course and found it to be useful in further developing and solidifying my statistics knowledge and skills.",
    "How to run many of the statistical tests needed in experimental psych using SPSS and R.",
    "This course taught me the basic statistics needed for understanding and conducting research in social psychology.",
    "I learned about the foundations of statistical analysis, causal inferences, and a lot about experimental design. I also learned to use SPSS, and how to seek out answers when I'm not sure.",
    "I learned the foundations that underlie statistics in psychology, how to calculate statistics by hand, and using SPSS\/R",
    "-how to choose the best analyses to run for each kind of study -how to run these analyses"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: very thorough lectures, conscientious professor and TF, many homework assignments which helped to apply what we learned in class, nice progression\/scaffolding into more complex approaches, memorable examples given in class. Weaknesses: Homework assignments got very tedious after a while of doing F-tests by hand. I understand the value in it, but one problem done by hand is usually enough to get the basic idea, the rest can be done using statistical software, which is more applicable to our research anyway. I think the main weakness, which is not exactly a reflection of this course per se, is that we did not have sufficient time to cover regression, which is the approach most of us will use in our research. I think the psychology department really needs to add a second statistics requirement that is a full semester of regression.",
    "I thought the class was well-organized in lecture and instructions were clear.",
    "The comments given by the teaching assistant for each assignment were extremely helpful for staying on track throughout the semester. The detailed feedback and opportunity so submit several drafts of each submission gave a clear sense of progress and improvement, and facilitated learning and improvement far beyond what I experienced in similar courses.",
    "I think the course is awesome as is. Maybe more instruction on R.",
    "I liked the lectures very much - nice to get feedback on assignments and projects along the way so you could see what you did wrong and fix it\/ learn from it",
    "Strengths: This course was one of the best of my life (and I don't say this casually). Dr. Dovidio presented the information in an interesting and logical way and truly helped us to gain a solid foundation of understanding. Although the homework assignments were often quite time consuming, I didn't mind because I realized that it was purposeful. The take home assignments were extremely useful and are templates that I will use for future results section throughout graduate school. One minor notethere were a few instances in which April and Dr. Dovidio's comments on take home exam drafts were contradictory.",
    "This course was a really great introduction to statistics. The only problem is that I wish there were another semester of it for more advanced statistics.",
    "Great overview and practical class with really intuitive explanations. Not sure how useful the readings on the website were since it didn't seem like many students used them.",
    "Te helpful and engaging professor and teaching fellow are the course's greatest strength. It is hard to think of the course's weakness.",
    "It was very clear and the instructor was very good at making intimidating and unfamiliar concepts intelligible and interesting. I would have liked to do more on regressions--but maybe that does not fit into the curriculum.",
    "Too much is done by hand, which does not provide practical practice."

    "Yes. I learned a lot of meaningful statistics that I can directly apply to my research!",
    "This course was a great way to delve deeper into statistical analyses without being overwhelmed.",
    "Wholeheartedly.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. While most of us probably came in with substantial statistical background, we tend to lose sight of the overall theoretical underpinnings of each test. This course not only provides the knowledge about why we choose each test we perform, but also provides enough practice and instruction of these tests, that we leave the course having fully mastered the concepts.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in engaging in empirical work.",
    "YEs",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student and think that it is an invaluable component of any graduate education in the sciences. I have heard that there may be changes to the statistics course offered next year and I think this is a huge loss.",
    "Yes. This was a super useful course for anyone learning statistics for the first time or looking to brush up their stats skills.",
    "Great introduction to psych stats.",
    "Definitely, yes, I would recommend the course to another student. The course did a great job of laying a strong foundation in statistics for graduate students in social psychology.",
    "Yes, I learned much more in this course than I have in many others.",
    "yes",
    "Definitely recommended for anyone who wants to gain a solid foundation in\/understanding of statistics"
