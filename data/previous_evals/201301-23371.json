    "Anth 254 is basically an introductory course to Japanese culture post WWII. It's really interesting and I learned a lot that I didn't know. The writing is not very helpful so don't take it if you want to become a better writer, but if you just want to learn about Japan it's a great start!",
    "This is a WONDERFUL course that does an excellent job teaching anthropology as a method and using Japan as a case study. I feel like I'm leaving it with more sunken-in knowledge than I have gained from most of the other classes I've taken at Yale so far. I can't think of anything to improve, because Professor Kelly did such a great job ensuring the course was received in the neatly packaged way he intended.Professor Kelly is the ideal Yale professor. Approachable, immensely knowledgeable, flexible, and willing to work closely with students, it's impossible to speak a word against his name. I thoroughly enjoyed his professorial style, and hope he continues to teach what he's passionate about to many Yale students in the future.Just drink some coffee before class. His voice can be soporific if you don't get enough sleep.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a great writing credit course with an actually interesting topic.",
    "Take the class. Interesting content, very little work, very little note-taking, sections open to opinions (as long as they're relevant and reasonable), and a less demanding, but more reflective course on writing.",
    "I would definitely take this class if you have any interest at all in Japanese society. Interesting readings, engaging lectures, straightforward assignments. You leave the course with a lot of knowledge and a great overall picture of what modern Japanese society and culture is like (you also leave DYING to go and visit Japan for yourself).",
    "This is a fairly easy writing credit: you have short weekly writing assignments, one short paper (5-7 pages) and two longer papers (10-12 pages). I learned a lot about mainstream and post-mainstream Japan. The lectures can be dry sometimes but overall it was a good course and a good way to fulfill your writing credit if you are interested in learning about Japan.",
    "This class was a bit of a disappointment. Kelly is a good teacher, but a lot of the subject matter just seemed very random and inconsequential. I don't feel like I'm leaving with much more of an understanding of Japanese society than I went in with. If you're interested in Japan, you're probably better off taking the modern Japanese history course.",
    "A pretty unique course; it's a writing credit in lecture format with section. The material is split between 'mainstream' Japan of 1950-1990 and the 'post-mainstream', when things fall apart and everything gets much more interesting. Professor Kelly is a talented lecturer and his ideas are of quality. Section was not a drag. Not much work, but you can't just cruise through; you're expected to put real effort into the writing for the course essays, and you're held to this expectation. Readings were interesting. Take this if you are interested in anthropology or Japan and don't know much about one, the other, or both.",
    "If you really like Japan and are interested in Japanese culture at all, definitely take this class. Professor Kelly evidently cares immensely about Japan, about anthropology and about this class. Work-wise, the experience is not that bad at all (for a WR credit). It feels like you take away a lot from every lecture and section meeting. The course is an excellent supplement to anyone who studies the Japanese language (and\/or who plans to study abroad in Japan). It's also a good introduction to area studies for students who plan to go on and take more East Asian Studies classes.",
    "If you are interested in Japan at all, take this course.",
    "This course is precisely what it says it is. If you want to enjoy learning about Japan, then this is for you.",
    "fantastic overview of where modern Japanese culture has come and where it is going, if you take it be prepared to learn to write like an anthropologist",
    "A good introduction to modern Japan and the anthropological methods. The readings are interesting, but since the lectures are a bit dry, I'd advise taking it if you know you're interested in Japan."
