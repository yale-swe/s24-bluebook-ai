    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in African American literature and\/or history. It is a fantastic and really unique opportunity to delve into one writer's work, rather than trying to speed through an overwhelming number of texts in a single semester. Professor Stepto is wonderful."

    "This class enhanced my knowledge of both Ralph Ellison's work and (as the title promises!) the larger cultural contexts in which he worked. This approach invites engagement with a variety of facets of twentieth-century American cultural and literary history. The course definitely helped me think in more detail about the themes I want to pursue in my further research."
