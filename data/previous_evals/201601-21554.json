    "I thoroughly enjoyed the class. Seminar was always engaging and educational- the readings were curated well, and Professor Zeidler facilitates discussions and lectures well. The primary assignments are the final paper and a final presentation, neither of which is burdensome or difficult. I sincerely recommend the course if you are interested in the topic- no previous art history course experience is necessary.",
    "Very interesting and enlightening class! If you like Surrealism, take it!! pretty manageable workload-- just one final presentation and paper, and readings.",
    "Yes! take it. A word of warning, have experience in art history this class is not for you if you are taking an art history class to be cultured or step outside your comfort zone.",
    "You will learn about the surrealist movement through individual artists and their work. The final paper is very open ended and allows you to choose any topic within the subject, which is a very liberating and enjoyable way to end the course."
