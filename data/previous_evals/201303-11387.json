    "It is what you make it. If you're a THST major you're going to have to take it, but if you aren't this still SO worth taking. Looked forward to the class always",
    "Yes. This class is so out there in terms of weirdness. Do not think this will be a normal acting class, if ever such thing did exist. There will be moments in class when you're like \"wtf?\" But, by the end of it, everything will make sense. Deb's approach to theater is that everyone can do it. That it is our birthright. She never makes you feel insecure about your work. Ever. She will always point out the positive things you do in class and help you to capitalize on them. You will also get to know everyone in your class very well on a very deep level.",
    "TAKE IT. Deb is a miracle worker and this is easily the best class at Yale. Literally nothing wrong with it.",
    "The best thing you will do with your Mondays and Wednesdays.",
    "Discovering your presence as an actor... I would definitely recommend it!",
    "The summary would be the same as above and I would definitely recommend it for other students even if they had no interest in theater studies at all."
