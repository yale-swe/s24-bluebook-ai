   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in archaeology, this course will provide you with the best background possible for the field. It was informative and fun and provides you with the opportunity to get to know other students and members of the archaeology department very well.",
    "Archaeological Field Techniques is a fun course, but a large time commitment in October for weekend digs. It is the first half of a full year course, essentially. I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in archaeology who doesn't mind getting dirty.",
    "If you're looking for a ton of fun, valuable hands-on experience, and a bunch of amazing people, take this class. If you're looking for a traditional introduction to Archaeology, don't. This is far more interesting, dynamic, and exciting than that. The weekends in Bethlehem are really fun, and totally worth it- don't let that part of the course put you off. Contrary to what is listed in the Blue Book, this class isn't every weekend- you go for 3 weekends in October out to Bethlehem, PA and work on the Yale dig site. It's awesome.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in gaining field experience or if you happen to really enjoying digging and sifting dirt.",
    "Yes, its a lot of fun. 3 weekend trips and no other commitments (Just make sure your october isn't tooooo busy)",
    "Yes take it!!!!! It's two Anthro credit too!",
    "This is really a hidden gem. You learn a ton about archaeology, and the weekend excursions are really fun. You don't have to be an archaeo\/andthro major, either. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Definitely take it. No work outside class. You get to learn a lot about the Moravians--and Bethlehem is a lovely place to go on weekends.",
    "This course is for anybody who likes to play in the dirt. It is a large time commitment - every weekend in October - but it's totally worth it. You'll have a ton of fun, DO IT.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who wants practical skills in the field, and someone who is good at roughing it for three days. You leave the class feeling like you really learned something."
