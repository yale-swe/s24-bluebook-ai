   "comments": [
    "I would completely recommend this class to anyone interested in religion, American religion, and theology in general. It really is a basic class that needs no prerequisites, and it provides a great basis for future majors like American Studies, Religious Studies, or History.",
    "I would definitely recommend Rise of Religion to any student. The material is interesting and Professor Butler does a great job making class fun.",
    "If you have a chance to be in this freshmen seminar, take it! I went into this course having no idea what to expect, not being an American Studies\/History\/Religious Studies prospective major, and this class turned out to be the one I looked forward to every week. Professor Butler is fantastic. He's very supportive and grading is definitely fair. He makes you care about the material and you learn about a broad range of things. This was probably one of the best academic experiences of my freshmen year.",
    "I would absolutely recommend ROR. Butler is the retiring dean of the graduate school, but he is so approachable, funny, nice, and a great professor who really loves teaching this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Butler is fantastic and you should seize this opportunity if you get in. As long as you're willing to put up with a few long readings on religious theory, the course is fine.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is a great way to fulfill a writing credit.",
    "Rise of Religion in Modern America was, simply put, an amazing class in every way. The material was always very interesting, the discussions were the best I've had at Yale, the papers were interesting to write, and Professor Butler is an absolute gem of a professor. He manages to let his students discuss the readings among themselves while inserting hisown thoughts and insights in a way that no other teacher I have ever had has been able to, and he is just such a great person and you will come to absolutely love him and Hector, Minnesota by the end of the class. If you have the opportunity, you must take this class. It was my favorite class this year, and it will very likely end up being my favorite class at Yale. These are the types of classes that you come to Yale for- don't miss out.",
    "If you can get in, take this class! Professor Butler is an excellent instructor! The reading is sort of long, but not too bad. 4 500-word papers, 1 3000-word paper, 1 1500-paper, so not too big a reading load. Pick something you are interested in for your research paper. At the beginning of the semester, the discussions weren't so interesting, but I'm glad I stuck with it because by the end, it was fascinating.",
    "Rise of Religion in Modern America has been my favorite class at Yale thus far. The small seminar size was ideal for facilitating discussion, and Professor Butler was phenomenal. I could not have asked for a better Freshman Seminar experience. I would most definitely recommend this class to another student. The coursework consists of reading for each seminar session and four, 500 word, papers, a research paper, and a term paper. The workload is definitely manageable, and I got so much out of this class.",
    "A very interesting class that gives you a new take on American history, through the lens of religion. It also helps you become a more consistent writer and introduces you to academic articles and discussion. I really respect Prof. Butler and appreciated his wit, kindness, and obvious love for history! He is a very good teacher. Class discussions were sometimes a student-dominated and thus hard to follow, but other than that it was a great class.",
    "Yes! This course is a lot of fun, not too hard, a writing credit, and Professor Butler is amazing."
