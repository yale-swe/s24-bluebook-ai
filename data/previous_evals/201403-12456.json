   "comments": [
    "Excellent, excellent, excellent. If you want to start getting your hands dirty working on robotics and work in an applied environment, you must take 348. It's absolutely my favorite EE class at Yale.",
    "This is a fun class where you get to make our own robot with a group. A lot of topics are covered and get very technical quickly. There's a lot of work at the end with finishing the project, project report, and final but it's a good course overall.",
    "A really fun class that is centered about building a basic robot and programming Arduinos. The project is what you and your group make of it, which is good if you like the topic (which I did) because you get great results when you invest more time. Kuc is the epitome of jovial and holds fairly informal but very useful lectures. All in all, a great class, a moderate workload, and a relatively practical topic.",
    "A great hands-on course where you formally learn how an arduino actually works and use that knowledge and more to create a mobile robot in small teams. Would definitely recommend. Fair warning that you should be ok in not knowing exactly where you are going in this class since Kuc is not the most organized.",
    "This class began using the Arduino platform 2 years ago and has been constantly evolving. This year, the concepts of digital communication (SPI, I2C, Serial etc) are smartly applied to different parts of an autonomous robot. As you learn the concepts in class, you add on a new functioning component to the robot (wireless communication, the motors, IR sensors and servos) and by the end of the class, the goal is to make an autonomous robot that can seek an exit from a box and return. Even if you have used arduino's beforehand, this class goes in much more depth. You use register commands, timers and write way more efficient code than those provided by the hobbyist code ie. you learn to write your own \"analogWrite\" or your own \"analogRead\". The class practically makes you an Arduino guru with knowledge of all the basic digital communication systems to pick up and understand other hardware that you can buy online. A MUST TAKE!",
    "Working with arduinos is fun and useful to learn about so it was definitely worth taking the class. Kuc is also hilarious, though a bit disorganized. I think he restructured the final project this year so that may have been why. The lack of clear instructions for the homework was frustrating, but he doesn't seem like a super strict grader so that makes it bearable.",
    "Kuc is a very disorganized professor which leads to a lot of frustration when taking this class. The midterm\/final were mostly writing out code by hand which is the worst.",
    "Organization of this class was all over the place. Many times we weren't sure what was expected of us. Not idea what my grade is or how it will be calculated.",
    "Really fun class but not at all easy. It's a little bit frustrating because the home works and robot project you spend most of your time on basically don't contribute to your grade. Fun class though!",
    "Very code heavy. Nothing too difficult but would've been good to know going in.",
    "Fairly enjoyable. Pretty disorganized: the requirements for the final switched a bunch of times; but his notes for each class are helpful and accurate. Has periods with tons of very fast material, and others that are really slow. Worthwhile for a CS elective credit. There are nearly daily assignments for the first half of the semester though.",
    "You build things, and have to learn how to mostly by yourself. Don't underestimate the difficulty of the project you're doing.",
    "Prepare for the sassiest prof you've ever had in your life if you take it with Kuc. This is a lot of work, so I don't necessarily recommend taking it alongside another big project-based class like I (and some others in the class) did but it's definitely possible and I think expectations are reasonable (our class didn't even really get graded on how well our projects functioned, just on our tests and final reports, so working on the project was kind of self-motivated). I definitely recommend this class for any non-EE majors who have the prereqs; you'll learn so much.",
    "Great course! You get an in-depth look at how digital systems operate and communicate with each other. Our final project was to build an autonomous wall-following robot using Arduino microcontrollers, a sensor, an actuator, motors, and wireless transreceivers.",
    "I wouldit's a great excuse to get to fool around with Arduinos for credit! Though it did get harder than it was rumored to be in past years, the homeworks\/projects balanced teetered between tedious and fun. As a CS major, I gained a lot of confidence with wires, circuit diagrams, thinking about bits, using microcontrollers and debugging electrical components."
