    "This was a good thing to do for me, since what I'm interested in was not available in the art department this semester. That being said, I would be careful to make sure that you KNOW what you want to work on so that you see a tangible product or skill at the end of the semester, broken down into steps in between. Also, look to have a professor that actually knows about what you're studying.",
    "Truly excellent opportunity to work on something that you're passionate and receive excellent one on one advice and support. The more thought you put into your plans for this class ahead of time and the more carefully you choose an advisor, the more you will get out of it."
