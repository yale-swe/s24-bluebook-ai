    "Its an intermediate Spanish class taught similarly to L1 and L2 Spanish at Yale. I would recommend it if you enjoy spanish.",
    "The grammar is mostly a repeat of L2. There are a lot of course packet readings that are pretty interesting and hard.",
    "Good course. If had previous spanish knowledge, this would be a good course to start off with because it provides a review, as well as learning new material.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this class if you need to fill the requirement.",
    "It is a useful class if you have it with a worth while teacher.",
    "This was a great couse. If you have to take it, definitely take it with Oscar. He is the man. He is very relaxed and a great teacher. You might have to review a little by yourself for the assessments, but if you do the work you should get a good grade.",
    "I'd recommend this course"
