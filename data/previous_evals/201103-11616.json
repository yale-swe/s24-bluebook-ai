   "comments": [
    "116L was a great introduction into labs at Yale. Dr. G really cares that students master both concepts and methods; if you take general chemistry, I would definitely take the lab as well. Some of the lab reports do take a while though; the course certainly merited more than half a credit.",
    "So much fun if you like titrations! Personally, I found the class mostly relaxing and a good way to end my week. The summary sections of the lab reports are a pain though.",
    "Lab is a bit tedious when doing titrations, but it really enforces the concepts we learned in Chemistry 114.",
    "This is a good intro lab to help you get familiar with the equipment, and to help you learn to write a decent lab report, which should make future labs easy. Dr. G is super enthusiastic, which makes the prelecture entertaining. I would have really enjoyed the lab had it not stripped 3 hours out of my day each week. The length is frustrating.",
    "Teaches basic laboratory techniques very well, very useful. The first half of the semester is a little dry, but the experiments get better.",
    "For the first 30 minutes of class, Dr. G delivers a pre-lab lecture to explain the lab (although by that time, most people have already reviewed the lab from their lab manuals). Then students take a quick (10 minute) quiz. Then students do their lab (which usually take 2 to 3 hours).If you're looking at this class, you probably have to for your major. It's very tolerable, especially with Dr. G.",
    "Take it!",
    "There are weekly quizzes and the lab write-ups suck a little but overall the lab procedure were actually fun.",
    "You do harmless experiments to learn the chem basics, i.e. doing titrations or making observations. The techniques used in the lab are not dangerous and are fairly simple to carry out once you try them once or twice. This course taught me the general skills needed to work in a lab while reinforcing the concepts of chemistry learned in class. For example, doing a titration let me use burets and pipets while observing how oxidation-reduction reactions occur.",
    "Definitely take lab if you're taking 114, it helps a lot with content understanding. Dr. G is also wonderful, he made the 4-hour labs something to actually look forward to, not dread.",
    "Only if you're pre-med or major requires it",
    "DON'T TAKE IT UNLESS YOU HAVE TO. Chemistry 116L helped review some of the general chemistry concepts, which was helpful. Overall, though, I found Chemistry 116L to be a waste of time when considering the amount of time it demanded. There were multiple weeks where I found myself doing 4 hour titrations, then going home to write an 8 page lab report. To review simplistic concepts, that's a ridiculous time commitment demanded.Also, grading somewhat varies based on TAs - some are much more helpful than others. Try to shop TAs; try not to get Thoe, because she grades really harshly, i.e.",
    "Gen Chem lab is deceptively time consuming. If you want to do well on your lab reports, you will spend quite a bit of time on them. If you like chemistry, or want to learn basic lab skills, it's a good course that will give you a solid preparation. Some experiments can get very tedious in this class.",
    "Chemistry 116 01 is a very good course to take in conjunction with Chemistry 114. I would highly suggest this course to any student interested in the sciences. It is not too rigorous, yet it provides students with the opportunity to familiarize themselves with a lab setting.",
    "Basic general chemistry lab. The reports vary in difficulty\/length, but for the most part are manageable.",
    "Fine introduction to general chemistry lab.",
    "I enjoyed this class. It wasn't too challenging, and the labs were interesting and engaging. Dr. G is a great teacher, and I'd definitely recommend this class.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to any first time lab student. It was very comprehensive and built a strong foundation for other lab skills and techniques to be developed.",
    "take it if you have to. hard work and many times you can only have<1% error. the lab reports can be up to 10 pages long and often take 6ish hours. the course could have been much worse if i had had a different TA. be on the lookout for chill TA's",
    "If you are taking General Chemistry, then take the lab course for sure. It helps understand the concepts very well.",
    "Chem 116L is a helpful intro class that leaves you with greater facility in conducting universally essential lab techniques--of which titrations are the foremost. Although many are deterred from taking the lab due to its (mundane) consistency throughout the semester, I felt like the experiments offered a nice progression that led to better understanding of chemical reactions.",
    "Really good if you didn't take AP Chem with an associated lab in high school. It teaches you all of the basics for future chem labs and introduces you to what lab will be like at Yale in a low pressure environment. Definitely take it if Dr. G is teaching it because he makes the course.",
    "If you're taking a lecture-based Chemistry course, take this lab-based course to remind yourself that Chemistry is not just based on textbook examples but real experiments with measurements, titrations, qualitative tests, etc. Great course. Without it, I would absolutely have hated my experience with Chemistry at Yale.",
    "Don't take it if you aren't pre-med or using this for prereqs. This class can be very frustrating at times.",
    "Usually a person taking a lab pretty much has no choice. So rest easy knowing you'll at least have a great instructor and a fairly manageable workload.",
    "Lab reports and quizzes every week. Make sure you're neat or Dr. G will start ticking off the points.",
    "Yes! very interesting, especially with Dr G.",
    "I would recommend this because it was cool to see in class concepts in the labs.",
    "Dr. G is great! So funny, and he made chemistry \"fun\" ... even if you don't have any experience in a laboratory setting, don't worry. You will learn in this class. If you are looking for a chemistry lab course I recommend this one!",
    "If you're taking this class, it's probably because you have to. It's not terribly difficult, but it can get boring.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's a good introduction to lab skills and techniques. The work is relevant and reasonable. Dr. G is just great. A variety of topics are covered, and basically no lab experience is required (but is helpful). It's also helpful to have a good command of basic math; there is a fair bit of number crunching involved in the course. Read the introduction sections of the lab manual before the course begins\/writing lab reports to save yourself a lot of trouble. Also read over each experiment before lab. It's possible to get away with not doing it, but it makes life easier to be familiar with the setup beforehand. Overall, a very good basic lab class.",
    "An interesting course that I would recomend to any student enrolled in a General Chem lecture.",
    "Chem lab is fine. At times it can be a bit stressful because the lab reports take a bit of time to write, especially if something goes wrong in your experiment. The experiments are interesting, but become a bit tedious when you have to write down everything that you're doing.",
    "Chem Lab is good at teaching basic lab techniques, but it is a lot of work for a half-credit class. It is all about following directions. Take it if necessary.",
    "It's not as bad as you think. The time leading up to lab is the worst; actually doing the labs isn't that bad. The first time you do a titration (if you've never done one before) is a little nerve-racking, but you do titrations so much that you get used to them.The final practical exam is pretty intense in that, in order to get full points, you have to have less than a 1 percent error.",
    "It's a great introductory course for students who are new\/beginners in chem lab.",
    "Definitely take lab with gen chem. Dr G is a great professor, it's hard Not to get an A, and you'll put what you've learned in lecture into practice.",
    "Yes. It is a lot of work but the work is clearly explained and very manageable.",
    "Chem 116 is a class the majority are going to be taking as a requirement, but this does not mean that the class is not enjoyable. I would not, however, recommend it to anyone for whom it is not a requirement: the time period is far too long to justify being wasted on it , especially since Chem114 is strongly recommended with it.",
    "Lab is a great way to begin to really understand material being taught in lecture. Very well taught and all material presented in a way that makes it easy to grasp major concepts and techniques.",
    "I would recommend it; it is required for many paths, and it's not bad. Chem 116L is basically a decent basic lab class, in which you will master basic skills that will come in handy later.",
    "You spend 3-5 hours a week in lab and approximately 1-3.5 a week writing up the actual lab report. You gain hands on experience doing labs that help add depth to the concepts you learn in your chem lecture. This class is very useful so yes, I would recommend it.",
    "Chem 116L 01 is a pretty straight forward lab. The lab reports can be a hassle if left until the day before they're due. If you don't have that much chem or lab experience going into the course it would be really helpful for you to spend a little extra time on the class. Look over the lab thoroughly and ask for help when you need it. If you spend the extra time you will find the course pretty simple. If you have had a solid chemistry and lab background you\u0092re probably going to be pretty comfortable in the course from the start.",
    "Take it. It's not that hard.",
    "Chemistry 116L is a very good class to take, especially as a first lab. The experiments are interesting and manageable. Though the lab write-ups take a considerable amount of time, it is worth taking the course in the end. I would just caution a student who is planning on taking Chem116L that it IS a considerable work load, so though it is only one half of a credit, it may feel like more than that with other courses.",
    "Solid lab course-- not too difficult, easy A, just do the work and your grade will reflect the time you put into the course.",
    "Be careful with lab reports. Class is pretty straightforward.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Chem 116L. It is a lot of work for only half a credit, but a lot is learned.",
    "OVerall, lab was an easy A for me. That being said, it's not the same for everyone. Lab reports and quizzes can be very difficult if you do not understand the experiments. I was lucky and got a great TA, which helped a lot. Only take this course if you're a pre-med because it's not worth it for .5 credits! Also you don't learn much aside from lab techniques. Finally, Dr. G was a fantastic teacher.",
    "This lab was pretty manageable, so I would recommend it to anyone considering pre-med\/any other major that requires chemistry. Generally it doesn't take the full four hours which is really nice. The key is just that you need to read the lab manuel and understand the procedure before you actually carry it out.",
    "I would not recommend that a student take this course unless he or she is on the premed track. It is a lot of hours of work for half a credit, and I can imagine there are much more fun sciences to take. I don't think that I will take the second semester of it. I also wouldn't recommend it for someone who is not a freshman, unless they need it for a requirement of course. Everyone I met out of the students was a premed freshmen.",
    "Yes! It is a good introductory lab course that is enjoyable and low stress.",
    "I usually hate chemistry lab, but I actually had a lot of fun in this class. Dr. G is hilarious, and helps his students a lot. The TAs are all really friendly and helpful as well. It's not a lot of work, but each lab is pretty long. I took this with chem 114, but I feel like I would have understood the experiments with my high school chemistry background (regular chemistry). I enjoyed this lab much more than I did the chem 114 class.",
    "This course is a lot of work for only .5 credit. Only take if you have to. The labs are four hours and tiring, and the grading of lab reports are rough.",
    "Only take this if you have to. It's stressful and has way more work than it should be given that it's only worth a half a credit. The finals easy at least.",
    "This lab is just a basic introduction to lab procedures and writing lab reports I would recommend this lab to incoming chemistry students.",
    "You'll learn a TON of valuable lab skills in this class- very worthwhile even if you're not a science major.",
    "This class is a winner! I highly recommend this course if you have never before worked in a chemistry lab and desire to reinforce the concepts you learn in Chemistry 112 or Chemistry 114 lecture.",
    "Definitely, especially if you are taking classes for pre-med or just because you are interested in chem",
    "Yes - 116L was great! Not only did it teach lab skills in particular, but in terms of general chemistry classes, it provided great illustrations of topics and extremely helpful practice with calculations. By the end of the course, I felt I understood what to expect on pre-lab quizzes and especially how to write lab reports in general.",
    "Absolutely - just the right amount of challenge that you were always on your toes but didn't have to stress out that much about the class. Great instructor and good TAs. Perfect for those with little lab experience. A huge bonus if you already know lab technique, however.",
    "It's not terrible but not a bunch of fun. I do recommend it though.",
    "In general, a pretty frustrating course in that it takes up a lot of time and is pretty much just busy-work with the lab reports (takes a lot of time but doesn't really feel useful).",
    "If you need it for a requirement, then I would definitely recommend it. It wasn't particularly fun, but it wasn't terrible.",
    "If you're taking Chem 114 you're probably taking Chem 116 because you need to. That said, it's not a bad lab, although it can be tedious at times.",
    "Again, if you're pre-med you probably have to take Chemistry116L anyway, but I actually found it very helpful and fun.",
    "I mean, if you're pre-med, take it. It's not horrible. If you're not, I honestly do not see why you ever would.",
    "The class is very monotonous, only take it if you need to.",
    "I enjoyed chem lab. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone not doing pre-med because it is a lot of hard work, but it was fine.",
    "I would recommend this course! It was fun, and although it was tedious and long and a lot of titrations, I always actually enjoyed it while i was there.",
    "A good course that teaches how to work quickly and efficiently and sometimes how to correct for mistakes. It is a good course and the skills learned are of more practical use and can be applied to other fields of study.",
    "In addition to general chemistry, you are probably taking this course to fulfill pre-med requirements. It's a pain to have spend 4 hours of your day every week up on Science Hill, but it's really not a hard class. In order to end up with an A: 1) actually go over your lab prior to your lab& study for the pre-lab quizzes - they're not hard, but actually looking over the material should guarantee you a 20\/20; 2) pre-write your lab procedure material out in your lab notebooks before the actual lab - it causes you to spend much less time in lab; 3) make sure ALL of your lab reports, from the very first one, are perfect - Dr. G can be very strict and one bad lab report grade can really bring down your average.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student. The class had clear expectations and the instructors were helpful.",
    "It's an introductory lab class that introduces you to the basics of lab techniques and applies them to material being taught in the corresponding Chemistry lecture. This class should be taken if a student is taking general chemistry. It's not too difficult but can be a bit time consuming, especially since it is only a half credit.",
    "Chemistry 116 is a great way to implement some of the abstract ideas taught in lectures. Furthermore, it is a pre-medical requirement, so its very important for students who are even remotely considering the pre-med path. I would definitely recommend the class because both Dr. G and the TA's do their best to help both you understand the material and get a good grade!",
    "Chemistry lab makes the subject tangible and is recommended if you want to have some real world fun with science.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course because it provides you with the basic tools to be successful in other courses.",
    "Chem 116L was a great course. If you have no lab experience, this is a must take for any science major. It will go at a pace that is safe for beginners, and you will learn a ton about chemistry, the lab, and commonly practiced lab techniques. I would definitely recommend this class to another student because I learned so much in it.",
    "Take it only if you need lab credit.",
    "yes!",
    "Chemistry 116L is a great course but in entails alot of work. Each week you must prepare a lab report as well as study for a quiz...on top of 4 hours in the lab. That being said the course is very upfront about what it wants\/requires, there are no surprises. You get exactly what you put into it.",
    "Chem lab is relatively easy course. 30 minute lectures and a quiz proceed each lab session.",
    "I would recommend this lab- it emphasizes important lab techniques and skills and is a good introductory lab course.",
    "Chem 116L is the lab taken along with Chem 114 or Chem 112. It for the most part follows the work in the course. It is not too difficult but you must pay attention in the pre-lab lecture and at least read the important parts of the lab right before so that you can do well on the pre-lab quizzes (which are very detailed at times). Grading for the lab reports can be very picky but you get used to it. Also realize that you will be writing a lab report almost every week, so choose a lab section on a day when you won't have too much other work due if possible.",
    "Standard lab course - take it if you have to or want to.",
    "No one takes this course unless they need to take it.",
    "Yes, if Dr. G is the professor, the course will be much better and easy to understand if you do the homework and pay attention.",
    "Chem 116 lab is an interesting course because it demonstrates how the concepts learned in lecture are applicable in real life. Lab reports are all outlined already so they are not too time consuming. The quizzes need to be prepared for as well! Dr. G is an awesome professor, so take advantage of his enthusiasm and willingness to assist students!",
    "I would say Chemistry 116 is an interesting chemistry lab course. I would recommend this course for pre-med students, but I would warn that it is very time consuming and the work load is rather large.",
    "This lab is definitely a lot more work than a lot of my other classes. There was always pre-lab reading and you had to do it in order to do well on the pre-lab lecture quizzes which were annoying. The frustrating part is that lab is only worth 0.5 credit so it feels like a lot of work for the amount of time you spend on a lab and the report.",
    "Chem 116L provides a great foundation for lab skills. The quizzes can be tough, so be sure to study. The lab reports also take a long time. However, actual lab class usually went by quickly and I enjoyed doing the experiments.",
    "Yes I would. Some people complain about the time it takes but it really isn't that bad.",
    "Great introduction to working in a chemistry lab. By the end, you feel comfortable with basic chem lab techniques and you get to carry out some visually impressive reactions. Would definitely recommend for science majors or even non-science people who want to try a lab.",
    "do it if you need to! too many hours spent in lab and writing reports.",
    "Chemistry 116 is a really good compliment to Chemistry 114. A lot of the topics covered in lab correlate with what is currently occurring in lecture, and it is a good way to master any topics you might be iffy on.",
    "If taking Chem 114, I would recommend you take Chem 116L. It is not that difficult. Start the lab reports ahead of time because they sometimes took me more than five hours. Starting the lab reports the night before is a big mistake. Overall, take this lab if necessary and needed for premed.",
    "This course was a good introduction to lab work. The labs were for the most part interesting, and lab reports were not too much work. I would recommend it, the class was well put together, taught important skills, and was a helpful supplement to chem 114.",
    "This is one of those classes that people usually take because they have to and that makes sense. The actual chemistry part of this class isn't that bad; you do some interesting labs and learn how to do all the basic chemistry procedures. Dr G is great and sweet and can be funny and is always available to help. He does a prelab lecture and then there's a quiz before each lab that isn't too hard if you've read the manual the night before. I had Jill Hagey as my TA and she was great--really chill and nice but also helpful. The biggest problem with this lab is the busywork. It's absurd--you basically spend most of the class copying down word for word what's in the lab manual into your lab notebook. And then lab reports usually aren't that bad because you're just filling in the blanks in a lab report template and then writing a formulaic summary. It's just annoying because most of the work you do for the class doesn't help you learn anything at all. And then you get points off for very nitty gritty unimportant things--so make sure you're neat and do every DETAIL. More than anything, the lab is just annoying...But it works out okay and if you need to take it for premed or something, then just try and have a positive attitude about it so you can get through it. Do lab with your friends if you can because then the 4 hours is easier to handle.",
    "Basically a lab application of the chem112 and chem114. It's a solid class that allows you to better understand what you're learning in your chem class.",
    "A difficult course. Recommended only if you are willing to put in a lot of extra work before and after each lab to understand the procedures.",
    "If you want to take chem and you dont have the strongest of chem backgrounds, this is a great class.",
    "I liked it much better than the Chem 114 class, but I would only take either class if you are required to.",
    "Take lab if you have to.",
    "Chemistry 116L was a great starting place for someone with basically no lab experience. They walked you through how to use the lab instruments and gave you enough information to perform the labs and understand them.",
    "Lab may be stressful, especially if you are very meticulous. Lab Reports are lengthy, but the overall workload is ok.",
    "I found chemlab to be enjoyable, and I felt as though it really taught me lab technique; I truly gained confidence in the lab. Make sure you prepare well before the lab; I found it to be really helpful if I wrote out all the notes for my lab notebook prior to lab, i.e. \"The 30 ml of HCl were added to a 50 mL beaker, and __ g of the unknown solid were massed,\" leaving values you will need to measure blank. This way, you won't have to deal with writing down the steps in lab, which becomes cumbersome, and it's a lot easier to organize your notes that way. Also make sure you memorize all the relevant reactions exactly for the quizzes (they will sometimes ask you to produce the formulae). The lab is very formulaic; learn the formula, get familiar with the info. and you'll be fine.A large component of this course involves following recipes in the lab, but the interesting part comes with learning how to use the equipment and getting an intuition for labwork and quantitative analysis. I really enjoyed chem lab, and I also enjoyed the chem class. Chem lab could be made more interesting if students were called upon more to devise a way to solve a problem, rather than just following the instructions in the lab manual. The lab manual was well written. The work load is WAY too much for just half a credit. I think the lab requires so much work to learn the topic sufficiently, so maybe it would be best to give more credit for the course.Dr. G did a great job explaining the labs in the pre-lab lectures. He answered questions well, and he was very helpful in figuring out what we did wrong when we encountered problems with our experiments. He's very approachable, but also very professional and appropriately strict.My teaching fellow was Dustin; he was unintrusive, but he answered questions well when asked, offered help when needed, gave advice, and asked the professor when he wasn't sure how to answer a question.",
    "I would recommend it if lab is something that you think you would enjoy and would be interested in, because you learn important lab technique and it can be a nice break from the traditional classroom setting.",
    "I would recommend this lab; it is a good introductory course that isn't only for science majors. You will learn a lot about chemistry that you can't learn in a lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course as it helps very much with understanding chemistry as a whole and is extremely useful.",
    "I would recommend this course to students taking Chem 112 or 114. It provides a good introduction to laboratory skills and writing lab reports. Dr. G is extremely enthusiastic and helpful. The workload is manageable, with 1 lab report and 1 pre-lab quiz each week; however, the course does require more time than its 0.5 credit may suggest.",
    "Yes. A great introduction to lab techniques and tools.",
    "I would recommend it. It provides useful hands-on experience in chemistry and relates well to the topics taught in lecture.",
    "Chemistry 116L is your standard first semester general chemistry laboratory. If you\u0092re taking it, you probably don\u0092t have much of a choice. I thought the experiments were genuinely interesting but the overall experience was pretty stressful. Pre-labs on top of lab reports on top of quiz preparation stacks up if you put it off. The whole lab process was excruciatingly long (which is true for any lab), and is worsened by the fact that lab involves copying down the procedure as you do it. Lab reports also took more time every week than I anticipated and it explicitly clear what my TA wanted. Grading depends on your TA, but they\u0092re generally good across the board unless you have some glaring problems. Dr. G is a great lecturer though and the TAs were helpful.",
    "Chem 116 is a good course. It can get a bit stressful if a lot of people sign up for your lab section, just because it can get a bit crowded in the room because of all the people going to and fro, so keep that in mind when choosing your lab day. Overall, I would recommend this course to anyone really interested in chem who is willing to do the labs\/write-ups.",
    "It was a great introductory lab class. It teaches a variety of basic techniques and the use of a lot of important equipment. It is also very useful to see theories learned in Chem 114 first-hand. I would highly recommend it to somebody taking Gen Chem."
