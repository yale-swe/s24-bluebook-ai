    "yes because it is a cool class and much different from other classes you will take here.",
    "This class is fantastic. I accomplished more, and yet had more independence, than in any other lab I've ever taken. Electron microscopy is way too cool, the Prof. and TA's were great, and I loved learning about an organ in such depth! I would emphatically recommend this lab to anyone with an interest in physiology, histology, and super-cool microscopy.",
    "I would say it's a great lab, you learn a lot about the tissue you study and if you're pre-Med, it gets you started with histology. I would recommend it, although be ready to put extra work in(it usually balances out because there are no weekly reports and you can go in on your own time). Just be sure to get started on the presentation and final report as soon as possible, and do parts of it along the way so that it's not daunting.",
    "Yeah, absolutely, take this course! Just remember to start early on your final paper.",
    "Excellent lab course for the MCDB major in a smaller setting (max 12 students); provides great preparation for future microscopy work; subject material is very interesting, especially those interested in physiology or anatomy.",
    "Very different from other MCDB lab courses because the focus is not on biology at the macromolecular level, but at the cellular and organ level, so the knowledge learned feels very practical\/useful, esp. if pre-med. however, only worth it if you have time, because a lot of time must be spent outside of classtime in the lab on your own. However, the course is very valuable to both pre-med students and those only interested in research because the information learned is very practical and the skill learned is very useful. Just beware of the time commitment. The end of the course is a lot of work, so plan your time appropriately, because the final report takes A LOT of time. Barry is super approachable and an excellent instructor."
