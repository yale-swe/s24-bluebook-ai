    "A lowkey and decent class, you read a couple interesting books and hear Professor Weiss talk about what he's an expert in, which can be really interesting. Overall I can't really say if I've tangibly learned anything from the class. It's relatively easy and can be interesting, but was not one of the best classes I've taken.",
    "Drought causes collapse, no argument. I would not take this class again. If you go in expecting to learn about climate change, look somewhere else.",
    "A seminar sized conversation on societal collapse, causation, and resilience.",
    "It is a good course for those looking to learn about history from a different perspective via more quantifiable methods.",
    "Don't take it. This was one of my if not my least favorite course at Yale. Although Prof. Weiss has interesting opinions\/things to say and cares about listening to opinions that differ from his own, the entire premise of this course is his own research on collapse as the result of drought and every class is a disorganized lecture. Despite being a small seminar there is no discussion. Entire books will be assigned for reading and barely discussed. It maybe that I'm not interested in archeology but I did not feel that we engaged with archeology in an interesting way. Very boring. Only take if you really like archeology and even then I wouldn't. It's an easy class to do nothing for if that's what you're looking for."
