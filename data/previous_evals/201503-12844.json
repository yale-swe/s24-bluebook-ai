   "comments": [
    "The material in this class is rather boring to anyone already interested in conservation biology. I took a marine conversation class in high school, and feel that this course was on par with that class. I would recommend it to those who know nothing on the subject. The class requires little work from students throughout the semester except before tests. Low stress, rather bland, and ok science gut if you plan on attending lecture and studying your notes before the test.",
    "A great introduction to conservation biology. Manageable workload and 3 midterms. No final during finals period.",
    "I would recommend Conservation Biology to another student, either as a fifth class or as a way to get a gestalt of conservation theories and practices. The course is not too demanding, and you finish the term much more confident in the effective and ineffective ways to approach sustainability.",
    "Absolutely take this class. Go to the lectures and I promise you will do great. If you skip the lectures, then just really study the slides for Powell's portion and learn the material for Puth's. But there is no reason to skip, you will learn a lot!",
    "This is an absolutely solid science course for non science majors that allows you to engage with a really interesting and serious topic.its appplicable to today's day and to the future and thinking about some of the potential policy hanged that will come out of the climate change talks is also really exciting.",
    "Not my favorite class. There are probably other more interesting science credits to take.",
    "Good class but not a gut. Not a lot of work but exams are hard. Interesting and good for non science majors.",
    "Great class to take if you are interested in the the environment and want a science class that isnt tilacnhce",
    "Absolutely do not take this class. Don't take a gut. Find a well-taught, interesting course that is not this. In fact, it's not even a gut. The exams have extremely vague questions that demand extremely specific answers. The course is not only not an easy A, but also mind-numbingly boring. Lectures move slower than molasses. In a vacuum, the subject matter is interesting, but I've learned more by being an aware reader of newspapers than I have in this course. I literally come away from the class with nothing but what I got from section, because Larry was fantastic.",
    "I would probably recommend this course only for someone who was looking for a science credit that did not involve too much work. It is a mildly interesting course I thought, but it was often hard to be engaged during class.",
    "Very satisfied!",
    "This class is definitely not a gut, but it is a good class course that is not too difficult. It does not require too much work, but the tests are difficult because they require applying what you know to hypothetical cases and this may get confusing near the end as terms become more similar. I would recommend the course.",
    "Good science credit if you're interested in conservation biology. Exams are pretty straightforward (but oftentimes ask application questions rather than testing core concepts). Other assignments are also straightforward. Solid science credit for non-science majors.",
    "Would recommend for a student wanting to take a science credit. Easily manageable amount of work.",
    "Good science credit without too much work. Take it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This course was extremely interesting, thought provoking, and was very well presented.",
    "Don't take it assuming it'll be a fun, relatively easy class.",
    "A good science credit for non-science majors. Workload is low, exams are pretty fair, and section is low-key and actually interesting.",
    "Take it if you need a SC credit. It's okay. Don't take it just for fun. Can be good for Cr\/D",
    "Yes, fairly easy class, but you must study for the exams. Interesting material, but not the most interesting lectures.",
    "So, you're looking for a science credit? Well, here's one! This is, I think, geared towards non-STEM majors, but it's a great course for anyone interested in environmental conservation. This is a great introduction to the topic and how conservation is put in practice. I would definitely recommend this course! There's not a lot of day-to-day work which is nice, but it means that the tests are more valuable, and they aren't super easy. You need to keep up, take good notes, and study. If you do that, though, you should do fine and will learn a lot! The class is taught by two different teachers. Professor Powell is very knowledgable and uses lots of good examples, but his lectures aren't extremely well organized. Professor Puth is energetic and very well organized. I would say shop it! If it piques your interest, go ahead and give it a shot! You might learn something!",
    "Worst class I've taken at Yale. Super boring and disorganized with insane exams. You will regret taking it.",
    "This class gave a good overview of conservation biology. I had never taken a science class before at Yale, and I did not find this class too demanding and did not require more science background that high school biology. The teachers have different teaching methods and different ways they like to ask questions. Linda Puth's exam questions can be challenging as it can be unclear what she is looking for or asking. Her lectures also always run over time",
    "The topics in this course were very interesting, but the tests were a pain. So study beforehand!",
    "If you're a non-major looking for a reasonably interesting, not terribly difficult science credit, this could be a good choice. Conservation biology is an important and timely subject to learn about, and the course provides a fairly comprehensive overview of major themes and topics. That said, there is a significant disparity in the style (and in my opinion, quality) of lectures taught by Dr. Powell and Dr. Puth; Dr. Puth emphasizes concepts and applications, while Dr. Powell is more focused on somewhat mundane facts. The course (generally) feels well paced for non-majors, though it may be helpful to have some background in high school biology for context. With 3 one-hour exams and 2 small projects, the workload is fairly light.",
    "If you want an easy science credit, I'd recommend this class. It's actually pretty interesting and not particularly challenging. I wouldn't say it's TOO easy, but I think it's a lot less work than almost any other science credit.",
    "The class is a lecture about conservation biology. I would recommend it to another student. It is completely manageable with a heavy course load.",
    "Great class, readings aren't too long and are interesting. The tests are very long and sometimes it's hard to tell what exactly they are looking for but definitely take it. Very little work."
