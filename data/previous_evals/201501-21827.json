    "This was a challenging course for me because of the amount of vocabulary\/sentence structures to learn per week. I'd say the number is around 80-120. But Zhoulaoshi is very kind and always willing to meet outside of class. The news articles we read are nice.",
    "Chinese Media and Society was a very good survey of contemporary Chinese social, political, economic, and cultural issues, including the One Child policy and various demographic issues, environmental pollution, senior care issues, and the HIV\/AIDS crisis. We read Chinese-language versions of articles from the New York Times, BBC, and Wall Street Journal about China, supplemented by occasional articles from Chinese sources. We had a fair bit of homework, including three essays, two tests, and a final essay, as well as sentence construction assignments and two oral presentations, but the workload was manageable. Daily vocabulary quizzes helped with retention, and questions about the contents of the reading ensured that we were thinking about what we'd read. On the whole, the class was well-structured and helped give me a deeper understanding of Chinese society. I can't say I learned many specific pieces of information that I didn't already know through English sources, but it's useful to be able to discuss these issues in Chinese. If you're coming off of HBA or PIB, the pace will be slower, but still pretty comparable because you only meet twice weekly.",
    "One of the best high-level Chinese classes. Be prepared for a ton of homework, but the topics you cover are interesting outside the context of the class and you will learn a lot of Chinese too! Also, Zhou laoshi is one of the best Chinese teachers around."
