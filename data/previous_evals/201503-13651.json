   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're looking for an easy A and not much work demanded. That being said, if you want to get something out of the class expect a lot of extra time figuring things out and going through the lecture slides.",
    "It was essentially glorified Googling. Most of the homework is not taught in class so you have to google it. Definitely a good 5th class in terms of work load, and it also refines your Googling skills.",
    "Although this class will introduce you to some of the basic tenets of energy and technology, I would certainly not recommend it. Problem sets include tens of questions, none of which have to do with the material covered in lecture and most of which are simply an exercise in Google and Wikipedia usage. The midterm is very challanging (and difficult to complete within the time allotted). Professor Prober is not a very clear instructor. I thought this would be an interesting and stimulating way to satisfy a science requirement, but it was not.",
    "Problem sets are long, but mostly require just googling the answers to an eclectic collection of questions. Minimal\/easy math. Midterm would have been pretty bad if not for a very lenient curve. Lectures are interesting for the most part, field trips are cool. Prober... is interesting, and obviously very smart, but doesn't always convey the information in the best way and is frankly kind of a dick. He incessantly interrupted student presentations to add additional (irrelevant) information, voice his own opinion, or ask nit-picky questions, and often interrupted guest lecturers and field trip tour guides in a similar manner that was uncomfortable and off-putting. If you're fine dealing with this, take the class I guess, but I can't say I enjoyed this class very much. 4\/10 would not recommend to a friend.",
    "I liked it!",
    "For those interested in the energy industry, this is an excellent introductory course to find out where America is in green tech. It mostly focuses on the science; it avoids politics and only touches on the economics. But for those studying the politics or economics of green energy, having a science background is still definitely useful.",
    "It's hard to summarize this class. On the one hand, much of the material is very interesting, and if you like the topic, you will learn relevant and useful information. On the other hand, those kernels of information will be buried by the hours that you will have to spend sitting in this class while the professor repeats himself, grinding through the useless problem sets, and trying to prepare a group presentation according to the most poorly written sheet of instructions I have ever read. It's a science credit with a good deal of quantitative analysis, and with a little restructuring it could be a really good class. Right now, it isn't."
