   "comments": [
    "Juliana is super enthusiastic, but a very tough grader. She lovessss teaching and is definitely a great help. She encourages class participation and loves interactive activities.",
    "A lot of work, boring, if work hard get fine grade",
    "This is a very well run class with a very reasonable amount of work. You get a very thorough understanding of basic Spanish, with interesting culture and literature included as well.",
    "It's a requirement but this class is very valuable. It definitely improves your Spanish skills.",
    "If you're taking Spanish and you need to fulfill the distribution requirements or just want to learn, Spanish 120 is a good class. I like the fact that it's taught completely in Spanish because that definitely helps you become a better listener and speaker. Even though the work isn't overwhelming, there is a lot of it (worksheets and preparation for each day's class) but it's worth it because it saves so much time going over activities rather than just doing them in the class. I recommend it if you need to or just want to take and learn Spanish.",
    "Spanish 120 is a big jump from 110, and requires more work and studying. I would recommend it to those who did well in their Spanish 110 class.",
    "If you are interested in learning Spanish I would definitely recommend it. Do not be worried about>a Yale credit on a language class. Juliana makes it fun and intellectually stimulating.",
    "Watch out for more homework than spanish 1!",
    "Take this if you want to get your Spanish to a minimal working level.",
    "I definitely recommend Spanish 120. It is an amazing course if you want to improve your Spanish grammar and communication skills.",
    "You learn quite a bit of Spanish. The amount I learned surprised me. Not a super interesting class, but pretty much everything you expect out of language classes."
