   "comments": [
    "YES!!!!!! TAKE IT! So important & relevant and with so many moving parts in the most interesting and fascinating way possible.",
    "If you have any interest in intellectual property at all, you should take this class. It's one of the best I've taken at Yale.",
    "Super recommended, but only if you're genuinely interested in the material! Reading responses every other week ensure that you generally know what you're talking about, and all the material is so interesting and relevant to how we experience IP in the modern age. Love it!",
    "An overview of intellectual property law, from copyright to trade secrets to trademark. Highly recommend, especially if you have taken CPSC 183 or 185, as the structure of this class is very similar to Brad's.",
    "Take this course!! Discussions are great. Six reading responses and a final project. Make sure you do the readings!",
    "CPSC 184 is a wonderufl introduction to the fascinating world o Intellectual Property law. Not only do we touch upon all the major areas- Copyright, Patents, and Trademark, but we also discuss their modern-day implications in class. The once a week seminar was a highlight of my week, where my classmates and I would discuss at length the subtleties and sometimes absurdities in the system. Highly recommended.",
    "If you are genuinely interested in intellectual property law, I would take this course 100%. It's a fun time, the workload is fair and its super engaging. If you just want to work for a startup some day and are looking for a resume item, this is not for you. If you are ready to talk about law and technology technically and seriously, you will have an absolute blast.",
    "Great discussion-based course. The readings are very manageable. Super fun!"
