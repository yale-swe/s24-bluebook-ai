    "Highly recommended. A great course to read foundational literary works and to hone your skill in analytical writing.",
    "Arguably the greatest strength of fall DS Literature is the literature itself. The course covers classics from Homer's Iliad to Ovid's Metamorphoses to Dante's Divine Comedy, a dazzling array that provides not only a solid foundation in classic literature but also a fascinating narrative path that traces through the course. Almost every work was engaging and interesting, although that may have been due to the enthusiasm of Professor Roffman or the chemistry of the discussion section as a whole. Professor Roffman was a phenomenal teacher, passionate about the class and the course material and skilled at gently guiding discussions in a gentle, organic manner. The literature lectures were on the whole well-organized and aided classroom discussion by providing a particular outlook on an aspect of a work. The weakness of the course is really a weakness of DS itself: the lack of time available to examine each book in depth. I would highly recommend DS Literature to interested freshmen; it was the highlight of the fall Directed Studies experience, which as a whole I would hesitate to recommend as enthusiastically. While Literature was a joy, Directed Studies is a package of courses and Philosophy and H&P must be considered individually as well.",
    "If it could be taken without the other DS courses, I'd recommend it; it's by far the best of the three. It knows its goals and it achieves them simply and without drama or flourish.",
    "Do you like lot read? Are you fine reading large portions of books each night? Do you enjoy the ancient classics of Greek and Christian culture? If you answered yes to all those questions then I'd highly advise you to take DS Literature!",
    "This course was a survey of Greek to Renaissance literature that explores the themes of justice, divine piety, honor, and journey. I would recommend the course to anyone who is interested in literature and understanding the origins of many modern questions and themes.",
    "That it is a quick survey of the western canon",
    "I survey course on Western Literature. It goes very quickly and covers a large amount of works. There is a lot of reading and essay writing involved, so if that isn't appealing do not take this course. Also if you are looking for a course that will go in-depth on any of these works, this is not the course for you. If you are looking for a general, but intensive, survey course, then Directed Studies Literature is the way to go.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course for all the above reasons concerning the syllabus and the instructor. These are works that are relatively often already studied in high-school (or at least mentioned), but DS Literature truly gave me countless new perspectives not only on the books themselves, but also on overarching issues that they tackle. My vision of religion or justice as a whole for instance was completely altered and vastly enriched by this course for instance.",
    "Read Odyssey, read Inferno, think about tragedy, the rest is up to you.",
    "Great experience"
