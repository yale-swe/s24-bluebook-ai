   "comments": [
    "Sure, if you're an econ student interested in policy.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class if you're looking to learn about Microfinance and other tools of development. This class involves a lot of reading about specific cases, which lectures are based off of, and a final project in which you design your own intervention.",
    "The class is geared towards explaining how microinterventions are constructed and how they try to mediate potential pitfalls through randomized control experimentation. The final project of creating a randomized control experiment is extremely valuable and gives \"hands-on\" experience in working an experiment.",
    "Take this class if you have taken econometrics and retained the information of that class. It is not listed as a pre-req, but it really should. You must know how to run regressions, understand them, know p-values, t-stats, coefficients, etc. The class gives practical approaches to market failures in the developing world. It is challenging to keep up with the readings, but towards the end, the complete picture of how to approach market failure problems is consolidated.",
    "Do not do this to yourself. It was one of the most boring classes I have taken. I am leaving the class having learned nothing but how to read regression tables.",
    "Eh. The lectures are good, but the problem sets take forever, and the project is incredibly frustrating and kind of a waste of time. There's not much of an overarching theme to the class -- it's just 20-something totally random topics in development. If you like that, take it. I'd cr\/d\/f it, if you can.",
    "An amazing class, but only take it if you're willing to put in the work of doing the reading and working on the project. The workload is INTENSE, but the returns to investing are definitely positive. Just expect to be screwed when the final rolls around if you haven't done the reading or gone to the class. Karlan's the man.",
    "A course that makes you read a large number of economics papers, without assuming that you know any econometrics. However, it would be useful to have had econometrics.",
    "No, unless you must.",
    "This class is good if you are an economics major looking for an inspiring economics class. Unlike many other econ classes, this one will actually teach you something useful and get you involved with the topics. The project can be fun and interesting if you actually dedicate time to it. And the lectures are sometimes interesting. Be warned: it is a lot of work, even the problem sets are difficult, and the final exam is very challenging.",
    "If you are interested in development, absolutely take this class. As you will find out throughout the course, Dean Karlan is one of the leaders of the field, and it was exciting just to hear him talk about the subject. You will learn a tremendous amount about the field.But know what you are getting into. This is not a history course. The papers, problem sets, and the project are all fairly math intensive. it definitely helps to have a background in statistics, and knowing STATA puts you at a huge advantage. There is very little work for the first half of the course, then things pick up really quickly towards the end (problem set #3, project, and final all very close to each other). So if you think you can deal with all of this, go for it. I really enjoyed the class.",
    "I think its one of the best econ classes at Yale. You really learn a lot about experimental methods and it's great at teaching you things about using practical tools.",
    "An absolutely great course in some ways, but frustrating in other ways. It's a course on experimental design and interventions in developing countries. The readings\/lecture material are great (you learn about different interventions across different topics in development - education, health, nutrition, microfinance, agriculture, corruption). The project is a big part of the course, and VERY cool: you get to design your own intervention, get made-up results from the prof\/TAs, and analyze and write up your results. Coolest project I've ever done for a class. BUT the class would really benefit from an optional section, since lecture really doesn't deliver the econometrics info you need for the problem sets and projects, so you have to go wait in line at TA office hours all the time.",
    "If you want a view of the microeconomics of international development (such as designing experiments to evaluate the social impact of a particular policy intervention), take this class. If you are looking for a macroeconomics of international development, consider another class-- like Chris Blattman's \"African Poverty and Western Aid\"Also, I did not take econometrics or statistics before this class -- which made the material difficult. While the classes are not absolutely necessary, if you have not taken the prereqs, make sure you sit down with a student that has at the *very beginning* of the course, go over the tables presented in the reading, and talk about how to read and analyze them carefully.Also note that the way the class is currently structured, almost all of the major assignments fall at the end of the semester. The group project will take over your life for a week (particularly when you are analyzing the data) and it is worth 40% of your grade. The final is worth another 40% and primarily covers the weekly reading. So keep up with the reading -- summarizing main points for each article -- and plan the workload in your other classes accordingly.",
    "It has interesting ideas and concepts, but only take it if you're prepared to take the initiative in finding a theme for the course.",
    "DO IT. The course gives you an overview of policy interventions with regards to a variety of subjects in developing world economics: intrahousehold allocation, agriculture, microfinance (loans, savings, insurance), education, health, corruption, institutions. It looks at policies used at a micro level to affect the lives of the world's poorest people, and really opens your eyes to what poverty alleviation looks like. Not the kind of international development class you usually see in the econ department - much more down to earth.The class also teaches you econometrics, much better than actually taking econometrics does. I went into the class knowing nothing about empirical analysis - and by the end I did the chief data analysis for the group final project, which involves \"implementing an intervention\" and analyzing the fictitious data that the TAs provide you. (That said, you need to take metrics as a co-req, if not a pre-req, or you will make your life miserable, as well as the lives of people in your group for the final project.)It's a decent amount of reading if you do it all. Very few people do, especially because you can essentially just read the abstracts, as almost all the papers are studies of various interventions. Outside of that, there are three problem sets (which take a decent amount of time, but 2 out of 3 are done in groups and are pretty cool), a final project (which is very time-consuming, but also extremely rewarding), and a final exam, which was pretty challenging, but worth it, as it makes you really internalize the material of the course in a productive way. Not an insane amount of work, but you should be willing to do it.Also, Karlan is a great lecturer and a leader in the field,so go to his class and stay awake for the lectures.Only downside of this class: Karlan and the TAs can be extremely mean for no apparent reason. So watch out for that.",
    "Mass cramming at the final period. It will happen.",
    "Great practical econ class. If you pay attention in the lectures and do the reading, you will actually get a lot out of it. Prof Karlan is apparently big in the field and really knows what he's doing. The project seems a little intimidating, but since you're working in groups, it's not that bad. Take it! My favorite econ class so far.",
    "Take it if you are interested in the topic. Be ready to work more than you expect. Tough course but highly rewarding.",
    "Take it, if you're not obsessed with your GPA. There wasn't really a sense of grades throughout the course, but the class is extremely relevant to the world today. The projects were a lot of fun, as long as you delegated tasks within the group properly. Having taken statistics would have been helpful beforehand, but econometrics wasn't essential because the focus was on analyzing studies, not on crunching numbers.",
    "Interesting class. Although it is VERY econometrics heavy so beware that. The problem sets were kinda frustrating and so was the project because the TF's were quite unhelpful. Studying for the final was frustrating because it was very reading-heavy while the rest of the semester you don't need to do any of the readings. All in all I would recommend it if you're super into econometrics.",
    "This was a fun course! I really enjoyed the project- one of the most fun and interesting learning experiences I've had at Yale, though be sure to choose GREAT partners because you will spend a LOT of time working with them. The class kind of needs a section, because it's hard to keep up with readings and to do them on your own, but definitely worth taking. Karlan is a little spacey but a fun lecturer. Take it!",
    "This is a good course for anyone who wants to learn about the causes and barriers to economic development",
    "yes if you really care about developing countries other than China and INdia. neither of these countries were much examined in the class. the class does a better job exploring the issues of reallly poor countries in the sub-saharan regions of Africa in terms of health, Mexico\/south america in terms of credit and savings, and only south asia a little bit in terms of education. negligible mentioning of the BRICs- Brazil, Russia, India, China.",
    "Would definitely recommend it but with caution. Its a lot of work, especially the group component. However, it was really enjoyable and after many sleepless nights you learn a lot.",
    "Probably the class at Yale where I have worked the hardest, but also learned the most. Take it if you want to work hard and learn a lot.",
    "Yes, if you are very interested. It's a lot of work and very different from any other course I've taken at Yale so prepare to be challenged.",
    "Definitely take this class if you like econ and its applications. However, beware if you have not taken any stats classes before, because the class does require you to be able to interpret regression tables.",
    "Econ 325 is a very interesting class that teaches a lot of important topics about development. Just note that this class is mainly based on teaching background information about different topics in developing countries (e.g. microcredit, health, savings) and then uses many experimental studies to back up this theory. I would have very much enjoyed this class IF the grading in the class had not been that DECEIVING. The class starts of easy, and then as the problem sets being, you realize that you don't really know what the professor expects and that the grading is harsh, and subjective (?). This made the group project much less enjoyable than it could have been.",
    "Depends. It is a goof introduction to econ of developing countries, but the lectures are not that interesting and you can learn most of the materials through reading the papers.",
    "I would recommend this course, but students should get ready for some confusion. This course should really require some sort of statistics background, if not an econometrics course. STATA is definitely a plus. You never actually have to use it if you don't know how, but things will be so much easier if you do. Even if you do have the right background for this class, you will probably get frustrated with it. The group project is a ton of work, and your life will get really hard for a couple of weeks.",
    "Interesting class, great professor. One thing though is that there is a lot of group grading, which can make it tough. You also have to do all the readings, since the exam is largely based off of them.",
    "Econ 325 is an introduction to the main results in microeconomics of developing countries. In other words, which anti-poverty\/disease\/illiteracy, etc. interventions work well and which don't? Why do poor people make the economic choices they do? How do norms and institutions interact with economics in developing countries?Don't take this course if you're not willing to slog through econ papers describing interventions. You have to have some interest in how experiments are designed, how statistics are interpreted, etc. to enjoy this course. And don't expect too much insight into macroeconomic issues--those were covered only very briefly. But I'd still recommend the course, although you should consider taking it Cr\/D\/F since the grading seemed really flaky and the class averages were really low (apparently there's a curve, but it's not clear how much).",
    "The readings are fascinating, but the lectures are disorganized and the project is a heck lot of work.",
    "Should probably be called \"Experimental Economics\" because you go over lots of experimental methods, all applied in developing countries. The reading is fascinating. If you're taking this for a grade, have taken Econometrics and Statistics beforehand. A good class to Credit D otherwise, if you get people to agree to do the stat work in your group project. Good class, learned a ton.",
    "This is a great class! Take it if you're interested in the idea of empirically testing development and aid programs. I thought the professor was excellent and the class was highly engaging, so I would definitely recommend it. This class is equally rigorous as others in the econ department and econometrics background is very helpful, so be aware that despite the fun subject matter it's not a gut or an easy A."
