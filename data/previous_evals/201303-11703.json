   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, definitely take this class if you are at all interested in the subject! The professor is so nice, and you go really in-depth with all the ways that mass incarceration could affect inequality (both positive and negative). This class does not feel like a crusade against the prison system, which I greatly appreciated. Instead, it provided a very balanced views of exactly what the effects are, both good and bad. The readings become quite statistics-heavy toward the end, but that is the only tiny complaint that I have.",
    "yeah, great class, take it!",
    "I recommend this class to anyone interested in mass incarceration, especially those who have mostly been exposed to the prison system on a theoretical or political level. This course will give a much-needed quantitative treatment of the problems of mass imprisonment, and provoke interesting discussions. The readings are well-chosen and manageable, even if the midterm and final are predictable and a bit dull. And though Prof. Wildeman can be off-putting at times, his awkward energy is generally endearing.",
    "Yes--This is a really interesting class--definitely heavier on the Sociology than the AFAM, but still great. Only annoying thing is not really knowing how well you're going to do on the writing assignments.",
    "Yes definitely. The progression of the course made a lot of sense. The professor is funny and the class is fun, even at 9:25 in the morning.",
    "I would not recommend this course. I was prepared to love it, but I was disappointedby the lack of respect for anything non-quantitative. I appreciated Professor Wildeman's efforts to teach students with a more qualitative background how to engage with this material, but I did not appreciate his often overt dismissal of students who contributed alternative opinions\/forms of reasoning to class discussion. Overall, the method of this course felt counterproductive, and I think it could be great, but I would recommend taking a different course on crime, mass imprisonment, and inequality if you're interested in the topic because unless you are a quantitative purist, this course will consistently frustrate you.",
    "This is a class about the unexpected and unintended effects of mass incarceration in the US, and how those effects may breed inequality - especially racial inequity.",
    "This class is good. It will provide a sociological look at prisons, so if you're looking for policy, this isn't the class for you. Nonetheless, it's a good way of looking at punishment. The grading is arbitrary and discussion can be kind of cyclical and repetitive, but overall this is a solid seminar.",
    "If you're interested in learning comprehensively about prison stake this course. Great in depth analysis of the course. If you're trying to come to grand conclusions about the incarceration system, don't take this course. Most of it was intuitive and overalls you just learn that prisons are bad for society. I felt there was very little room for writing creativity.",
    "Great course! A lot of different angles on the same question. If you're interested in the theory of power structures, though, this is not so much for you - very much trying to put the science back in social science here.",
    "I thought that it was an interesting class with good readings and a good professor. It'd be a great fifth class.",
    "Definitely take it (if you can get in)! Professor Wildeman makes it easy to deal with the early class time. You will learn so much about the different effects of mass incarceration on inequality, but from a very quantitative point-of-view. How much you get out of this class depends heavily on how much work you put in, especially since so much of your grade depends on just a midterm paper and a final paper.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class -- it's one of the most solidly rewarding courses I've taken at Yale. The course expectations are fair, and the class is designed very intelligently -- regardless of your background, there's plenty of room to have a rewarding experience. A small note of personal privilege: please, for heaven's sake, try to check your righteousness at the door. I enjoyed the seminar immensely, but got pretty tired of the two or three crusaders who tried to play their own experiences, politics, or personal philosophies to frame themselves as God's gift to justice. These are intense questions and enormous problems, and everyone with half a brain knows they have to be addressed; approach the subject with humility and a commitment to learning about the facts of the situation, and you'll be a blessing to your fellow classmates (and probably learn more yourself).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You will learn so much about the effects of mass incarceration in ways that you would never have thought of."
