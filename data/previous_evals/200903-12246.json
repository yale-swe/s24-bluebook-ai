    "If you are interested in literature - take it!",
    "The course offers excellent readings, to which you need to write a weekly posting of respond, and you have much freedom to talk about the readings on class. It offers freshman the opportunity to organize and construct their seminar discussions by themselves. Field trips to libraries and to be at somewhere you feel really foreign are also life-enriching experiences.The most important thing was I didn't feel much pressure in taking the class as I really enjoyed all the readings and assignment. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "This was a very pleasant class. The readings were mostly modern novels that were entertaining, well-written, and interesting. Professor Kaplan is a very good writing teacher and pleasant to have in a conversation. One thing to be aware of going into the class is that it really is a discussion class, so don't expect to leave with big conclusions or a wide base of new knowledge and skills. Butif that doesn't bother you, it's a very nice class with engaging subject matter.",
    "The course looks at \"The Experience of Being Foreign\" from many perspectives: exiles, immigrants, refugees, expatriates. The dichotomies of East and West, North and South, old and new, past and present are brought together and then dissected. I would emphatically recommend the course because it allows the student to look at literature from a broader perspective than the formalist view so often used in typical English classes. The writing assignments were also varied and interesting, and the workload was literally the perfect amount."
