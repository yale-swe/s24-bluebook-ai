    "Boring. Not recommended.",
    "No because it he is not a good teacher",
    "Yes, as long as you haven't taken AP chem in high school. I took honors chem and found that the first half of this class was mostly review but the second half was all new. It is a pretty easy science credit but it is at 9am on science hill...",
    "A good refresher course for Chemistry for students who have had some exposure to the science before. However, the class moves a bit too fast for concepts to be developed further and understood students who have not studied it in high school might not get too much out of it.",
    "Do not take this Chemistry course if you have little knowledge of Chemistry. It seems like it would be a good course for non science majors but that is not true because you end up taking the class with people who took 2+ years of chemistry in high school.",
    "Yes, definitely take this course with Dr.G. he makes chemistry very interesting.",
    "Great science credit! Dr. G is extremely helpful if you don't understand a concept. Workload is pretty light. The only downside would probably be having to go up science hill at 9 am.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chemistry 101 to a another student because chemistry is interesting and has many applications and Dr. G is a great teacher.",
    "Yes, surely",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I didn't remember any of the chemistry I had learned from high school, but I wanted a good way to fulfill my science credit and learn something new. I'm glad I took this course. It's strength is really just the way it's taught - kind of like a lecture, but small enough to be a seminar so that Dr. G actually knows who you are and is sure that everyone gets what's going on. Dr. G was wonderful. He's a great teacher, easy to understand, eager to answer questions and repeat things - basically he just really cares about his students and WANTS them to understand what he's teaching. He does a lot of examples and makes class notes available online so as to facilitate learning. The weakness is that it's at 9:00 on science hill, haha. But I suppose that weeds out the class and helps keep it smaller\/more like a seminar, because the people who are there actually want to be there. Great class! Take it! But be wary - you actually need to go to class and take notes and work on the problem sets. You can't just snooze through the class or anything. But if you work and come to class, it'll be great.",
    "Good option for non-science majors to get a science requirement out of the way. Time and location are hard to handle (early on science hill).",
    "A basic chemistry class that reminds a lot of highschool courses. But if you are interested in a solid course with manageable workload, then take it."
