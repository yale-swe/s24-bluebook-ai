   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to others. If at all possible, get into the seminar. You will learn more and enjoy yourself more.",
    "Yes, I recommend this class.",
    "It is necessary to take this class if you want to eventually take higher level (more interesting) economics classes, so though it can be dull it is a necessary starting point for future studies of economics.",
    "Boring. Very boring. The lack of algebra makes the discussion of some of the topics frustratingly prolonged. The concepts were interesting, but the pace of the class was too slow. Not the best or most engaging class, but the topics covered should be understood by everyone. The online notes are very useful, but it's still important to pay at least some attention during lectures.",
    "Great entry level course, giving you a strong foundation in the basics of economics",
    "Definitely take this class even if you don't need it.",
    "You will learn the basics of Economics, nothing particularly insightful, but it provides a solid foundation for future classes. A relaxing and important way to start the major.",
    "This is basically what you would expect from an introductory microeconomcis course. The material may seem mundane and simplistic at times. However, that being said, I would definitely recommend it and especially to a prospective econ major. Even though I tested into intermediate microeconomics, I chose to take this course and was very glad I did so. There was definitely new material we learned that was not covered in the AP courses. Plus, it is also nice to get a sense of the economics department before fully committing to the major.",
    "I would not recommend this course for a fellow student, unless he\/she has already studied economics in high school.",
    "Not the most interesting course, so get it out of the way as early as possible if you need it.",
    "Nice course if you want a brief intro about general Micro Economics.",
    "Economics is an important subject to learn in today's world. That being said, ECON 115 was terrible. I left every class confused and stressed and I felt I spent ALOT of time trying to teach my self rather than revising notes. Professor Udry, though a genuinely great guy, pretty much invented his own acronyms\/ jargon and never explained them so many of us spent much of lecture just trying to understand those rather than the actual concepts. Definitely try to be in a good section, particularly the head TA's section, form and ECON study groups and go to as many of the Residential College Tutoring sections in order to do problem sets. If you really need a QR, I would consider shopping other courses. Don't rush into this one!!",
    "sure! not too much work!",
    "ECON 115 was a really great class, whether you are becoming an econ major, or just want to fulfill your QR credit. I would highly recommend it to anyone. It was not at all a lot of work or a high time committment; however, I learned a lot from this class and thought it was engaging, useful, and fun.",
    "I would recommend the class to other students. The class is interesting and applicable to real life, in one way or another.",
    "You know, it is what you think it's going to be, big, boring, informative. I took it because I thought it was one of those subjects everyone should take at least once in their lives. Plus, it's a QR.",
    "You really cannot go wrong with either the lecture or ECON 110, both will definitely help you, but if you want to just get the material without worrying too much about the grading curve, I would recommend you take the lecture over the seminar.",
    "It's the intro micro lecture--don't expect a life-changing experience. But it's a necessary class for many majors at Yale and, honestly, offers basic information about markets that most everyone should learn. As someone with no econ experience whatsoever, it was a bit disorienting to be in such a large class where the professor can't give individual attention. Go to lecture and find a good TF for section, and you'll do fine in the course. Also, the professor loves to talk about developmental economics, so be prepared for him to relate everything to farming in Africa.",
    "A great introductory econ course. I recommend it if you need a QR and are interested in the subject or if you are thinking about majoring in economics.",
    "I LOVED this class! It made me wish I had taken intro micro freshman year so I would've had more time to take other econ classes. Prof. Udry is an amazing lecturer. He reviews the material from the previous class in the next class, makes sure to look around the room to see if people are confused, always takes questions, and goes through the material very clearly. Some people were bored when he went over the same concept from the previous lecture as review, but frankly I thought this really helped to solidify concepts and made me feel like I had a better grasp of the material. He makes jokes in class and really just wants you to be as excited about econ as he is. Definitely take this class. Without a doubt one of my favorite ones at Yale!That said, I have never taken an econ class before this, so I don't know how it compares to AP micro or any high school classes. But for someone who knows no econ, this class was accessible and amazing! I took this class for fun this semester and am so glad I did!",
    "If you want a basic economics vocabulary or are interested in studying economics, definitely take this course!",
    "Read the book BEFORE lecture, actually go to the lectures and take notes just so you are familiarized with the material covered on the PSETS, go to your section, and if your TF sucks, find a way to switch to a good one. Go to office hours if you are having trouble. This course has a challenging curve since a lot of people have already taken economics in high school, so you need to do very well on the Midterm and Final if you want to get an A. The psets are graded fairly easily.",
    "You gotta take it if you wanna major in econ so... yeah I would recommend it. However, the seminar might be better",
    "Don't take it unless you absolutely have to.",
    "Econ 115 is really not so great. You will learn the basic principles of micro, but it's not presented in an exciting way.",
    "A good way to start learning about economics at Yale. The class is a bit large so the focus of learning material is largely on you. I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "This is a huge introductory economics class, so what do you expect? Sometimes it feels like you are riding the Magic School Bus with Udry, because he is, indeed, a barrel of laffs, but he is pretty engaging, which means a lot when you're sitting in a giant auditorium with 400 people. But I probably wouldn't recommend this class unless you are majoring in Econ., are considering an EPE major, or like goats.",
    "ECON 115 is a large, lecture based course that covers basic microeconomics material. The course material is not difficult but the constant clashes between the way of the professor and the way of the T.A. results in massive confusion. Overall the professor is good but the mass quantity of students makes it a bad class to take. If you need to do it to meet a major requirement treat this class like a band-aid something that should be done fast and early. If you are trying to meet a QR requirement then take other more interesting classes such as statistics. If you end up taking it I would recommend printing out the notes and writing on printed handouts and ALWAYS GO TO SECTION! It may sound terrible but the TA's are actually helpful and since they grade your midterms and finals I would primarily listen to them.",
    "The large lecture format is definitely not the most conducive way to study economics. No matter how good the lecturer is (and Chris Udry is not bad), most people in a large lecture hall end up spending most of their time surfing the internet during the lecture. Do take it if you're interested in Econ, but make sure you have enough self-discipline to actually pay attention in class.",
    "Intro microeconomics. I would, simply because it's pretty heavily curved and it's nice to take a humongous lecture. Really useful knowledge and a requirement to take a lot of Yale's courses.",
    "Being in lecture with 400+ other people is like being in a herd of cattle, but Udry did a good job all things considered. Take it if you've gotta take it or if it interests you. It's not a great class, but it's a staple.",
    "Not extremely inspiring, but I'm glad to have exposed myself to the concepts of microeconomics. I find it frustrating how we waste so much time trying to use calculus ideas without explicitly mentioning them, but I guess there's nothing that can be done about that since it's an introductory course. It's also easy to have impersonal experience in such a massive lecture.",
    "Easy to fall behind in this class. All in all, not too difficult or too easy. Didn't require daily input of effort but a lot of cramming near exam times.",
    "Large lecture, moves relatively fast, problem sets are much more difficult than lecture so they're pretty annoying. Curve is horrible in such a large class.",
    "yup",
    "A solid introduction to basic microeconomics and academics at Yale. Frustrating at times because of its avoidance of calculus and material that is not always backed up by the readings. Problem sets and tests are fair. Overall, recommended, if only to understand at least how economic institutions function at a more theoretical level.",
    "Economics 115 is an intro course for microeconomics. It's a prereq for the econ major and is also a good intro course if you think you might be interested in econ.",
    "It is a survey class of basic microeconomics without calculus, taught in a lecture hall of over 400 students. If you are the kind of person who can't find the necessary support from your classmates, then this kind of course will be harder, as it is so impersonal. But, if a large lecture is your style, this will be a good course and it is a prerequisite for some really interesting other courses.",
    "Yes. This is a very standard intro to econ course. I found it interesting.",
    "Interesting class that will most likely be helpful in the future. Sometimes the lectures got a bit dry, but the material was definitely worth learning. I do with that the lectures corresponded more with the psets and the midterm\/final, but I don't regret taking the class.",
    "Only if their true aspiration was to become an econ major. Definitely not an enjoyable course otherwise.",
    "I would summarize it as an intro course to microeconomics (which I had already taken before) but it goes into much more detail. I would recommend it completely even if you've already taken the course before because it was very helpful and teaches more things than (at least) mine did.",
    "Try to get in the seminar if you can, lecture is awful",
    "Pretty interesting class if you plan on majoring in ecnomics. Problem sets every week which are not too bad but can be difficult at times. Its very tough to get an A, but pretty easy to get a B. Overall pretty good course.",
    "I would summarize it as a necessary evil. A lot of students take it because they think they'll be Econ majors or because the need the QR credit. I found it really difficult and not well-taught on the whole. I would absolutely not recommend it to another student.",
    "Hate it. Hate it. Hate it.",
    "Take it - it's an essential education for anyone, irrespective of academic affiliation or interests.",
    "-terribly structured, boring and a terrible prerequisite. I really hope econ at yale gets better. I would not suggest this class to anyone at all unless they just needed it as a pre-req",
    "I really enjoyed this class! I had never taken any sort of Econ class before and I feel I gained a solid foundation in microeconomics in a short period of time. Professor Udry is a great professor who is well-organized, enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and a good communicator. I highly recommend this course!",
    "I wish I had taken the lecture. I don't feel I have learned the material, and I am just cramming to regurgitate information for the midterm and final.",
    "Econ 115 is a good way to get started with Economics even if you have no prior background. It is fairly straightforward. If you are looking to see if you like Econ, this is a class to take.",
    "Not hard at all, don't need to go to lecture if you don't want to. Section helps answer the p sets and the exams are fair",
    "Yes, but with reservations. It's a good basic introduction to microeconomics, but not one of Yale's greatest courses. If you do plan on taking it, Professor Udry is probably your best choice.",
    "take it if you like econ",
    "ECON 115 is a good introduction to microeconomics, including its many applications across various fields. It's designed to be a gateway to different types of economics, and definitely leads nicely into macro. The course certainly had more breadth than my high school AP micro class, and it was a lot less biased. The workload isn't bad, but that means that it's deceptive--sometimes, due dates snuck up on me and I found myself working on a problem set at 2 am. The class isn't very theoretical, which disappointed a lot of economics enthusiast. That being said, if you like graphs and equations, this is the class for you. As far as whether or not I would actually recommend it, here's my take: If you need to take it because you need it for you major, you don't have much choice. It is what it is. It will not be a fun or exciting experience at all, but it also won't be awful. Professor Udry is a good lecturer, and he tried to be engaging. He definitely made interesting--and sometimes even amusing--what would otherwise have been a dry subject.",
    "I think Intro to Micro is a class that everyone at Yale should take just to be an informed world citizen, and I think this class made economics very straightforward and enjoyable.",
    "Yes. If you want to be an Economics major, take this course.",
    "Nothing too fascinating, but worth taking for the background in economics. Lectures moved slowly, which is either good news or bad news depending on how you go about things. One problem set a week, a midterm, and a final, all fairly straightforward.",
    "Econ is EXTREMELY boring. Like you will fall asleep in your seat at least once during the lecture, I guarantee no matter who is teaching it or how interested you are. That being said, it's one of those things you just need to do because it's a prerequisite for a lot of majors--Global Affairs, EPE, yada yada. Just take it ASAP seriously! Also please go to all your sections you will really regret it if you don't.",
    "Econ 115 is a fairly generic introduction to economics course. If you took AP Econ in high school, it is a nice easy review. If not, they jump into theory fairly quickly, which can be a bit confusing. Having a grade only based on the midterm, final, and problem sets is a bit stressful, but overall I'm glad I took this course.",
    "you know exactly what you are getting into with ECON 115 - this class isn't great but in ways still worth taking and not terribly difficult",
    "difficult somewhat boring class but gives intro to econ major",
    "It is the stereotype. Large class, somewhat dry presentation, interesting material (if you like Economics) and entry level. It is a class everyone should take to have a rudimentary understanding of economics, but it is also a class no one should expect to love as it is basic and not that stimulating. Don't expect too much work, just aweekly problem set, midterm and final (if you go to section, the problem sets are pretty easy). Udry does a fine job, but definitely doesn't go above and beyond.",
    "Definitely take the class even if you've taken high school economics; the math is probably more complicated than what you've seen before. Although lecture is sometimes ridiculously boring and the psets are way harder than what is discussed in class, the tests themselves aren't too hard.",
    "This is a fairly solid and comprehensive introduction to microeconomics, and it's close to a must-take for prospective econ majors. The material's generally straightforward and the homework load is light (about 2 hours a week). Some words of caution, though: this class is much more popular than it ought to be. While it's important for everyone to understand how the economy works, reading a decent book will get the concepts across. Econ 115 falls into a sort of gray area between the qualitative and quantitative approaches. On the one hand, most of the conceptsare taught in terms of watered-down mathematical models with little historical\/case study background. On the other, any words pertaining to calculus (\"derivative,\" \"integral,\" etc.) are officially taboo, so we're stuck with proving the product rule using areas of rectangles on a demand curve (ahem, line). The lectures are also painfully slow, so bring a good read.In summary, if you're planning to major in econ and you're not ready for intermediate, take it--it's pretty good. Otherwise, be sure you're legitimately interested in the subject and don't mind 115's approach to it.",
    "I would only recommend it if you are mathematically inclined or if the subject genuinely interests you. Not an easy class.",
    "Take it! It is an interesting way of viewing the world.",
    "If you are looking to learn economics better, take this; it could go a number of different ways with your grade, though, so be careful.",
    "Extremely easy class.",
    "Great class where you learn a lot. Udry is amazing and while the course material is interesting but somewhat challenging at times, there's plenty of help given by Udry and the TFs.",
    "Very good intro class! Take it!",
    "Yes, if really want\/need to take Econ, take it.Even if you haven't taken econ before (unlike 90% of the rest of the class) you'll probably do fine and you'll end up learning a lot.",
    "An introduction to economics.Super useful when you listen to the news. I think everyone should take economics classes, because it really changes the way you view politics, business, and basic purchasing choices.",
    "This is a very good intro class. Weekly problem sets do not take too long and the course covers a lot of topics effectively.",
    "This is definitely a worthwhile class to take. If you took AP Micro Economics, this class will cover some topics you might have missed. Even if you are not going to major in Economics, this class was very useful in helping to understand the basics.",
    "This is a great class actually, despite what a lot of people say. I learned SO MUCH, and at times it can be kind of a fun and new math. The first half of the course is the hardest because you are figuring out how to speak the \"economic language\" but once you get the hang of it, everything in the second half of the course comes much easier.",
    "This was a pretty solid intro to micro course. Sometimes topics discussed would be a little confusing, but ta's were good about answering questions, and there were opportunities in section to go over the course material. I especially enjoyed Udry's references to Africa and his printed shirts. It shows that he really cares about economics.",
    "Econ 115 is a basic, intro to microecon lecture. Expect a HUGE class, expect people who have already taken econ to be sleeping in lecture and getting As on problem sets and exams (welcome to yale!) You can't expect too much engagement between professor and student during lecture because the class is so big. Problem sets were manageable (1 per week) and graded pretty leniently by TAs. Your success and level of engagement in this class may depend on your TA because you will most likely interact more with him\/her than the professor.Relative to the microecon seminar (110), this course has a much nicer curve and doesn't go as in depth with the material. So if you're choosing between the seminar and the lecture, consider how you are balancing your courseload and whether you prefer learning in a bigger or smaller environ,ent.",
    "Slow, but easy if you've ever worked with numbers. The information I learned was useful, but the toughest part of the class is going to class (because it's so slow).",
    "You spend the first half of the course going over how to derive a supply and demand function. The course gets lost for a few weeks, but when you actually derive it via indifference curves, it feels pretty good.Then, after the midterm, we moved on from perfect competition to general market failures. This included monopoly, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, externalities, and public goods. The second half of the course was much more interesting and relevant that the first half of the course. I really liked the professors talk about poverty at the end of the class in December. It felt like a Ted Talk - very interesting.",
    "\"A class you can get either a lot or little out of, depending on the amount of work you put into it but get a good grade no matter what\"I would recommend ECON 115 to students who need it as a pre-requisate for majors or higher level ECON classes or if you're interested in a broad overview of Economics.",
    "Yes, it's a good introduction to the basics of micro and it's not too difficult.",
    "I thought this was a really good course. Whether you want to major in econ or are looking at this class as an elective, I'd say take it. the tests take a bit of studying, but the overall workload isn't bad. Professor Udry makes lecture fun.",
    "Yeah. You will learn a lot in this class, but it's not exactly easy, especially if you've never taken econ before. There's a lot of material to study for the midterm and final.",
    "I would recommend 115 if you really want to major in economics. The class itself is pretty boring, but also very easy to study up on by yourself.",
    "I would recommend this class if they are just interested in learning the basics of microecon.",
    "ECON 115 is a solid introduction to the concepts of microeconomics: it can be a bit dry at times, but real-world applications help make the class engaging. Recommended if you want to take higher-level economics or wish to become more knowledgeable on the nitty-gritty of how the economy works.",
    "It was interesting, but VERY slow and at times the basic math will make you wish it were an upper level class with calculus.However, the curve is pretty mean, so I suggest doing this credit\/D\/Fail",
    "The concepts you learn in this course are pretty important to understand. A lot of people make decisions based on completely false economic assumptions. So I recommend taking this. The workload is average, but don't think you don't have to show up to lecture, or you'll be cursing yourself by midterm time.",
    "Of course! You would have to take it as a Yale student...everyone are going to, I would say there are ups and downs, but overall it becomes more interesting in the end.",
    "Definitely recommended. Udry is a great professor for Econ 115. Although it's a big lecture, he stops often to take questions and is highly approachable after class. There is a certain amount of dryness to the course material by its nature, but Udry does a good job making it interesting. Most importantly, he explains things very well and does a lot of review every class. The material is important for a basic economics foundation or to take future economics courses and the problem sets and exams are based heavily on class material. Go to section- it'll help with the psets.",
    "I would recommend 115 to another student. I think knowing economics is so useful in life, and just after taking this introductory course I already look at certain things in life differently. I also definitely understand more about what I read in the news than I ever did before.",
    "Honestly just take this course. You'll need to take some sort of economics class eventually, and this isn't that bad. The material is pretty dry, but it's not difficult.",
    "It's a good introduction to the subject, and I would definitely recommend taking it with Udry. I thought econ might be dull and math-heavy, but it wasn't at all and it was actually very interesting to be exposed to another way of seeing things.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you are looking to fulfill a requirement or pre-requisite. The class is quite dry, and the material is not taught in enough depth to be interesting. That said, it is not very hard, and with a minimal amount of work, you can be well on your way.",
    "Good intro class, minimal work. The oftentimes difficult PSets we could collaborate on, so that helped cut down some of the difficulties. Lectures could be dry, but the slides were scanned and posted online-which was an absolute godsend. Udry was a fun professor, and if you were the least bit interested in econ, you'd find class to be enjoyable. The curve was great too-40% A's, 50% B's, 10% C's and lower. You'd have to actively fail. The midterm and final were conquered with massive cramming. Make sure you have a good grasp on math in general, but calc isn't necessary.If you're considering econ, take this class. If it doesn't kill your interest by the end of the semester, good luck in macro.",
    "Definitely a great class. I won't lie--it's hard, but it's hard in a way that changes the way you think. But as long as you're willing to take on a challenge, you'll be fine. 90% of the class gets an A or a B, so you can'treally end up with a bad result. Plus, Udry is great, and so are all of the TFs! So there's so much help available.",
    "Yes. I waited until Junior year to take this because I kept hearing scary things about Micro, and in reality, it was a really painless class that I wish I had taken earlier.It's useful stuff to know, and it's really not that bad at all.",
    "I would tell a fellow student, \"If you need a QR credit and want to learn about how to be an educated citizen, this is a good course to take. Don't take it for fun. It is not fun. Take it for a major or a QR.\"",
    "It is your classic intro to micro course. There is really not much else to say. If you have an analytical mind i.e. feel like you are good in math and stuff, this class should be very easy and enjoyable.",
    "I felt like this class was like a rough sample of Econ from every layer. It starts to look at Econ with every day examples, messes with Econ a little more by throwing out assumptions to make the imaginary world of Econ, and then probes Econ a little further with graphs, algebra, and concepts that introduce the higher level economics. I'd recommend this class for those who want to get a representative taste of Econ.",
    "A VERY basic introduction to economics. I would recommend Micro if you like and are interested in economics. Even though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an intro course, Professor Udry does a good job of showing a concept\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real world applicability.",
    "You're probably gonna have to take it, so take it. It's not super hard, but you have to do well on the one midterm and final because that's 80% of your grade.",
    "Necessary evil. Know what you're getting yourself in to. It's not impossible but just be aware that it's a massive class that isn't riveting but it is something that most people should take along with intro Macro to have a baseline understanding of the way that economics works.",
    "I liked microecon because I do think it provides a new perspective on how to view the world and decisions we make. The material could be a little dry at times, but if students commit to doing the work and learning the material, is a good foundation course. Udry's pretty great.",
    "It's a pretty good class that covers information that every college student should know. The material covered is not the most interesting but it's not boring either. I'd recommend it just because you should probably know this stuff before you graduate.",
    "Yes. This is an interesting class. Take it if you want to learn basic economics. Udry is cool.",
    "Yes, because it is the most basic economics course and everyone should take in order to understand the world better.",
    "Take it!",
    "i would definitely recommend this class. If you're strong in math (or at least marginally better than decent), you'll rock this class.",
    "Not the most mind-blowing course, but take it if you have to. Don't expect to learn anything that can be applied in the real world, though.",
    "This is a solid, enjoyable, introductory course, taught by someone who clearly enjoys what he is doing. You should do well in this course if you go to all of the classes offered and do the problem sets carefully. The sectionals are optional but the instructor says \"you would be foolish not to go.\" He is dead right. Find a study partner or team and do the problem sets together, which is encouraged, although the work you finally submit must be your own. This will give you a better understanding of the material as well as good grades on the problem sets, which count for 20% of the final grade. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn some important lessons about economics and is prepared to do the work.",
    "Super boring even though I actually thought the material itself was pretty interesting. The problem is having the same things repeated over and over again. At least for me, there was also this strange phenomenon where he would make the same graph over and over and over, but every time after the first time I would be like \"Oh, we already learned this\" and not pay attention, so then when I started studying for the final I'd realize that I didn't actually understand the graph. Psets didn't require you to learn anything because they were so short and you could as for help.",
    "I would recommend this class. I think it is better than the lecture especially if you put in a little effort. Your grade corresponds to your effort and that is all you can ask for in a Yale College course.",
    "The material is dull and repetitive at times, but is often more engaging. I would recommend it to another student because it lays the groundwork for more interesting material and is pretty easy.",
    "Good course for content, not so great for participation or involvement.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone. I thought the material was interesting.",
    "I would only recommend econ if you're genuinely interested in the subject. Do not take it if you're taking it just for general knowledge. If it's required for your major but you're not that interested in it, make sure to attend all classes and if you're having difficulty, get a tutor! It's easy to not pay attention in the class because of course material and the size of the lecture.",
    "ECON 115 in the fall is a pretty good intro course. Professor Udry, for teaching such a large lecture class, is actually pretty engaging and very friendly. There is one problem set a week (usually around 5-6 questions), they are graded fairly easily, and there are lots of resources (office hours, TAs) to help with them. They also drop the two lowest scores. I would recommend you attend lectures, as all the material is from the lectures and not the book. Also, be aware that if you take this course in the fall, the curve is much less forgiving since lots of freshmen who just took AP Micro are all in this class. However, overall not a bad intro course.",
    "I would recommend the course but not my particular teaching assistan.",
    "Its a good class and a prerec for Econ and other majors. Good for some general knowledge about how markets work",
    "I would recommend this course, it is a course everyone should take before graduating. If you take the lecture, you can easily just get the lecture notes online and only go to section and never attend the lecture because sometimes the lecture is repetitive and soporific.",
    "Sure, if you want to take other econ courses, this is a good place to start.",
    "As an introductory microeconomics course, this class could have easily generated a number of horror stories. But thankfully, I found this to be a clear, focused, and enjoyable introduction to the world of economics. Having never seen a supply or demand curve in my life, I definitely felt like I was miles behind the other students at first, but over the course of the semester, I felt like I was able to develop a semi-firm grasp of econ that has not only helped my quantitative reasoning skills, but also allowed me to view the world from a new perspective. Compared to my classmates, I found the workload and the material to be tougher than average, but that may just be a function of my limited background. For a large lecture course though, Econ 115 proved to be an interesting and relatively painless class.",
    "Take this class for a basic understanding of economics but keep in mind that you need to do the work on a day to day basis to succeed. If you fall behind, you'll have a really hard time catching up.",
    "Only take this course when you know you want to\/need to. As a first semester freshman interested in poly sci and global affairs, I made the mistake of taking it alongside uber-econ focused freshman and wish I had thought my decision through.",
    "Standard intro econ class. Take it with Udry, he's great. I've heard horrible things about Weese.",
    "Not a ton of work, the problem set isn't bad if you go to lectures. Be careful skipping lectures because it is difficult to get caught back up.",
    "Take the seminar class (Econ 110) if you know that you are the type to fall asleep in a huge lecture class right after lunch. It's a great class if you've never done economics before.",
    "This is one of those courses that most people are going to take regardless of what is said about it. Economics 115 is really what you make it, it can be absolutely horrible or a decent experience.",
    "I would recommend it because, even though it is boring at times, it is a good class to take and learn while at Yale.",
    "Only take this if you absolutely have to because of the Econ major requirement.. otherwise it is just not an enjoyable class and not worth your work.",
    "Everyone says Econ is important to know, but I think I would have been better off not taking this class. Don't waste your credits on it unless it's required for your major. Notes were confusing and lecture was unhelpful. The first half of the semester was especially difficult, coming from someone with no prior knowledge of Econ (I had never seen a supply and demand graph before). If you just do your problem sets and study the notes, you probably won't be ready for the final exam.",
    "I would! It is a great intro to microeconomics. The wide concepts and arguments on each side (these concepts don't work! Yes they do!) are clearly explained and returned to over and over again. You leave the class with the key concepts solidly embedded in your head.",
    "This was a well-designed and well-taught course. Professor Udry was an excellent professor. Engaging professors are essential in large lecture courses. Udry taught the material clearly and made the class enjoyable to attend.",
    "Basic introduction to Economics. Helpful if you are looking to start somewhere.",
    "I thought Econ was hard, but mostly due to my lack of experience in maths or economics in general. The material was interesting though not necessarily applicable, especially because it's all theoretical and one-dimentional, although vital as a basis for understanding future economics courses. I would try to take the seminar, but did not mind this class at all. It was good to get out of the way first semester of freshman year.",
    "Yes. Tough class but worth it",
    "ECON 115 serves its purpose, and provides a good introduction to microeconomics. However, don't expect it to do anything else. The problem sets are every week, but are not a huge deal. It can be easy to decide to skip lecture because there are so many students, but don't make this mistake. Because there are so many students, it's easy to get in the B\/A- range, but much harder to score in the A range.",
    "Yeah, it was pretty good. It's a good way to get a QR out of the way, and probably is a class everyone should take.",
    "I would recommend Econ 115 as a broad survey course for various topics of interest in economics. I would recommend skipping the optional section meetings.",
    "What you would expect from an intro micro class. I would recommend it to a friend.",
    "Not an easy class or the best-taught, but teaches essential principles than everyone needs to know. However, absolutely try to take the seminar or place into a higher-level econ course if you can.",
    "A good introduction into the idea of a perfectly competitive market and why this market nevertheless never works in practice.",
    "This class is excellent. The course material is fascinating, and is taught engagingly. Professor Udry is brilliant! The workload is absolutely manageable. The weekly problem sets are challenging but never frustrating. The exams are pretty straightforward, with one or two tricky questions. The sections are very helpful, particularly for the problem sets. I thoroughly enjoyed this class!",
    "Great for an intro lecture. Udry is great, very entertaining personality. Sometimes exam questions are a little funky though.",
    "If you did not take Econ in high school and do not have a burning desire to take Introductory Microeconomics immediately upon arriving on campus, I do not recommend taking this course first semester freshman year. Although the curve is touted as a godsend, it certainly was not an easy A type class. Also, with the final worth 50%, it's all up in the air until that last day, which can be stressful to say the least.",
    "Intro to Microecon was a very well-taught class instructed by Professor Udry, a development economist. Udry is one of the best professors I've had at Yale (I'm a premed science major). He reviews material from the previous lecture at the start of each class, which is incredibly helpful and allows you to see the connections in econ concepts. He also took care to organize his lectures, gave us access to old exams, and designed fair psets. Lastly, he was a really enthusiastic professor, and clearly enjoyed making connections to the real world and his experiences as a development economist. I probably appreciated this more since I'm interested in global health, but it's so nice to go to a class where the professor is excited to share the material with you.The class itself is standard: psets each week, a midterm and final. Section was sort of useful. To do well you have to have a good understanding of and be able to memorize graphs. The scariest thing about this class is that the midterm and final are worth 30% and 50% of your grade, respectively, and the class has a hard curve since it's so huge, it's easy to be average. So be careful and make sure you have time to study.",
    "I would recommend this class because I think that Econ is an important subject to take at some point. Its really helpful to have friends in the class though because the material can be hard to understand.",
    "Economics 115 is the the go-to lecture course for Introductory Microeconomics. It is very interesting and I definitely learned a lot about economics and the world I live in. Don't be deceived by the curve or the fact that Professor Udry drops the two lowest Problem Set grades. Work on every problem set with a group of friends, study from the past midterms and finals and you will be in a good place by the end of the semester.",
    "I think every student should take 115 in their stay at Yale. CHanges the way you see things in the real world.",
    "I would really recommend this class to anyone thinking about majoring in economics or never having thought about economics at all. This class was a great intro to economics, what an intro should be, and it is a great gateway into the major and what it has to offer. I looked forward to this class and the homework was not a lot, but it was enough to really help reinforce the facts. I would take it!",
    "Don't take it. It is impossible to do well with that many people in the class.",
    "It's a great intro course if you're interested in economics.",
    "I would not recommend Economics 115 to a fellow student. Ever. If you can't get into the seminar (Econ 114), wait for next semester. The work is not incredibly challenging nor voluminous, but you won't learn very much, will be confused and flustered often, and will be very bored.",
    "I would recommend Economics 115 to another student, because the course offers an essential introduction to economics.",
    "yes",
    "It is very challenging but a much needed class for those interested in the subject.",
    "It is a good introductory course, but the final is harder than you would think.",
    "The course title is pretty self-explanatory: it's an intro micro class, and it doesn't go very in-depth. It was interesting stuff about 50% of the time (the rest of the time was spent explaining fairly simple equations) and it's probably useful for you to understand how economists think no matter what major you are. It's also good for you to know how much econ is full of hand-waving and how far you can trust it.That said, expect to be frustrated if, a) you've done rigorous, proof-based math, or b) you don't like capitalism.",
    "Econ 115 is a good course to take freshman fall, isn't too demanding and is a goodbasis for economics in the future at Yale. I think the seminar is preferable to the lecture in terms of quality of education, and I think some of the lectures were redundant and boring. Overall, however, I feel I gained a good foundational understanding of economic concepts which will serve me well in my future economic study at Yale.",
    "Do not take this course for an easy QR credit- it is not at all easy. The lecture is dry and very abstract, and it had little correlation to the problems we were assessed on. You can quickly get behind in the class, and then the midterm and final seem like unsurmountable obstacles. I did well in the macro course I took in high school, but it did not help me at all with this class. I would not recommend this course; if you are really interested in econ, definitely try to get in to a seminar.",
    "Economics 115 01 was a very manageable course, with one problem set and minimal reading each week. The workload is manageable but the material gets harder over the course of the term. I would recommend taking this class as it gives a basic understanding of microeconomics. But I recommend taking advantage of office hours and finding a good teaching fellow.",
    "Econ 115 isn't a very difficult class, but to do well it is necessary to completely master the material. The tests are not difficult and because of this many students get very high scores, throwing off the curve.",
    "class is alright. you might find it boring. you will see lots of people sleeping in the lecture (especially in the balcony). its hard to get an A, fairly alright to get an A-. pretty easy to get a B\/B+",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class but I know you have to take it.It is hard to learn in this lecture as the class size is large and many times lectures are hard to follow.However, the TA's are very helpful, work is minimal and exams are passable.",
    "It's a struggle to stay awake in this class, and it's really not as easy as everyone says. You'll find yourself falling asleep during lectures, and the textbook does not cover the same material as the class, so it's easy to fall behind. Be careful on tests because the TAs are extremely picky in their grading. If you forget to label a graph, they take off half credit. I would not recommend this course.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class unless you are absolutely sure you want to do Econ. In my dean's words90% of kids who take it, take it not because they like it or want to take it but because they think they should take it. and 90% of them end up hating it. Give percentages some flexibility but it is true. I took it cause I thought I am interested in politics and should know how money works but microecon wont teach you that. Also even if you do end up studying poli sci and thus want to have econ background you can do that boring stuff in your junior year. Take fun stuff if you are a freshman. dont take things that dont make you absolutely love waking up in the morning please",
    "It is a tough class that requires a lot of time and work.",
    "I would say that econ is a good class to experience and you need it for your requirements. In addition, you need to work to understand the content, but it will be good in the long run. I would recommend this to another student because I learned a lot and it was a good class to take.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone who doesn't have to take it. It just isn't worth it.",
    "Good class, not too difficult. Fun, but does require studying for exams, although they are similar to the practice ones given. Take with Prof Udry, he is great! Makes lectures interesting.",
    "Take it only if you seriously want to take further economics courses later on in your college career. I wasn't sure at the time whether or not Econ was for me, and took it because I thought it would be a useful skill. While I learned a bit, the course format and pace just made my time taking Econ that much more unbearable. If you aren't confident that you'll want to pursue a career that needs heavy Econ knowledge, I'd honestly avoid this class and learn it from a book.",
    "Standard microecon class. Would recommend if you plan on going further into economics and want to take more econ class, otherwise not super easy or interesting",
    "I would recommend Econ 115 for a fellow student. It is a basic introduction to topics and themes that are interesting and applicable in the real world.",
    "I would call Economics 115 a pretty average class; useful if you are considering the economics field\/major path or are just interested in the class, but otherwise not very beneficial or exciting.",
    "Economics 115 covers the basic consumer and supplier theory. If you want to know about basic economic principles or at least give terminology to the ones you might already understand intuitively, take this course. Go to a lecture or two, see if you like the class (big lecture, slides), and if the professor is engaging enough, take the class. You won't regret it, especially if you're considering being an econ major. For what it's worth, I would imagine the curve is significantly easier than the seminar curve. If you do the psets each week, go to lecture (and section every now and then), and take good notes, you will do very well in this class. The book is useless though. My lecture notes were much more helpful.Also, the review session before exams were very helpful.",
    "Really good if you want to get a basic understanding of micro. Not too much work and the problem sets can be tough but you can work with other people and the grading system of the problem sets works highly in the students' favor. The material can get a bit boring at times, but Udry tries to make lectures interesting. Final was pretty hard (and is 50% of your whole grade) but midterm was very straightforward. I think micro is a really important subject to understand even if you don't want to go into a field that requires its direct application- in general, it's really important to understand how markets work.",
    "The concepts, though not quite \"easy\" come at a very manageable pace, so if you keep on top of things a good grade is withing reach. As you might expect the lectures aren't always captivating, but if you show up and look in the general direction of the professor you're already doing better than half the class. Problem sets are pretty short and easy, probably more so in a group, but make sure you can do them all yourself because those are almost exactly the problems on the tests.",
    "I was very hesitant to take this class, because people said it was pretty much useless. Also, I took it as a junior and almost everyone in that class is a freshman. But I'm glad I took it (to fulfill my last QR of course). I did learn some applicable things, like what cap-and-trade is, and a little about risk, and a lot about a totally different way of looking at things. I honestly think I've become a more rational person in my decision-making because of econ.",
    "A good, standard survey course\/lecture, QR fulfillment...",
    "Not a must-take if you're not going to be an Econ major, but the class does provide a solid intro to microeconomics that will help you understand the basics of econ and apply them to the real world. Very low workload and basically no math, which can be frustrating if you have any calc background. Udry is a good lecturer. Pretty easy to get an A- but you'll have to work for an A.",
    "It's a good class to learn the basics of economics, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to someone who has never taken econ before and is just dabbling. It was a fine class but isn't something you necessarily want to waste one of your 36 Yale classes on if it's not for your major.",
    "I would recommend this, because it is fun and the work load is not that big.",
    "If you're interested, it's worth at least shopping. I'd recommend taking it with Udry, because he is an awesome lecturer. Try to find a group to do p sets with, and\/or go to TAs' office hours because they will explain how to do any difficult problems. Also, TAKE the practice tests when you're studying for the midterm and fina!!! As a non Econ major I'm glad I took the class, but if you don't have to take the class as a pre req for anything, and you're interested in Econ, macro might be more helpful in terms of useful knowledge.",
    "The ideal - and also mandatory - preparation for a major and career in Economics.",
    "Udry is a great lecturer. He reviews the previous lecture in every lecture, which I found helpful. The psets are check+\/check\/check-, so they are not hard. Good overall!",
    "The lectures were engaging and give a very good overview of microeconomics. There are weekly psets graded on a check, check minus, check plus basis and the two lowest get dropped so they aren't high stress. I recommend going to section since they're very helpful for the psets. Textbook is rather useless except for some definitions for the psets so try borrowing it from a friend. Overall, I would recommend the class.",
    "I would recommend it to another student. While the material can be dry at times, it's not too bad a workload and it's a good topic to have an understanding of.",
    "Yes, take it. Very good intro to microecon, regardless of whether you're thinking about majoring in econ. Weekly problem sets were very manageable, and only a midterm and final (though they were worth a substantial part of your grade).",
    "I would not recommend Economics 115 01 to another student because I did not feel that for the work I put in that I learned a lot. I would recommend taking this course as a seminar if possible. I did not feel that the class was structure particularly well - the first 30 minutes of each lecture was review of the last lecture.",
    "I would not recommend it, instead I would recommend the seminar. It is too large and very hard to learn in that environment.",
    "great intro microecon class",
    "It's a good intro class that I would definitely recommend because it opens the doors to more specific courses and makes sense of a lot of concepts in the world, so even if you're not going to study econ, it's cool to understand this material.",
    "Go to lecture.",
    "Yeah. It is a giant lecture and it gets the job done. Not too bad and udry is pretty animated",
    "A great introductory micro economics course.",
    "Would recommend to any student regardless of major. Lays down fundamental economic concepts that are universally-relevant, even more so than macroeconomics. Lecture format essentially allows student initiative to determine success.",
    "If you're interested in economics or politics, this is a good class to take. It's not, however, particularly exciting.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a good social science credit and interesting because it actually applies to your life. Take it. The curve is also pretty nice.",
    "Definitely take Econ 115 with Udry. If you're looking for a QR, it's not hard at all. If you think you might be an Econ major or might just be interested in learning economics, it's a great introduction to the subject, and taught in a really unique way (he brings in tons of examples from the developing world, so everything is goats and farms but it WORKS!). At times it was frustrating not being able to use calculus techniques (there's a lot of moments when curves are tangent, have the same derivative, etc) but all in all, I'm definitely glad I took it. It's a huge lecture, so you don't have to go every day (I missed one or two classes each half of the semester, and didn't really miss much material) but definitely go the vast majority of the time. I never opened the textbook once, because the lecture notes were actually more advanced then the textbooks. Section is very helpful for the problem sets- they basically teach you how to do them. Final is harder than the midterm, so be sure to study for it.",
    "Good intro econ class with a great professor.",
    "It's a pretty basic course. Take it if you even want any minimal knowledge of econ. Not too demanding and since it's a huge lecture, you'll know a bunch of people in it. That said, because it's huge, the material isn't going to be that interesting and it is easy to be distracted given the lecture size. Reasonable class though.",
    "I would recommend this class. It offers a basic, but in-depth analysis of microeconomics.",
    "Somewhat difficult never having taken Econ before!",
    "If you are at all interested in business, you should take Econ 115. Although the class is large, the professor does a great job of interacting with the students and you learn a lot.",
    "Recommend! Actually go to lectures - they're interesting and if you don't have any prior economics background, you learn a lot. If you're an incoming freshman with AP Econ knowledge, here's a bit of advice: don't be the section asshole.",
    "The class is a prerequisite for a lot of majors, and just a useful class in general. That said, I think you could probably get a lot more out of the seminar version of intro micro. This class was taught in kind of a confusing way, and the textbook wasn't too helpful.",
    "It is a good course if you are interested in Econ because of how in depth the course goes.",
    "its intense",
    "Base class, nothing more, nothing less.",
    "If you're interested in Econ, than this is the right course. Not much personal interaction because the class is HUGE, but professor Udry makes the class a lot better than other intro classes. Also, you will learn a lot more than you did in AP courses or other intro econ classes in other colleges.",
    "Absolutely, even if you don't plan to be an econ major, take this course.",
    "Take it only if you have to. Many people with prior Econ take it and mess up the curve.",
    "Econ 115 01 is a basic intro course into microeconomics, and I would not recommend it to another student. I feel that the quality of learning and quality of the course was not parallel to my other classes, and that I would have been better off taking the smaller seminar based class.",
    "Obviously take it. It's basically required to graduate.",
    "Take it if interested",
    "Like you would expect from an introductory course, it's not the most exciting material. Most take it as a prereq and it's a subject everyone should be exposed to in any case. Give that, take it with Professor Udry - he's one of the best professors for this course.",
    "Take it if you need it for your major, but if you are thinking about taking it to actually learn something or for fun, don't. This is an introductory course where students need to take whether or not the professors, lectures, and material are good. Professors are not held accountable for their performance or else this course would have improve long ago. Econ 115 needs to be seriously reevaluated and not just by the Econ Department, which has let this course exist for so long in such a mediocre state.",
    "An intro course that provides the basics with good theoretical and, sometimes, math-based explanations for the principles. Though we don't use calculus, expect to use algebra to manipulate formulas and derive general rules (mostly 2nd semester).",
    "I would recommend it because I think the material is interesting",
    "It was a difficult class but the curve is beneficial. I am glad I took it.",
    "Take this class. Everyone else does so you might as well. It'll help you find out if you actually like econ, and if you don't, at least you'll come out of the class knowing more than you did coming in. Udry is great. If you don't understand something make sure you get help - from TAs, tutors, classmates, etc."
