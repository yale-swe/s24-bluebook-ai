    "Only if you are willing to put in at least 4 hours a week. His tastes are very particular so be ready for criticism week after week. You don't learn the technical aspects as much as you learn about how to structure a scene - focuses way more on writing.",
    "I would definitely take this course. Making a short film every week is a great way to hone your skills and begin to understand what it takes to be a director and writer.",
    "YES.",
    "It's definitely an experience. You learn a lot about filmmaking from having to make a movie each week - that's truly the best way to do it. However, that also means a lot of stress in organizing the shoots each week, so be SURE you work together and appear in each other's scenes. Roemer has lots of wisdom to offer, but it comes with some tough criticism and also plenty of eccentricity, personal details, and probing into your psyche. Be prepared for that, and know that it's certainly not personal. So yes, I would recommend it to someone interested in a filmmaking trial by fire. But it's certainly not a walk in the park, neither in or out of the sections.",
    "If you have to take the class to complete the film major, take it with the knowledge that you will learn from the experience of having your work critiqued by a professor and your classmates. You might not learn as much as you expect."
