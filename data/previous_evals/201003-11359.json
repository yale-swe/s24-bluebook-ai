    "Great course, but it didn't help me answer the question of whetherI want to be a historical\/comparative sociologist.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interestedin state-building processes or political sociology. It is less relevant to students who are interested in other types of historical or comparative research, but still very rewarding. Work load is heavy."

   "comments": [
    "a great preparation for my research substantially and methodologically.",
    "it helped me to focus my research question and gave me a good set of tools and methods I could use.",
    "The literature review assignment was helpful to me in advancing a research interest. I have an overview of some of the key thinkers in historical sociology, but not necessarily a clear idea of how to apply their work to my own research.",
    "This course contributed to my understanding of comparative methods mainly by reviewing various examples of comparative research. While I am still not sure if I will apply any of these methods directly in my dissertation, I do feel that it gives me much needed orientation in this field."
