    "very helpful in understanding the complexity of global health today. would recommend to anyone, though admittedly, i am not sure how to have enough to say in 8000 words.",
    "I enjoyed the seminar style and getting to hear from many GH experts from the field on numerous issues. The requirements are reasonable and the professors are great if you get to know them.",
    "This course's strengths by far are the high-level researchers it attracts. It is taught by, attended by, and guest lectured by some truly fantastic minds who do amazing work in these fields. Especially as someone who is relatively new to the field, it's been great to get that kind of exposure.It's weaknesses are that, while it provides such amazing material, it doesn't really provide less-experienced students like myself any kind of analytical toolkit to approach them with. Still, if you're willing to work hard and learn things on your own, you can get a TON out of this course.",
    "The strength was that we experienced many different leaders' in global health perspectives. This was exciting and made for diverse sections. Each day there were unexpected topics and strengths of the speakers. The lunches were also a wonderful experience."

    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0good comments",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0She's nice, but a bit stand-offish. I didn't get to know her well.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0Professor Ruger is amazing. She was willing to take time out of her day during the week to meet with me to discuss the course, her own research, and my future career options in public health and health research. She is a true global health scholar. Take advantage of her knowledge and experience.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0She is incredibly approachable and very involved in the topic. Her work and her experience make her a wonderful authority on the issues that the speakers bring to the class.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Pogge \u00a0excellent work and good insights. always very encouraging to student comments and only applying his own as a \"final\" thoughts deal.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Pogge \u00a0He's awesome - I got to know him well and really enjoyed talking with him after class and through email. He is accessible, pleasant and informative.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Pogge \u00a0Professor Pogge, too, is an experienced and accomplished researcher. For one of our response papers, I wrote a nine-page critique of his most important work, something many Yale professors would respond poorly to. Instead, Professor Pogge emailed me back a few weeks later with thoughts on my critique.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Pogge \u00a0Professor Pogge is also incredible. He is vibrant and always brings excitement to the class. His own work in the field along with his understanding in economics brings an incredibly practical dimension to the projects presented."

   "comments": [
    "You will hear from different presenters, on different GH topics, each week. Prepare with the readings. This class is what youmake it - you can slack off, but it's not in your interest. Also, don't leave the final paper until the end of the semester - talk about ideas with the professors early on!",
    "This is a hard course. You can try to blow it off, since there's no set body of knowledge you will be tested on, but if you attack this class and try to get the most out of the amazing scholars you meet, you will find yourself pushed to your academic limits. Butting heads with and discussing theories with some of these scholars is extremely intense, and it takes hours of weekly preparation just to not sound like a total idiot, but it's well worth it.",
    "Take this course if you have any desire to work in global health!"
