   "comments": [
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend LATN 494. It is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale (and certainly the best Latin class). The discussions are fantastic and the readings are fascinating. I learned a lot about Latin literature and culture, about grammar and syntax, and about academic discussion and writing in general. It is a lot of work, but completely worth it.",
    "This class was great to continue building my Latin skills and fluency, and also getting exposure to a wide variety of authors and genres. The discussions about madness were really interesting and often unexpected in the depth and connections we explored. Bryant is also hilarious and brilliant and makes every part of the class more enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to read a wide range of Latin texts on a theme (as opposed to, say, focusing on one author); the theme was very interesting, to me, and things learned in this class felt very applicable to and eye-opening about things I read outside of it, which is an excellent bonus.",
    "Unfortunately, I do not think this course will be offered again (the \"Independent Tutorial\" is typically different, with a different professor, each time it's taught). If it is, with Bryant (Nelon) Kirkland, definitely take it. He's a fantastic teacher (still a grad student, actually), but very knowledgeable and good with students. The literature we read (the topic was Madness and Delusions in Roman Lit) was fantastic, and not the kind of stuff you get to see all the time, at least not all together. In short, very highly recommended.",
    "This class was an anomaly in both situation (it was created relatively last-minute) and subject matter, but I would highly recommend both Bryant as a professor and the course in general. The topic was fascinating and I would love to see more courses on madness & insanity in Latin - it's a very rich topic!"
