   "comments": [
    "A lot of writing skills, and knowledge about contemporary Chinese fiction, especially about the authors of the readings.",
    "I felt that this course not only gave me exposure to an oft-overlooked part of modern literature, but also insight into the psychology of post-Cultural Revolution China that history courses don't necessarily offer. It was also refreshing to read a text in a foreign language with the same literary considerations that I would make for a text in English.",
    "By taking this course, I was able to gain a new knowledge of Chinese contemporary fiction, and we read books by some of the most famous authors in contemporary Chinese fiction. I was able to gain new vocabulary and ways of expression in Chinese that are more formal, but ultra elegant.",
    "I learned how to adapt my study habits to accommodate unfamiliar and challenging coursework. My Chinese reading, writing and speaking abilities greatly improved as a result of this class."

   "comments": [
    "Very good class. Difficult to improve.",
    "I felt that the brief but vivid snapshots painted by each text in a survey of contemporary Chinese fiction was the strongest part of the course; I do wish that we could have spent more time discussing the texts on a literary level (as opposed to simply linguistic or comprehension level).",
    "I believe the strength is in the reading the good books, however, I hope that we could read longer sections of the books. I think we always read a section of the book and then I would be ultra interested in the book, but saddened that the story couldn't continue.",
    "A major strength was that I was introduced to a number of new authors and writing styles that I would not have learned about otherwise had I simply taken another language acquisition-style class. However, I sometimes felt like the course moved too quickly and adequate time was not taken to understand the readings themselves."

   "comments": [
    "This is the first class I've taken where I'm reading material that's not expressly written for a Chinese learner, and that's pretty exciting. Su laoshi chose a variety of works from known writers, and the material is pretty interesting especially when he talks about it from his perspective in class. Be warned that you won't get to practice any speaking skills -- its mostly him lecturing during the class. Also, I unexpectedly found myself spending a lot of time on this class because the material just didn't come easily to me, so I wouldn't necessarily pick it as an easy fifth class, if that's what you're looking for.",
    "This is a great class; students in the class are motivated and truly enjoy learning about Chinese culture, and Su Laoshi has an abundance of knowledge about culture.",
    "This is an enjoyable, engaging, and not too stressful course that does well to expose students to genres and texts aside from the material they see in their textbooks. Professor Su knows all of the history, authors, and material intimately (by which I mean, he actually knows the people you'll be reading) and offers intriguing behind-the-scenes insight during classes.",
    "If you're interested in deeper engagement with the Chinese language and culture, then definitely take this course. Su Lao Shi is an awesome instructor with a lot of various life experiences.",
    "As a non-heritage Chinese speaker, I would recommend this class to others with a warning. The vast majority of other students in the class are heritage speakers and it often feels like the class is tailored more to their needs. It is very challenging and I devoted much more time to this class studying than I have for other Chinese classes at Yale. That being said, I learned a lot more and improved my language skills in a completely different way. I feel a lot more confident about my reading, writing, and speaking abilities as a result of this class."
