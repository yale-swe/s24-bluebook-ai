   "comments": [
    "You should take it if you need it for a requirement or if STATS is interesting. 101 is good because it has a small class size. My experience was made much better by going to TA office hours or else I wouldn't have understood what we were learning.",
    "Great intro class to help you decide whether or not you want to pursue more advanced classes in the major.",
    "Good class, great way to knock out your major's math requirement or for premed. The class is really fast paced but the exams are fair and all the material is on the slides which are posted to Classes. First two midterms are easy. Second half of the class with Jetz definitely picks up in terms of difficulty but honestly it's really well taught and you learn a lot.",
    "This class is WORK. You need to be willing to put in the time to really study for it and spend a long time on homework. Overall, take a section you find fascinating and useful, otherwise it is definitely not worth it. I took Life Sciences and found myself very drawn in by the useful and very interesting information, but if not for that this class would have been more stressful than anything else.",
    "STAT 101 is a great foundational course in statistics. The material is made clear, and the professors are engaging. The homework is sometimes difficult and requires a few TA visits, but otherwise there are no outstanding complaints. I would recommend STAT 101 to another student.",
    "It's not the most inspiring course, but it's a place to start. If you're taking it, you probably need it as a pre-req or for your major anyways. I thought the biology part of the course was better than the beginning part of the course, although we only really learned one technique (GLM). It's a decent primer on statistics, just sometimes really boring.",
    "I would recommend Statistics to a fellow student. It is a relatively manageable QR requirement, and, although the material can be dry at times, Professor Reuning-Scherer and the other section instructors make class fun.",
    "Definitely take this class, if you're in the Sciences (even if you're PreMed). I was PreMed too and trying to decide whether I should take Life Sciences or the PreMed Stats. I ended up going with Life Science and I'm confident I made the right decision. Professor Jetz took time to really go through the concepts and explain the essentials of statistical modeling. Yes, the examples were mostly drawn more ecology but their application to other science field was pretty obvious as well. In fact, the lecture slides were so helpful that I had many friends in PreMed Stats who ended up using my Life Science lecture slides to study for their PreMed Stats test because they didn't find the PreMed Stats one helpful.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have never taken a stats course before and either will need to use statistics soon (e.g. for your research), are curious about the statistics used in various studies you may read about, or have used some statistics before without really understanding them. This class will teach you how many of the most commonly used statistical tests and models work, how to design experiments properly, and how to choose the appropriate statistics for your data. I had used many of the statistics before but never understood them until taking this class. Jonathan Reuning-Scherer is a great lecturer, very entertaining, and provides extremely helpful notes. Professor Jetz was a very different style, but still usually clear during lectures and very invested in helping students do well.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you're at all going to be looking at data in any way, shape, or form. It's the most useful course I've taken at Yale so far.",
    "I enjoyed the first half of STAT 101 (general statistics with Professor Reuning-Scherer) more than the second half (statistics in the life sciences with Professor Jetz), but I would still recommend taking STAT 101 if one is interested in science. In the first half, Professor Reuning-Scherer did a fantastic job of making dull material engaging and palatable. Homework and midterms were very fair. Professor Jetz definitely is quite knowledgable about statistics, but this knowledge was not conveyed in the most effective manner. He seemed cognizant of the fact that he needs to improve on his teaching (he addressed criticisms of his class on the first day), and therefore I think the class was better than in years past. His lectures and homework were pretty vague at times, but he did make the effort to better explain some of these unclear concepts in later class periods. I wouldn't let negative reviews of this class prevent you from taking it, if you're interested in doing research in the life sciences at some point. The class wasn't very enjoyable, but I thought it was manageable.",
    "Even the boundless enthusiasm of JDRS wasn't enough to salvage this experience for me. Personally, I find statistics joyless, unintuitive, and mind-numbingly boring., and I would not have taken it if I didn't have to. That being said, the workload is manageable and the exams surprisingly easy (in comparison to the psets). But the second half of the course was harder than the first. Credit where credit is due, though: JDRS was a pretty great lecturer and a very approachable, helpful professor, and made the most out of exceedingly dull material.",
    "It's not as easy as people say it is. The second half is harder than the first. Make sure you go to your TA with answers to your homework already --- and then see what you did wrong. Don't ask for answers because the beauty of learning comes from making discoveries on your own.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student, ESPECIALLY if Prof. Reuning-Scherer is teaching it - he's amazing!!! I feel like I have a much stronger grasp of stats in the real world, and could actually really use some of the techniques we learned. The lecture IS large, and the material can get tedious, but overall it's really helpful to know and JDRS taught it so so well!!",
    "If you don't have prior experience in statistics, and you are planning on pursuing any type of research, then the class is a must. Not only will you learn the relevance of certain statistical analyses, but you will gain skills that will allow you to become independent in your research, and to have the ability to choose what types of analyses are relevant or what type of experiment to perform.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are interested in the sciences. Helped not just with statistics to test results but also how to construct an experiment to avoid bias and error. None of the work comes from a textbook so mine just sat on the bookshelf. It was only needed for a quick reference or two."
