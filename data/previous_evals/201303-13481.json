   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course for its reading material, however, if you are not looking for a somewhat lecture-like english course, I would not recommend this class.",
    "AMAZING CLASS. Take it, take it, take it. The grading gets easier as the year goes on. I don't know if the students are getting better or the books you read are just way easier to write critically about. Probably a combination. This reading list rocks and Paul is a stud.",
    "Go ahead if you want to read beautiful texts of crime fiction. Requires quite a bit of reading and writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Amazing syllabus and interesting books, lively discussion and a great professor.",
    "Good intro English course. If the reading list looks interesting and you need an English\/writing course definitely take it. Lots of really interesting discussion about the readings. Grimstad is a great professor and leads some really interesting discussions, and he is very accessible and helpful for your papers. Your class grade is entirely based on four papers and participation. Those four papers are the only coursework other than the readings. If you miss a reading for a given class meeting, you'll be fine. Overall not too much work but the four papers can be tough since you know they're important. After the first essay you don't turn in drafts but rather it's a one-shot submission. I guess that could be stressful, but Grimstad isn't a ridiculously harsh grader and he's pretty helpful if you ask him.",
    "If you don't want to talk much in class and basically have a lecture about the topic, Professor Grimstad is your man. He cannot seem to allow students to interact directly. He just talks the entire time. No discussion. Would not recommend.",
    "My favorite course of this semester AND EVER! (I am only a first semester freshmen.) Encompasses more than just English and Literature. It's about life, it's about science, it's about what it means to be human and feel and think and the mystery of ourselves! You get to read so many great authors and ask why detective stories should even be considered art. There is a great balance between film and novel! Lots of reading, but really, really fun interactive reading! Only four essays but still work on your writing skills although it's more about having original thought and really making a solid argument. Just an incredible class with and incredible teacher that everyone, everyone on the face of the earth, mars, the universe, should take!!! Go sign up now for this or anything that Paul Grimstad teaches!",
    "This section of English 115 was all about detective stories. We read Sherlock Holmes, Christie, Freud, and a lot of other interesting authors and their takes on detection. We also saw some movie adaptations of books such as BBC's sherlock and The Maltese Falcon.",
    "It was a fantastic class.Yes, because it teaches you to see the world in a more simplified format and to approach problems with a certain mindset.",
    "English 115 is a pretty typical English course: reading books, discussing, writing essays. Grimstad is really great though! And he usually leads sections with really great books.",
    "I definitely would, I found it engaging and interesting. It offered a chance to explore literature that might not normally be examined in an English Class.",
    "If you get the chance to take English 115 with Professor Grimstad, do it. In general, 115 is a really nice way to get your writing credit by mostly doing a lot of reading. This class was especially great, though, because the books and stories were often just plain fun to read--and it was really interesting to see how they fit into the larger narrative of evolving genre.",
    "I loved this course - definitely a great one to take to get a good foundation for college writing without being forced to read uninteresting books or be around others who are clearly uninterested in the course. Readings are not unreasonable and are enjoyable, and the teacher is great.",
    "This is a great course to take if you are looking for an intro English course to improve reading and writing. While this course may be a little more independent that English 114, you do get to focus on literature which makes for interesting discussions. Overall, it was a good experience.",
    "Great course for anyone who enjoys reading - particularly detective fiction. Paul Grimstad is a fantastic teacher.",
    "Excellent class. Professor Grimstad is knowledgeable and enthusiastic. You're reading detective stories, so doing the homework is actually fun.",
    "English 115 04 is a course which looks in depth at a wide variety of works within and closely related to the genre of Detective Fiction."
