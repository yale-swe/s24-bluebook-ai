    "if you really have to take it, then go for it. if not, then don't do it.",
    "Definitely. Even if you don't intend to take your math further, I found this course to be of interest in and of itself.",
    "Yes, Math 115 is hard, but it's also a great course. And it's not really overwhelmingly difficult. It really pushes you beyond just simple high-school integration\/series\/etc., and as someone who got a 5 on the AP Calc AB test, this was perfect for me. I'd definitely recommend it.Will Leeb is also a great guy. He's super willing to help, and he's even willing to make an extra meeting time just for you if you can't make office hours. His teaching style is more based on theory and proofs than on examples, though, so I would warn you that if you learn better from examples, he may not be the instructor for you.",
    "MATH 115 is a relatively difficult calculus class largely due to the way the material is presented in contrast to how the students are evaluated. A large number of students tend to enroll in this class, and although there are a number of resources available (i.e. tutors, professor office hours, etc.) I would not recommend this class to a fellow student. In previous years I really enjoyed math and now having taken MATH 115 I do not plan to take any more classes in this department. Itwas just frustrating.",
    "MATH 115 is the a second-semester calculus class, but it is extremely difficult. It seems as if the class teaches one year's worth of information in one semester. I would not recommend MATH 115 to anyone who did not have to take it as a requirement or to anyone who doesn't enjoy math. It is very difficult and if one does not have a natural talent in math, it requires a huge time and effort commitment.",
    "Very time consuming and the number of hours you put in mostly don't pay off with grades, but I must say you leave the class with an excellent understanding of the concepts.",
    "115 is fine. The content is most definitely challenging, but not at all impossible. If you're wiling to put in the time and work to go through the book and do the homework problems, and maybe even some \"suggested\" problems, it is definitely manageable and pretty feasible to do well in. That being said, nothing is the course is really that intriguing or at all special, so if you don't have to take this class (or if an easier calculus class will suffice) I would recommend spending your credit on something either necessary or enjoyable!",
    "A good introduction to the math classes at Yale, especially for reviewing after taking calculus in a high school setting. For those that take a calculus class like AP Calculus BC concurrently, it may be an unneeded review."
