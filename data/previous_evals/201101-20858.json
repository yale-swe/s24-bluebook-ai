   "comments": [
    "I have already recommended the course to other students who are in search of foundational knowledge in applied econometrics",
    "The problem sets although helpful were not very indicative of the exams.The course did not cover a lot of material but went in depth on some theoretcal issues",
    "Very rigorous introduction to econometrics, setting solid foundation for future study of the subject.",
    "It is very good course for those who are interested in theory, but not suitable for those who just want the practical skills.",
    "I would not recommend it to a student at FES. It is not useful for applied work.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class, especially for someone interested in the theory of Econometrics. I would also recommend the student supplement the lecture notes with one or more Econometrics texts from the library. Note that the class is about theory,rather than about application (no actual regression with numbers on a problem set).",
    "I would recommend the course, especially to someone who knows very little econometrics",
    "Yes, I will definitely recommend this, since it is a very useful tool to analyze economic phenomenon.",
    "good course",
    "Challenging!",
    "REALLY HARD. Take it only if you've had the recommended prerequisites.",
    "I would take it if one is looking for a intro to Metrics class, but not looking for practical knowledge, no stata class.",
    "Yes, it was useful.",
    "If you know some econometrics and economic analysis, this course will improve your understanding even better.",
    "I recommend this class to people who want to have solid basis of econometrics",
    "Econ558 needs much of self-studying to be well-prepared. Problem set questions are very creative and interesting, though it takes some time to solve it.",
    "yes. The material is useful in any economic related job.",
    "I would recommend Econ 558 to students who want to understand the fundamentals of linear regressions from a theoretical, mathematical, and critical perspective. Boozer forces you to think about different methods, how they might be missing the whole picture, why they might not make as much sense as other methods, etc. The course is highly recommended, though I would not recommend it if you haven't yet studied matrix algebra.",
    "I would recommend this class to students with an adequate math\/matrix algebra background only."

   "comments": [
    "This course offered me knowledge that I will need to pursue more advanced econometrics course work and also will help me on my qualifying exams and dissertation empirical work",
    "The course got me interested in the subject and keen to learn more about it in the future.",
    "No much",
    "I took away some greater knowledge of statistical theory but wish that someone had directed me toward an applied or, honestly, a lower level course.",
    "This gave me the tools to learn more about Econometrics by studying a book like Greene on my own.",
    "Econometrics is one of the most important tools at an economist's disposalThis course did not contribute to my dissertation though",
    "I think it is a very good course for PhD level research.",
    "provides technical support to my paper",
    "The strength is its depth in theory, but the weakness is it did not provide students with hand-on experience in statistical packages.",
    "Again, I wish we spent more time on the topics covered at the end of the course, and focused more on application.",
    "I understand the why of what happens in a regression when you change things now.",
    "It helped to some extend to clarify certain concepts in my head.",
    "Helped for my development paper in understanding but not for methodology on STATA",
    "It enhanced my skill to conduct empirical analysis.",
    "econometrics is the basis to many economics-related discipline\/profession, especially when dealing with empirical studies. This course offered the basics to make applications on further studies. it would have been able to cover much more contents if it were to be stretched over the spanof a 1-year than 1-semester.",
    "This course gave me much greater insights into the theory of econometrics - it is far more than a course in statistics. It expanded my ability to interpret and critique academic papers that use econometric analysis. Very helpful course",
    "It helps me understand the papers that I read better. But it would have been better if this class was in the fall.",
    "As mentioned above we covereda number of topics in detail \u0096 which was great \u0096 but it would have been great to get some applied practice via problem sets."
