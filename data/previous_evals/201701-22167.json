    "Through reading different anthropological works on Asian cities, I have learned broader and comparative approach to studying cities. Also in this course I developed different writing skills in writing book reviews, literature reviews and final paper. The careful schedule of professor help us set up our pace on writing and generally structure our research.",

    "Our discussions are inspiring but sometimes I feel like we jump too quickly between topics without digging deep into one topic.",
    "The class was well structured to provide both understanding of class material and foundations for thoughtful discussion. The ethnographies that were covered and weekly book reviews were all strengths of the class. One way to improve the class could be to form reading groups 4-5 students that meet outside of class to discuss the readings. The books were so interesting and sometimes what can be covered in a class meeting was only a fraction of the book."
