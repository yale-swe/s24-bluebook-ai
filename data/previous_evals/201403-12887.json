    "If you can get Prof. Hadley, I highly recommend it! She's amazing! You'll love going to class and you'll get a lot out of it!",
    "A great intro-level language class. It is designed where you go through units very quickly (one every 1.5 weeks or so) but I found it very manageable and not difficult in concept. A low-maintenance class with a a noticeable outcome.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking Italian! It is a beautiful language that is being taught by one of the most dedicated and caring department at Yale. You are not just taking a language course; you becoming part of a close knit community.",
    "I would indeed recommend the course to another student. However, I would make him\/her fully aware of how fast paced it is as well as the amount of homework and exams."
