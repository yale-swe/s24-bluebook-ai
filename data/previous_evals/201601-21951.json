    "It will help you learn a lot of basic theory in a semester. If you want that, take it. If not, it isn't really a fun class in and of itself. Self-motivation to learn the material also needs to be present.",
    "Take this course!! It is a light workload and will leave you with awesome skills.",
    "If you are interested in music, definitely take it",
    "Great class overall! A very basic and not too difficult intro to music theory. There were some people in the class with no musical background and some people in the class with a background in music but no background in theory. As far as I can tell, everyone was able to keep up fairy well and Christy always welcomed questions. Christy is very calm and collected and definitely wanted all of us to excel at music.",
    "The class is a robust introduction the foundations of music theory. It is a great opportunity to move from zero to an understanding of the basics in a matter of months, and provides a solid foundation for further exploration in the field. The class goes further than what one might expect in that it also touches on the basics of composition. I would highly recommend the class to anyone without musical experience who have looked for a suitable way to familiarize themselves with the discipline.",
