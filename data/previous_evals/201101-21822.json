    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS, unless you have to, and hopefully you won't have to any longer. This class made me decide not to go into an EEB type career (and almost made me switch to MCDB), and I know that it has made a lot of people not EEB majors. The only redeeming factor is that it is not a lot of work- especially if you have taken any other EEB class, the intro EEB class is far better taught and strangely much more comprehensive than this course. I have never rated a class at Yale as poor, and that says a lot! The quizzes were dumb, tests were subjectively graded by a TA, and weekly sections were painful. Please, if you are not an EEB major, take any other EEB class and see what a wonderful field it is, just stay FAR AWAY from this course.",
    "A specific course on evolution, population frequencies, adaptations, with a little bit of genetics. I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for a somewhat easy Bio class, but you have to put in the work.",
    "For a class that should be an innovative, enriching experience, I was disappointed by how poorly it turned out. I think the class suffers from a few key problems. Firstly is the heavy amount of overlap between this class and EEB 122. I came into this class thinking that it would be a complement to EEB 122, that I would be able to go into greater depth on all of the subjects covered. But this was not the case. It is almost a carbon copy of EEB 122 in terms of subject matter. Rarely did it go into more depth than the intro class. It made the class time a boring experience.Even on top of the overlap, though, I think this class suffered from a lack of unified teaching paradigm. Students are often far more willing to forgive dry subject matterif it's taught by someone who gives a cohesive, consistent message. But this class was anything but. The first half was almost entirely about genetics while the second half lacked genetics principles almost entirely. The different lectures hardly built upon each other and gave the course a very modular feel. The paper discussions were even worse. Many times you got the sense that the instructors weren't 100% familiar with the paper's topics. This only made the discussions devolve into superficial examinations of hypotheses, results, etc. Rarely was there any deep and probing examination of the methods and arguments. The discussions lacked the skepticism inherent in so much of scientific discourse.Ultimately, if this class were to be improved in one way, I think it would be to give more credit to the student. EEB 122 is a pre-req for this class and the teachers should start treating it this way. More depth, more basis in the primary literature, and greater cohesion in lesson plans would not only interest the student more, but also make this class a stronger \"sell\" for the EEB major.",
    "E&EB majors are required to take it, but it could be a fun class for MCDB majors, or even non-science majors who enjoy biology.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, whether or not they are an EEB major. It was accessible to all levels, and clearly teaches a lot of important evolutionary theory that all citizens would do well to know.",
    "basically a repeat of 122, but not as in-depth or organized. the discussion sections are incredibly awkward and boring.",
    "This is a meh course. The material is challenging and interesting but the lectures were boring for the most part. I would not recommend the course for someone who is not already interested in biology or is taking the class for their major or interests.",
    "The first half of the class has more new material than the second which is a little weird. Otherwise reinforces and adds depth to topics you probably covered in intro EEB or any other EEB elective.",
    "The class is straightforward, and you will come out of the class having learned a lot about the basic concepts of evolutionary biology. The class in which we discuss articles from the week were sometimes very useful in applying that week's concepts to current research and sometimes completely useful. I don't think the class is a MUST TAKE class for Yale, but it isn't bad. I'm happy i took this class.",
    "Yes, interesting class but perhaps somewhat repetitive if you've taken developmental or genetics or both.",
    "We moved fast than Intro EvoBio which was good and bad, at times. That meant that we didn't dwell on uninteresting topics, but we also didn't really cover everything well in class. Read the book chapters!! And don't expect anything too inspiring."
