    "Hebrew 159 is a great course if you're looking for a way to keep up your spoken and written Hebrew and work on your comprehension. It worked well for me since that's what I wanted, and it teaches practical knowledge for navigating and living in Israel. I definitely recommend the course. The workload is manageable, probably a little less work than Hebrew classes I've previously taken. And Shiri is wonderful. Also, two classes were spent cooking and eating with a gourmet chef.",
    "Really teaches you how to function in Hebrew.",
    "It's a good class for someone who wants to learn a bit more about Israeli culture and society while also practicing useful Hebrew.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in taking an L5 Hebrew class. Professor Goren is amazing and all of the topics covered in the course are both extremely useful and helpful in developing more confidence in speaking. We cover such areas as health, cooking, directions, arts, interviewing, renting an apartment, etc. I feel much more equipped to carry out daily life in Hebrew!",
    "HEBR 159 is a great way to improve one's Hebrew conversational skills. The course is not only wonderful in the sense of how much Hebrew you learn, but also in the sense of how unique it is to learn a language in such a fun and memorable way. I would defintiely recommend this course to another student."
