    "Statistical Thermodyanics contains a ton of material. You learn a lot of different ways to model the world and explain macroscopic phenomena, from White Dwarfs, Neutron stars, to the Greenhouse effect, and ionization of atoms in the ionosphere. Really fascinating material the entire time.",
    "Stat Mech is a challenging course covering a wide range of interesting subject matter. There's a lot to learn here. Prof. Nagai lectured clearly and reasonably. He seemed very green, possibly new to teaching, and the midterm was poorly designed. But, the final seemed better.Working with others was extremely important to figuring out the homework, so don't try to do it alone.",
    "recommend this class. If you are a physics major you have to take it anyways but I totally recommend this class. Organized very well and interesting.",
    "Stat Thermo is a very difficult course but very valuable. The methods allow you to determine complicated behavior of simple systems and you will not learn them anywhere else that I can see. You have weekly problem sets as usual. Standards physics course.",
    "It is a necessary class for a physics student, but I'd recommend it anyway--manageable problem sets and stunning moments of truth and revelation.",
    "This course is a basic, straight-out-of-the-book approach to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. The material and problems won't be that tough if they're taken from the Sturge book--some tricks you need to find but nothing much more than that. Because the physics department rotates professors for this course on an annual basis, talking about the professor won't be of much use to you. I say take it if you're a physics major. No reason not to, and you'll probably appreciate some of the material if you haven't seen much of it before. However, if you think you're already well versed in thermo and you don't have to take this course, whatever brand of physics major you are, you might want to consider taking something else you would find more interesting."
