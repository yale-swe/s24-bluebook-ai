   "comments": [
    "The course was extremely helpful in developing new insights into my research. The professors are extremely insightful and it was great to get their perspective on my work.",
    "I am not responsible for a dissertation, but this course certainly broadened my disciplinary knowledge.",
    "The course provided very useful forum for engaging with some of the most current theoretical work in media studies and art history and with current examples of the shifting boundaries between art and media in contemporary creative practice. Some of the material may prove to be of use in my dissertation.",
    "This class helped me give substance to my thesis, which was primarily about the media. The readings I was exposed to, as well as the artists we discussed in class were also valuable. The exposure to the dialogue of students from other departments, like architecture, art history and film studies was also very positive."
