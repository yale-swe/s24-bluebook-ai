    "I would summarize this course as a great class to take. Carla helped me learn so much about Early Childhood Education, and I am excited to take more courses with her, and Nancy Close next semester and next year.",
    "This is definitely a class that you have to be intentional about taking because it requires a lot of \"extra\" time--i.e for commuting and for observations. To get the most of the class, make sure you have time to enjoy it. The journals are very straight-forward, mostly observations and then your reflections. Start on the final paper early!",
    "Take it if you get a spot.",
    "Thorough class that explores many aspects of early childhood. The class is a commitment because of weekly observations. Generally an excellent class with a thoughtful professor and great environment to have class in.",
    "An interdisciplinary seminar with observations of practice and discussions of theory, very engaging and one of the best classes at Yale. I would highly recommend to anyone interested in kids, schools or education in general.",
    "Absolutely take CHLD 127 if you get the chance. The course is a surprising amount of work but grading is pretty lenient and the material is interesting so it never feels burdensome."
