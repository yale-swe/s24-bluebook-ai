    "When an interviewer asked Neil Degrasse Tyson what the most astounding fact about the universe was, his response began with the following: \"The knowledge that the atoms that comprise life on earth - the atoms that make up the human body, are traceable to the crucibles that cooked light elements into heavy elements in their core under extreme temperatures and pressures. These stars- the high mass ones among them- went unstable in their later years- they collapsed and then exploded- scattering their enriched guts across the galaxy- guts made of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and all the fundamental ingredients of life itself.\" I borrow his phrase to describe this course: \"enriched gut\". By no means is this class easy, but if you have a strong background in math or science, then this class would definitely qualify as a \"gut\". If you don't, then you'll find the workload challenging, but manageable. Regardless of your status though, the material is intriguing and the structure of the course is nice. The solar system simulations that we had to run were really fun and it felt like we were doing meaningful work (seeing what happened to exoplanetary systems 10 million years into the future). If you take this class, I'm sure you'll have a stellar experience.",
    "Qualitative science course. Fun content that you have to be able to internalize and regurgitate on exams but not hard at all. The psets are fine, but take a bit of time.",
    "An incredible class. I literally cannot say enough good things about it. As a Global Affairs major, I was initially skeptical about taking an intro-level astro course. However, this ended up being one of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far. Professor Fischer is literally the coolest person ever, and the guest lecturers and TAs were equally caring and awesome (solely convinced that astronomers are the chillest people ever). There's the perfect balance of substantive material, good homework practice, and exams to create a class that wasn't overwhelming difficult, but still a good pace as to learn well. Furthermore, Professor Fischer actually cares about what we learn and how we integrate everything studied, rather than just making us regurgitate facts on exams. At the end of the semester, Professor Fischer spoke to us the value of being good scientists and humans in order to make a difference in the future of the world, and I think the entire semester has reflected those values. She truly cared for our learning and future. This is such a gem of a class here at Yale, and I hope everybody gets the chance to take a class with Professor Fischer!",
    "Do yourself a favor and take this course. I'm a washed-up senior and I can honestly say that it was one of the best classes I've had at Yale. Prof. Fisher's enthusiasm will make you remember how much you love learning. The subject matter is incredible, the TAs are great, and the problem sets and exams are all very doable.",
    "This class is full of super interesting material that you will probably never encounter in other parts of your life-- so take it! Gives you a much bigger picture of the universe. The workload isn't too bad, and I learned so much over the semester. YES, TAKE IT!",
    "Absolutely take it, especially if you are a non-science major looking for a science credit that is interesting, well-taught and manageable, but not a gut.",
    "'Twas an excellent course! It's a very interesting topic--the course covers quite a lot of ground and will probably have you reaching new insight about your place in the universe. I highly recommend it. It did not get as technical or go into quite as much detail as I would have, but many people will probably see this as an advantage.",
    "I'm an English major, but I have a good math and science background from AP Calculus and AP Chem and Bio in high school. Even if you don't have a great QR or Science background though, this class is totally accessible and actually incredibly interesting. Professor Fischer and Professor Robinson are great lecturers, and if you don't understand the material then they and the TFs are always really helpful. I walked out of the exam feeling like I had actually learned something, maybe not something totally practical, but really interesting and thought-provoking nonetheless. Definitely take this course if you're looking for a Science credit that isn't as difficult as something a STEM major might take but isn't as boring as a typical \"gut\" class. The nights at the planetarium are really fun too. The paper is a little tedious, but not too difficult, and the PSETS really help you keep track of what you're learning.",
    "Interesting course, fairly easy, and not a ton of work. Would definitely recommend taking this, especially if you need a science credit. Prof Fischer is a great professor and person overall. She is clearly passionate about astronomy which is cool to see, and she made each lecture interesting. The material can get a little dry at times but looking back on the course, we learned a lot of cool little things I hadn't known before. Things such as exoplanet detection methods, what we are doing to search for extraterrestrial life, and characteristics of the universe along with our solar system. Be prepared to spend anywhere from about 1 to 3 hours on the psets, which become pretty routine when you have a friend to do them with.",
    "Great class to take, especially if you are looking for an science class that is interesting and not significant in terms of the workload.",
    "I would recommend ASTR130. Quite easy, and lends good perspective on life in general.",
    "This is an excellent class for non-stem majors or anyone interested in learning more about the course material. We go into considerable detail on the characteristics needed to sustain life on a planet and what we are doing today to detect such planets. I definitely know much more in this field now than I did before entering the class, so if it piques your interest, take the class!",
    "Not an easy SC at all Long psets and not the easiest exams. A lot of work overall, but some things were fun to learn about.",
    "This is a great class; definitely take it. I would recommend this to anyone interested in learning about astronomy, even if you already have enough Sc credits. This class was simultaneously really easy and really fascinating. The class covers the most interesting part of astronomy-the search for extraterrestrial life. Astronomy is a surprisingly contemporary field, and Professor Fischer's work is right at the forefront of it (she studies exoplanets-planets in other solar systems-and has discovered like 100 of them herself). She pretty firmly believes that life will be discovered elsewhere during our lifetimes, and the class definitely convinced me of that.",
    "Would definitely recommend for a science credit. The material was never boring and always approachable. Professor Fischer is an expert in her field and really loves the material she teaches.",
    "ASTR 130 was not only an enjoyable course, but also one that practiced analytical and quantitative skills (though on a very basic level) and left me feeling like I have a better understanding of the world. Debra Fischer is amazing. You'll learn about the origin of the universe, the evolution of stars and the solar system, the evolution and origins of life, exoplanet detection, Mars and Europa and Titan, climate change, and the possibility of extraterrestrial technological civilizations. If any of that sounds cool to you, definitely take this class. I took it for a science credit, and I thoroughly enjoyed it start to finish. It's not the guttiest science class you could choose, but the midterm and final were easy, and the weekly p-sets and paper were worth it. You get to simulate an exoplanet system--which is super, super cool.",
    "Great intro class, especially if you're looking for that SC credit. Prof. Fischer is absolutely the best, and the material is really interesting.",
    "AMAZING CLASS!! This was my favorite class this semester. I'm majoring in a humanities subject, but this class blew the other classes out of the water. Literally life changing. I was wary after seeing mixed reviews from previous years, but this class was so great I can't even... Professor Fischer is extremely caring, tries to get to know your name, is very available, responds on Piazza like every hour, is a wonderful lecturer, and is just a brilliant scholar to have the chance to learn from. The TAs are wonderful, and the sections are helpful in terms of homework. Homework sets are relatively easy, should only take a couple hours if more than an hour even, and lots of help via sections and Piazza is provided. Material is really interesting, the science is a little less than AP Biology\/Chem\/Physics B level, very manageable. You don't have to do the readings. Lecture slides are posted online which is very helpful. Nothing unexpected on the midterms--mostly all from the study guides given to all students. Not too hard to get an A if you put in the effort. Final was awesome, based around the Drake equation, and the pre-test studying you do for that is really a great experience -- makes you really think about your position in the universe and what you're doing with your life. Also, you get to go look at the stars and jupiter with fancy telescopes!!!! ALSO, we got to go see the Martian as a class and got free popcorn??? VERY COOL STUFF. PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS PLEASE!!!",
    "ASTR 130 is an excellent introductory astronomy course. The math is easy to understand and really only involves algebra and very basic trigonometry. The material covered a wide variety of subjects, ranging from star formation to climate change. I would highly recommend this to anyone that is interested in the sciences.",
    "Would definitely recommend. I took it as SC credit as non SC major, and it was extremely interesting and frankly a lot of fun.",
    "Explores a vast amount of interesting material and opens your mind to new aspects of the universe. I would absolutely recommend this.",
    "Great intro to astronomy and a very interesting science credit. Don't expect a gut class because there will definitely be a reasonable amount of work every week but it's totally worth it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Relatively easy SC credit that will change the way you think about life and the universe. You'll cover a breadth of material - from the evolution of life on Earth to planet detection methods to climate change - and will feel so much smarter after. You'll also get hands-on experience with the orbital simulator and will learn how (as Debra says) to \"science the shit out of it.\" Also Debra is amazing and the best professor ever. You won't regret it! Science!",
    "This is a challenging but worthwhile course for non-science majors looking to tackle an interesting, unique subject matter with a warm and wonderful professor. I would recommend the course to students looking for something a bit outside their comfort zone. The class is predominantly populated with humanities-based majors; the professor openly acknowledges this but does not, to her credit, as a result \"dumb down\" the material for non-scientists. This is key: the class will require a good deal of work. The p-sets are not at all easy, and the lectures are packed with material. Professor Fischer is, however, incredibly understanding, even as she maintains high expectations. I do not regret taking the course and think I gleaned a lot of valuable information from it--if nothing else, it is an unparalleled way to truly put our human existence into perspective.",
    "Be aware - this class is not the gut that it could appear to be. Eight problem sets, two midterms, a short paper and a final is a considerable amount of work. But Professor Fischer is incredibly nice and helpful, and if you stay up-to-date, this class won't be too hard at all.",
    "This class is stellar!!! (- Pun absolutely intended). Professor Fischer is an amazing teacher as well as a phenomenal human being in general. I am not at all interested in STEM majors, but this class made me seriously consider dropping everything and switching to Astronomy and Astrophysics. It is that inspiring. The material is really interesting and while the exams are a little tricky, the weighting of the grades in the class makes it so you can do really well if you put it the effort. Going to the optional sections is super helpful because the TA's will help you get to the correct answer and you can usually come out with near-perfect scores on the p-sets. The final exam is on the Drake Equation (google it! Like right now! It's pretty cool.) and incorporates all the amazing things that you learn in the class to help you estimate how many communicating civilizations there are in the universe. Basically, you have to show them how much you know, but you get to prepare and she tells you all about how it works before hand. A lot of students thought the final was long, but actually pretty awesome. Overall, an incredible class, great for a science credit (especially if you put in the effort), and Professor Fischer is an wonderful person!",
    "Very cool class, a must take at Yale",
    "Absolutely. You'll learn a lot and have a chance to, for once, be futuristic at Yale. This is not a gut.",
    "Just watch some astronomy documentaries instead",
    "Great course that gives you a deeper perspective on the world and beyond. Take it!",
    "This class is a lot of work, of which some is very boring and seems like busy work, but it is a fun and you will learn a lot about the universe, biology, exoplanets, and the likelihood of life on other worlds. There is not a lot of computation, and none of it is more than just multiplication and division.",
    "Great class. Not just an Sc credit you really learn cool stuff. Professor Fischer is one of the kindest, most caring professors I've had, as well as an extremely knowledgable and accomplished astronomer.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student, so long as they understand the importance of starting the coursework well in advance of the due date. I have long said that the astronomy department has a great number of low- or entry-level courses that are intriguing enough to pique interest but not so difficult that they deter non-STEM students.",
    "This is an interesting class, but is not a gut. If you are a non-science major with an interest in astrobiology that is looking for a meaningful science credit where you will learn a variety of subjects, take this class. Professor Fischer is wonderful and will make you love the class.",
    "Fun class, though the lectures are somewhat disorganized. This made certain assignments a bit difficult. If looking for a science credit, definitely take it.",
    "Take this class! If you are a non-science major looking for a Sc credit, this is the perfect class. And not because its a gut (because it's not), but because it's extremely interesting and will change how you see the world. The other Sc \"for non-science majors\" course that I took was horrible, so I honestly didn't have super high expectations for this class. But I was totally wrong, because Astro 130 was great! It's not extremely difficult if you put in the work, so it feels rewarding and you actually learn the material. The work is manageable, and feels relevant. Professor Fischer is also reason enough to take this class, because she is so kind, knowledgable, and enthusiastic. She really wanted us to be good people in addition to good students, and was just overall an amazing teacher.",
    "Honestly a great option for a science credit. Definitely challenging at times, but very rewarding and beyond interesting. It is exactly what you read about in the syllabus, which is nice because there isn't too much math or technical chemistry\/biology involved.",
    "Amazing course. Perfect science for non-science majors. It isn't that difficult, but you will learn so much. Fischer is one of the best professors I have ever had here. You won't regret this class.",
    "Mind blowing",
    "Take this course! You'll learn about so much, there is not a lot of work, and you'll come out of the class thinking about all your classes a bit differently.",
    "I would recommend this to any non science major who is interested in an engaging and cool science credit.",
    "This course is not a gut, but why would you want it to be? Better to spend a semester really learning about one of the most interesting, cutting-edge fields of science out there. Professor Fischer will keep you genuinely interested in the class. She is one of the most dynamic and dedicated teachers out there. She'll help give you a completely new perspective on the universe and your place in it--lessons that will stay with you long after the semester ends. And while it's not quite a gut, it is one of the more accessible science credits out there; Professor Fischer gears it towards non-science majors. As long as you keep up with the problem sets and pay attention in lecture, you will have no problem doing well--and learning a lot in the process. TAKE IT!",
    "ASTR 130 focuses on the thematic (more poetic) features of space, rather than the nitty-gritty calculations and force diagrams that higher level courses might require. The class is, then, perfect for humanities majors looking for an SC credit. Be warned, however: THIS IS NOT A GUT CLASS. The homework is time consuming and the orbital simulations (on the homework) sometimes require several days preparation. In spite of all the work, though, Professor Fischer and her TAs were always available to clear up any confusions, and, in the end, its not incredibly difficult to get a good grade overall (there are lots of little grades weighted at different percentages that can ultimately help).",
    "I have already recommended it. This was by far one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Professor Fischer is wonderful, and it's a very straightforward science credit. If you put in the time to understand the psets and study for the exams, you'll succeed in the class and come away with a better understanding of our place in the universe. I learned about things I would want to know anyway.",
    "Yes, it was an awesome course that I would recommend to anyone.",
    "introduction into astronomy and explanatory systems.",
    "Yes, good SC credit that is relatively interesting."
