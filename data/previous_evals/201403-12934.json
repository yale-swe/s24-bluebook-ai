    "Reading a solid number of German plays from 18th to 20th century. I was worried a little at the beginning that the plays would be boring because they are \"old,\" but I was entirely we wrong. Themes include violence, sexual promiscuity, war, and politics. Definitely a worthwhile course, you will come away feeling very cultured!",
    "This course was a great introduction to some central texts in the history of German-language theater. Nadine Schwakopf is a great teacher--I was so grateful for the chance to write and revise three short essays in German, with the help of her detailed feedback, as well as a final paper. My written German improved significantly. The level of the course also allows for substantive discussions of the texts.",
    "Good advanced language course; good texts; not the highest-level seminar."
