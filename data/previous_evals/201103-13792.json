   "comments": [
    "Yes, the resources were adequate.",
    "Yes. There was always ample time to arrange for resources.",
    "The range of work and methods of production were so varied by the students, and the unique means of exploration was very much encouraged, so I don't believe there were significant problems accommodating all of the fabrication that happened around midterm and finals period.",
    "I think it would be useful to notify students (repeatedly) that they can be reimbursed for material costs, as students often forget to budget\/keep track of material costs.",
    "These things were available.",
    "I was very happy with the shop facilities this semester.",
    "Yes, the space, fabrication labs andfaculty were excellent and absolutely required for the research and work throughout the semester.",
    "Yes- though maybe a quick survey of what fabrication stuff new haven has to offer in terms of extending the scope of what we can do outside of the sub-basement could be cool."
