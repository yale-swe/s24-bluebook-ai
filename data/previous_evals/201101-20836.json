This course gave me a better understanding of the phylogenetic relationships between different plant families I am working with in my dissertation and will help me to identify plants during field work in the future.",
    "I am working on fossil plants, and this class not only looked at the evolution of plants but also taught me the terminology and methods with which to look at the fossils. Having little background on plants this was a very helpful course.",
    "Will help me i.d. plants more accurately and quickly during dissertation research."
