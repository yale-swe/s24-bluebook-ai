   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it at a class that focuses on the actions the government takes in order to prevent crime that winds up infringing on our civil rights at times. It focuses heavily on states of emergency and when or if taking civil liberties away is ever appropriate. The majority of the content discussed is current events.I would recommend this class because it is a great way to be introduced into law, and being taught by Aaron is something that we should definitely take advantage of here.",
    "Excellent, fun, fascinating, and laid-back class. Our seminar took on a personality of its own and had a real chemistry that was very evident when the Professor took us all out to a dinner at Mory's.",
    "Aaron is a quirky guy but really so kind and cares a ton about his students. He's very open and doesn't try to put up any barriers between himself and the class, more or less treating students as his peers. In that sense, it doesn't feel like you're typical class, but is a real breath of fresh air from the usual classroom hierarchy. The material is fascinating, whether or not you're a civil liberties\/con law buff. Aaron's only agenda is to get you to question your views, not to push any of his own on you.",
    "This is a really cool class, but only take it if you're willing to do the readings and form opinions of your own (or play the devil's advocate). Some classes dragged because nobody had much to say on their own.",
    "I would take this class if you're interested in law. Aaron cares a lot about the students and really has a fresh perspective--both as a younger person and as an international. He seems really hooked in to the law school world as a semi-recent graduate, knows a lot of law school professors, and had plenty of connections other \"real world\" lawyers. The topic is fresh and new and you discuss way more problems and questions than answers, which is cool. I recommend this class.",
    "Aaron is a wonderful professor who truly cares about his students. He is very patient and understanding and also seems to take great joy in teaching students. He makes students feel like equals, which leads to a very conducive environment for discussion between the students and professor. He is flexible in his approach to teaching the course and adapts to what works best, in terms of assignments, or is most current, in terms of reading material.The class itself was a very relevant class to real-world politics and ethical issues. It covered topics that students discuss on a regular basis in dining hall conversations and in writing for campus publications, e.g. NSA PRISM, stop and frisk tactics, etc. I loved this aspect about theclass\u00e2\u0080\u0094relevancy\u00e2\u0080\u0094and being able to learn more in breadth and depth about these controversial issues. There is some weakness in the experimental nature of the class, since it has not been taught with multiple iterations. However, this also led to a feeling of community between classmates and the professor.Alongside Polak's game theory class and Spielman's algorithms class, CSBK 290 has been one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, and this is coming from an upperclassman. For lack of better words, this felt like a very scholarly experience. Speaking of which, Aaron brought in numerous scholars for guest lectures.",
    "This was a fantastic course, with an intriguing balance of legal scholarship, current affairs, and philosophy of prevention and civil liberties. Aaron led engaging class discussions and invited several exciting guests to the class. The topics covered were particularly applicable to our current political landscape (Drone targeted killings, torture, NSA surveillance scandal, etc), and I have come out of the class with a much more nuanced understanding of these complex issues.The workload was very reasonable (three response papers, and a final seminar paper, along with fascinating readings). Regarding the readings, Aaron chose particularly trenchant passages from prominent legal scholars, informative current events articles and useful case studies. The diversity of these reading offers appealed to me, and contributed to the strength of the class.",
    "While there is a ton of reading for this class there is not a lot of work that you have to hand in. The readings can be pretty dense and difficult to get through, but the class discussions help. I would say if you're really interested in the subject matter you should take the course."
