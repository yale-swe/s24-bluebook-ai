   "comments": [
    "Excellent - might be a little better if there were more exchange with students instead of almost entirely lecture style.",
    "Strengths: Interesting topics, fair gradingWeaknesses: None",
    "Great blend of domestic and international nutrition issues, which appeals to people of different backgrounds.",
    "Great course! This is not a topic I had any experience with before this semester, and Dr. P-E did a wonderful job providing a solid overview of the material, yet also managing to cover the topics in depth. I think the format was good, and I am glad I was able to take the class.",
    "Wonderful insight and real life experiences shared by Prof Perez-Escamilla!!",
    "I thought that the lecture material was interesting and well-taught.The weekly write-ups were a bit monotonous. Also, I felt that the expectations for the final paper were a bit too high since not everyone has experience with health policy or doing systematic reviews.",
    "This is an excellent course for anyone interested in maternal and child health. Dr. Perez-Escamilla is extremely knowledgeable and provides a great overview of current issues and approaches to evidence based research& policies.",
    "The final assignment should be clarified in terms of what is expected.",
    "Be prepared to discuss only topic areas that are of interest to the professor, particularly breast feeding. An courses designed around evidence based medicine, most of the course is rattling off various studies and results from those studies. Final paper is a systematic review, but prepare for unclear guidance on the subject matter or format of the paper.",
    "Overall, this course was well-structured and interesting.Final project was a scholarly review but at no point in course was methodology for such a review introduced. It would be helpful to have a lecture on the basics of a scholarly, systematic review including electronic search strategies and the structure of a review. A librarian could even be brought in to discuss electronic search strategies for a systematic review.",
    "This course has been one of my favorite classes at YSPH! The strengths of the course are its ability to examine various aspects of nutritional policies domestically and internationally. There were always political, economic, cultural and social dynamics to each lecture which gave a comprehensive and thorough examination of each topic. The course also did well by incorporating discussion and lecture during the class-period. No weaknesses.",
    "This class covered a wide variety of topics in maternal and child public health nutrition, which I really enjoyed. I believe the weekly summaries, however, could be replaced with short writings that require more synthesis rather than summarization.",
    "Everything about this course could be classified as an strengh. The summaries were great because it help students prepare for the coming lecture and allows us to come up with ideas for our final paper. I also enjoy the 10 minute presentation. Everyone was on time and all presentations were great.",
    "This was an excellent course - our professor was incredible! His ability to supplement the course material with his own experiences was a huge strength of the course. The course had few readings, but each was pertinent for the presentation that week - making the readings useful and too overwhelming.There are no weaknesses of the course.",
    "",
    "Strengths- variety of interesting topics related to public health nutrition- opportunity to do substantial research on a topic of interestWeaknesses- some of the class structure (according to the syllabus) didn't work because the class was very large",
    "Great course, very interesting. Nice balance of policy, nutrition, CDE.",
    "The weekly lectures were always intriguing and insightful. The readings also further helped us understand the concept\/topic of the week. The weekly write-ups, which were basically summaries of an article that we read, were helpful at the beginning of the semester, however, it became more of a routine mid-way through the semester and perhaps a little redundant. The final project, which comprised of a systematic review and presentation, was a great exercise. The presentations were all very interesting."

    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Professor Perez-Escamilla is a good teacher. He clearly knows a lot about the topics of the course. That said, it did not seem like he cared too much for the students. He was approachable in the sense that he was willing to meet with you, but he was not the easiest person to solicit help from. If I am struggling with something class-related, I expect a professor to be supportive and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Engaging& extremely knowledgeable",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Dr. Perez-Escamilla is engaging and knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Professor epitomizes the academic focus of Yale, interested in his own work more than the students and the perspectives they bring to the table.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Sensitive to students but could provide better, more detailed feedback (particularly on outline for final paper). It seemed that the professor had a very specific idea of what he wanted for the final paper (i.e. topic that evaluated evidence underpinning a particular policy or program) but he did not convey this to students at outset of course.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Dr. Perez-Escamilla is a wonderful instructor- he challenged us by helping us to critically analyze articles related to the nutritional topics. He was enthusiastic about his work and his passion showed in every lecture.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Dr. Perez-Escamilla is exceptionally knowledgeable in this field. I particularly enjoyed hearing about his wide array of experiences both at the local and national level, such as at the US Dietary Guidelines lecture.I believe the instructions for the final paper and presentation could have been more clearly explained from the beginning of the semester. More specific feedback on our topics and outlines might have been helpful as well.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Dr. Perez-Escamilla was amazing. He provided the students with wonderful feedback and ideas for our paper. Also he gave us very strong syllabus and detail instructions for every assignment, which was very helpful for the students. It was very nice to have the presence from Dr. Rodrigo Venna from Brazil during each class. He also provided us with his input on how things are done in Brazil. Both were amazing.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Prof. Perez-Escamilla was outstanding. He was one of the best instructors that I have had at YSPH, and if I could we take any other course he taught. He is a great lecturer, has a wealth of experience in the field and does an excellent job of teaching this information in a digestible way. I do not have any recommendations for how his teaching could be improved.",

    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0- Very articulate and passionate about teaching- Engaging and creative approach to policies and practices in public health nutrition",
