    "Strictly a workshop. Valuable for the plays you read and for forcing you to write a play. But I am baffled at the high praise this class has gotten years past... Margulies gives no feedback on writing, so I can't conceive of how this might make someone improve their writing. Blech.",
    "You read a play or two each week and write a scene based on the play you've read the former week. Also, you work on a larger final one act. The class is a very open discussion and you learn from everyone else as well as your own writing. Professor Margulies is incredible and you should try to take his course at all costs.",
    "I can't recommend this course highly enough. It's not only the perfect way to learn to write plays, but it also serves as an introduction to the landmarks of contemporary theatre. Absolutely fantastic.",
    "I liked the work I produced in the class, but not the class itself.",
    "Definitely take this class. Margulies is great and you'll definitely learn a lot. As with most classes though, you get what you put into Playwriting. I'm not really one to get \"into\" a class and I wish I would have taken more advantage out of it. So basically... try to get into the class and if you do, appreciate it.",
    "If you want to be a playwright, this is the class for you."
