    "advantages: constructive discussion; individual flexibility",
    "The instructor was very candid and open, but there was little actual instruction in the course. Especially since we were designing research based on the course and will continue to design research, it would be helpful to have more concrete guidelines and more feedback.",
    "Strengths: Interesting set up and project-oriented course Weaknesses: Reading full books was not as helpful as having read fewer chapters of the book more closely. Full book (or more) assignments per week along with fieldwork led to a relatively cursory reading of the books on my part."

I still don't feel prepared to conduct a full scale research project with qualitative methods, but I do feel like I have a better position to start.",
    "Definitely - important learning for future qualitative work."
