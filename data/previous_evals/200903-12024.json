   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course. Go one below this course and take the class with Professor Angela Lee. From what I saw see, I think Professor Angela makes most of the courses, anyways. Prof. Choi is disorganized and this course is way too difficult, more than it should be to teach us about Korean culture and the language. It is basically cramming of vocabs like the reading sections of the SAT (except in Korean)",
    "This is a great course if you're looking to improve your vocabulary and writing skills.",
    "yes. it could be hard or easy depending on your skills but i guess the placement test will do the decision making for you. i came here to the US in 6th grade and this class was a good fit for me.",
    "This is a solid course in higher-level reading and writing. Choi seonsaengnim has put a lot of time into developing a diverse set of readings and assignments showcasing some of the most common vocabulary and grammar in standard written material (essays, poems, editorials, articles, reports, etc.). Your hard work pays off when you can make your way through a variety of texts without too much trouble, and when you see your composition improve. I wish that this course did more to include a speaking component, or to differentiate student ability more productively, but all in all, it was an excellent experience.",
    "I would recommend it only if you are correctly placed into the class. If you have any doubts take a lower level class."
