    "A great overview of sonata-form, Schubert songs, and Romantic harmony! This course focuses on both chord and form analysis, so definitely be prepared to start analyzing music from day one! Prof. McCreless is an amazing seminar leader, and makes already interesting material even more rewarding. T",
    "211 gives you an overview of various music theory topics through multiple lenses, including counterpoint, written and aural analysis, and composition. If you hope to gain insight into nineteenth-century music on a harmonic basis and interact with a fantastic professor and talented peers, take the course!",
    "I was not expecting to enjoy music theory 211, but I ended up having an overall positive impression of the class. This is mostly because Professor McCreless is a great, caring professor, and will work with you outside of class if you need help. Just to warn you, taking music theory 211 in the fall semester will put you in a class with a bunch of pre-college-trained, music theory-genius freshmen, but music kids are cool, so it's not a problem unless you want to be the resident genius of the class. Anyway, take 211 with McCreless because he's the real deal and the quality of theory classes fluctuates greatly by professor.",
    "! TAKE IT. 211 with McCreless means a semester of theory with one of the very best in the field. In this class we covered mostly techniques of chromaticism and essential musical genres (like sonata theory, opera, lied, etc..) I cannot even describe how important the concepts of 211 are to understanding what's going on in everyone from Mozart up through Beethoven, Schubert, and Chopin. It all just seems to make sense now. Because of how important this material is, you want it taught to you by the absolute best. Enter Prof. McCreless: he has a great sense of humor, a very helpful ability to sightread\/perform basically every example piece in our course packets doing analysis simultaneously, a sense of flexibility if you need an extra day or two with an assignment, and most importantly, he is genuinely passionate about the material he's teaching and cares about his students' wellbeing. All in all, this was easily one of my favorite courses at Yale.",
    "I would strongly recommend it to all musicians because it will give them a fundamental understanding of chromatic harmony that is very common. I also recommend it to math-music people for that reason- but be ready to work!"
