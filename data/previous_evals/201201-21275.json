    "Interesting topic, but prepare for a lot of work for the final project!",
    "no. esp if you're a sociology major, you will have no idea what's going on. learning \"R\" to do the final project is basically an entirely self-driven project that will take you forever if you don't already know it.assignments are not well-thought out, and you are just thrown into a course where you have to create a detailed, sophisticated computer generated model without any real practice. the assignments are not detailed and were not written in ways that would really prepare students to do the project, or to learn R.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course. It was pretty boring and didn't teach much. It was definitely a mistake to have a mixed class of sociology people and computer people."
