    "A really great class- you watch basically a movie a week and talk about them in Hebrew! Watching good movies is awesome homework, and class time is fun and laid-back. Not too much work, but my Hebrew definitely improved. Shiri is great--super smart, fun to talk to, and the perfect mix of laid back yet still expects a lot out of you. I highly recommend this class!!",
    "This was a great class. You watch 1 or 2 movies every week (on classesv2 so you can watch whenever) and write a response about the movie. Class is basically a discussion about the film and how it relates to Israeli society at the time. There is a midterm and final paper as well. This is a really good class to take to improve your Hebrew and have interesting discussions.",
    "Take this class if you haven't seen many Israeli movies and want to improve your Hebrew writing. Basically, you watch a movie a week and write about it. There is a long midterm and final, but Professor Goren is really helpful and accommodating and you'll never feel overwhelmed. Class discussions are sometimes long but you usually just discuss the movies so they're interesting.",
    "A discussion based class with a wide variety of selections from contemporary Israeli cinema, semi-weekly writing assignments, and a great professor. Great for improving or keeping up your Hebrew!",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student, and honestly I don't think the student needs to have such strong Hebrew to take it."
