    "This course skims over some of the topics of the broad field of cognitive science. The lectures are pretty good as far as lectures go, but the optical illusions begin to lose their 'wow' factor pretty quickly. I found it to be not a whole lot of work, but kind of difficult to maintain interest in, and difficult to do very well in.",
    "This is a survey course of some of the topics of cognitive science such as linguistics, perception, and decision-making. If you are at all interested in psych, philosophy, linguistics, or neuroscience, this is a great class that combines the four.",
    "Go to a few classes during shopping period and decide whether or not you're interested in the material and like Professor's Scholl's style.",
    "I took Introduction to Psychology, with Paul Bloom, and thought that there would be too much overlap to take this class, but it turns out that the two are quite different. Brian Scholl's lectures are entertaining and funny, he does a good job of keeping everybody interested. The tests are quite difficult, but overall the workload is manageable. This is a survey course in wat has been discovered about the brain in multiple fields.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS (if you're at all interested in the workings of the mind)!!!!!!!! the lectures and readings are incredibly interesting and the workload is on the medium side of light. also prof scholl is great!",
    "I would recommend it, although understand that it involves lots of disparate information and is not necessarily a cohesive field. It is more an umbrella field which encompasses lots of different types of study which are related in untraditional ways (methods of inquiry, themes...). At this point, get involved in cog sci if you are interested in research, as there are lots of opportunities for that, but don't get involved academically if you are only interested in learning.",
    "A really FUN and entertaining course. This course is not science-heavy, and you jump around a lot. The workload is very manageable. Even if you're not considering a career in brain-related things, this course makes you aware of how your brain works in everyday life.",
    "This is a wide-ranging course, and suffers for its efforts to cover too much material. The attempt to draw from disparate fields is noble-minded, but the course's execution results in a cluttered curriculum. While Scholl attempts to draw everything together with a handful of overarching themes, the midterm and final prove that the class is truly a test of memorization.For a more focused and engaging class on the mind, I recommend Intro Psych with Paul Bloom",
    "This class is a quick run-through of many topics in the field of cognitive science. Each of the topics had some really cool examples thatwe explored in class, and the idea is that by the end of the semester, you have a good sense of what cog sci is like as a whole.I would recommend this class to anyone even remotely interested in the science behind mental illusions, language acquisition, sex and attraction, or a number of other things I can't quite remember as I'm writing this. My only caution is that it can be easy to stop paying attention to what Prof. Scholl's saying in the long lectures, because you're thinking about the cool cognitive sciencey things you've already learned.",
    "This is a fun class to take if you're not looking for an intensive look at cognitive science. It's pretty easy-going in terms of time commitment and grading, but the topics covered are nonetheless very interesting.",
    "It is a good intro class and Scholl is a great lecturer. There is a lot of overlap with classes like intro psych and intro linguistics, however.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "Cognitive Science is a really interesting class; in my opinion even more interesting than Intro to Psychology (even though that class was excellent). Professor Scholl is a great instructor, and the assignments are pretty managable. I highly recommend it.",
    "I think that PSYCH 130 was an interesting class. I did learn a lot of new information by taking this class. In summary, the class is a large lecture class in which you learn about the way the mind thinks, works, and makes decisions. I would recommend PSYCH 130 to another student if he\/she is considering becoming a Cognitive science major. The class is interesting, but I may not have taken it in retrospect.",
    "Take it if you want to major in Cognitive Science. Otherwise, take Psych 100, Brain and Thought, or Sexy Psych. They cover the same material more thoroughly and usefully.",
    "This is a huge class for a reason: it's well taught and the material is captivating.Weekly readings are cumbersome, but good for you in the end, and the class is easily graded.",
    "Intro Cogsci is a great survey class that covers a lot of different topics, so if you're a freshman wondering what to major in, this class will expose you to a bunch of fields that'll help you figure out what you're interested in. That said, if you already know what you're interested in, it would probably be better if you just took classes in those specific fields, since this class will spend a lot of time on topics that you might not be interested in. The workload is reasonable, and you don't really have to do the readings even to answer the reading questions. The tests are pretty hard, though, and I wish we could've been handed back our midterms instead of just getting a grade, since it would be nice to know what we had gotten wrong.",
    "The course is a WONDERFUL introduction to the study of cognitive science. It was fun, generally informative, and a good use of a period. At the end of the course, though, there is a distinct feeling that nothing really happened. Maybe that's the nature of such a large introductory course, but it did really feel like it was some too-long teaser trailer for cognitive science and not a real COURSE in it. Brian Scholl is great (although a LITTLE bit over-hyped), and it was worth takingthe course with him.",
    "Intro Cogsci was one of the most interesting intro courses I have taken at Yale so far...what I liked most was the \"relatively low methodological overhead\" - that is, that you could identify with concepts presented in class based only on your own personal experience. I have heard, however, that for people who have also taken intro psych (I haven't), the course is slightly less exciting because of the overlap of material. Would definitely recommend.",
    "Very entertaining, enjoyable, valuable class! Brian Scholl is a great lecturer, but unfortunately, he knows it. His humor and self-congratulatory asides are occasionally annoying. The curriculum was also heavily geared toward his areas of specialty, particularly visual perception and computer science. That said, if you have any interest in cognitive science and finding out how it brings together philosophy, psych, linguistics, comp sci, and neuroscience, this class is great.",
    "Great course. Take it if you are at all interested in the study of the brain. You may not like all of the different approaches, but it gives a nice taste for the many different fields individually and for cognitive science as a separate science. The class is very manageable, although the daily reading questions can be a pain sometimes. Prof. Scholl is a very engaging lecturer and does his best to keep the class entertained. There are some boring moments, but on the whole, a very good lecture.",
    "Take this class!",
    "Definitely recommended. Interesting, fun, and not too much work.",
    "CGSC 110 is primarily a survey course in cognitive science. Expect to learn a little about a lot of things. I feel like I have a better appreciation for some of the abilities that we have, but I always wanted to learn more about the topics we covered. If you're a computer science major or know anything about game theory, expect to be very bored when we talk about computation and the prisoner's dilemma, respectively. This is a very easy course but the midterms can be tricky. All you have to do is answer reading responses and write one 6-8 page paper. Prof. Scholl is arrogant and has an agenda but is knowledgeable.",
    "Intro to Cog Sci is a fantastic course! TAKE IT! A few notes:1. Readings: The readings range from 25-50 pages for each class, and you don't honestly have to read all of them or all parts of them, although they are interesting and do help you understand the material in class. Don't get bogged down with all of the statistical stuff though, Scholl or your TF will\/can explain it.2. Midterm and Final: Honestly not bad at all. You HAVE to start studying at least two weeks in advance if you want a good grade. About 95% of the midterm and final comes from material covered in class (including guest lectures), and the other 5% is from readings. Note any overlap between the readings and what is said in class; these topics are extremely important. The questions on the midterm and final range, and you have about half multiple choice and half short response, for a total of about 30-36 questions. Partial credit is awarded. On the midterm, you'll have two Turing machines to do, but they aren't very challenging. The questions range from definitions to applications, and it's really not too hard. It's not curved (not really) because if you are responsible and start studying a week or two in advance, you can easily get an A or A-. The final I found more challenging, and be on the lookout for questions about linguistics!3. Paper: Start it early. Seriously. It sounds easy, but it's a bit of a challenge. It's a thought paper and it's kind of strange; you cite one or two studies and the rest is all you. TFs are fantastic and can read over your papers, but really try to start it three weeks in advance. It's totally worth it.Overall, it's an easy class that isn't challenging. You don't cover a lot of material, but what you do learn is interesting, and it gets you thinking about a lot of things. Professor Scholl is a fantastic lecturer and this was my favorite class. Don't be deterred by the large lecture format; he makes it fun. Your TFs can help you a lot, and if you go to their office hours every week, they'll like you and be more lenient when it comes to grading your midterm, final, and paper. I give this course my full recommendation. Take it; you won't regret it!",
    "I would recommend this class if you have an interest in an area of science that is such a confluence of multiple areas of science. What is intended by that comment is that this course, therefore, has a very broad focus, since it does not just focus in on neurobiology, linguistics, psychology, etc. Instead, the course offers a somewhat cursory view of many topics and leaves a student questioning how much solid information he\/she can take away from this class. Nevertheless, Professor Scholl was fantastic, and this course certainly makes one introspect and consider our own perceptions, as well as our unidentifiable, internal constraints imposed by the mind.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class to anyone who is interested by the subject. I learned a lot about many different aspects of Cognitive Science, and got a better idea of what I was interested in and what I didn't particularly care for.",
    "I would recommend this course, but it is not a gut. It makes you think, but you to do well in it, you have to think like he does which does not come easily.",
    "Intro to CogSci was a great overview course that helped students gauge their interest in something they have probably never studied before. The material was interesting, the amount of work was fair, the Professor and TFs were helpful, and the course was well-structured for a lecture.",
    "i would recommend it. lots of intersting material that will probably change the way you think about many things.",
    "No. There are better ways to spend your time here.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is really interesting and delves into such pervasive studies that the research is bound to relate to something that you're interested in.",
    "This course is a lot of work. It is not that much fun because the lecture is huge, and the lectures are usually pretty boring. UNless you really love cognitive science, I would say opt for another course.",
    "Its a very interesting course, but there is alot of reading and it takes alot of work. I would recommend it be taken credit d if a student who does not want to major in cognitive science takes it because it is a great class but it is difficult",
    "The tests are annoying. Easy to lose points on stupid things. The material is interesting, but don't expect to get through everything. It's a pretty general overview with a lot of cool examples (namely, many MANY optical illusions).",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! As long as you take notes during lecture, it's a fun and easy class",
    "I would recommend this class to everyone. It's relatively light workload for a class that covers a whole lot of very interesting subjects. Professor Scholl is engaging, and I enjoyed the lectures. Be warned however that just because the concepts covered are interesting doesn't mean they aren't complex. In particular, many of my friends had difficulties with the linguistics sections, but I was taking a linguistics course concurrently, so I found it easier.",
    "I would not recommend this class to a fellow student who is only mildly interested in the topic. Brian Scholl is a good teacher, and he's got the ego to go with it. So sometimes his explanations about the importance of a topic--which we had to write our final paper on--was just \"I like it. \" Also it was incredibly difficult to communicate with Professor Scholl or the TAs. Getting an answer to clarify a topic or addressing reading response deadlines or paper technicalities often took too long so that by the time I got a response the opportunity to fix it had passed. Overall, the class was interesting, yet I always found myself falling asleep around 3 and vaguely forgetting the information once it was presented. Interesting yes. Vitally important or hugely memorable? Not at all. A must take at Yale? No.",
    "The class was tougher than I thought. Definitely harder than Intro Psych and more scattered. The CompSci interdisciplinary stuff kinda threw me for a loop at times, but the linguistics and psych basis was great. Prof. Scholl did a wonderful job picking topics to teach in class considering that CogSci is such a vast field. This class had some overlap with Intro Psych, but not as much as expected. At times, it's pretty awesome to see how economics, neuroscience, linguistics, and psychology all come together. Enjoyable class, but tough. Cr\/D\/F would have probably been a better choice.",
    "CGSC 110 is an introduction to the mind and how our cognitive systems work to accomplish what they do. I would recommend this course. Lectures were almost always very interesting. There is a fair amount of reading outside of class but it was mostly interesting too. All reading is from a packet of scientific articles and reviews instead of from a textbook. This may seem daunting, but you shouldn't be discouraged. It's actually really interesting to read the scientists' papers without textbook editorial commentary. Another note: the course is not overly technical; neuroscience and neuroimaging are discussed, but only conceptually.",
    "I would recommend this class, but I did prefer Intro to Psychology. This is different in that it incorporated many different fields inclusing comp sci and linguistics which psych does not. That can be a good or bad thing.",
    "Take this class no matter who you are or what you like. The homework is just reading and answering one to two questions before each lecture and the paper is only 6-8 pages of your opinion, no research needed! Professor Scholl is an amazing lecturer who will make an hour and fifteen minutes of class time go by really fast. You won't regret at least shopping this awesome course!",
    "Pros: Brian Scholl is a skilled and fascinating lecturer, some of the material will amaze you, you will learn to read dense scientific journals, you will learn to think skeptically.Cons: The exams aren't fair and test your memory of the lectures rather than your understanding of cognitive science, cognitive science is a very young field and its scientists know almost nothing for sure.Overall: Take this course. It is worthwhile to have a rudimentary knowledge of psychology.",
    "Though it has a good amount of overlap with Intro Psych, I thought this class was amazing. I recommend it to everyone.",
    "definitely. if you are at all interested in how the mind words, in any way, you will gain something valuable from this class. the interdisciplinary method is really fascinating, and it's godo to see the connections between the different subject areas",
    "Intro to Cognitive Science was an interesting overview of a lot of the aspects associated with Cognitive Science. The lectures were usually interesting, though some of the material was a little tedious to go over. Professor Scholl is a great and engaging lecturer and makes the lectures worthwhile to go to. The 2 exams were pretty fair, though there's a lot of material to study that you need to really absorb for each exam. It's a great class to take Credit D, though you can still get a good grade if you put the work into it.",
    "Cognitive science is an extremely interesting course, and Professor Scholl is very engaging. The lecture is large, however, and there are no sections, so it sometimes feels very impersonal. Overall, I would recommend the course to anyone interested in psych or cognitive science.",
    "Good intro course. There is not a lot of work but you have to pay attention to the PPT slides. You do need to prepare for the Midterm and Final with the lectures in mind, so attend all lectures. Otherwise, you can make of his presentations what you will.",
    "Fun class. Go to lectures and you'll learn the material pretty well. Almost all of the material comes from the lectures, so while you do have to do reading responses, the readings are somewhat interesting...or if their not, the responses are pass-fail, so who cares. Take the class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The course material was very interesting and the lectures were a lot of fun. Brian Scholl is great, so definitely take it with him if possible.",
    "Good class. Not as good as intro psych with bloom but you learn a lot of cool stuff and think analytically. Pretty fun, but more reading than you'd think and a decent amount of work though it's spread out. Not a joke class, but pretty chill.",
    "It's comprehensive, but a lot of facts are left out (appropriately) which may confuse the more inquisitive student. It's fun! Take it!",
    "I took this course as a Psych major looking for a not-so-scary List B course. For that purpose, this course was great: Not a lot of work, not too hard, and certainly not very science-y.However, if this is not your aim, my recommendation is a bit more reserved. I had already taken Intro Psych and Intro Linguistics, and done a lot of reading in behavioral economics (out of my own interest), so alarge portion of this course was review. Only the stuff on vision\/perception was new after these things. Even if you've just had Intro Psych, I don't know if I'd recommend it.If you're a science person looking for a So credit, TAKE INTRO PSYCH! Preferably with Paul Bloom. That was an amazing, mind-blower of a course, whereas Intro CogSci is just okay. And it's really not that much more science-y. Seriously, take Intro Psych.Brian Scholl (who I hear is not teaching it next year, though I also hear that the other prof. is a lot worse) was just so-so. He was a pretty good lecturer, but often got caught up in his own wit to get through his lectures on time (We rarely finished one powerpoint in one lecture). His tests are quite difficult--watch out there. The workload isn't bad--a fair chunk of reading with a reading response due for each class and a final 6-8 page paper.",
    "This is a very interesting course and the workload is not intense. However, the tests often seem intentionally more tricky than necessary. This is a good class to take credit\/D and decide later whether or not to switch to a letter grade.",
    "CGSC 110 is a pretty good class. Brian Scholl is a good professor, though arrogant at times -- he'll occasionally go off into random tangents which are reasonably entertaining but then end up getting behind in the material. Tests are difficult and not entirely fair, but probably doable.",
    "This is an interesting and fairly easy course. The work isn't overpowering, and Brian Scholl is an excellent lecturer. I found the material very engaging. There are no sections for the course, so everything is pretty anonymous, but the TAs and Professor Scholl are both accessible if you want to talk. I would recommend it for anyone interested in the field or looking for a Social Science credit.",
    "CGSC 110 is a mindblowing course that introduces unbelievable concepts about the mind and, most importantly, opens one's eyes to how much we do not know and how often our intutition is wrong about our mind. I would strong recommend the course to all students, but particularly those who are curious about how we perform the most vital actions to our lives - see, speak, interact, reason, and so on. Definitely take the course with Brian Scholl if possible, he is quite possibly one of the best lecturers at Yale.",
    "Cog sci is a class with a few gasp moments and a lot of staring into space. I don't think I would recommend the class unless someone was interested in pursuing the major.",
    "the first couple of lectures include cool illusions. after that the lectures become boring and without any noticable content. the problem is that it is such a broad survey of different sciences",
    "Based on my experience, I would not recommend Cogsci. Basically, the first two lectures seem really cool so you think it will be a really interesting class. Then the rest of the lectures are really confusing and unrelated, and then there is one more semi-interesting lecture at the end of the semester. Plus pretty much no one understands any of the readings, even the super-over-achievers.",
    "I would recommend Cognitive Science 110 to another student. You really learn so, so much new information on a variety of concepts and the workload is minimal.",
    "Intro to CogSci is an interesting broad survey course. There were certain topics that I wish we'd delved more deeply into. I would recommend this to another student if you are interested in neuroscience, computer science, and psychology. It had much more neuroscience and computer science than I expected.",
    "This class is good if you are willing to deal with Professor Scholl's pompous attitude and focus on visual perception. The visual displays are interesting and it surveys cognitive science to a degree, though the focus lies too much on the visual while aspects of cognitive science such as memory are left out or talked about very briefly.",
    "Yes.",
    "I found the course to present some fairly interesting food for thought and to be engaging but very little work. It doesn't demand a lot intellectually, and I found that a little disappointing; however, it made the course a decent complement to directed studies, which I took it in conjunction with.",
    "I would say take this class, it is awesome, Brian Scholl is a baller. You learn a lot about everything , how we work, why, etc. it's great",
    "Take it if BJS is teaching it. I don't care who you are, what major you're in, etc. It's relevant information for everyone and an enjoyable class on top of it.",
    "It was an overview of how we study the mind. Lots of interesting slides but also lots of readings. I might recommend this to another student, as long as they're very good at reading straight scientific reports and being able to draw out the main ideas from them.",
    "This is a good introductory course in the sense that it gets students interested in the field of cognitive science in general (as an added bonus, its about subjects that have considerable relevance in the real world). That said, I would urge students to exercise a bit of restraint after attending the first lecture: Professor Scholl does a great job of making the course seem like it is going to answer all your burning questions abouthow the mind works, but there is actually a lot more skimming of the surface that goes on than he wants to admit. Definitely expect this class to raise as many questions as it answers. Professor Scholl is as much a performer as a lecturer, which on the one hand can be great (lecture is rarely boring), but if you don\u0092t like his sarcastic style, this might not be the course for you. I would also give a big warning about the midterm and final exams: they are the kind of tests that are intentionally tricky and don\u0092t seem to really test your knowledge of course material. You can study all you possibly want and still do pretty poorly\u0085",
    "COG SCI IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE COURSES! TAKE IT!",
    "I definitely recommend it. Not too much work and very interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I thought this was a pretty neat course. I was interested in essentially all of the topics we covered, and Brian Scholl was a good lecturer. I think that at times I felt that this course only gave us a very surface-level survey of Cog Sci, but I guess that's what an intro course is about. I tihnk this is a great course for anyone to take; the material is very interesting and the workload is not excessive.",
    "It's an interesting class if you have time for the readings. If your course load is already packed, it may not be the best idea if you want to get the most out of the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The things you learn in the class are just too amazing and thought-provoking to say otherwise. The readings may sometimes seem like a 'beach' but the difficult ones are not meant to be completely understood and all the others are either cool or amazing. The final is trickier than the midterm, and the paper is not too hard at all. Take this class. Though the lecture does seem to be almost exactly 15 minutes too long, this class will be worth the time--as classes at Yale go...",
    "Cognitive Science is anintroduction to how the mind works but so much cooler than that sounds. This is an amazing course for just about anybody, but especially if you're interested in some of the things our brains are up to \"behind the scenes.\" It is very surprising at times, and there was not a single reading or lecture that I didn't want to do or attend. I guarantee that you will find yourself doing research on your own to find out more about certain phenomenon, and it is a grade introductory course in the sense that you will almost certainly want to take additional courses in the Cognitive Science department or related departments. Taking this course in the Fall of my Freshman year is probably is one of the best choices I made.",
    "Good overview for deciding whether you would enjoy majoring in cognitive science. Lots of interesting topics.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it except as a fun fifth course to take if you want something that's not too hard on the brain. I didn't learn very much about cognitive science and I'm now not too interested in the field--it seems diffuse to me.",
    "COGSCI101 is a great course for getting a broad view of Cognitive Science. Because the field is so interdisciplinary, it is hard to go into a lot of detail about any particular thing, but that is to be expected of an Intro course. AP Psychology has similar topics, but this class takes the ideas of Psychology and looks at them from different angles. Brian Scholl also does a marvelous job of supplying students with the most recent findings in the field and keeping the class entertaining and engaging. A weakness of the class may be the size. If you are not a lecture person, this may not be the class for you, but if you are at all interested in Cognitive Science, I highly recommend it.",
    "If you're interested in psychology or any kind of study of the mind, give this course a try, at least shop it. There's plenty of useful and at the very least enjoyable and interesting information here.",
    "Very interesting material, a fair amount of work. Recommended for pretty much anyone but especially those who are interested in anything related to the brain (obviously). Scholl is a great lecturer.",
    "Take it. A great intro class.",
    "Overall, if you are interested in Psychology and Brain Sciences I highly recommend this course and am sure you will find it fascinating. However, if you are only mildly interested you will be much happier and better off taking Intro. to Psychology with Marvin Chun in the Spring term. While the subject matter is by no means identical, Professor Chun's course is widely regarded as more engaging and consistent.",
    "An introduction to the field of cognitive science--what exactly cognitive science is, the disciplines it draws on, and the questions it studies. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the mind and how it works; you'll learn a lot that may surprise you. Scholl is a great lecturer, and made it a lot of fun. A fair amount of reading, a midterm, paper, and final--pretty manageable work load.",
    "I would recommend it, even if you're not a science type it's a very interesting class.",
    "Take intro to Cog Sci if you have every wondered about how the mind works and are willing to pursue these questions using scientific reasoning. Though the course does have moments of \"did you know,...\" there are many sections that are scientifically rigorous. The advantage is, unlike traditional courses that deal with the mind, cog sci will provide you with much more concrete, inter-disciplinary answers. Just be warned that the curve is steep.",
    "Definitely take this class! It is really fun and not too difficult, plus it is an interesting introduction to a variety of different subject areas that you might discover you want to pursue further.Brian Scholl is a very good lecturer and always has fun little visual illusions or anecdotes that keep the class upbeat. He makes funny comments that I'm 90% sure he plans out beforehand and then pretends are impromptu. Which just adds to the entertainment value.",
    "It's an intense 3.5-month long course, with a midterm, a paper and a final. While the writing of the paper was a very enjoyable and thought-provoking experience, allowing you to explore further a specific area in cognitive science you find most interesting, the midterm and final were very tricky. I really didn't like the questions in the final, as I found they didn't really test our understanding. If the grade isn't an issue to you, then by all means do take this course--it's enlightening and you come out of it better-informed than you ever were about your own mind and its workings.",
    "Take it. Curve isn't too bad and its interesting!",
    "Cognitive Science 110 is a decent course. Although not quite as good as intro psych with Paul Bloom, the material is interesting, and the workload is miniscule. Overall, it's definitely a great course to take if you've already loaded up on hard courses, because anyone can get an A if they put in a little bit of effort.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to anybody. It gives you a good understanding of the most fascinating thing in the world -- our brains. Anybody with any interest in this subject matter should take the course",
    "Cognitive Science 110 is a great course that everyone should take, if just to see the world in a little different way. There is a little overlap with into psych in terms of material, but the way the topics are approached and what is emphasized about them is very different. Two exams, one 10 page paper, weekly reading responses. DEFINITELY be sure to take it with Brian Scholl -- he's a great lecturer.",
    "I would recommend this class to everyone. so much fun and really interesting.",
    "A great class. Definitely worth taking.",
    "Intro CogSci is a very broad look at everything that could possibly constitute cognitive science. For the average person, the contents of this course will be most useful as cocktail party conversation, as the course seems ideally aimed at freshmen and sophomores who are considering applying to the CogSci major. For those people, it offers an overview of the various subjects they could study and the various strategies they could use.Unfortunately, it's an over 300-person lecture and there are no sections, so if you want to actually discuss the topics you go over you need to find some friends in the class.Professor Scholl is interesting to listen to and his demonstrations will impress your friends.",
    "Interesting info, but at times can be really abstract.",
    "This class is harder than you think it will be. It's interesting and fun but take Intro to Psychology before Intro Cognitive Science.",
    "I would recommend it. I originally signed up for it Cr\/D but changed it after the midterm. If you go to class, turn in your reading questions, and review\/study before tests- you'll be well in the class. I like this class because, if you put in the work, you'll do well. It's pretty straight forward.",
    "Take it if you have to for the major, or with someone other than Professor Scholl unless he gets his act together. Depending on who you are, his jokes\/examples can be offensive. We did not get through the material because of his book recommendations. It is also frustrating that lecture, slides, and readings were often inconsistent and periodically contradicted each other.",
    "No. It ends up being a rather broad survey and you don't learn much of anything specific. A lot of annoying reading.",
    "No, I would definitely not recommend taking this class. Although the first lecture is engaging because you look at optical allusions, this class raises more questions than it actually answers. I don't feel like I learned very much. However, if you want a class with very little weekly work, you could consider taking this. However, it's not a gut nor do you learn very much.",
    "An introduction course studying the marvels of the commonplace. I would not recommend this course to another student. There are psychology courses that encompass some of the material and are perhaps more engaging.",
    "I highly recommend CogSci 110. It's a great introduction to psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science all in one! Brian Scholl is a terrific lecturer, clear and engaging, with an incredible grasp of course material. The material is intrinsically interesting, and Professor Scholl emphasizes its relevance to life. The course doesn't require a lot of work - Professor Scholl includes the most important information in his lectures, and reading responses are graded on a \"pass\/pass\" basis so you don't need to do all the readings thoroughly. Take it!",
    "I would recommend this course as an excellent introduction to this general area, one that I prefer over intro Psych or Neuro, because it touches on all of the topics albeit in less depth. It's good for getting you accustomed to reading papers (a manageable amount) and developing experimental thinking.",
    "Absolutely take this class, if Professor Scholl teaches it. It's not very hard (neither in terms of work nor grading) but is a lot of fun and very interesting",
    "This class is a good course to open your mind to this discipline, which most people have not had any exposure. It opens your eyes to the common place. I would recommend it to anyone who has any interest in realizing the wonder of the mundane, but warn those who are not extremely interested in science, because it does definitely lean towards that realm.",
    "This is a HUGE lecture, but very interesting! The classes can be hard to pay attention to for a full 1.25 hours, but the concepts themselves are incredibly relavent to everyday life. The readings take a lot of time to complete, but not all of them are entirely necessary to do well in the class.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you are interested in the material. Otherwise, the lectures become a big struggle to stay awake.",
    "Yes. There is no way into cogsci without this course. It gives a good overview of specific fields within cognitive science and provides an opportunity for students to assess their interests in any subsets of cogsci.",
    "yea, but only as someone who has never taken psychology before.",
    "The material for each lecture is really interesting. The difficult part is putting everything together. Sometimes the class seems disconnected because one day you'll be talking about inattentional blindness and the next day you'll be talking about prospect theory, which can make reviewing major concepts for the tests difficult. Go to the review sessions! Professor Scholl goes to them himself (unlike most professors), and the material we go over in review sessions seemed to have a big effect on the questions he chose to put on the exam.",
    "I'd recommend it to anyone considering the major or considering going further into one of the related fields... as a random class, or to fulfill a distributional requirement if Social Sciences arent your thing, there are better classes",
    "Yes, this class was a great overview of Cognitive Science, and it is interesting even for non-cognitive science majors.",
    "Upon taking the first exam, the majority of students come out thinking that they Aced it. Unfortunately this was not the case for all of us. Study hard for the midterm and take notes in class even when what Prof Scholl is saying may seem of little significance.",
    "Definitely.",
    "A good course, not too much work outside of class. First quarter is really interesting, second quarter (linguistics) is more specialized. Good introduction to the major to see if you like all components. But beware: midterm and final exams are tricky and random.",
    "Take the course, if it fits in your schedule at all and you don't have really good reasons for taking another different one instead. It's fun, not terrible much work, not a Gut, and just full of stuff everyone should know, whether you major in the subject or not. Take it with Scholl if you can - it's essentially his brainchild.",
    "A good introduction to cognitive science. Take it if you have any interest in the field.",
    "CogSci gives you an overview of, well, cognitive science. It is incredibly interesting, and Professor Scholl is a great lecturer. The exams are difficult and it is very important to take good notes in lecture - pay attention to what Professor Scholl seems to think is important.",
    "Introduction to Cognitive Science was my favorite course this semester and it covers many of the themes and tools employed by cognitive science even as it keeps the attention of those not interested in conducting experiments in the field. It covers fascinating topics such as instinct blindness (our inability to sense the processes are brain is performing), decision making, and visual perception. I would definitely recommend the course to all students.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. The material is very interesting, the work is easy, the Professor and TAs are all nice as well as understanding, and the tests are fairly reasonable.",
    "yes. the material is awesome. it is a HUGE lecture though. the lectures are usually fun (sometimes they drag on). for each class, reading questions are due...these can be a pain but they are graded VERY leniently (pass\/fail).",
    "Cognitive Science is a great class to take--but take it credit\/d\/fail if possible. It's a really interesting class and there's not too much work. The readings are generally interesting and the midterm, paper, and final exam were not unreasonable. However, because it is a large class, the grade distribution is large and it's very hard to get an A.",
    "Smorgasbord of cognitive science\/psych topics. The tests were unfairly difficult, as they did not reflect how we learned the material in class. The re-grading policy was very unreasonable. The class and its material did not live up the expectations that had been built up by previous class-takers.",
    "A survey of the different fields and analytical methods of a cutting edge discipline.",
    "It's overrated. Work load is pretty light, and it's a cute introduction to a variety of fields that everyone's got an interest in. But the lectures can be frustrating, it's not a substantial course, and the tests and paper aren't right for a lot of people.",
    "A horribly horribly boring class. The first couple lectures look really cool -- Scholl shows you lots of cool examples of mindbugs -- but after that it all goes downhill. It is painfully theoretical and dull. If you like computer science and physics and have that sort of brain, this is the course for you. If not, stay far away, especially if Scholl is teaching. He is annoyingly smug, patronising and clever (and he knows it)",
    "a very interesting class and I highly recommend it if you are even remotely interested by the class description",
    "I would recommend that you take this class for a good general overview of topics in cognitive science. However, the course covers a very broad amount of material, so if you already have a particular direction that you want to go in, it might not be the best course for you (i.e. if you think you are more interested in psychology, take intro psych, or neuroscience, take brain and thought)",
    "I'd definitely take this course if you want to learn about cognitive science with moderate comprehension (there isn't really anything that goes way over any student's head).",
    "Take this class if you're considering the major at all. It's a great introduction to the field, and it will definitely help you decide whether or not to apply. I'd recommend the class even to anyone not considering the major, because it really was fun and interesting, and the workload wasn't too bad.",
    "The tests are too hard. You get asked some obscure stuff and they ask you to apply a lot of what you know in ways that you don't have much experience with. Study hard, real hard, and then cross your fingers when you take the test.",
    "It might be my major so I am bias in saying it's a really interesting course. You learn A LOT during the one semester and a lot of it actually pertains to every day real life.",
    "Must take. Period.",
    "If you\u0092re thinking about the Cognitive Science major, do it. If you\u0092re not thinking about the major, still probably do it. It\u0092s a huge lecture class with no sections, but generally, the workload is very, very manageable \u0096 a couple of scholarly articles to read and respond to, due an hour before each class. Each exam is in class, so if that\u0092s a turnoff, keep it in mind. However, they\u0092re not unmanageable in the least if you are diligent about reviewing from Day One\u0085if not, well, you\u0092re in a bad spot. The final paper is also a breeze. I woke up three hours before it was due on the due date, BS\u0092d nonstop, and got an A on it. Seriously. Overall, I would recommend the class. It wasn\u0092t too hard, was definitely illuminating, and opens up a whole lot of other great courses in the Cognitive Science and Psychology department.",
    "Cognitive Science was a class where the lectures were always excellent! Professor Scholl is an extremely entertaining and enthusiastic lecturer, and his passion for cognitive science clearly shows when he discusses the material. In addition, the course material was also intriguing as well, and it was useful to learn about several different aspects of cognitive science.That being said, the exams for this course were difficult to study for. Professor Scholl really wants you to think through the material and be able to apply concepts on your own. The reading questions (about 2-4 a week, and each is only a paragraph or two long) aren't too bad at all. In short, your grade in this class depends on the midterm, short \"thought\" paper that is very open-ended, and the final.I would definitely recommend Cognitive Science to another student since the material is so exciting to learn about, especially visual perception, visual attention and linguistics, and the lectures are rarely, if ever, boring! Professor Scholl doesn't mind taking time to play a game to illustrate a point or show some interesting visual \"illusions.\" However, do take the time to consider taking this class Credit\/D\/Fail, since it can be difficult, especially for first-term freshmen.",
    "Yes, it's as good as an introductory lecture class gets.",
    "Good class with a strong overview of basic psychology material. Not too much work, but the exams are surprisingly difficult considering that the material itself is not hard at all.",
    "It's a cool survey course of the different disciplines in Cognitive Science-- computer science, linguistics, developmental psych, decision-making, etc. However, the readings are sometimes very dense. The midterm and final are extraordinarily tricky and notoriously frustrating.",
    "Terrible course. The tests are absurdly ambiguous, the lectures too long. Don't take it unless you need to; otherwise, audit it.",
    "This is a survey course of a discipline that is so interdisciplinary that it is difficult to stuff so much material into one course. As such, it can at times seem disjointed and a bit difficult to cohere into a single broad topic. Individual subjects were interesting, however, and lectures were generally entertaining.",
    "Yes, it's one of the more interesting courses at Yale, and it's (as rarely seen in other subjects) taught by the director of the program.",
    "This course is excellent! I highly encourage this course, though there is quite a bit of reading involved. Professor Scholl is a great lecturer, and he loves teaching. I learned a lot about everyday occurrences that I took for granted.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. You will never think of the mind the same way again. Professor School is enlightening and hilarious and the work isnt bad.",
    "great lecture, i recommend it, but dont expect to get a good grade",
    "If you are interested in the field, then yes. A very good introduction to a thought-provoking subject.",
    "Intro to CogSci is a fascinating course for anyone. The goal of the course is to establish an understanding of how our minds work and why we behave the way we do. CogSci involves so many fields of study that I'm sure anyone's interest would be piqued at some point. The bulk of the work involves doing the readings, which are interesting and are reinforced by discussion during lecture. The reading responses are not difficult to do, even though they are a significant component of the final grade. Finally, Brian Scholl is a lot of fun to listen to, and he imparts so much information so effortlessly that it is impossible NOT to take something away from this course. This is the kind of course that everyone can and should take.",
    "Fantastic introduction into the study of the human mind, how we're wired, and why that makes us do what we do. While there are themes that are brought up again and again in the class, the class is a survey course, and each lecture stands on its own, each exploring different facets of cogsci (Linguistics, Inattentional blindness, Vision, etc.). I can't speak for the class if Brian Scholl isn't teaching it, but he's an excellent lecturer, always funny and injects lectures with a bunch on energy and enthusiasm.The TFs are all brilliant (Sarah Shultz especially!), and it really is key to stop by regularly to do well in this class. The biggest trap of this class come midterm\/exam season is thinking you know the concepts discussed, but finding out that you know them on a superficial level, and not on the deep conceptual level required. Talking things out with your TF on a regular basis helps remedy this.Overall, great experience, highly recommend it!",
    "It's not easy, but it might be worthwhile for some, if you're looking for a wide survey of potentially interesting topics that you may or may not wish to pursue further studies in later on. Take it early if you can, as a freshman or sophomore, if you're considering applying for the CogSci major. Brian Scholl is not teaching it anymore, so I can't say anything about further teacher quality.",
    "This is an incredible class, but expect the grading to be really tough (as with most Yale intro classes)! While you're not going to learn about any cognitive process in depth, this class will give you a sampling of some of the areas of study in Cognitive Science, including visual perception, decision making, language, etc. Prof. Scholl fills his lectures with fascinating examples about how our perception is not always intuitive... you'll leave the class being shocked at the complexity of your own mind and the everyday processes which you take for granted.",
    "Super interesting class! You will learn a lot about humans. If you always attend lectures and pay attention in class you'll do fine on the exams. They're not easy, though the readings aren't necessary!",
    "It's a fairly interesting introduction to cognitive science but the professor thinks he's God's gift to the field and is annoyingly pompous. The course is not hard but the exams are incredibly difficult and doing the work and taking good notes in class guarantees little. Most people would probably be better off taking intro psych, computer science or linguistics.",
    "I would reccomed the class, especially if the person is interesed in understanding how the mind works and a different \"problem solving\" approach.",
    "Intriguing but more difficult than accounted for. Taken as a light fourth class in addition to ds this ended up being similar work (a lot of reading and constant writing) with a science orientation. Interesting, but take it seriously.",
    "This is one of those lecture courses everyone seems to take before they graduate. It's fun, but challenging. The grade is based on 2 exams (the better grade is weighted more towards your final grade), a paper, and reading responses due before every class meeting. The exams are tough - be aware! Study details and be sure to go to the review session prepared (that means you have to study before-hand). You'll do well if you memorize buzzwords. And remember that no detail is too small. Be sure to take a draft of your paper to your TA and you'll do fine. And you get full credit for your reading responses if you try. Plus, you get two free passes. The curve is on your side and if you approach this class as challenging rather than a gut (it is NOT) you'll do great.",
    "An introduction to the interdisciplinary study of the mind--the most interesting part of the most interesting creature on Earth. Primary themes are raised at the beginning and then traced through several case studies, such as visual perception, language, and attention. Each case study is fascinating, indeed revelatory--our intuitions about our minds are extremely flawed. Highly recommended, even more so if Professor Scholl is teaching it.",
    "CogSci was a very interesting class, covering a wide array of material to introduce students to the study of the mind. Professor Scholl is a very good and funny lecturer. Grading was nice and fair, as were the questions on the final exams.Although there is a lot of reading, only certain readings are evaluated through assignments (reading questions) and tests (final&mid-term).Yes, I recommend this class.",
    "CogSci 110 is a fun course that covers a lot of things. Maybe a great Credit-D class. Either take this with Brian Scholl or intro psych with Bloom during your time at Yale.",
    "this is definitely the worst class i have taken at yale. i took this class as a senior and i don't understand how this class and prof scholl have such a good reputation. prof scholl always seems very arrogant and tries too hard to be funny. i think everyone likes him because most people in the class are freshmen, but trust me, there are much better classes and much better professors out there. i don't think i learned a single thing from this class, i came away with absolutely nothing. if youre looking for a good intro psych class take intro pscyh or social psych (themselves boring also but much better than this). there is a reading assignment for every lecture (very annoying) and the tests are unnecessarily hard. in short, this class is a waste of a credit. don't take it. the final paper at the end of the semester is also a waste of time.",
    "Lots of potential, but Professor Scholl really needs to nail down his lecture style - he lets lectures on totally different topics spill over into the next class, which leaves things jumbled and confused.Interesting studies, cool topics, sometimes poorly explained. Overlaps in a lot of ways with Intro Psych, and Intro Psych often explained things better.If you're interested in the major, go for it (obviously). Otherwise, I don't think it does enough that Intro Psych doesn't.",
    "Cognitive Science is a fun fifth class. It's not a lot of work - there are twice weekly reading responses that are pass\/fail, two tests, and a paper. The tests are multiple choice\/short answer and the paper is about 8 pages. As long as you go to lecture and pay attention you will have no trouble at all with the class. The work load is easy and Professor Scholl is entertaining; it's a great intro course.",
    "You'll learn a lot overall on what comprises Cognitive Science. Lots of reading, but Prof. Scholl is an AWESOME lecturer, so its an enjoyable class. Take it.",
    "I would not recommend this course to other students. It is poorly taught and turned the exciting field of cognitive science into a dull study. The only reason to take this class is as a prerequisite for further studies in cognitive science.",
    "I'd highly recommend the class. It's very interesting. The tests are rather tough though.",
    "CogSci 101 is for any student who has even a cursory interest in learning about how the mind works. Professor Scholl's course will make a strong case for further pursuit of the field. For this reason, I strongly recommend the course to any other student.",
    "lots of work, too confusing, dont take it!!",
    "YESSS! You'll fall in love with Brian Scholl. This class teaches you so many cool things about everyday life - you'll be amazed at how much you can learn in one semester without really doing much work. The lectures are like watching an awesome movie - you get in, see and hear a bunch of cool stuff - and when you get out, all you can do is talk about it. I really enjoyed this class - sometimes it did get a little slow but it's all worth it. The tests are really vague I think because the correct answers are not always what you intuitively would think are correct and its really hard to know how you'll do. But eventually more than 90% of the class gets either A's or B's. There isn't too much work - reading responses are due before each class but they are pass-pass, there's one 6-8 term paper that's pretty easy to write, a midterm and a final. It really is less work than it sounds. This is a must take class.",
    "Intro to Cognitive Science is full of stories. Stories that are fun, worth repeating to your friends, and teach interesting lessons about the mind. It's best taken with the lecturer-entertainer Professor Brian Scholl, who is on sabbatical until fall 2011.",
    "Intro cogsci covers a lot of very interesting material and some less-than-interesting material, but for the most part the lectures are fairly engaging. Professor Scholl has a sense of humor that is on and off the mark, but in general there are enough optical illusions and mental tricks to keep things entertaining. If you want an overall view of the principals behind cognitive science, this is a good if sometimes uneven course (we focus on certain things over other things- Scholl studies vision, for example, so we spend a lot of time on that as opposed to other potential subjects). Cognitive science as a subject is really cool and fascinating- you see a fair amount of that in this course.",
    "This is a very interesting and fun course to take. SCholl is a great lecturer and will not fail to make lectures interesting. However, I would highly recommend taking this course Credit\/D\/Fail. Grading depends largely on your TA, and even if you believe you're keeping up with the work and have a handle on the material you could very likely be wrong and this course could quickly become aGPA killer."
