    "A lot of work, but worthwhile.",
    "It's a good class in that it'll help you learn Hebrew. Dina isn't the most dynamic but she can teach Hebrew well, and if you want to be fluent you need to take this.",
    "Hebrew 130 is a very enjoyable class. It is a reasonable amount of work, and Dina is a great professor who really care that her students learn. It is not paced incredibly quickly, but you do get to know the material very well.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course! Hebrew is a beautiful language and it is particularly well taught at Yale.",
    "HEBR 130 is a great class! I have loved every class I have taken in the hebrew department at Yale. It is definitely a lot more work than other languages, but it's worth it. By L3, you know everyone in your class and it's a very intimate environment. All of the hebrew professors are great, although some are more effective than others.",
    "Learned the future tense and new grammar\/vocab tidbits! Interesting readings and activities on Israeli culture."
