    "Straightforward L2 language course. A step up in difficulty from L1.",
    "Spanish 120 can be a very difficult class as it requires a big time commitment. Make sure that there is room in your class schedule for the workload, and make sure that you can make time for extra studying outside of class because it is necessary for really learning the language. It is a very enjoyable and beneficial class, but it is one that you should do your best not to get behind in.",
    "Take SPAN 120 with Professor Ramos-Ruano. She is the most amazing professor. She is so dedicated to her students and to teaching. I absolutely loved coming to class every single day. My Spanish has improved so much this past semester. I am so glad to have taken this class with her.",
    "Learned a lot but you have to put in work",
    "Probably necessary if you're using Spanish to fulfill the language requirement. L2 has more work than L1 and can get somewhat annoying. Take with Juliana and it will be much better.",
    "It's definitely a lot more work than Spanish L1, but if you're regular with the work, it pays off. If you get Juliana, you're immensely lucky! She's the best!",
