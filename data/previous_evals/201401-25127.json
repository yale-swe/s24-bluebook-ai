    "Yes, good for people who want to apply these methods to their work.",

    "Thorough review of the major convex optimization techniques. The focus is more on the theoretical issues rather than on concrete applications. However, you have the chance to apply all the tools learned in your final project on a topic of your choice (no final exam).",
    "I would recommend this to a student only if she knew she were going to use the methods introduced (i.e. iterative descent methods). I wouldn't recommend it if this is not certain, as it is pretty specific (despite the wide variety of applications).",
    "This course is an introductory course for convex optimization, which covers standard techniques in optimization. I would recommend this course to others because this is a very useful courses."

    "This course introduced a variety of optimization methods for tackling different problems. It focusedmore on the theoretical and the \"why\" things work rather than \"how\" things work. I feel that I have a fundamental understanding of the standard basic optimization techniques and now have the tools to pursue research into more sophisticated methods.",
    "Economists optimize. That's what they do for a living. This course provided me with solid tools to tackle complex optimization problems on a numerical level.",
    "This course broaden my view of thinking statistical problems. By doing the course project, I have learned a lot of advanced topics of optimization in statistics and it helps me a lot."
