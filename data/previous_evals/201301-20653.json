    "French 933 will be the best close reading experience you will ever get involved in and will make you wish such seminars existed for all of your favorite books. If it is ever offered again, not taking it would be a terrible mistake.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it -- the readings were interesting and Prof. Kaplan is great.",
    "Yes, I would recommend French 933. The course offers an innovative approach to studying Proust that goes far beyond an introduction.",
    "An overview of different approaches to a complex text since its publication a hundred years ago. A strength of the class certainly is that is does not overlook the source text while concentrating on its reception, but instead leaves room for reading both the literature and its criticism, which is crucial in order to find one's own approach to the text in an academic setting.",
    "Yes. Great course, with a good balance between the novel we studied and what has been written about and around it."

   "comments": [
    "Very much deepened my knowledge and familiarized me with the methods of \"reading around\" texts, which are crucial to research. It was a great experience",
    "(Probably) No direct impact on future dissertation projects but I certainly benefit from the intensive methodological reflections."
