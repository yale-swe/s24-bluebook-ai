   "comments": [
    "A very normal chemistry class, in that you have lecture, section, three tests and a final. An average amount of work. Problem sets are one per week and take about 2-3 hours each, which isn't really that bad.",
    "Take it. It is not as bad a course as everyone makes it out to be. I enjoyed working on the p-sets. When the exams came along, since I had been keeping up with reading from the p-sets, I didnot have any major issues preparing for it. Also, since the lectures are exactly from the textbook, its not bad. Make sure you keep up with the reading, and you will find it fun.",
    "Much more mathy than Orgo, back to the principles of gen chem but much more rigorous. Also almost exclusively chem and chem E majors",
    "This is a tough course. The lectures are slightly disorganized but as long as you read the book it should all make sense. PSets take about 3-4 hours each and the tests require a lot of studying for. Overall a good class to learn about more advanced chemistry from a quantitative approach.",
    "I recommend this for ONLY those who need to take this class for a major, or overachieving freshman who think they are invincible. This is not an easy class, especially the exams. The material is very interesting and can be applied in many fields, but it takes a lot of hours to understand the chemistry in the mathematical level along with the molecular level.",
    "It's an OK class but the tests are kind of random. Good luck.",
    "It's all right. I don't recommend it if you aren't going to major in something that really needs it. Don't take it \"for fun.\"",
    "Reasonable class - the material is useful for engineers and chemists. Problem sets are not bad, and the exams are manageable if you study.",
    "You'll learn pchem, but probably mostly on your own. Schmuttenmaer is fun, but really scatterbrained. Not a great professor, but the class is alright.",
    "This class is almost inclusively for chem majors and people who think of becoming one. For freshmen I would much rather recommend freshmen organics, unless they already really know this material well.",
    "It's a fine class, the midterms (hour tests) are a bit long and random, but overall an okay class. Work quickly during the tests - they're not necessarily hard, but can be time consuming and not-obvious.",
    "It's ok. Professor Schmuttenmaer was a good teacher, but it was early in the morning, and I found that I don't like the subject.",
    "P Chem is a great course and covers very interesting material, but it is also very difficult and time consuming. I would recommend to anyone with a strong background in Chemistry and who is looking to pursue a Chemistry-related major.",
    "This isn't an easy class, but it's a class you'll love because of Professor Schmuttenmaer. He's great and really goofy, which is nice during a 9:25 lecture. The problem sets aren't worth very much and don't have a ton to do with the test questions, so make sure you have a really good understanding of everything written in the book and taught in lecture.",
    "CHEM332 is a semi-interesting class with a zany teacher (Professor Schmuttenmaer). It\u0092s not too much work, but you should do the reading and the problem sets, and study quite a bit before the tests so that you can move quickly through the material. It doesn\u0092t really feel like Chemistry, but Professor Schmuttenmaer is fun and it\u0092s a requirement for the Chemistry major if you\u0092re getting a BS or higher and the Chemical Engineering major if you\u0092re getting ABET.I would recommend taking the lab at the same time.The second semester class is apparently much harder.",
    "This class is what one would generally expect of a physical chemistry course. The class covers almost nothing that isn't in the book, so it doesn't seem like it was really necessary for me to have gone to lecture (except to get the answers to the test's 1 point bonus questions).I didn't like the book that much, but apparently it's one of the better, more popular p chem books.I also didn't enjoy this class as much as I thought I would, but that might just be a result of my not putting enough time into learning the material as I should have.Take this class if you're a chem major or want to see where all the formulas you learned in gen chem come from.It's not a bad course, but it's also definitely not really a great one.",
    "Not too much work, and concepts aren't too difficult. Schmuttenmaer is great.",
    "Despite often daunting reviews, CHEM 332 was actually a great course. If you are trying to decide between CHEM 332 and the other physical chemistry course (bio apps), definitely take this one! Professor Shmuttenmaer is extremely engaging and it is easy to pay attention in class. The course is quite mathy and requires understanding of equations and derivations, but if you go to class (where you will undoubtedly pay attention to the material and the Professor's amusing stories) and read the book (a really well-written textbook), you should be fine. Just plan to spend significant time on the problem sets: the first ones are deceptively easy compared to the rest of the course.",
    "Good course in physical chemistry, Prof Schmuttenmaer is great! He is very good at explaining the concepts and tells hilarious stories from time to time. I just wish he would make the curve a bit less stringent (because its a course within the major) and provide a reasonable amount of time to complete the exams. This would allow for a less stressful course.",
    "Professor Schmuttenmaer is a very funny,enthusiastic guy. He obviously loves his field, but I get the impression that he doesn't put that much effort into his lectures. Atkins is a pretty dull book....I've heard McQuarrie is way more interesting and fun. I wish professor schmuttenmaer didn't stick word for word to the book. He even bothers going through every single annoying calculus derivation. I think we could've been expected to read through those ourselves. Then more time in lecture could have been spent on the conceptual understanding of these equations.Also, psets were worth 5%. very little incentive to put effort into those. Tests, however, were pretty straightforward. We got to make equation sheets.",
    "Chem 332 is basically Chem 118 + multivariable calculus. It's a solid course and if you have to take some type of physical chemistry, take 332. There's no need to be afraid of the class especially if Prof. Schmuttenmaer is teaching it."
