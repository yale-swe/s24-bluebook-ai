    "Taking the basics learned in Czech 110, Czech 120 builds and expands upon these principles. I would recommend this course to those serious about furthering their ability in the Czech language.",
    "it was good, fun.",
    "Do not take this course, it used to be easy. Now it sucks.",
    "I would recommend Czech to another student, as long as that student is interested in linguistics. Czech, though used relatively little in the world, is a fascinating language and embodies Yale - it is a chance to study something unique that few people get the chance to study. So yes, I would recommend Czech to another student, because Yale is about expanding your horizons and there are few better ways to do that than to study an exotic language with a native speaker of that language (Professor von Kunes)."
