    "If you are considering Chinese as your language requirement, it's a great language to learn, but be warned that it's a lot of work. You really need to be able to budget time for Chinese each and every day. It's way too easy for it become 2 AM and you finish your other homework, but have yet to start learning your characters. Slacking off a few times a week really adds up.But that said, the teachers are amazing. You get a different teacher every day so that you get to hear different voices speaking Chinese. Each of them is fantastic in their own way. Course materials are very good - the course packet and books and online materials are very clear and informative.Each night you are responsible for about five\/six characters, a short dialog, some grammar notes, and sometimes a written translation assignment. There's six written tests spread out through the semester, as well as six oral presentations. There's a daily quiz (which you can get away cramming for fifteen minutes before, but not learning those characters will come back and bite you later on). You also have to meet with a Chinese graduate student for tutorial time for twenty five minutes a week. There's no final or midterms.Once you get to the end of Shopping Period, you should have a really good sense of what the workload will be like from then until the end of the semester.I personally enjoy foreign languages, and I have to say that Chinese 110 has been my favorite class at Yale so far (and I'm a junior). I've simply had the most fun in Chinese (your other seven or so classmates make all the difference) and feel like I've learned something really pertinent and tangibly useful.",
    "Chinese 110 was an excellent course. The small seminar structure based primarily on class conversation was an effective way to learn Chinese conversational skills rapidly in combination with grammar structure and written characters. Zhou Laoshi and the rest of the teaching staff are certainly among the best, and they are impressively consistent in teaching material between rotation days. The only stressful area of the course was the intense workload, but it was understandably necessary to learn the language rapidly. The mandatory tutorial session seemed extraneous, but that was the course's only weakness. I highly recommend this course to anyone with a true interest in learning the language - it is undeniably difficult but also completely worth it!",
    "SOOOOOO HARD!!!!!!!!! But worth it. take it if you have enough time to take it. It will become your life.",
    "Awesome course. Enriching and fun! Definitely recommend. Be prepared to do a lot of work though.",
    "This is an amazing class. I would certainly recommend it to every other student. It is taught extremely well, and the different teachers are all very energetic and willing to put in the extra effort to make sure that you understand what is going on and do not get lost. It is worth the huge time commitment.",
    "If you really want to learn Chinese, this course will help you--but try to balance out your courses--this course is a lot of work. You just need time to do well, but time is hard to come by for Yalies so plan accordingly.",
    "An excellent language program. It requires a lot of work but by the end of the first semester you feel very comfortable with the information that you have covered, provided you try. I would recommend this course to any student who would be interested intaking first year chinese.",
    "This is a fantastic class. The curriculum is clearly very carefully constructed to give students a good base for future Chinese learning -- I thought there was a great balance of speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Most importantly, I feel like I learned a lot of Chinese!",
    "You have a constant wave of Chinese every day, but it's tremendously rewarding. Your class becomes very close because you meet every day, and this course opens up the opportunity of the Light Fellowship - who could turn that down? If you are organised, and keep on top of all your work, then this course becomes more manageable than you might think",
    "Strongly. If you are interested in learning chinese, I think this course is the best you can get. Be prepared to allot an amount of time for daily study (around an hour and a half to two hours) and your work will be rewarded. The professors are truly great, very good at explaining and answering any questions that you might have.",
    "yes. It's a great class full of work and fun. We learn Chinese at a good pace.",
    "Summary: An introduction to modern Mandarin, spoken and written.Recommendation: Take it.",
    "Take it! I was very intimidated before taking this class, and it is definitely a lot of work, but you will be very impressed with how much you learn. The teachers are all very nice, and class can be fun if you like your classmates. You just have to be careful to follow all the rules, because there are a lot of them (e.g. 1.5 points off your final grade for every unexcused absence, 2 points off a homework if you forget to staple, etc). Having said that, you get the hang of things really quickly. Chinese is awesome!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student, but really only if you're serious about studying Chinese. I'd taken the language in the past, so I was already familiar with many of its particularities. However, I can only imagine what it must have been like for the other students in my section - the course really digs straight into the material, and moves forward at a rapid pace. The load of coursework can vary, but I could easily spend two hours a day studying. The professors are excellent, and if you're in a section with people that you get along with, class is a truly enjoyable experience. All the same, Chinese 110 is not for thefaint of heart.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chinese 110 for a student who has any interest in learning Chinese. The class is very well taught and structured, so that you begin learning Chinese right away and very little time, if any, is wasted in class. The sections are very small (my section had 8 people), and the you rotate between five instructors, each of whom has a slightly different teaching style, so you won't get bored. The class does require that you keep up with the material, and the workload can be heavy, but it is completely manageable. I spent around an average of 1.5 hours on Chinese each night, which isn't that much considering that is is a 1.5 credit class. Exams are fair and should be easy if you keep up with the work, and presentations and oral exams help to make sure you're also learning how to speak correctly (it's all about tones!) alongside learning characters and grammar. By the end of the semester, you will have had learned ~300 characters and some very basic conversational skills. Don't expect to know how to speak Chinese like a Beijinger after one semester (needless to say), but what you do learn you'll know very well.And the opportunities available for students of Chinese are amazing. The Light Fellowship says it all. You can spend a summer in China after your first year of Chinese, or you can apply for funding for a year abroad even after first year Chinese. Yale, and the instructors of Chinese 110, are serious about its students learning Chinese, and the opportunities afforded by Yale are proof of this.My only regret about Chinese is that I didn't take it in freshman year. I'm glad I took it this year, though!",
    "Deciding to learn Chinese is a great choice, as long as you understand the workload you're accepting. Chinese is not difficult; it's just time-intensive. An hour every day for daily characters and dialogues, plus more hours for homework sheets, presentations, and exams. If you put in the time, you will get an A. There are a ton of resources for Chinese learners at Yale, including the Chinese program itself. We have one of the best programs in the nation right here, why not take advantage of it?",
    "I would definitely recommend Chinese 110 to everybody who is interested. I loved it, and can't wait for the second semester. The workload isn't as bad as people say as long as you do it consistently and the teachers are great, and patient.",
    "A lot of work, but worth it if you are serious about learning Chinese. You will learn a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student because you learn a lot, it is fair, and the work load is heavy but manageable. I have not taken another class at Yale that has a more organized lesson plan.",
    "Chinese 110 isn't easy, but yields tremendous dividends. The faculty are all wonderful and the class is fun. If you are serious about learning Chinese, definitely take this course; I can't see any better time or place to learn, or better people to learn from. That said, the workload can at times be onerous, but I'm sure students pursuing Chinese are aware of the necessary commitment.",
    "Chinese 110 is a lot of work, but it is well worth it. There are daily quizzes, weekly or biweekly tests and presentations and three oral exams, although there is no official \"final exam.\" You will learn almost 300 characters throughout the semester and there are basic dialogues to memorize each night, so you must be willing to work everyday for at least an hour or more depending on your habits and background. Some in the class will have a little background, but if you have none, you will catch up soon. Overall: Great COurse with Great Professors. Also, class sizes are limited to 8-10 so you get the individual attention that you need to learn a tough language. If you do the work, you can get an A.",
    "I would recommend this course only to those willing to put in the large amount of work required to succeed in the class. I have never had a language class as demanding as this, but the knowledge i have gained is in proportion to that difficulty.",
    "YESSSSSSI already speak French, Spanish and Korean, so I could've placed out of the language requirement by taking L5 in any one of those, but I decided to explore and took Chinese as a new language.I DO NOT REGRET IT.If you're considering taking a new language, TAKE CHINESE!",
    "Chinese 110 was a difficult class for me, but after getting into the necessary work habits, I found it manageable. The strength was definitely the quality of the teaching \u0097 very helpful and also very friendly. I feel that the instructors tried to get to know each student personally!I am truly amazed by how much I have learned this semester. Just realize that you are committing yourself to a great deal of work. If you're ready, go for it.",
    "Its a lot of work each day, and even more work if you want to stay ahead of the game. Definitely worth it.",
    "Highly recommendedPerfectly organised, very effective and a very intensive course",
    "Take it. You'll work hard but you'll learn a lot. It's extremely worth it if only for the fact that you'll actually enjoy attending class.",
    "Very good, it is hard but the teachers were great and although it was a lot of work it wasn't too much.",
    "This class is very intense, because it HAS to be, so you have to be willing to put in the many hours of homework in order to keep up in class. My only comment is that sometimes the class is intensified in the wording that is used for the exams and other assignments, and it becomes a little scary and intimidating. However, it is very rewarding when y",
    "Very tough. Very draining. Incredibly rewarding, and strangely fun.",
    "A lot of work. You will have homework every night. I would recommend it because it is very interesting nd you can learn a lot form it.",
    "If you want to start learning Chinese, Chinese 110 is the rightplace to start. I think that this program is a great asset toYale and it is a great opportunity for students interested inlearning Chinese. You won't regret it!! The work load can beoverwhelming at times but is really worth it.",
    "Absolutely, you learn a ton.",
    "I would summarize this course as VERY labor intensive but very precise instruction in a difficult language. I would absolutely recommend it to another student who wants to learn Chinese, though I would add that even for such a demanding course nothing can match immersion.",
    "This class is not for the faint of heart. You have to be willing to study really really hard and constantly. And make sure your other classes will not make your life miserable; it's hard to balance learning Chinese for the first time with other difficult subjects. However, it is a lot of fun. The teachers are so fun and the small classes become like families. It's really a great class. Take it if you want to learn Chinese or go to China!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class! It is an amazing introduction to Chinese class and when you leave it you really feel like you have learned a substantial amount of useful conversational Chinese.",
    "I highly recommend Chinese 110 to anyone interested in learning the Chinese language. Don't be intimated by the workload; it is not all that bad, especially if you are driven by a strong desire to learn Chinese, and it isn't hard to get a good grade in this course as long as you do all the work expected of you. Also, this class is a great way to get to bond with other students in your section.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It was time-consuming and challenging but highly rewarding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Besides the wide-ranging benefits of learning to speak Mandarin, it is a fun atmosphere to be in.",
    "good",
    "If you want to learn Chinese at some point in your life, definitely take Chinese 110 now. It will be more work than any of your other classes but, if you keep up with it, you will be rewarded. All the teachers are great and they are very accommodating. Don't feel frightened because Chinese is known as one of the hardest languages to learn. At first I was - and I am NOT a language person - but by the third day I was loving it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Chinese 110 to another student, but would let them know immediately about the level of dedication it requires. I have found the Chinese language extremely rewarding, and I think most people would enjoy it as well (as long as they are willing to spend 2-3 hours a night studying).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone willing to put in the work \u0096 there\u0092s a lot of it. The assignments themselves aren\u0092t too bad, but you also have to learn characters and a dialog for each class. That said, the format of the class makes it easy to get in the rhythm of studying every day: the course packet outlines what\u0092s happening each class, so you know ahead of time what\u0092s going on, and most of the class time is spent drilling what you\u0092ve studied. There\u0092s a different teacher every day of the week, and they\u0092re all amazing!! A word of advice: consider carefully before picking your tutorial time slot. I had 3:30 on Thursdays, which got in the way a lot, and some people picked Sunday, thinking it would be easier to do on the weekend \u0096 bad idea. Overall, this is a very rewarding class.",
    "Excellent course; you can easily feel progress. Makes you appreciate daily class.",
    "This is an excellent, no-nonsense introduction to Chinese. The class is not extremely difficult, but it is not easy. The curriculum is fast-paced and well-planned, and the teaching and student support systems are terrific. Quite simply, you get as much as you put in -- given the fast-paced class environment and the endless requirements, it is hard not to stay caught-up with work, but it requires extra effort to make good use of what you've learned in other contexts. I think that this is a great class and I would recommend it to other students with the small bit of advice that choosing the right section -- ie the right group of peers -- is important. Some classes are much more energetic and high-performing than others; try to get into those.",
    "Chinese was a highlight of my semester. I really enjoyed doing chinese homework every night, usually more than doing things for other classes. That's the drawback though, because I may not have done so well in my other classes because I had such a focus on Chinese. Not to say I did badly, but the balance needs to be watched. I think I could've let my chinese grade slip a little and still gotten the same grade, and I could've improved in another class.With enough time put into Chinese, there's no reason why you shouldn't get an A. And you really know what you're learning too. So rewarding3",
    "Yes. The course is very well organized, and from the beginning, the sentences and vocabulary they teach you are as applicable to daily conversations as possible, i.e. greetings, apologies, conversations occurring at stores, restaurants, in the home and at school. (As opposed to classes in which you might learn sentences like \"The red car is on the lawn,\" which, although important to know for fluency, do not have as many opportunities for use.)Generally, 1-2 hours of work a night.Be aware that the complexity of the dialogues you have to memorize as well as the hand-in homework requested of you take a somewhat abrupt increase once reading week is over.",
    "Chinese 110 is a difficult course; while it seems to start off slowly, it quickly becomes a test-a-week, meet 6-times-a-week pain in the proverbial academic butt. But I understand why this is: they make you do all of the work because it is the only way to learn Chinese in a class as quickly as you must learn it to have a working knowledge of Chinese before you leave Yale's Chinese program. I learned a heck of a lot more than I thought I would in only one semester.So, while you will at times be swamped with work and at other times resent having to study Chinese while your friends do more fun things, you will be pleasantly surprised by the amount that you learn, and have a feeling of accomplishment when you are finished.Ultimately, if you have interest in Chinese, you have come to the right place. Yale is rightly regarded as having the best undergrad Chinese program in the country, and you would be foolish not to take advantage of it (although I would warn you that taking Chinese and DS at the same time is a mistake).",
    "This is an outstanding course taught by committed and excellent teachers, but it likewise requires time and effort on the part of its students. The daily load often exceeded two hours per night, and skipping even one day puts one far behind. The rigor of the course was exhilarating but at times exhausting. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning Chinese with the proviso that he or she understands that taking this course requires a major commitment. As one person put it, Chinese here at Yale is not a language, but a lifestyle.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone willing and excited to put in a significant amount of time -- about 2 hours a night for homework -- to get what is an extremely rewarding language learning experience. But if your semester is already jam-packed, it might be better to re-evaluate if you can get the most out of taking Mandarin, since it is a cumulative course in which, if you fall behind once, you'll be playing catch-up for a while, which is not the best way to learn a language.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is very interested in foreign languages and would like a very solid start to Chinese! Although the load is difficult, I do not believe it is much harder than any other Yale language. I also think Professor Zhou has set up an infallible system.",
    "Chinese 110 was great. Definitely my favorite class so far. If you are willing to put in the work (because there is a lot of work and even when you are done with your homework, there is always more that can be done and should be done if you are serious about learning Chinese), you will do fine. Do not be discouraged about the amount of work you will have because you will find that often, you will exceed the time you set aside for this class because you get wrapped up in practice, not because you have to. Chinese is something that I enjoyed very most.",
    "Chinese 110 is a wonderful course that will challenge you. I personally recommend this course because it introduces students to the basics of the Chinese Language in a timely, organized fashion. The teachers are extremely supportive and are always available either in Office hours or by e-mail.",
    "Chinese 110 is exactly what everybody says: a ton of work and absolutely fantastic. The work, though immense in quantity, is not terribly difficult, and having the class every day leads you to quickly establish study habits that work for you. It is heavy on memorization. (Actually, after having taken it for one semester, you will find yourself with the uncanny ability to memorize nearly anything in the short-term.) Don't take it at 9:20 unless your schedule dictates that you must. Getting up that early every single day of the week can get grueling. You bond a lot with the other students in your Chinese section. It's a lot of work, but very rewarding and even fun.",
    "I would recommend this class to those who want to start learning Chinese. It is undeniable that workload is pretty much, but you can learn much from this class.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course for any student interested in learning Chinese.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in a challenging but very well organized Chinese course.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone who wants to learn Chinese. However, it is a lot of work and dominates the rest of your classes.",
    "Chinese 110 is an excellent course. Although many wouldn't recommend it just to fulfill your language requirements, but if you truly enjoy the Chinese culture and language, this course is a fabulous opportunity to do just that. It is definitely a big time commitment, but everything you put in, you get out, and it is all worth it.",
    "The grading is very strict, and consistent, so hard work will pay off.",
    "You dive into a journey of intensive language study. It is difficult, yet highly rewarding. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student, as long as they are prepared to do a lot of work.",
    "I would definitely reccommendthis class to another student! Chinese is a lot of work but a lot of fun!",
    "An interesting class, but a heavy workload so be prepared. A lot of drilling and memorization",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a motivated and driven student. The pace is very fast and the workload demanding but if you apply yourself you will reap the benefits.",
    "Chinese 110 is basic Chinese at a very fast past. you are expected to learn quickly and put in the time to learn the words. It is hard work. I would recommend Chinese 110 to any student that is serious about learning Chinese. It is not easy but it is definitely worth it.",
    "I would recommend Chinese 110 to other students if and only if they were seriously commited to studying Chinese. It's not a course that should be taken on a whim, but if one enrolls in it after serious thought, it's extremely rewarding."
