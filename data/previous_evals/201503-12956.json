    "Learn how to write for musical theatre! New pieces due every week Not for the faint of heart",
    "This class is a lot, especially if you come in with no experience composing. I pulled my first all-nighters trying to finish songs, and sometimes still didn't get the results I wanted. That said, you improve an incredible amount throughout the semester, end up with several songs that you can be proud of, and learn a lot about the art of composing. I would recommend it to the student that is motivated and prepared to put the time in (depending on your skill level. If you've composed before, it's probably not that bad).",
    "Freedom to compose pretty much whatever (you get a broad topic every week) + time constraints to force you to put work in is a pretty good formula to get better at composing.",
    "I would recommend MUSI 214 to anybody who wants to learn to write better music. Whether you're interested in pop, rock, classical music, or musical theatre, this course will better develop your voice, technique, notation skills, understanding of musical form, lyric writing, etc. Even if you hate musical theatre, take this course - find out why you hated it, and write something better.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to hone their craft or just learn more about the art of writing for theater."
