    "Instructor: Hao Deng \u00a0Honestly, no weaknesses, keep up the good work",
    "Instructor: Hao Deng \u00a0Hao made himself very available, and was willing to stay as long as necessary for each student to understand what the assignments were asking and how the concepts worked. Sometimes it took several students to ask different versions of the same question before Hao finally understood what we were asking, which at times, was a source of frustration. He never gave up on our questions, however, and if he didn't know an answer, he made sure to send it out later.",

    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0He was always available to guard me in understanding some of the concepts discussed in class.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0Overall, my experience with the TAs was a positive one. However, sometimes the problem sets were worded confusingly or the equations were incorrect. The TAs did not know how to handle these issues and often there was no outreach to the entire class. If a student was unable to attend the option TA sessions, s\/he would not have had all the information necessary to complete the problem set.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0Very friendly, approachable, knowledgable, responsive, accessible. No complaints.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0Jesse was extremely helpful. He was able to clearly and comprehensively explain complex topics and questions that significantly added to my understanding of subjects in the class. He is kind and thoughtful and we all appreciated his effort. My only suggestion would be that in light of the significant gap between what was covered in class and the problem set material, a bit more emphasis on a short, structured lesson in tutorial time might have been helpful.",

   "comments": [
    "I suggest the professor to have a better control of the pace of the class, rather than turning the class to a totally discussion time which may not be that valuable.",
    "The instructor answers every student question, and there were lots of them - in general, this was very positive. Occasionally, however, a student would ask too many questions that were too far off topic, and those classes would have flowed better if the instructor had asked the student to ask the questions outside of class.",
    "Professor Gillingham needs to make sure that the course progresses at an appropriate pace. If this means that he cannot answer each and every students questions, then so be it.",
    "The problem sets could have been worded better and several contained errors.",
    "Consider including both government failures as well as market failures as topics in the class. Future policy makers need to understand the balance needed between policy as a tool for addressing market failures, as well as a tool that can be used by government that could intentionally\/inadvertently stifle growth. The economics literature we reviewed covered market failures well, but when policy is being developed, there are other considerations to account for beyond economics.",
    "You should just call the \"midterm\" a final... it was totally a final. That quantitative work in the problem sets were not linked or supported in lecture. You basically had to go to the TF session, which I didn't like. The readings were redundant and there were too many readings assigned. I would have done more readings, but it was hard to tell what was important and what wasn't. Plus the lectures crystalized the important parts of the readings. I liked that all the readings were very current though.",
    "Class lectures were sometimes too focused on re-iterating the readings, instead of moving beyond them.",
    "A basic textbook of economic concepts to refer to would be nice. That seemed lacking at times.",
    "Ken could do a better job of managing student questions to keep the class on target. Questions and comments often went off target and I feel like we could've spent more time on other, more useful things. Ken intentionally creates an environment where questions and comments are welcome, however I think he takes this openness too far. Also, having a few guest lecturers on politics and the political feasibility\/tactics towards certain policy objectives would have been great. Ken is an incredible economist, but not well-versed on politics. Perhaps this class could be paired with a energy politics class. Also, a lot to cover- we went into very much detail on some things and too little on others. Again, maybe better as a two-part course. I'd also prefer less academic articles, more newspaper\/magazine articles. In sum, a little too heavy on the economics side.",
    "Level of difficulty needs to be pulled up. It didn't feel like a masters class.",
    "I can't see so far.",
    "At times Ken indulged too much in answering questions (some more frivolous or less germane than others), thereby slowing the pace of the class and being unable to cover other interesting material.",
    "It sometimes felt as though there was a bit of a disconnect between the hw assignments and the material covered in class -- particularly in terms of the more quantitative questions. There was an expected base of knowledge that I'm not sure everyone possessed.",

A more structured, in-class approach to economic analysis would have been helpful (rather than just problem sets).
