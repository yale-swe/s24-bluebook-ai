   "comments": [
    "Great class. AMAZING LECTURES. Sometimes there were a lot of weekly readings, but overall they were worth better understanding the material.2 projects, one paper. I do wish that we were informed of the paper a bit sooner.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class because it's one of the few classes that really gives a good overview of the history of urban design. The projects are a lot of fun, and the workload isn't bad at all.",
    "Pretty interesting and not too much work, but its hard to say how much you'll get out of it. There are no tests, which is kind of nice, but that also means you have little motivation to review your class notes and try to remember what you've been taught. Still, its perfectly enjoyable, and the projects are a nice break from other classwork.",
    "Civic Art will provide you with a solid introduction to the history of land use. There is a lot of overlap between this class and classes like Study of the City and American Cultural Landscapes, so I would look through the syllabus and see if you already know the material. Overall I enjoyed the lectures and projects and would recommend this class to another student interested in urban design.",
    "The lectures kind of felt all over the place. The pop quizzes you're given in section are impossible unless you take so many notes during lecture that your hands ache. Projects, though, are easy.",
    "An excellent survey to urban studies. A little repetitive if you have done other urban studies courses before.",
    "This is a GREAT course. The lectures are interesting and the projects are a lot of fun, although quite a bit of work. The workload is low throughout the semester, with three time intensive projects. However, these are so much more interesting than the typical paper! This is a great way to learn a LOT about a fascinating topic!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student as a comprehensive introduction to urban design. I believe that this class will drastically improve when it has been taught by the same professor for a few years in a row and the lecture material and readings are better synchronized. The course material should be required for all architecture and urban studies students.",
    "Yes. I would.",
    "An interesting class to take if you're not someone who likes to be able to wrap their heads around something completely. I felt like I walked away knowing a little about a lot of different themes."
