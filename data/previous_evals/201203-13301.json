    "Yes, I'd recommend this course. Basically, the course approaches current topics in health care through econometrics, and students are allowed to discuss\/contemplate policy implications of the outcomes of econometric studies applied to topics of interest. It's also a good course to take if you've never taken the time to iron out exactly how the health care system in the US works (you'll need to know after you graduate, so pretty applicable), or if recent legislation is sensible.",
    "Senior lecture on health economics. Relatively low workload and interesting subject for anyone interested in healthcare and the differences between healthcare as a good and other goods that don't suffer from so many informational asymmetries. Professor Kowalski knows her stuff, but if you're not a morning person (if the class is still at 9 AM), don't take this because you won't learn anything.",
    "yes, if you're interested in healthcare. no otherwise.",
    "Take it. It was not too much work, i would recommend reading all the articles though but the textbook is not necessary. Kowalski is a great professor and really knows what she is talking about",
    "Definitely take this class! You get to apply microeconomic concepts to real-world problems. As a citizen, it is important to understand how the health care system works. Prof. Kowalski does a great job of presenting papers so you get to see not only the conclusions but also the process. I learned a lot, and the class is not difficult.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in healthcare economics. Otherwise, there are other, more interest small lecture courses available.",
    "Everything you need to know about healthcare",
    "This class is definitely for people interested in this subject matter. This is not a course to just take casually to learn about the US Healthcare system. That would be better done in Howard Foreman's class. This class is much more concerned with economic theories and empirical studies. I learned a lot about how to assess research in health economics.The workload is actually pretty light and the information is valuable.",
    "This is a very interesting survey course on the economics of healthcare. It covers a wide variety of topics including Medicare reform, the economics of pharmaceuticals, why dental insurance costs extra, and racial and gender disparities in healthcare. The professor is very accessible and is very accessible inside and out of class, and willing to help students with questions and concerns. The TA, Julia, is equally willing to help students with review questions during section and office hours throughout the term. This course taught me a lot about how healthcare works in the country, and could be very useful for those considering a career in a healthcare profession. I'd highly recommend this course, and it's easily one of the most interesting courses I've taken in Economics as a senior.",
    "Id recommend this course especially if you want to understand the current debt and healthcare crisis.",
    "Great course if you are at all interested in the healthcare system.",
    "Definitely a worthwhile class if you haven't taken Forman's other health economics class and want something a little more difficult instead. This class focuses more on economic concepts applied to health care as well as an examination of current research in health economics, and I enjoyed this approach. Professor Kowalski relies a bit too much on PowerPoint slides, but she is informative, an important player in health economics, and an effective speaker. Her in-depth explanations of economic papers are the best I've ever seen, and they make dense research interesting and easy to understand without dumbing them down too much. Like many other economics classes, section was not usually helpful but might be helpful during particularly difficult weeks.Evaluations from last year called this class \"less\" work than other courses, but this is no longer the case based on my experience. There's a lot of work for this classnow: a difficult yet rewarding econometrics-intensive problem set, three 800-1000 word papers (best two count), a midterm, and a final. All of these assignments were fair and reasonable except for the final exam, which seemed to test rote memorization more than the application of economic concepts.Overall, this is a great, real-world-applicable economics course.",
