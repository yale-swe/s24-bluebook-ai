    "Great introductory metaphysics class, covers most topics in metaphysics. Recommend it if you are interested and have taken at least one philosophy class.",
    "The course material touches on pretty standard topics in Metaphysics- so take it if you like causality, free will, pluralism\/monism, and stuff like that. The teaching is really what makes this course good- take it with Professor Miller if you can - she's one of the best professors I've ever had (and her Classesv2 is nothing short of a work of art: like nothing you've ever seen). Good way to do the M&E requirements in philosophy, and it would probably make a good introduction to philosophy and philosophical method for someone who's not familiar with it, or who is more comfortable with the hard sciences.",
    "Great survey course of contemporary metaphysics which manages to go in depth on a few topics (especially the debate among Humeans (read: Lewisians) and anti-Humeans about laws of nature) while keeping a clear eye on the big picture. I'm not sure what a non-philosophy major would think, though: all of it is interesting and relevant to people doing contemporary analytic philosophy, but I would imagine the discussions could be tiresome if that's not your cup of tea.",
    "A wonderful introductory-level metaphysics class. Material is challenging and engaging, but also accessible for first-timers in philosophy. Essays are rigorous and rewarding, but also so much help is offered throughout the process. And we get to rewrite 2 essays as well. Prof Miller is a wonderful professor; it'll definitely be a joy being taught by her. The problem with the class this semester is that there was a very clear divide between those who spoke up in class and those who didn't. And that was quite sad\/awkward, because it'd always be the same few people speaking up in class. And when it came to the final group presentations at the end of the semester, it was just really awkward that we didn't even know some of our group members, and it was the first time some people spoke in that class... So, I'd just recommend being active in participating in class, and not letting some people dominate the class for the semester.",
    "Great class, mostly because Professor Miller is a fantastic teacher. If you don't want to challenge the way you think about the world, then this is not the class for you. If you do...well, you're in for quite the ride.",
    "If you are even remotely interested in philosophy as it is practiced in universities today, you could do no better than taking this course. Elizabeth is really committed to helping you get a hang of reading and writing philosophy. She sets aside loads of timebefore and after class, during office hours, at optional discussion sectionsto make sure that anyone who needs to go over any of the material has the opportunity to do so. Her comments on essays were thorough, and we had the chance to re-write each one (the grade on the re-write took the place of the original grade, which was quite generous). In addition, the syllabus itself was very well organized: we did not cover all that many topics in contemporary metaphysics, but the ones that we did cover were all linked, so the class felt more unified than it otherwise might have been if we had covered more. In sum, this course is a wonderful option for those who have never taken a philosophy class before or for those who have done philosophy, but no metaphysics.",
    "If you've ever wondered whether the world we live in is real, what exactly we mean when we say something causes something else, or if everything we do is a result of our own free will or just a chain of logically necessary events, then you need to be in this class. If not, then there's no reason for you to take it.",
    "If you are even considering taking this class you should make sure that its' a semester in which you can do the subject matter justice. Lots of interesting things to think very hard about, even if eventually you come to the conclusion that it is all meaningless anyway (you will have arrived at the conclusion through your OWN judgements, which is very valuable). Take this credit\/D if you do not have prior background in philosophy.",
    "Although it's an introductory course, some background in philosophy would be helpful to access the dense readings. The professor is a great resource if you are willing to go to office hours."
