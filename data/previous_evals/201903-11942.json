    "I learned about a lot of new plays and dramatic concepts.",
    "information about the history of theater, viewing scenes with different perspectives and considering alternate forms of performance",
    "How to analyze plays. How to approach plays with scholarly research to help artistic choices.",
    "I learned about different styles of theatre through different time periods and geographic locations. I also learned about how to analyze a 'the world' of the play. The performance works also helped experiment with different artistic choices and how these led to different interpretations of the play.",
    "I learned how to read ancient theatrical texts like modern ones and interpret them within their historical time period and culture. I learned a lot about how cultures impacted how plays were interpreted and what their significances were.",
    "I developed a solid foundation of theatrical historical knowledge, as well as experience in reading plays closely and in conversation with theatrical scholarship.",
    "I learned a lot about theater, performance, drama, and the history of it! The amazing thing is how we learned from many different cultures, eras, and time periods! Whether it was Nigerian adaptations or classic Chinese pieces!",
    "I learned about multiple different theater traditions and plays representative of those traditions at a pace that allowed for sufficient analysis while still allowing numerous traditions to be surveyed."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was pretty good as is.",
    "Having the discussion section was a strength of the course because it was better to analyze the texts and discuss ideas and themes in a small setting rather than in the lecture. Another strength was that there was a lot of room to consider all aspects of production (lights, sound, dramaturgy, etc) not just acting, which led to a more well-rounded experience.",
    "Strengths: the course covers a wide array of plays and time periods, and also makes space for collaborative performance works. Weaknesses: sometimes communication from professors\/TFs was slow and\/or confusing.",
    "There were five different syllabi. There were certain lectures spent on topics or plays that either we weren't allowed to use on projects or that were not relevant to what we were doing\/where we going with the course (namely Soyinka's Bacchae). There was a mandatory performance that was brought up the week it happened and that was oddly placed in the (5) syllabi. The material covered in the beginning seemed to only skim the surface. I'm also not a fan of the testing bundles, particularly having an essay but also having a midterm and final that are essentially a series of in-class essays.",
    "Strengths: Very informative and Shilarna is GREAT!",
    "The end of the semester had a few too many final assignments. A final paper, project, and exam seemed a bit unnecessary..",
    "Lectures were sometimes a bit scattered, and didn't always relate to the content of the plays we read. Not enough time spent on analyzing the plays."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, if they have an interest in theater studies.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in theatre and wants to learn about a wide variety of styles beyond what is traditionally taught in English classes.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially anyone interested in the Theater Studies major because it not only familiarizes you with principles of reading theater, but also introduces you to the other members of the very small major, which I honestly found to be the best part of the course. I became very close with my section and also other members of the course, which I think was really integral into my adjustment to college and transition into the theater world of Yale.",
    "This course is a useful foundation for those intending on pursuing the Theatre Studies major, but is admittedly not particularly fascinating or invigorating.",
    "Yes! Shilarna is so nice, patient, and entertaining! You learn so much about theater history!",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. Even for someone who is not a Theater and Performance Studies major, this class is incredibly engaging and quite varied in its material."
