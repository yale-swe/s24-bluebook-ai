    "It is a field trip, so I declined to answer the field trip question.",
    "This is above and beyond one of the best learning experiences I've had at Yale. Mike is an excellent discussion leader, and he does a wonderful job of meeting individual students at their own level of understanding. The course shows in practice the type of forestry that we can't really see in New England. No one should graduate from the best forestry school in the US without visiting the timber basket of the US (the South). The cultural experience is also wonderful. I highly, highly recommend this course."

   "comments": [
    "It gives you a valuable chance to see on the ground forestry, which is very important for forestry students who have gone taken the courses but not really seeing different practices on the ground.",
    "I thought that we went to a very diverse selection of forest management operations. I liked that we got to see both private organizations and government owned forest, and learning about the motivations that influence key decision making in both of those realms. All of our tour guides were excellent! They were extremely responsive to the students and were very knowledgeable! Mike and Rebecca did an excellent job organizing the itinerary. We were busy but not overwhelmingly so.",
    "Great trip!",
    "Field trips are as useful as the best of the courses for you to understand sectors or areas of the World. This was a fantastic experience for getting to know the South-East and how forestry takes place there.",
    "Each day brings a new learning opportunity, from seeing plantation style forestry to wildlife habitats. There's just the right amount of down time to feel that you can absorb all you need and want to without feeling bored. And, you get to learn from experts in the field as well as your peers. All around a wonderful experience.",
    "This course is so important for the forestry curriculum! It exposes us to the sector of forest resource management that dominates the markets and that we are unable to learn about from up here in NE.",
    "The opportunity to meet and interact with a variety of different forestry practitioners across South Carolina is incredible. I came away from the course with a much better grasp of how pine ecosystems are managed, and how industrial forestry works."

    "I heavily focused on forestry even I am a MEM student. I wish to bring some of the forestry practices back to Tibet, thus, this course perfectly fits into my overall program.",
    "I had very little exposure to forestry beforehand so this was very eye-opening. I mostly took the course due to personal interest, and I got all of my questions answered that I had wanted.",
    "As someone with interest in the international aspects of forestry, forest products, etc. this course was a must. I truly enjoyed it, learned a lot and I am so happy about it being offered. It was one of the highlights in the semester.",

    "This is an excellent course, and it's even better if you know what to look for. At times, Mike just let us explore a little bit in the forest stands, and it's helpful if you have a little bit of knowledge so you can distinguish interesting\/concerning\/cool things.",
    "If you study forestry in the US you have to take this course if you are not very familiar already with forestry in the SE",
    "Do it! Go with an open mind, take notes, and enjoy every moment.",
    "This trip is an amazing opportunity to see a different side of forestry than you see in the rest of the program."
