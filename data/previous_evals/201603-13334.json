It also gives an insight into the environmental issues that arose during the energy marked energy transitions over the years and how they were,have been and maybe addressed in the future",

The research in energy history provides a good introduction into the energy world by looking at how transitions have occurred over the years and their impact on the social structures as well as the environment. Given I have no academic background in energy other than work experience,it serves as a good foundation course for anyone interested in energy. Additionally,the research paper provides an opportunity for one to develop an argument focusing on energy history and defend the same.This was quite useful as a tool in developing my writing skills",
