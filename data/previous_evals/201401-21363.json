   "comments": [
    "I recommend this class to anyone with a serious interest in Modern China. The readings are fascinating and touch on so, so, so many aspects of Chinese society that you really learn SO MUCH. The readings can get to be a lot -- an average of 4 or so scholarly articles per week, and it's sometimes difficult to gauge which ones are most important and which ones you should focus on and in what detail. Prof. Davis is wonderful -- an extremely friendly and encouraging professor who will treat you like an equal. She makes herself extremely available to her students, and she is one of the few professors I have encountered in my time at Yale who responded to emails with carefully thought out and detailed comments -- which is often much more helpful than meeting in person when you are scrambling to write a paper. The fact is that DD is willing to take the time to help and I would say without a doubt that students are a major priority for her. It's wonderful. (A sidenote: I have often heard that she is a tough grader, but haven't found this to be the case myself. The bottom line is that she likes to see that her students have thought carefully and critically about the material and done the required work. You don't need to be a genius to do that, but you do need to take the class seriously. An example to illustrate the point: a final paper outline to Prof. Davis isn't a bibiography of some basic sources along with a few paragraphs of vague ideas; it's an outline with sections and thesis statements and all of that fun stuff.) I think you should have some China experience going into this class or you will be a little swamped and lost. But it isn't necessary to have taken 5329523 China classes or even to speak Chinese.",
    "If you're an EAST major I would highly recommend this course as soon as possible. Professor Davis is great. It's a lot of work, but it's highly rewarding.",
    "As with other Deborah Davis classes, this class is not for the novice to China. She expects you to have already an intimate understanding of modern Chinese history, society, and politics. (Not to mention the weekly Chinese sections.) This class, compared to her other China classes, is more theoretical, focusing on the concept of civil society, and is relatively loosely structured. Either way, you'll have to do a ton of reading, and expect to engage in some original research as well."
