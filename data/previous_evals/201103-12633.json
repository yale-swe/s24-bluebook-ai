    "Best class I've taken at Yale. TAKE IT!",
    "Absolutely. This course is amazing--hands down my favorite course I've ever taken at Yale. Gaddis is fantastic and extremely accessible. You will not regret taking this course. I have taken many courses here on the cold war and this one is absolutely the most definitive and enjoyable. Although there is a fair amount of reading and the exams are difficult (he likes to choose ID's almost exclusively from the reading, not from lecture), it is definitely worth it.",
    "Yale legend. But do not expect your life to change.",
    "Probably the best class I have taken at Yale, Gaddis is an amazing professor, you have to take this class before you graduate!",
    "Take it. Take it. Take it. The best class I have taken at Yale. I was extremely sad to have it end.",
    "I would summarize it by saying take if necessary, if not, just avoid it and take one of these incredible seminars that Yale offers. Don't waste your time with the Gaddis folklore, he's washed up.",
    "Gaddis is inimitable and has lots of great stories, and he's much more approachable than you'd think. Apparently you can't get the CNN documentary he shows from anywhere else, so you might as well watch it in this class. Make sure you go through the readings and find the more obscure IDs, as they're more likely to show up on the tests.",
    "Lectures are great, I hated going to section but I did learn a lot. I would recommend it.",
    "would recommend to any student interested in the cold war at all",
    "Take it!",
    "Cold War is great to take Credit\/D. I went to all of the lectures and tried to do a good amount of reading so I'd get something out of it. For me at least you can't totally slack off even if you're taking it Credit\/D - on the midterm I only recognized 4\/7 IDs and was supposed to talk about 5. Definitely worth taking even if you're not a history person just because it's a lot of stuff that you probably don't know about but should.",
    "Incredible class. Gaddis is an amazing lecturer. Take this class before you graduate.",
    "A class that every Yale student should take.",
    "Great class on an extremely important period in history that remains relevant today",
    "What a class at Yale should be. Absolutely recommend.",
    "TAKE IT! YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS CLASS TO GRADUATE. IT IS THE BEST CLASS AND PROFESSOR GADDIS IS AN ALLSTAR IN HIS FIELD. It is so interesting. There is absolutely no reason not to take it.",
    "Fantastic course, definitely one of my favorite classes at Yale. As a non-history major, I found the class very accessible and understandable - don't need background knowledge. Gaddis is an amazing lecturer, and really knows his stuff. DEFINITELY take this.",
    "It is the definitive Cold War course. Take this class if you are interested in Cold War history. Take this class if you are interested in 20th century history. Take this class to experience one of Yale's most renowned and respected professors. And if not for all of that, take this class because it's just one of those things that all Yale students should do.",
    "BEST HISTORY CLASS AT YALE! INCREDIBLE PROFESSOR! TAKE IT!!!!!",
    "Definitely take it. Gaddis is literally so cool and he's a great lecturer and his lecture in conjunction with the videos he shows are really interesting. It's a lot of memorization for the midterm\/final but totally worth taking it. Seriously, Gaddis is awesome.",
    "I thought it was a great Cold War course. I learned a lot and really enjoyed the lectures and sections. Take it!",
    "If Gaddis is teaching this, TAKE IT. It's one of those legendary classes, and it's worth it.",
    "Absolutely worthwhile. The Cold War shaped the modern world, yet if you're of college age now you probably don't know very much about it. This class is taught by a great lecturer who is probably the leading Cold War scholar in the world. There is a fair amount of reading every week, but it is doable. If you're taking the course for a grade, do as much of the reading as possible and the exams are a breeze (though note that many people take it C\/D\/Fail and don't do much if any of the reading). Other than reading and weekly section, all this course requires is a short paper, one midterm, and the final. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Take this course. If you're a history major then absolutely take. If you're not majoring in thisstuff, but want one really good history course to teach you everything you should know about what was going on in the 20th century then this is right for you. As the first generation born after the Cold War, we understand too little of what went on. Gaddis himself was a major figure in shaping US policy during the Cold War, so he has some incredible insights. It's a lot of reading and you really have to study for the midterm and the final, but it is absolutely worth it.",
    "Great class. Gaddis is THE scholar on the Cold War, and he was involved (on a very small scale) in some of the events. Some people don't like the videos during lecture, but they come from a good documentary, and I found them a good complement to his lecture. As a lecturer, he is good (not the best), but he still is fascinating to listen to. Midterm IDs were hard. Final's were easy. Reading is OK. Gaddis' book is great and basically summarizes his lectures. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "People say this is a classic course everyone must take at Yale - I disagree. While Professor Gaddis is indeed a world renowned Cold War historian, that itself is not a sufficient reason to take the course. Students be have interest in the Cold War and should be ready to commit to the immense amount of reading before they take the course. That being said, even though I briefly studied the Cold War before taking this course, Professor Gaddis always brings in new perspectives that never ceases to amaze me.",
    "I strongly recommend this course. Gaddis is THE expert in this field. His lectures were great but I personally did not gain a lot from the documentary clips, although a lot of students did. Be prepared for a ton of reading, but it is very interesting (except for Luthi). The TAs are a hit or miss, as they are for most courses, so try a couple before you commit to one. The exams test very obscure identifications, so be sure to pay attention to minor details. But overall, the course is one of my favorites I have taken at Yale because you learn about the big picture of the Cold War and the strategies that resulted in the defeat of Communism.",
    "Yes. a must take yale history course.",
    "Yes. The course covers a wealth of knowledge that isn't normally covered in a normal history class. It is also interesting to learn about the gravity of the Cold War and the impact on current history.",
    "A great history lecture. Definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes. It's not as hard as people say that it is. You just need to do the reading and pay attention in lecture.",
    "One can only add to the chorus: take the course whatever your major or interest. There are so many applications of the Cold War beyond history and polisci: technology, language studies, art, etc.",
    "Gaddis is as advertised. His lectures are fantastic and he seemlessly works in actual footage from the documentary he helped produce to tie everything together. The class is fairly hard and there is a LOT of reading, but not all of it is necessary to do well on the exams which are pretty fair. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale and a real can't miss, even if you are not usually interested in history.",
    "A must take class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to all students. It is a traditional Yale class that everyone should take before graduating.",
    "Take this class! Professor Gaddis is one of the most fantastic lecturers at Yale, and makes this class worth taking!",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "Great class. One of the must takes at Yale.",
    "Cold War is \"The Gaddis Show,\" but that's not a bad thing: it's a great show, and Professor Gaddis is awesome. I would definitely recommend it, but be aware that it's a large lecture and you will only get out of it what you put into it. It's a lot of reading that most people treat as optional, a midterm, an 8-10 page paper, and a final. The midterm and paper are really early in the semester, which can be nice, but remember that the final is cumulative.",
    "Good class, cool readings, a bit of work though. IDs on exams can be very obscure so study up. Had a lot of fun taking in credit\/D\/fail.",
    "Great class, totally worth it. My favorite of the semester.",
    "Don't take it; it doesn't live up to the hype. You'd be better off watching the documentary if you're really interested in the Cold War.",
    "Definitely. Examining the history of the cold war in such a comprehensive manner allowed me to understand world tensions today in a remarkable ay.",
    "THE BEST CLASS THAT YALE OFFERS. I could listen to Professor Gaddis speak for hours on end.",
    "It's a very good class, but it has its drawbacks. A lot of lecture time is spent watching videos, so you don't always get to hear a lot of Gaddis. The readings are good, but not thrilling. Still, it's a great overview if you're interested in the history.",
    "An amazing course, a must take before one graduates. Gaddis is an innovative lecturer; he interweaves his own commentary and documentaries brilliantly. Even with a fair amount of work, it was a joy to take. If you are an American history buff, take this course!",
    "If you want to learn the material, take it. Don't take it just for Gaddis... you will be disappointed. Beware--- between the showing of his movies and the time of the class right after lunch, you are bound to fall asleep at some point.",
    "Overview of the entire cold war, you will walk away having a lot of knowledge and having enjoyed it.",
    "Had heard a lot about this course and while it was definitely an excellent survey overview of the Cold War I found it somewhat underwhelming. Gaddis is a great lecturer but he can be quite biased. Also the reading is so dense that most don't even do it, whichbcan make section awkward and stilted. Ids on exams are obscure and random. Take it credit\/d or audit.",
    "Lectures are everything that people say it is: engaging and informative with a professor who is a cold war expert. The videos definitely do not take away from the lectures and the class is not just watching a documentary. In fact, the videos really add to the experience. Section really depends on your TA. My first TA was pretty useless and did not provide useful discussions while giving out reading responses. My second TA also gave out reading responses but was much more effective during discussions. If you can, get Sulmaan (the head TA) as your TA.",
    "I'd recommend it to anyone who wants an advanced History course, in or out of major.",
    "The material is quite interesting. It's the class I look forward to everyday. The lecture sometimes can be substandard, but mostly exceed my expectations.Also, take this class so you can have opportunities to have lunch with the professor. It's the grand strategy of getting into Grand Strategy.",
    "I fully recommend taking this course! The history of the Cold War is fascinating and Gaddis presents it superbly.",
    "Good course, but there is a lot of reading and so many story lines inherent to the Cold War that it at times was hard to handle and get the most out of the class. Gaddis and the class were good overall but by no means the can't miss gem that it was cracked up to be; there are better history courses out there.",
    "TAKE IT GEEZ",
    "Cold War history is a good class. Gaddis is a great lecturer, so much so that the numerous (interesting) video clips we watch can get obtrusive. The class is very expansive in scope and does a great job of bringing together all the disparate elements of the Cold War- even students who think they know a lot about the topic will find much to learn here. At the same time, be warned: while the lectures will give you a good understanding of the key principles, the readings are incredibly dense and long, and will bog you down if you don't manage them well. At the same time, the midterm and final are both reasonable. If you have time to keep up with the reading, take this class for a grade; if not, credit\/d\/fail might be a better choice.",
    "Yes.",
    "Absolutely. Go for it and stay with it through each lecture.",
    "From WWII through 1991, Gaddis lectures on the cold war and its events all over the world.",
    "Yes, obviously- classic Yale class. Gaddis is amazing, and I wish we had opportunities to get to know him (though he has monday lunches where you can get a group together and set it up- I just had class). I love the Cold War, but if you're not interested in it then lectures can get long and he uses a lot of videos. Also, the midterm and paper happen within a week of each other, but then there's nothing until the final other than section. Make sure to get a good TA!!",
    "Yes. Great Class",
    "Would definitely recommend it! Great summary of the Cold War and the links between regions are well explained.",
    "Absolutely recommend this class to everyone! Take it! It's a must at Yale.",
    "If Gaddis still teaches it, this is one course you must take at Yale. Half-videos and half-lecture - I think this is a good combo because it kept me awake and alert.",
    "DO IT. Absolutely. It's such a great course-the syllabus has 4 (5?) books on it but you really only need to read Gaddis's and go to every lecture b\/c that's when he literally reiterates his book. It's so much info but so easy to learn!",
    "One of the courses at Yale that if given the opportunity you should take.",
    "Cold War is one of those legendary classes, and I found that it lived up to the hype. However, it is undeniably alot of work and alot of material, so I wouldn't tell a student to take it if he\/she weren't generally into history. Gaddis is a great lecturer and had such amazing experiences and anecdotes, it makes the stories fun to learn. The paper is completely manageable, 8-10 pages, but both the midterm and final require alot of studying, just because there is so much going on over such a long timeframe. Cold War was one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Yale. Generally speaking, our generation is pretty clueless about this time period, so it was eyeopening. I'm also a history major, so take the enthusiasm with a grain of salt if you are, say, a chemistry major looking for your first history credit.",
    "Absolutely take this class. It will be a learning experience you remember for the rest of your life. Lecture in SSS is utterly epic, course material is fascinating and so very relevant, videos are effortlessly integrated into lecture, and the workload is quite manageable. Plus: John Gaddis is incredibly intelligent and has a sense of humor. To reiterate: Take this class!",
    "Yes--its a great overview of 20th century diplomacy, and, as a result, how we find ourselves where we are today within the world.",
    "Yes, definitely take it. It's one of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far because it's super interesting, and, it seems to me, no one knows more about the Cold War than Gaddis.",
    "100%, if you have the slightest interest of learning something about the most important period of history just before when we were born. Learned so much about that period of history. And it's great when you know you are tought by the best in that field. Come on, it's John Gaddis, what more is there to say?Graceful lectures and even more beautiful writings. Read his book on the Cold War! Best condensed review of that history ever.",
    "Take it! Some great points of view and facts that will shock you! Wonderful class.",
    "Awesome class",
    "If you want to understand why most of the world is the way it is today, you need to understand the Cold War. The policies and actions by countries during this time were all made under the unprecedented threat of nuclear war. Gaddis is an excellent lecturer and he KNOWS what he is talking about. There is a ton of reading which can be difficult but try to a section from at least one book in time for section and play catch up over break and reading week. If you want to be a history major take this class.",
    "Great course! Very engaging, interesting, relevant. Lecture interspersed with a video Gaddis consulted for - he knows what he's talking about!",
    "Very interesting class! I didn't know much about the Cold War but I had heard this class was one to take at Yale and it definitely is! Gaddis is an amazing lecturer. You watch lots of videos in class which are a good way to learn the material. Don't bother buying the books, except for Gaddis' book and maybe the Brands book on Latin America. The rest are all very dense and largely unnecessary for the class. All the info you need to write the paper and the exams is in Gaddis' book or his lectures. Wikipedia will be your best friend for this class to learn about the important figures and events for the exams.",
    "Awesome, classic class. Credit D or not, both work. Paper is easy, and so are the exams.",
    "Tremendous course. Easy if you do all the readings and attend lecture, survivable even if you don't. A must-take at Yale, especially if Gaddis is still the professor.",
    "Amazing. I've never seen such a perfect combination of lecturer, teacher, mentor, and expert. All of Yale's lecturers could learn a lot from John Gaddis. Each lecture is a fusion of documentary clips and Professor Gaddis's commentary. There is a lot of reading, and some of it is less than thrilling. (More than anything, the supplementary reading serves to highlight Gaddis's accessible style of writing\/lecturing.)",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to anyone who thinks its worthwhile to know about 50 years of human history that's an integral part of our daily lives today. Even for those who are not history or political science majors, this class will add a lot to the definitive liberal arts education.",
    "WONDERFUL! class, professor, readings, EVERYTHING. Going to lecture is like going to storytime. You can just listen and absorb information without even trying.",
    "I definitely would. Even if you are not a history major, this class is a must take.",
    "YEs",
    "Great class, take it.",
    "Take it! It's a fun class with a relatively light workload. It was a great survey course and filled in many holes in my knowledge of 20th century history. I feel like I understand current foreign affairs better after having taken this class. Gaddis is a phenomenal lecturer.",
    "YES, definitely!",
    "Definitely take this course!! It's a lot of memorization of IDs for the midterm and final, but it's worth it. You will learn everything there is about the Cold War from 1945-1990.",
    "Take this class if you get the chance. Gaddis is a boss and the material is oh so relevant to us today. Learning about the Cold War has made so many of today's global issues clearer to me. Honestly all of the events of this50 year time period are still impacting the international order today.",
    "Definitely take it! Easily one of the best history courses I have taken at Yale. Gaddis is so wonderful. Definitely take him up on his offer to get lunch.",
    "Really great class. Lots of videos and really relevant course materials to modern life. Take it before you graduate!",
    "For sure take this class.",
    "A really great class, definitely a must-take for all majors.",
    "Cold War is a comprehensive course on the subject matter, one will definitely finish the class with a better understanding of the period. The readings can be heavy during certain weeks, but light enough to catch up on others. The class relies too much on video clips, but, when he does speak, Professor Gaddis is very engaging and insightful.",
    "Worth taking because of Gaddis. He's just one of those professors you take a class for. The class itself is good, but he makes it great.",
    "It is crucial that you take this class. It makes you aware about how foreign policy works and the triumph of humanity. The Cold War era is politically and sociologically important. Students were actually sad on the last day of class.",
    "Professor Gaddis' lectures are fantastic. There's quite a bit of reading, but the lectures are even better the more of it you do.",
    "Professor Gaddis is of course, a legend, but his lectures are not as mind blowing as one might expect. His analysis of Cold War events are straightforward, and his adds to his delivery a wry humor that is easy to appreciate. If Professor Gaddis teaches this course again, you would be well served to take it, but keep in mind that this course requires self-motivation above all to do all of the reading and to actually dig deep into the history, as one could easily get by without working too hard. In terms of the material, the Zubok book is undoubtedly the best. The Luthi book on Sino-Soviet relations is also commendable, while Gaddis' own book is too introductory and too superficial to be of too much use. The Suri book and the Brands book we used this semester were pretty terrible, but here's to hope that they won't appear on the syllabus again.",
    "It's interesting, but don't take it just because it's John Gaddis. He's good, but you have to like the subject.",
    "A valuable lecture. Take it if you want a broad overview of the cold war.",
    "A great class. I'm a science major, but I took this class because I feel like there was a huge gap in my knowledge of the second half of the 20th century. There is way too much reading assigned, but I did about a third of it and I was fine... Some people kept up but I don't know how.",
    "Great overview of the Cold War, extremely interesting class.",
    "This class is legendary for a reason- it has been honed by decades of practice on John Gaddis' part and it shows- I've never learned so much in a semester. One important note- this class is only as good as it is because of the combination of good engaging lectures, well-planned sections, great comprehensive readings, and videos that give a visual side to the class. Just listening to lectures is not enough to do well on the exams! You really do need to do the readings. Of you stay up to date, this class will be exciting and a great learning experience about a hugely important time in world history- if not, it could be stressful."
