   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend the course. A lot of readings but if the topic is interesting it is definitely worth the time. The class is mostly dominated by a student presentation but the insights by Zedillo are highly valuable. Really great course, demanding but doable.",
    "This is one of the best classes available to Econ majors (and others) at Yale. It is not mathematically rigorous, but the reading list is excellent, and the writing students must do to complete the course is fairly intense. Professor Zedillo takes a major interest in his students' development. I not only learned far more about Latin America and development economics by taking this class, but I also became a better student of economics, in general.",
    "fascinating subject matter, I learned a lot more than I though I would, but I enjoyed what I learned. Its structured in a presentation style where students present on the readings and then the class discusses. However every time Zedillo speaks its far more fascinating, so I ended up hoping the presentations were short just so I could hear what he had to say Zedillo is a boss, its enjoyable to listen to his wealth of experience. Surprise heads of state may come to visit just because they're friends with Zedillo and can contribute to the conversation. If you're willing to put in some work it'll be very rewarding.",
    "This is an extremely rewarding course. It is a fair amount of work, but you will learn a great deal and it is truly a privilege to take a class with Professor Zedillo who is an authority in this field.",
    "Take this class. Latin America is one of the most puzzling continents in terms of economic development, and this class will provide you with a blend between history and economics that will help you understand difficult concepts and come up with clear answers to puzzling questions. This class is indeed a lot of work, and if you want to remain engaged you need to do the readings and put time into your reading responses. But to be quite frank, the readings are very interesting, and there will be aspects of them that you will want to question: reading responses will allow you to structure your thoughts in a cohesive manner. Midterm is super straightforward, and the final paper gives you an opportunity to investigate an aspect of Latin America in depth. You will be required to do class presentations on the readings, but these don't take a lot of time, and in fact help you structure your thoughts better. Overall, an amazing class. Take it if you're truly interested in Latin America and willing to put in the work."
