   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend the class to anyone. You will love it, and it will actually change how you think about the world. The one thing I will say, however, is that the discussions were sometimes very theory-heavy and intense, and if you are not familiar with much social theory (as I was not - at all), class could be somewhat intimidating at first. I often did not speak up if I didn't feel I had something revelatory to say. That being said, I would take it over and over again, because it was truly excellent, and I LOVED doing all the readings. The workload is definitely manageable, and Graeme Reid is so wonderful.",
    "If you want to study masculinity around the world, take this course. It's a unique WGSS course with a very relativistic flavor a la anthropology. Weekly reading responses aren't fun, but the reading is light (~30 pages per week). One final 10-12 pager and no exams.",
    "If you're an Anthro or WGSS major (or someone interested in these approaches but for some odd reason still blindly majoring in something like History) you should take this course. It has a fair amount of reading and you have to write 8 well-crafted responses in addition to the final paper, but you're not going to get a chance to focus on masculinity academically anywhere else at Yale. And Professor Reid is awesome.",
    "This is a great course that everyone should try to take. The readings are really interesting and lead to great discussions on masculinity, both in history and in the modern day.",
    "I wish this course had been less bogged down by theory. The topic has so much potential for fascinating and controversial discussions, but we didn't really have any. The readings were good, but they didn't cover some pretty central issues (like fatherhood) re: masculinity and manhood. I really wanted to love this course, but the only parts I found truly enjoyable were the presentations by classmates at the start of each class on current issues or topics they were studying individually.",
    "WGSS 304 is a very fun class. We learned about masculinity as it is viewed and constructed in societies around the world. I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in studying other societies (and our own) through this lens. It was a pleasure to be in class with Professor Reid."
