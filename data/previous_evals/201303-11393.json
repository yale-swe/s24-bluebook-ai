   "comments": [
    "It's a rather dry class but not much work needs to be put in other than the weekly problem sets and the final paper. If you're looking for an interesting elective though, I suggest not to take it but if you're looking for something light and fairly easy then yeah I would recommend this class.",
    "Easy BME elective. Not that great of a class\/kind of boring but worth it cause it's not a huge time commitment.",
    "BENG 410 is a pretty good class overall. The material is interesting, especially for imaging students (the connection to the molecular track was tenuous, at best, but it's good background nonetheless). The class consists of lectures, weekly problem sets, a take-home midterm, a take-home final, and a final paper. Overall, it's not too hard, with good lecturers and a great TA (Emil). Definitely recommended for BME students looking to finish one of their electives.",
    "Great overview of imaging. Very chill class.",
    "You probably aren't taking this class unless you need a BME elective. In which case it's a fine elective. It's a pretty broad overview of a lot of different imaging techniques, and not that much specific knowledge.",
    "Overall, if you just keep up with the material and ask questions you will be just fine. But, if you do fall behind, it's difficult to catch up since you build on the material you learn just like any class.",
    "An overview of common imaging\/sensing techniques. Several of the units overlap with other courses you may have take such as biochemistry or other imaging courses. Lecturers are hit\/miss since it is taught on a rotating schedule. Overall it tries to cover a lot of different techniques in a limited amount of time.",
    "Good class. I'd recommend it as an elective for BME (I think it counts for all the tracks). In terms of workload, it's a pretty chill course: weekly psets that probably took an average of 1.5 hours or so, take home midterm, take home final, and final paper. They give you a detailed template regarding the structure\/content of the paper, which helps a lot. Regarding the lectures, they can get dry at times, and they tend to repeat a lot of concepts (NMR, MRI, MRS), which sometimes gets a bit exhausting. There are multiple professors for different portions of the course. The professors clearly show excellent mastery of what they're teaching, but the lectures themselves are not that exciting. Basically, if you want a chill BME elective, or you are very interested in the material, this class is perfect. Take it with at least one friend though, just in case you find it really boring (might make things tough)."
