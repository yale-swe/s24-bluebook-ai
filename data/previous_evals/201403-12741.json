    "If you're not very interested or using it for your major, why bother. But it is a relatively straightforward class. You do the work, you'll do well.",
    "Multivariable calculus...as an incoming freshman, this course was definitely the most challenging course I had ever taken, but it was definitely rewarding. This course wasn't necessary for my major, so there were many times during the semester when I would constantly question why I was taking the course (because of its difficulty); however, I am glad to have taken this course because now I understand how to study, how to handle challenging classes, and how to use the resources that Yale provides us. After the first test, I was able to realize what this class required of me and achieve the grades that I wanted (so no, it is not an automatic GPA bomb.) Also, if you've taken AP Calc BC and are debating between taking this class or MATH 115, I know of people who dropped down to MATH 115 and seemed to have a harder time (just to let you know). My advice for anyone who does want to take this class, take advantage of the peer tutors and the coaching sessions even if you initially don't feel you need them; they are great for providing any guidance and practice problems that you may need.",
    "Math 120 is a rigorous course that requires a lot of time and effort. However, Miki was a wonderful instructor who made the material interesting and the concepts easy to understand. This course definitely goes beyond high school multivariable, although having taken it does help a lot. The problem sets that are due every week are quite lengthy, but they are doable. I always found myself at tutoring hours which helped a lot and made me more confident in taking the exams.",
    "Challenging but interesting class!",
    "Math120 is a hard but rewarding course. Though the curve is harsh since many students have already taken multivariable calculus before, the class itself is not impossible if you put the time into it and seek extra help if you need it.",
    "MATH 120 takes concepts learned in single variable calculus and expands them to equations of two or three variables and showing how they are applicable to the real world. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, particularly if they are interested or enjoy math. The course is well structured and the workload is very manageable.",
    "multivariable calculus -- only if you need as a prereq or love math",
    "Challenging but doable.",
    "I would say it is a solid course for someone who has a strong background in single variable calculus and wants to go further.",
    "Good. Solid amount of work but manageable. Try to get Miki Havlickova as your professor.",
    "Math 120 is a rigorous math course that has a simple foundation but difficult problems after. I would definitely recommend the class to students who would like to take an interesting but challenging math course and who are willing to put the time and effort in.",
    "I recommend it if you are serious about furthering your math education.",
    "Take it if you need Multivar for anything. Out of all the sections, make sure you take it with Miki!",
    "You'll learn a great deal of calculus in Math 120. Though the course is difficult, there are a lot of resources to help you succeed (the peer tutoring sessions are great).",
    "Math 120 is a great class with Havlickova. The material is difficult and the problem sets can take some time to do well, but if you enjoy math, you will enjoy Math 120 with this professor. She is extremely helpful and also manages to explain the material clearly, and in an interesting way. She have lots of office hours and is always willing to help you understand the material better.",
    "I would recommend this course to those who will need multivariable calculus in the future.",
    "I would recommend the class, although a good TA\/teacher is vital. There are many resources available to learn the material (which is difficult). The p-sets are generally more complicated than the tests are usually easier. The workload is large, if done properly so do not procrastinate on the p-sets"
