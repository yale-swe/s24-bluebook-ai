    "If you love musical theater, don't hesitate and seize the opportunity to learn from Joel",
    "If you're a musical theater performer, director, music director, choreographer, anything, you must take this class. Take advantage of the fantastic connections Yale offers you to the business and get to know the professor. It's worth the Friday class commitment!",
    "This is definitely a performance class. Prepare very well each week, and be prepared to get put on the spot.",
    "Yes! It was so much fun, one can learn from the teacher, from the other students, and from their own experience, and watching the growth over the semester really is incredible!",
    "Joel Fram is fantastic, inspiring, and brilliant. This class was absolutlely instrumental in my development as a performer. Bring him back and take it with him if you can.",
    "You'll learn about theatre and how to perform and direct, as well as how to understand performance better.",
    "To any performers or directors out there, you should definitely take this class. It is a great way to get you to think about how you perform and analyze how others do as well. Treat it as a way of gathering tools for your actor or directors toolkit and not so much as a class that teaches you to audition. It is so much more than that."
