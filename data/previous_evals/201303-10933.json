    "Amazing course. Professor Dobbins is an incredible lecturer. I'm a huge fan of courses that just stick to straightforward teaching styles, and each day we just took notes from the blackboard, which I felt was the perfect way to learn this kind of math. It was challenging material but Dobbins is a skilled instructor who presented it in an accessible way. Problem set sessions were extremely effective at reinforcing the material and providing help with difficult assignments. Exams were EXTREMELY fair (this is before taking the final but if it is anything like the two midterms, it will too be a very fair and well written exam). I would recommend this course not only to engineering majors but people who like math, have taken multivariable, and would like to challenge themselves with differential equations but in a way that is more application rather than theory-based.",
    "Hard. Duh. Not horrible though...Dobbins is okay. The PSETs take as long as you'd expect. I found the exams challenging but some crazy kids got 100s on them...so....",
    "If you're reading this, you probably have to take if for your major. It's really hard and there's a ton of material. The first midterm was okay, but after that it just got steadily more and more difficult. Be prepared to spend up to 15 hours on each problem set. Professor Dobbins is really nice, so don't hesitate to go to him with questions, and the TAs were also great.Some of my friends took the math department differential equations sequence this year instead (ODEs in the fall, PDEs in the spring), and from what they said, their fall term course seemed much less painful. If you have an extra semester to spare on diff eq (or if you like math more than physics applications), you might want to consider that option instead.",
    "You'll learn the techniques, but you won't learn why they work and you certainly won't like it. Dobbins isn't the clearest lecturer, but he cares a lot about his students and is always trying to improve. Problem sets are hard in a tedious, soul-crushing way rather than a rewarding one. Expect 8+ hours per problem set. Your life will be much better if you go to TF help sessions (Joseph is the MAN) and find a study group. The two midterms were very fair, and the final was extremely hard.Basically, don't be frightened away by the bad reviews: it's going to be a lot of work, and I wouldn't say it was pleasant, but you learn lots of really fascinating\/useful material.",
    "ENAS194 is an excellent overview of differential equations. Take it with Dobbins if you can- although he's gotten poor reviews in the past, his efforts to improve his teaching are apparent, and in my opinion he's actually an excellent teacher. The weekly problem sets took me about four hours, and while the exams were challenging (mostly due to length), they were balanced enough that they were not a source of concern. 194 was the best class I took this semester, and I highly recommend it to anyone interesting in learning some (still-applicable!) higher level math.",
    "I really liked this course. It is pretty challenging, but it is also very neat because it shows you how to solve equations that appear everywhere in science and engineering.",
    "I would recommend this class--you learn a ton but the workload is manageable if you stay on top of things. Dobbins is great - a good lecturer who cares a lot about his students and was willing to provide basically infinite extra help to anyone who needed it. The psets take a long time and will make your Wednesday night stressful, but it's worth the effort in the end. It will definitely be one of your most work-intensive classes but it's also probably one of the most useful if you're going into any field of science or engineering.",
    "Don't take if required. If required, take it. It is less proof based and more sample based than 120.",
    "I remember reading the evaluations for this course before taking it, and one of the evaluations said \"There is a ton of work, but it really helps you understand the material.\" There is a ton of work, but I thought itwas excessive to the point where people would spend their time copying formulas out of the book just to get the problem set done, rather than taking the time to learn the set up of the problem and fully understand what was going on. I thought the professor assumed we knew material that we didn't (or a couple times held \"outside of class\" lectures to learn material not covered in the syllabus such as a brief introduction to linear algebra) which made the course difficult to understand. He spent a lot of time focusing on the actual math and working through problems, rather than discussing their set up and theory behind the equations. The professor and the TA's, however, go out of their way to get the students through the grind, and they can be an incredibly helpful resource for problem sets and test reviews. It was apparent that the professor was willing to put in a lot of time and effort to be accessible to the students, and that was greatly appreciated.",
    "Although you will probably hate it, you need to take this class because it is very useful in the sciences.",
    "A LOT of work. This class requires you to be dedicated to learning the material. I wouldn't recommend this class to someone who doesn't have to take it for their major; it's neither a \"fun\" or a \"gut\" class... That being said, if you have to ake it, it's really not that bad and does tie into other classes (physics in particular).",
    "Diff Eq is actually a fun subject. It's very method-based, not all that challenging conceptually, mostly it comes down to figuring out how to solve each equation using what technique when, and the class itself doesn't place much emphasis on what those solutions mean (though the tests will ask you so you should understand as well as you can anyway). All in all, everything in this class was just LONG. Problem sets will take 10-12 hours each, at least after the first one or two, and most of this time is just tedious calculation rather than conceptual struggling. But the problem sets are also fun to read because they set up relevant world scenarios and teach you about extensions of the material that are sometimes very intriguing. Exams are also far too long to finish, but they follow the homework difficulty quite closely. Professor Dobbins speaks very quickly in class and says a lot that you'll never absorb or remember, but he cares about getting his students to succeed and he gets the main points clearly across. This class is a lot of work, but it's very satisfying to get to the end, and the math itself is elegant and fulfilling.",
    "I would say Differential Equations is the next step up in computational math without proofs after multivariable calculus and linear algebra. It is very interesting if you are interested in mathematical modeling or if you like doing math problems. The PSETs are long and difficult but if you have Professor Dobbins and Joseph as a TA they will help you with the homework in their sessions. I've heard with different professors this class can be very difficult.",
    "Differential Equations was a really interesting but work-intensive course. The material started off easy but got extremely difficult towards the end of the course, especially since Professor Dobbins tended to only go over the basics and simple examples from the textbook rather than examples similar to problem set questions. That said, he was extremely open and eager to help (don't listen to other reviews from Professor Ahn's class -- I'd heard a lot of bad things about Professor Dobbins from them but he really made the class a lot less miserable than it could have been), and the exams weren't as hard as the problem sets as long as you studied enough. Just make sure you leave your two problem set skips for the last two, since they were pretty much impossible without going to the problem sessions, and study for the exams, and you'll do fine.",
    "This class is extremely tough. I cannot see a reason why you would take it unless you have to just because it is that difficult. If you do, make the most out of it. You can get a strong foothold if you do the necessary readings in the book and go to professor office hours and T.A. hours for concept and homework help. The hours will be super beneficial here. Have lots of patience and make sure to never move on without understanding a concept. Since problem sets are hard, you may have to do easier practice problems first.",
    "You should know what you're getting into. This course is required for your major; you know what it is.",
    "Lots of work! Overall I liked it much more than multivariable though. Basically it is a class that gives you a bunch of different tools for solving differential equations (duh). But when you get lost in the different methods, its good to keep this idea in mind.Also, check out Kahn academy! Its is a great resource for a solid fundamental understanding of a lot of the material covered.Dobbins is actually a great guy. Go to office hours! I wish I had earlier in the semester!!"
