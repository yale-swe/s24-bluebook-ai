   "comments": [
    "I would definitely suggest this course to others - I liked that I not only learned about European traditions but was also able to explore new (to me) territory and benefit from the professor's expertise in Islamic Art. It was a welcoming but still critical environment within which to explore familiar themes in new ways.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The course introduces an important set of theoretical and practical questions, and I believe I've become a better writer having done and discussed the readings for this course.",
    "The class had more of a focus on Iranian art than I had expected, and I would advise future students to be aware of this. I think that the class would be ideal for students with a greater background in Middle Eastern Art, but I found it difficult for someone approaching the subject for the first time."

   "comments": [
    "This course covered a broad range of material but still managed to get past the surface. It prepared me by teaching me new information but also by helping me realize how much I've already learned. I like that balance, which mixed building on an established base of knowledge and approaching subjects I had never had an opportunity to learn about before.",
    "This course offered me a wonderful opportunity to understand better my discipline and where it fits within the broader world of art history.",
    "Helpful in finding out about forward-thinking methodologies and approaches to the Renaissance."
