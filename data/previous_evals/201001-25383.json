    "Good. Great balance of work load and interesting material. Class and section were always fun to be in.",
    "yes take it! very interesting, not too much work. you do kind have to do the reading, but it is a manageable amount and very interesting.",
    "This is a true gem of a class, especially to take as a freshman, because if you're in any way at all interested in gender relations within society, you'll likely find this fascinating and it will make you question some of your own actions or beliefs. It's a very organized course-\u0096 starting with some basic theories and then spanning the life-course\u0096-and the readings (maybe like 40 pages a class) are generally quite good. It is a low-key, low pressure class, and Professor Alemeling genuinely cares about her students. She is a quirky, fun lecturer, and is very passionate about the course material, but manages to present all the information in very unbiased, easy to understand lectures. Definitely take this class.",
    "Yes, its a class you may not think you would like, but it's amazing how much sex and gender is part of everyday life",
    "It's a course on things that are obviously gendered and things you might've never even thought of as gendered. This course opened my eyes quite a bit. The material is interesting and the instructor is pretty awesome. I would recommend this course.",
    "Great intro to socy and wgss, will make you think differently about the world.",
    "Really good, definitely take it if you have any interest in sociology or women's studies!",
    "If you are interested in sociology in any way, take it.",
    "WGSS 110 is a really great introductory course. If you've taken a lot of sociology type classes, it might be too basic for you, but if you're just starting out this year, it's really helpful to have. The class does a great job of introducing you to terminology and the ways of studying sociology while introducing you to the themes of WGSS and not giving you an overwhelming amount of work.",
    "Amazing course! Definitely take this. Its a lot of reading, but it's all really interesting, and the amount of work you put into it will be more than matched on how much you get out of the class. Sex and Gender in Society really made me look at the world from a new perspective. Its a great introdution to sociology and Rene Almeling is a really passionate professor and a great lecturer!",
    "Great intro sociology class and good WGSS class. Once you take this, you will not stop seeing these lessons in your life, everywhere you go. A good deal of reading, but you have to learn how to manage it. I def recommend it.",
    "Arguably one of the best classes I've ever taken. It's well put together, the reading directly ties into the lectures and the section elaborates the points we don't cover, the grading is completely fair and sensible (mid-term, post mid-term quiz and a final paper) and all of the topics are extremely interesting. Professor Ameling is VERY knowledgeable in gender studies and has her own very interesting research endeavors and personal experiences. Despite her personal opinions (which aren't at all evident during lecture unless you ask), she does an amazing job of helping students get the both sides of every issue--including unfairness towards the male gender when we examine inequalities. She also does a great job of tying the lectures into the four course themes, and the course is overall VERY cohesive, despite how vague the topics are and the breadth of the course."
