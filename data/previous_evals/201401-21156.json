    "Get ready for some radical stuff! This class is bomb - Professor Klein is THE person to work with if you're interested in labor or socialism or really most things that are interesting. I feel extremely lucky to have taken this class, and you should too before you graduate and it's too late",
    "Yes! Definitely take it. One of the most radical but interesting classes at Yale. It makes you re-evaluate your role as a consumer and participation in the labor movement."
