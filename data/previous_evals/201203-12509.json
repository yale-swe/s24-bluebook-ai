    "This class entails a lot of reading, discussion and writing (all in German!) However, the professors are fantastic and the topic interested. If you speak German or are interested in German literature, I strongly recommend this class!",
    "Great opportunity to further improve your German and build a solid basis for studying German Theater.The class is a true exploration of what theater can achieve and will make you consider the massive potential of this media.Class discussion is very intelligent.Very good selection of reading.Work is regular but not excessive at all.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course. I think a pretty advanced proficiency in German would be necessary, since the texts can often be challenging and class discussion moves pretty quickly (although both Professor Campe and Martin were very patient with my less-than-fluent German!). This was a wonderful introduction to not only some of the most canonical plays in German literature but also more contemporary, often challenging works. So much fun!",
    "Take this class.",
    "I loved the class. I would absolutely recommend it. Be prepared to do a lot of work though."
