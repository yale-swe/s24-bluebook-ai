    "No. You will be better off by just buying the textbooks and learning the material yourself.",
    "Core class in microeconomic theory to prepare for comprehensive exams.",
    "i think it is compulsory, so all quantitative marketing students must take it.",
    "You should take it because it's compulsory. But you may want to take it even if it weren't.",
    "The course provides necessary mathematical and microeconomic tools for doctoral students in economics and related disciplines. As such, it is necessary for those students. I would not recommend the course to anyone outside those doctoral students, except for undergraduates interested in pursuing a doctoral degree. For those doctoral students, fortunately or otherwise, there is no choice but to take the class.",
    "If you want an introduction to microeconomics and some context about the uses and history of the field this class will not be very helpful. If you don't have a theoretical math background the first quarter will be very difficult. Your self esteem will probably suffer from taking this class."

    "Thorough treatment of microeconomic theory, the course teaches importantmethods of economic theory, that is how to develop formal arguments and proofs.",
    "as a general course in micro economics it was good, but as i mentioned earlier we could have a more tailored course instead of this course which is designed for econ dept. students.",
