    "Yes--I would absolutely recommend the course to another student in the department, and I have done so. It functions more like a reading group in which students prepare for the class and then take turn reading sections. As I suggested before, it is more like a reading group than a high-pressure course.",
    "An ideal class for solidifying one's knowledge of Old English, and very helpful in moving from an elementary to a proficient level in reading the language. But also, a marvelous literature class in its own right, allowing for the exploration of religion, paleography, history, and more. The highest recommendation indeed.",
    "You read the entirety of Beowulf in the original Old English; it's a challenging workload, but quite rewarding.",
    "If you're interested in Beowulf, then you should absolutely take it. It's a wonderful course, and you will learn a lot. If you're not interested, then it isn't worth it."
