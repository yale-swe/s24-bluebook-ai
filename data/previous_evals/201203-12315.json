    "I actually liked this class, but it had everything to do with the book and the material and nothing to do with Professor Edwards. Lectures were poorly organized and basically just a regurgitation of the reading done the night before.Homework usually had literally nothing to do with what we were learning in class. Louise wanted to teach this like an advanced physics class, but of course that isn't what it was intended to be. Our problem sets were mainly made up of questions that gave us a random physics equation (I do mean totally random. Absolutely nothing to do with what we were learning in class.) and asked us to prove it.You could do the proof either by finding it online or by making something up. Literally, I would start with some random physics equation, like F=ma, manipulate it in meaningless ways, integrate it, substitute some other expression for one of variables, and then write \"When you simplify it, you get [insert whatever wewere trying to prove.]\" Professor Edwards didn't know the correct proofs either, so I would get credit for this all the time.So, basically, astronomy is really cool and so was the idea behind the class, but the teaching was pretty inept.",
    "Mostly mathy, cursory introduction to concepts. For math, take this one. For concepts on the same topics, take 120.",
    "Astronomy 220 is an intensive, math-based introduction to astronomy. Professor Edwards described it as \"intro astronomy for science majors\" (for the record, I'm not one). If you take the course, you should not only have a good math and physics background (for me, that was AP Calc BC and AP Physics B in high school), but be comfortable applying the math and physics you know.I found this class very frustrating. The teaching seemed disorganized, and the lectures were often confusing. I had to rely on the textbook to clarify what Professor Edwards said in class. It's possible to do well in this course, but doing so requires a good deal of outside reading and initiative. Professor Edwards is a nice, interesting person who's willing to answer questions and meet with students who need help, but she's not among the best teachers I've had.All of that being said, I'm glad I took this course. I loved the experience of using the telescope at Leitner Observatory, and I feel well-versed in the basics of astronomy, with a foundation of knowledge that will be helpful if I'm ever interested in learning more.",
    "This is a good science class if you have some knowledge of calculus. Work is manageable, material is interesting!",
    "I thought that this class was really interesting and I feel like a learned a lot of cool things about the universe. I would take this class if you have an interest in astronomy!",
    "Take the class although it wont be super interesting. The workload isn't much though.",
    "It's a pretty easy class all in all. There's homework once a week, usually 3-4 quantitative questions, but the formulas are given in class and it's never a lot of work. The exams were pretty straightforward too. Prof. Edwards is a little shaky as a lecturer; the lectures aren't too gripping and she posts the powerpoints online, but it was here first semester teaching, so I feel that she'll improve. If you're looking to fill a requirement, this might be a good class to take. It's not far beyond the basic level of astronomy and you need little background knowledge to understand what's going on.",
    "This is an interesting and pretty cool course. I'd take it if you want a somewhat challenging astronomy class--it's not a gut like some of the other classes, certainly, but it's still quite accessible for non-majors.",
    "I would recommend ASTR 220. It's a good introduction to astronomy, and galaxies and cosmology are awesome! Professor Edwards is a great professor who thinks a lot about how to teach, and I enjoyed going to lecture.",
    "I have mixed feelings about this class. The material was fascinating, and Professor Edwards is a sweetheart and very available for office hours. However, it kind of lost steam after the midterm, and I often felt unsure of what I was actually supposed to be studying for. The difficulty level is also at a weird place- easy for those with science background, and confusing for those without."
