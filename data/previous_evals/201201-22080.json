    "Yes! Take it. No better setting at Yale in which to learn a language.",

    "A very good progression from Hindi 110. The professors do a good job of choosing the topics discussed each day to meet each classes needs.I would recommend it.",
    "Fun class with not much work. I'm not sure how much my Hindi improved from L1, but it was still worth it.",
    "YES. Hindi is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. It won't stress you out, but you will learn tons.",
    "I always enjoyed going to Hindi. It isn't necessarily an easy class, but it is quite laid back."
