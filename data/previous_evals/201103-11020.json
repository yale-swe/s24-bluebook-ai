    "highly recommend for those interested in the question of French Revolution and Enlightenment",
    "HIS 616 deals with the most recent trends in Enlightenment Studies including religion, political economy, print culture, and political culture among others. It is largely Franco-centric, but that should in no way deter students lacking a background in eighteenth-century French history. One will come away from this course with a broad understanding of the major themes and debates in the expanding field of Enlightenment studies sufficient enough to provide a foundation for a minor orals field.I would strongly recommend this course to another student for all the reasons outlined in my above answers.",
    "I would absolutely recommend HIST 616 for the opportunity it offers to engage with different approaches to the social history of ideas, and to do so under the tutelage of one of that field's youngest and strongest practitioners.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student. It provided a general survey of the recent historiography on a diversity of Enlightenment subjects and encouraged a deeper consideration of the historical understanding of the Enlightenment as a whole. The weekly subjects and readings were well-chosen and enabled interesting debate on different methodologies in Enlightenment history, which could be followed up in the final historiographical paper."

   "comments": [
    "Most useful to me were the weeks which dealt with topics that touch on my own sub-fields and research in early American history. My current research deals with the Enlightenment in colonial America and print culture and this course exposed me to relevant works and themes in the French historiography. This exposure has broadened my approach to my own research which has, in turn, allowed me to envision new directions for my research both in the short and long-term.",
    "The course greatly deepened my knowledge of the Enlightenment by introducing me to social and cultural approaches to its intellectual history. I explored and evaluated these methods with relation to the historiography of Enlightenment history in my final paper, and so the course contributed to future research plans by allowing me to review the recent scholarship on my preferred area of research."
