   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned absolutely nothing from this class. It is border line wrong for Yale to take money from its students for this course. You are told you will learn something and then you learn absolutely nothing. You waste 3.5 hours of your life every week being lectured about the most mundane, useless subject in existence. The worst part is there is no engaging discussion between the students and the professor. So, while Professor Frank talks at you for a solid 1 hour 15 minutes you retain absolutely nothing. I would rather take any other class at Yale than this course. When being interviewed for a job, I listed this class as one of my biggest mistakes and easily the worst class I have ever taken. Please take it off the course list so other people do not have to suffer through this.",
    "My vocabulary didn't increase as much as I thought it would, given my experience with Chaucer, but that's due more to the difficulty of the words than the course itself. While my overall comprehension isn't great, I do feel confident enough to tackle any Old English text in the original now.",
    "I entered this course knowing very little about what the term \"Old English\" meant. Previous conceptions of this term included Shakespearean works. After a wonderful semester of learning how to read Old English (which looked like a completely different language), I have come to have a great appreciation of the Old English history and literature and how it has come to shape modern English literature and culture.",
    "I learned a lot about Old English grammar and vocabulary, as well as Anglo Saxon history.",
    "We learned to quickly absorb detailed information on grammar and vocabulary, reinforcing it with interesting linguistic and historical background.",
    "I learned a new way of understanding language that I hadn't been exposed to prior to taking this class. I gained an appreciation for the evolution of language, and the way the words we speak are influenced by societies and cultures of the past.",
    "I think the course pushed me to think a lot more about the nature of language and translation. I've only studied English and Spanish before this which are pretty similar. Old English conjugates its words and structures its sentences differently than both of these languages, and it got me thinking about how much language structures our thoughts without us even realizing it."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course literally did not have a single strength. If I tried to list all of its weaknesses I would run out of characters. This course is beyond the point of no return. You simply cannot improve it, it is that big of a catastrophe. It should be removed from the course list. This class is probably Yale's biggest weakness.",
    "I hesitate to suggest making a course harder, but I did think that if we had not had the ability to translate easily using Old English Aerobics, we might have learned more vocabulary.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is learning the language of Old English and reading first-hand Old English written by period poets and authors such as Bede. By reading the literature in its original glory you begin to appreciate the ways that Old English has influenced modern English literature and culture. There were no major weaknesses of this course that I felt needed to be fixed - perhaps one thing I would be interested in pursuing more, if time permitting, would be to read parts of Beowulf in Old English so that we could compare and evaluate Seamus Heaney's translation of it to the original text.",
    "We did a lot of translation, which is necessary, but can get tedious. However, the class projects were awesome.",
    "The professor is its greatest strength. Roberta is one of the best teachers I've ever had. She brings a genuine love of her subject and of teaching, and no lesson was ever boring. Her care for her students was obvious. I can think of few weaknesses, but that I'd love to see a follow-up seminar in the spring that goes into more detail. I know there's a Beowulf seminar, but I'd rather have a broader exploration of the literature, like this class itself.",
    "We spend a lot of the class time doing line by line translations, and though translation is necessarily an important of the course, the format became rather dull by the middle of the semester. I wish we could have spent more time discussing the texts and language more holistically.",
    "It would be helpful to continue to review the grammar and make learning the language more structured as we went into translation. Overall, the class could benefit from structure for people who don't take a ton of language classes."

    "DO. NOT. TAKE. THIS. CLASS. I do not think I can be anymore clear. You would enjoy your semester more if you just had the professor waterboard you every day than you would if you took this class. If you enjoy learning: do not take this class. If you think your education is useful: do not take this class. If you pay $64,000 per year to go to school: do not take this class because it will make you angrier than you already are that you have to pay so much money to go to school. I think I am dumber now than I was when I enrolled in this course, because every second I had to sit through this course, the mind-numbing material and lecturing style of the professor killed off 7 brain cells.",
    "Absolutely. Old English texts are wonderful and entertaining, and I truly enjoyed reading all of them. Besides that, so many modern writersTolkien,Borges, and Heaney, off the top of my headwere influenced by Old English, so it gives you a good overview of the corpus.",
    "Old English is a wonderful introductory course to learning how to read and speak in Old English. It is truly a course like no other offered at Yale. You learn to read original Old English texts from a period that is rich in culture and literature. It is impossible to appreciate the foundations and the impact of Old English on modern English without being able to read Old English literature in its original glory. I highly recommend it - Professor Frank always has great insight in everything we touched upon.",
    "Definitely! If you know an inflected language already, this course will be a breeze, and if you don't, it will not take much time before you catch up. The readings are light, especially in comparison to other English courses. Professor Frank is incredibly kind and compassionate, and a fount of knowledge; go to her office hours and get to know her!",
    "Absolutely! Roberta is an amazing professor and she really cares about all of her students. Take this class while you can!",
    "Absolutely. Roberta is wonderful, the readings are fascinating, and the workload isn't too tough.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who might doubt the interesting aspects of this class. I was, admittedly, hesitant while shopping this course at the beginning of the semester, but Professor Frank (along with the class's content) really made Old English worth learning about. Its definitely a class that only gets more fascinating as the semester progresses.",
    "I recommend the course to students specifically interested in learning more about Old English. You do end up learning a fair amount about the language and the worldview of the Anglo-Saxons by the time the course wraps up. However, the structure of the course can grow a bit tedious after doing translations week after week, and if you're not too interested in Old English, this course may become quite dull after a few weeks.",
    "It really helps to be good with languages. If you are someone that considers your self to be bad with languages this might not be the class for you."
