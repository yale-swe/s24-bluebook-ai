   "comments": [
    "French 140 is, in essence, a French literature course-you read a lot. It also helps you work on your French writing and just general comprehension with both reading and watching movies. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "French 140 is like any other French class. There is a lot of reading, a few small compositions, and presentations. I personally dislike language to the utmost degree, but I found this class to be fun and interesting. All the work you put into it is rewarding.",
    "For the most part, a very good course. Course packet is much more useful than in French 3. A bit more difficult and work heavy than French L3 but very manageable. Mme Delaplace is a great teacher. Spoke in French all the time, which was helpful. Very responsive and made class enjoyable.",
    "I would highly recommend this course!",
    "I would 100% recommend taking FREN 140, especially with Mme Delaplace. She is a fantastic teacher and is always really engaging during class. Class was rarely boring, which I think is saying a lot considering you have to go to class every day. The class has very interesting readings, useful grammar, and a great unit on WWII.",
    "I strongly recommend FREN140. It covers the remainder of important grammar concepts one needs to know and then goes into a solely reading unit. After taking this class, all you need to learn is vocabulary and you should be able to understand any French conversation or reading.",
    "I definitely recommend FREN 140 to those who wish to continue to polish their French. It involves some tedious grammar exercises and previously studied units that become a little repetitive, but it's worth it, in the end. I feel much more fluent than ever before."
