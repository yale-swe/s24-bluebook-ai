    "Through this course, i was introduced to some absolutely incredible poets, and I especially appreciated Professor Stepto's integration of visual art and history with the poems we were reading. I gained both literary appreciation and historical context.",

   "comments": [
    "The syllabus was wonderful, and Professor Stepto is an angel. I especially loved our trip to the Beinecke-- it was unforgettable to see early drafts of the poems we were reading.",
    "Having the different weeks to be themed around different poetry forms or topics was really useful in understanding them and putting them in dialogue with each other. It would have been nice to have more historical background to the poets presented at the beginning of each class to better understand where they were coming from.",
    "The reading list is fabulous. But since the course is centered on close readings, it seems as though it would make more sense for the assignments to be shorter essays - the page count we reached was longer than that for most other English courses that focus on poetry and close reading, as opposed to prose or theory.",
    "This course is perfect! The poetry we read was amazing. This course also integrates art, music, and history. Professor Stepto is a legend and his life flawlessly blends with the material he teaches. The course is good for the soul."

   "comments": [
    "Professor stepto is an expert who has met many of the giants in this course, and even had their books dedicated to him. Needless to say, learning from him is a privilege as well as a delight. The Beinecke trip was excellent and one of those \"only at Yale\" experiences. Seeing an early draft of God's Trombones, with preliminary titles written in then crossed out, was unforgettable.",
    "If you want to get a broad sampling of African American poets from the late nineteenth century to recent decades, this class will provide that. I would recommend it just to get exposure to these poems and the topics they cover. However, this is not the most dynamic class--it moves rather slowly and quietly, so if that is not your speed, you might be better off elsewhere.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! This course is good for the soul. I've learned so much about history and poetry in a nice classroom setting. This class is challenging but not stressful so it's the best setting to learn about poetry."
