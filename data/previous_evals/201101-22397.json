    "This was a wonderful course. I took it immediately after taking Basic Drawing, and would recommend that as the best possible course of action--I've improved so much. Anna Betbeze is a great professor; assignments and classwork help build technique, and she allows for a lot of exploration and growth of personal style. There isn't too much direct \"how-to\" instruction, but pointers are always available if you ask for them. Homework is more time-consuming than drawing, simply by nature of the medium, but never overwhelming. Take it!",
    "The overall workload in this course is not that much (compared to some other art courses at Yale--this one only has 1 larger or a couple smaller assignments per week and not necessarily every week). Anna Betbeze is great, you get to go to the museum a couple times and talk about art, and our TA, Chris Page, was awesome (we got to go to his exhibition as well). This is a great beginner course for painting.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "take this class! fun, good intro to painting but also enjoyable if you are more experienced but not going to be an art major. can take some time to complete assignments but you are given a lot of time and flexibility to do it when you have time",
    "Yes! This class is really enjoyable. You had room to experiment with your own style and also learn some basics about how a painting is executed.",
    "Take. This. Class.",
    "Totally. It's great. But a bit of work. Painting's like that.",
    "Fun class, expensive for the materials.",
    "I would recommend this class even if you don't plan on taking any other art classes. It complements a less artistic schedule very well. It's also just a very fun, interesting class.",
    "It's a painting class that's done entirely in acrylics, starting with black and white and ending in a limited color palette. It's pretty comprehensive and you'll gain a good background in painting here. It'd help you out to have some prerequisites in figure drawing or perspective though, as those can be struggles if they've never been artistically addressed before."
