    "9: This course centered around a spring break field trip to St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The amount of prep work that Prof. Benoit put into organizing meetings with various scientists and officials (and into general logistics) was very, very evident -- all aspects were extremely well-organized.",
    "I would have like to have more presentations from the instructor.I would encourage him to share previous research projects with his next class. I think there is an opportunity for students to build on prior projects.",
    "Re Question 7b - Mary Beth Decker was a de facto TA and her insight and experience enhanced this already superb learning experience."

   "comments": [
    "The field portion of this course was incredibly well run, went very smoothly, and provided a much needed field component lacking in many other classes at FES.",
    "The field trip to St. Thomas. It was incredible to talk with such a broad range of interests relevant to soil erosion and environmental issues. Gabe has been organzing this class for multiple years, which means he has a great sense on how much work students can handle per day and balancing out the exercises with free time to enjoy the beautiful location.",
    "The field trip. The presence of Mary Beth Decker (E&EB) in both the course and on the field trip also added an incredible amount to the learning experience.",
    "The trip to ST Thomas was incredibly well organized and productive. Truly invaluable to get experience in the field.",
    "The field trip to St. Thomas. It was very helpful to have an on-site visit and see the impacts of development firsthand. I enjoyed meeting several people from the community and learning more about the dynamics of the community groups and the government.",
    "I really enjoyed the opportunity to experience so many perspectives from local people in the USVI. The class work leading up to the trip provided a strong foundation for discussions with many of the people we met, and the trip helped to put all of the nuanced issues impacting coastal development into context. Probably one of the best classes I've ever taken."

    "Clearer outline of what is expected in the course (e.g., for presentations), perhaps a couple more lectures led by the professor, meetings with students early in the semester to help decide on projects.",
    "I wish the first few classes provided a better scope of the problems and challenges on the island before jumping right into the technical papers. Some of the papers, like the one on cesium and gut ecology, were extremely scientific and lacking in how the issues relate to the broader context.",
    "I can't really think of any major areas for improvement. I would have liked to have covered some of the topics on the syllabus we didn't get to, but that was largely a function of the snowy winter (and cancelled class meetings).",
    "It would have been helpful to have received a set itinerary for the trip.",
    "More time in the USVI? Seriously though. It would be great to see the a continued and strengthened relationship with the University of the Virgin Islands."

I wish that at the beginning of the class he had made clear that he does not like to communicate via email and I would have then made a better effort to call or stop by his office with any further questions. However, once this information was learned while in the Caribbean, I had no problem getting in touch to ask questions.",
    "Gabe was generally available. He is not generally very responsive over email, but this was not a secret. I never had an issue when I dropped by his office.",
    "With Gabe's assistance, I was able to pull together a diverse set of resources for my research project.I enjoyed the opportunity to learn from Mary Beth Decker. She offered a lot of interesting insight about her own work, which complemented the course's subject matter.",

    "This course is one of the few options for learning about coastal ecology. It also incorporated social and political elements of coastal development. Very well designed and relevant to a variety of academic backgrounds.",

    "Try to select your paper topic BEFORE going to St. Thomas. It allows you to explore your topic while you are actually there, instead of scrambling once you get back.",
    "Find a topic for your final paper before you leave for the trip. If you have a topic, it offers a richer experience because you may be able to conduct on-site field research. I would also request and review papers written by previous classmates to see if you can build on previous research.",
