    "This was not a traditional capstone, in that we did not do research on a particular topic and present our findings and recommendations to a client. Instead, we developed data analysis tools for our clients, which was a long and trying process, given our lack of experience.",
    "The capstone seminars are really all quite different, but what they have in common is that you have the opportunity to produce something real with your work, which is a great way to culminate everything that we've learned over the last few years. By the end of the semester, you've invested a lot of time into this project, and you've really become an expert in whatever that field might be that your project was focused on. Personally, I had a great experience, and it confirmed everything I wanted from it as a global affairs major.",
    "I had a great experience in this class: I felt like I was on the cutting edge of where global affairs is going by learning programming languages and using quantitative skills to do something unique with our international relations knowledge. Instead of doing the same old--producing policy memos and writing analytical papers--we made web apps that the State Department can use even after we end our collaboration with them, and we were really able to produce something that we can be proud of.",
    "I would really advise selecting your capstone based on the instructor rather than the subject matter. The experiences turned out to be very different, as well as the skills developed in them. Some were really traditional write a policy memo kind of classes, but ours with Casey King was more focused on learning programming than policymaking - which was a unique opportunity I never thought I'd get through Jackson."
