   "comments": [
    "Take this class! The material is important for everyone to know about--everyone needs to eat--and is such a worthwhile way to take a Writing Skills class. Although this is a \"114\" level class, you will be challenged and engaged no matter how strong your writing is. There is something for everyone in this class.",
    "I would highly recommend English 114 to another student. Although the workload can get very stressful at some points, the class is rather enjoyable throughout the semester. I would mostly recommend it as a class to teach important time management skills along with improving writing style.",
    "This course helps one to learn the skills it takes to write a research paper as well as a personal essay. The small class size is great for the transition from a high school environment to a college environment.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class mostly because the content was very enlightening and intriguing. English 114 05 is an introductory English class centered around food policy in the united states that particularly emphasizes strong research and public speaking skills.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who can handle a high workload of semi-complex information. There was so much to learn about the food system that sometimes it took a while to even get to the writing part.",
    "I would recommend it, especially for people looking for an (easier) class or who are looking to strengthen their writing skills.",
    "Great introduction to college writing while also a very interesting topic. Subjects range from sustainable agriculture to the food stamp program."
