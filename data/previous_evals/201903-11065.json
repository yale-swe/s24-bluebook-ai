   "comments": [
    "The course gave me a deep appreciation of journalistic methods and medium.",
    "I learned more about interviewing vulnerable populations, current and previous wars \/ conflicts, writing, and collecting information.",
    "I took away new skills in interviewing individuals about hard topics on trauma and health. I truly enjoyed this course it was an amazing time. I also liked learning more about the world outside of America and the other events that are occuring around the world.",
    "Interviewing techniques with guest speakers",
    "I gained skills in interviewing victims of trauma; maintaining personal convictions as well as mental health in environments of war\/conflict; and navigating intersectional and intersectoral issues that arise out of conflict zones. For my final paper I created a report targeted towards a medical audience (e.g. healthcare providers) regarding migrant detention. I outlined the various stressors migrant children who end up detained in the U.S. face, as well as potential resources and solutions to mitigate their traumas in the future.",
    "This course was exceptional. I took it specifically to learn about writing and reporting because I had never studied that in an academic setting. Beyond the technical skills, I learned an enormous amount about international conflict that I had simply not yet been exposed to, and had the opportunity to refine my public-facing writing skills while exploring topics personal to me."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was very interactive, and highly experiential. Maybe the syllabus could be more consistent, but not if that takes away from unique last minute learning opportunities or potential interviews.",
    "Strengths: incredible guest speakers to interview and learn from Weaknesses: not as much instruction on writing \/ interviewing",
    "Strengths the amazing people who came into the class to teach us. I would have never had the opportunity to do this at any other university. Weakness, I would have love more journalistic feedback and more guidance on how to get into the business.",
    "This classes biggest strength is Professor Di Giovannis incredible experience. She has so much to share. It can be improved by having more assignments and activities to apply the material we are learning.",
    "Janine has very good contacts and some of the guest speakers were extremely interesting, especially those related to the UN system. I would have liked to spend more class time with Janine and I think the course could be improved if divided evenly between guest speakers and class time.",
    "Our professor Janine was kind, responsive via email, and genuinely invested in each and every student. She gave feedback on every assignment with great attention to detail. She brought a host of speakers -- individuals ranging from those directly afflicted by the Syrian conflict to those within the U.N. making (erroneous) tactical decisions. I benefitted from Janine, her speakers, and her direction for the class. I also benefitted from student presentations at the end, as they are knowledgeable about niche subjects I wanted more exposure to. A weakness of the course was the teaching assistant. Where Janine was cool and collected, our teaching assistant would at times argue with students over her own political beliefs regarding an oppressive state. While it would be one thing for a teaching assistant to hold conviction (particularly if she were representing a currently oppressed demographic), our teaching assistant came off as aggressive and dismissive of students' voice.",
    "We didn't particularly stick to the syllabus, which was a little off-putting at first. But the changes were made to accommodate really phenomenal guests, so the benefits certainly outweighed the drawbacks."

   "comments": [
    "100% - a fantastic course with a fantastic professor.",
    "Yes I would. A wonderful opportunity to learn from an incredible instructor and guest speakers",
    "I would recommend the course in order to understand other conflicts in the world and how to write on tough subjects.",
    "Yes, this class is a great opportunity to meet with and talk to incredible people. I looked forward to this class every week. The content is so powerful and so important.",
    "This has been the most memorable course during my time at Yale, and Janine is the most remarkable instructor I have met. She brings decades of professional experience into the classroom while being unrelentingly kind and supportive. Every week I felt like I left the class having learned something real and important, a little bit devastated about the state of humanity, and angered into action. Most of the weeks we got to interview either survivors of human rights abuses or experts, and in between I learned quite a bit about the practical aspects of working in conflict zones or with victims of trauma otherwise. The final project also allows you to choose a niche human rights topic and dig really deep into it. I could not recommend this class more.",
    "I would recommend this course depending on the student's interests. It is very focused on journalism skills and you can get great practice interviewing people. The final project is a great opportunity at exploring a topic the student is passionate about.",
    "Yes. Great opportunities to engage with other students, a well-renowned and well-connected professor, and many speakers from across the world. The feedback and environment facilitates learning.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student."
