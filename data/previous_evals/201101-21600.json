    "If you need an easy history course then this class is perfect for you.",
    "This class is really boring but extremely easy for a History lecture\u0097-take it only if you need the American or Pre-Industrial credits.",
    "i would recommend this course because it is a good into level history. there is no reason to be scared of having to memorize too many dates and names. it is also a very important subject to learn about.",
    "No. There are other more interesting courses. Blackhawk is better in seminars.",
    "This class treats a very important topic, but somewhat disjointedly. However, the amount of work in this class is wonderfully light compared to others. Professor Blackhawk is kind and understanding, and he is extremely knowledgeable in this field.",
    "Definitely take this course!!!",
    "I took this class Cr\/D\/F and was glad. The material we covered in the course was synthesized in a way I'd never encountered before, and I loved that. I really appreciated the somewhat unusual course readings. Lectures could be a bit confusing. Professor Blackhawk is clearly very knowledgeable, and very understanding. The course he presented has definitely shifted my understanding of the foundations of this country. He is not the most charismatic lecturer, but as long as you keep with him you'll be rewarded."
