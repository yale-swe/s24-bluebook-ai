    "Definitely take the class with Professor Schenker. She really makes an effort to keep the class interesting and include a variety of topics and themes about German history, culture, art, etc. The workload is definitely manageable, although the course had less of a focus on speaking than I had been expecting.",
    "If you want to keep learning German, yes! Take the class with Professor Schenker!!!",
    "I would summarize GMAN 140 02 as a a great fourth level German course. The classes were very intense and Theresa will expect a lot from her students, but she isn't out to punish her students in any aspect. I would definitely recommend her class to anyone that wants to seriously pursue learning German.",
    "Writing, online workbook, frequent but fair tests, and you'll learn a lot if you take the class seriously. I'd recommend it!",
    "I had an absolutely wonderful experience with GMAN 140 (as well as GMAN 110 to 130), and I would highly recommend any of these courses to a fellow student. Specifically, GMAN 140 will allow you to solidify your grammar and vocab knowledge and begin to refine and apply a core knowledge in a more realistic, \"real life\" setting. The course is also very interactive and fun, because your stronger language competency will allow to to participate in original class discussion, and engage with advanced forms of prose, art and literature \u2013 which is very rewarding after all the hard work you put into learning German through the previous semesters!",
    "German L4\u2013 ONLY with Theresa Schenker! You will be surprised how much you learn and will look forward to every class!"
