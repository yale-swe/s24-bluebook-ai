    "A rather casual class, just make sure you have an actual interest in the topics taught. There's some machine learning, some shape perception, some color stuff, and a decent amount of review from the first semester class. Not a lot of work, just biweekly problem sets and a final project.",
    "This is a very unique class that combines seemingly disparate topics (game theory, machine learning, vision?) into a more-or-less cohesive whole. There is a pretty strong focus on the geometry of vision (local surface geometry, etc) near the end of the course. A must take for anyone interested in the specific intersection between how we can teach computers to see, and theories for how humans\/animals see. Still a very nice class to take if youre interested in many areas of applied mathematics (e.g. game theory, optimization, learning, geometry) and want to see how it all ties together.",
    "Very much an advanced CS course. The actual programming is very simple and short, but the mathematics behind it can be challenging. Mathematicians, physicists and engineers with a minor programming background will probably fare better than most cs majors. Professor Zucker tries he best to cover the whole mathematical background required, but theres a lot of it. Not having taken the previous course in the series isn't much of a disadvantage. Grading is based on a few psets and a fnal project.",
    "A difficult course but you're given a lot of lee way. Don't be a burnout and you'll get a good grade. Will make you have to think in the abstract, doesn't hurt to be \"open minded\"."
