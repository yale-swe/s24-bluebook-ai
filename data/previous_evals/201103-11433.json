   "comments": [
    "The course essentially operates like working on a production of Coriolanus would, class time being split between dramaturgical work (reading primary sources, analyzing, studying history) and rehearsal time (contact improv at first, blocking and staging later on). I DEFINITELY recommend production seminars! Take as many as you can. It is the best learning experience you can have at yale and the perfect combination between intellectual and practical theater.",
    "I don't know if a course like this will be taught again but this class was awesome and should someone who's reading this have the opportunity to work on a play in this manner they should take it.",
    "If you want to do really good theater at Yale, then yes. This is sort of a moot point because the specific class probably won't be offered again, but as a general note for Daniel Larlham production classes: You will work really hard, there will be too much reading, but you will put on one of the best productions you will be able to do at Yale.",
    "The first half of the semester deals with a play and anything you could want to know about the play--all sorts of history, theory, adaptation, etc... The second half is on your feet, putting together a show. There is physical work throughout, which is exciting and was unfamiliar to some. It was fun to work with a mix of \"theater kids\" and kids not studying theater.",
    "It's the best production seminar I've ever taken. Makes you really re-evaluate what you think of Shakespeare as historical and untouchable text!",
    "This class is a very unique approach to performing Shakespeare- the critical and intellectual approach that covers half the class time is eye-opening, if not entirely relevant to performance."
