    "I learned SO MUCH in this class it's actually kind of ridiculous. Over the course of the three modules we covered exoplanets, Black Holes and Dark Matter, and Cosmology! While I already knew quite a bit about the exoplanets unit, it was still exciting to be able to Dr. Fisher and Dr. Laughlin come and speak about their research. The Black Hole and Cosmology units were my first real introduction to GR so that was quite challenging. However, I feel that I learned a lot about how GR works and the various metrics that we discussed, but also how to think about the Universe in broader contexts.",
    "I ended up learning a brief but solid introduction to exoplanets, black holes, and cosmology. Of these three topics, I found the exoplanets and cosmology modules to be the best organized. As a result I feel very stable in these topics. The black holes module felt a little less organized (there was no text to refer to), and as a result I feel less comfortable with this topic.",
    "Great intro and intense survey course to learn about astrophysics.",
    "I learned about exoplanets and their detection methods, black holes and general relativity, and cosmology and the expanding universe. We went over a lot of very interesting material in some of the coolest branches of physics.",
    "I gained so many insights into the nature of cosmology, general relativity, and planetary formation that I could not be more overjoyed by my dedication to go to class every day.",
    "As an astrophysics major, I've always been extremely interested in all 3 topics covered by the course: exoplanets, black holes, and cosmology. However, until now I had never had formal instruction in either of those 3 subjects, and this course provided a great survey of all of them. It definitely gave me a much better idea of the details behind General Relativity and Cosmology, as well as observational and computational techniques in all the 3 subjects.",
    "A good course for astro majors as you learn a lot of new things that are not offered in other courses, including material on exoplanets and GR."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Guest lectures are really fun and insightful, you cover a lot of content, the content is interesting and very relevant (this is basically a \"Frontiers of Astronomy\" course so everything that you talk about is at the cutting edge of the discipline), final project gives students freedom to choose a topic of interest to them. Weaknesses: Some of the material can be difficult to grasp at the speed of the course if you've never been exposed to it before so you really need to read the notes\/textbook and maybe watch\/read some supplementary things too.",
    "The course is well structured and the workload is manageable--there are three separate modules\/themes, two-ish problem sets for each module, and a non-cumulative exam at the end of each. There is also a small final project\/presentation at the end of the semester. However, the lectures could be hard to follow, as they often included information and concepts that were at a level that seemed inappropriate for the class. It almost felt like Professor Natarajan was recycling lectures she had given in other contexts--I didn't get the sense that she was invested in our learning process or in helping us fully understand the information she was presenting. This problem was compounded by the fact that only one of the three modules (the final one on cosmology) had a textbook that was clearly in line with the class material. It was hard to know where to turn when lectures were unclear. Also, we often had guest lecturers, and although their presentations were interesting enough, Professor Natarajan was not present for the talks and therefore did not contextualize the material for us in a helpful way.",
    "Less time could be spent on exoplanets; the black holes and cosmology parts require more time to understand.",
    "This course gives a useful overview of exoplanets, black holes, and cosmology. However, it would be nice if the class was more organized and stuck to a stricter schedule.",
    "Cosmology was super weird.",
    "The class is about really cool topics and is very interesting but was a little unorganized at times.",
    "Strengths: The course was very well taught and engaging. I especially liked the lecturers who came in and gave us an understanding of what's going on on the frontier. It really does give a glimpse into what's possible in astrophysics research today. Weaknesses: If it were humanly possible to cover more material, I'd love to have spent a little longer on understanding the equations more.",
    "This course was a great overview of a lot of really exciting topics in astronomy. I liked how we got an introduction to many complicated research topics while using a level of physics that most of us had seen in previous courses. It was a course that made people really enthusiastic about astronomy research, even if they had never taken an astronomy class before.",
    "Strengths: - does a great job of covering 3 very exciting topics in astrophysics: exoplanets, black holes and GR, cosmology - mixture of lectures and guest lectures provides a very good idea of the theoretical and observational\/computational aspects of the subject Weaknesses: - is a little too fast-paced sometimes - could spend more time on the mathematics behind the theory, especially for black holes and cosmology",
    "The course has a good set of material (although it can be challenging at times) and the grading is fair and straightforward. However there are a lot of organizational problems that really detract from the impression of the course as a whole."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! The topics are so interesting and evaluations are pretty chill (three open book in-class tests and a final project, no final exam). Psets aren't toooo bad either.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course unless it is taught by someone who is more committed to teaching.",
    "I would only recommend this course after it had gone through a revamping of its schedule. I believe that the course needs to be better organized.",
    "Great non gut to learn science.",
    "If you want to learn about cosmology, exoplanets and black holes this is a great class for you. I would recommend going to the TA and asking for help on the homework because some of the problems can be vague or not intuitive.",
    "YES. Definitely take this course; you'll learn so much from Yale's amazing astronomy department and it'll be worth it. Sometimes, you'll wonder what in the world is going on with all these stars and how people can know about the meaning of the universe, and if that's you, you'll want to take this class.",
    "Definitely would recommend 10\/10!!! This class is a wonderful survey course on three extremely exciting topics in astrophysics: Exoplanets, Black Holes and GR, and Cosmology. The workload is very reasonable (6 psets, 3 exams, and 1 final presentation), and the material is so incredibly exciting! If you are an astro major, this class is a wonderful choice for an elective. If you are not an astro major, this class will make you fall in love with the subject. :)",
    "Probably the better of the other astro electives (personal opinion). I would take again if I had to. Again, organizational problems from the professor detract from the course, but are not overwhelming."
