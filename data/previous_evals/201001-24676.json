   "comments": [
    "Great course to get overview of modern European history. Take it if you want to get a grasp of the major events that has happened over the past 350 years.",
    "This is a great class with a great professor. Perfect overview of European history for the last several centuries.",
    "if youre looking for a pretty easy course that is decently interesting, take itdont take it if you dont want to read a lot",
    "Great class from a great professor.",
    "I would recommend it. As a survey course, it really gives you a lot of detailed, useful information on European history.",
    "European Civilization is a good course but not a great one. The material is all very interesting, but the lectures were pretty scattershot and filled with anecdotes that often made it tough to figure out what was important and what wasn't--it got pretty easy to zone out during lecture. Also, my section was pretty painful, although that was probably just an issue with my section. If you never took AP Euro, though, this is good stuff to know.",
    "Yes-- great overview of European history!",
    "Take it if f you really need to brush up on your european history, otherwise, you'll get bored really quickly if you are already too familiar with this material. That said, the lectures are really interesting and taught very well. Manageable course work and finals are very fair!",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend",
    "This is a great overview of the period, though there is not much detail in any one area. I would definitely recommend it as an easy survey course.",
    "The class is a broad survey of European history, so it moves quickly. There's a good bit of reading (perhaps not as much as other courses, but still a lot), which I enjoyed because it included a variety of non-textbook assignments (e.g. Homage to Catalonia by Orwell). However, at the end, because it wasn't too difficult to get by without doing all of the reading, I question how much I gained in knowledge \u0097 I think I knew more history than I realized initially. But if you're willing to do all of the work, it'll pay off. Merriman is a great lecturer in that he doesn't duplicate the text \u0097 he focuses on other events that highlight the main time period and focus of the week, to supplement the reading. However, he's a little bit disorganized in his lecturing \u0097 if you take the class, don't worry about taking notes. They won't be necessary, and you'll enjoy the class more if you just listen to Merriman's funny stories.",
    "I would recommend the course. It is an interesting topic that Merriman covers thoroughly despite the broad array of subjects covered. The workload is very manageable.",
    "A look into the troubles of Europe from 1648-1945 and the acknowledgement of certain themes usually swept under the carpet. I would definitely recommend the course. It sets up a steady timeline and allows one to see the connections between remote events.",
    "I would recommend it if you like doing lots of reading from the textbook (which is great) and don't want to attend lectures necessarily.",
    "Definitely recommend!!! great class and work is reasonable",
    "I would recommend European History to another student-especially if he\/she has never taken a survey European History course before in high school or anything. I had never taken a European History class before so I found it fascinating and Professor Merriman is extremely interesting to listen too. If you have already taken AP European History, I would take a different class-perhaps one of Merriman's other classes.",
    "If you want a good history survey course, take this!",
    "Take this class if you're willing to do a lot of reading and really want to learn this stuff. The time span is 1648-1945, which is HUGE, so don't be surprised if it goes fast. Your enjoyment of the class really depends on your TA too, so be careful.",
    "I would recommend it not as a keystone class in someone's schedule, but maybe as a fifth course. It should be taken with the student aware that it is a survey course and thus lacking in some of the satisfaction of real specificity and analysis."
