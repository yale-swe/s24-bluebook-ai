    "There's not too much work and Professor Chevalier is great. After you give your presentation though, there isn't a whole lot of incentive to engage the econometric papers.",
    "Great professor, very good material. Take it if you're interested in the material. If not, you might get a little bored, particularly during the legal portions of the class.",
    "Take it. Take it. Take it. Worth every second.",
    "Great class with a really contemporary and interesting topic. You'll learn about the digital economy and examine recent literature. It's all cutting edge stuff, and the economics is fascinating. A must-take Yale Econ seminar.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students. If you are not an econ major, you should still try to take it because it's a fascinating subject."
