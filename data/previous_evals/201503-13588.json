    "SPAN 130 is a good Spanish course for students with a solid understanding of basic Spanish vocabulary and grammar. It moves at a much better pace than the previous levels, and is enjoyable in that there are many cultural activities that involve taking trips outside of class.",
    "Should be self-explanatory. It's a continuation of SPAN 110 and 120 with a bit less daily busywork (but still a fair amount of it). Most of the course was a rapid review of subjects learned in 110 and 120, studied in more depth, and the end was new material.",
    "Review spanish 2 and learn a little more. I would recommend.",
    "Only take Spanish 130 if you need to. It meets everyday and by the end of the course you will be happy that it's over. It's not fun or interesting. Tons of assignments, tons of grammar, very little rewards.",
    "Although the workload may appear to be a bit daunting, the course will help solidify your understanding of the Spanish language.",
    "SPAN 130 is a decent amount of work. Though it meets every day, the workload each night rivals that of classes that meet only twice a week. There will be a lot of grammar toward the end that may seem burdensome to learn, but of course grammar is essential when learning a new language. The expectations are also higher than what you might expect, especially if you take SPAN 130 as a freshman (the exams are relatively difficult and the oral exam at the end is nothing like the relatively simple oral exams from high school). In essence, it is what you've likely come to expect with a language class, and there will be boring parts and times when all of the language rules you learn make you sick, but if your experience is anything like mine, your language skills will radically improve as a result of your efforts."
