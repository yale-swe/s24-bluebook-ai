    "This class taught me a lot more complicated sentence structure and helped develop my German skills.",
    "I continued to expand and develop my reading, speaking, listening, and writing skills (after taking German 110 in the fall). My increased vocabulary and more advanced grammar allowed me to both communicate more effectively and learn more about German culture through reading more complicated texts, etc.",
    "L2 of German gets a little more challenging and picks up speed, as compared to L1. I would say that in L2 I finally understood sentence structure and learned some more about contemporary German culture.",
    "Vocabulary, grammar, reading, writing and speaking skills",
    "Lots of work on grammar, listening, and writing. Bi-weekly speaking tests are good supplements to speaking in class.",
    "I am now relatively able to hold a conversation in german and my writing skills are much better."

   "comments": [
    "This class is a TON of work. It counts as 1.5 credits, but I think it was as much work as 2 credits. There are a lot of different homework assignments going on at the same time, many projects, biweekly tests, online forum posts, and more. However, I do feel like the amount of work helped me with my language skills. Also, the instruction was great.",
    "Overall the course is very strong. The online forum was a hefty undertaking each week, but in retrospect I think it was very beneficial for our writing. Some of the Connect homework assignments seemed slightly irrelevant--that (for me) is probably the only particular weakness in the course.",
    "Strengths: Very engaging professor, passionate about the material, great attitude, very knowledgeable, patient, and helpful. Weaknesses: Too much work assigned for days where we didn't have class (snow days, off-days, etc.). Otherwise great.",
    "The forum posts were a little bit too long, 50 sentences a week took a lot of time and the question prompts were vague so it was difficult to write so many sentences on them. The Connect Homework software was AWFUL, I learned next to nothing from it and it is very difficult to understand how they wanted you to answer. I also think that the course is potentially to harshly graded. I was only a few marks short on every assessment and mid-semester realized it was not actually possible to get an A in the class. The strengths all came from the teacher.",
    "All the interactions were super useful. Having a place to actually practice speaking German aloud is great, and how we always paired off is helpful. Speaking German in front of the whole class can be intimidating, so most of the \"interviews\" we do is with partners or small groups."

   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn German this is a great course. I definitely recommend taking it with Theresa.",
    "Definitely take this course (especially with Professor Schenker!). It solidly builds on the foundation GMAN 110 provided, and by the end of the course students can write and communicate comfortably in the classroom setting.",
    "I absolutely love German and Theresa is an amazing teacher. I would highly recommend taking the class with Theresa, if you can. She is so happy and engaging, no matter how bad you are at answering her questions during class. German is by far the best class I have taken here!",
    "Yes, I learned a lot in a short time and although the language is hard, the course is very good and not too hard.",
    "Absolutely, 100% take it Theresa if you get the chance",
    "Yes absolutely. If you are willing to work hard the German course will teach you a lot really quickly and is very satisfying. It's just important to understand how much work is involved.",
    "I never imagined learning a language to be so fun. German is already an interesting language in and of itself, but with this course, the interactions and projects allow us to learn German in a fun and creative way. There is also so much important culture we get introduced to! If you were to study this all by yourself, it would surely be overwhelming."
