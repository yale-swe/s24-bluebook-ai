    "If you want a real science class\u0097and not a class based on memorization\u0097avoid Roeder. Dellaporte was great.",
    "Take this class! It's a great introduction to the biology program here at Yale, and you will accrue a lot of knowledge and problem solving skill without much work. I took this as a freshman, after having AP Biology in high school, and found the course to be totally doable, if not easy. It is also not necessary to read the textbook.",
    "I would recommend the course for anyone interested in Genetics. The course seemed much less stressful than other classes since it involves only weekly quizzes rather than midterms and was generally enjoyable although Professor Roeders lectures can sometimes seem boring if you get caught in the cycle of just memorizing and not appreciating the material presented.",
    "Great class, definitely worth taking. Material is very relevant. Curve is extremely generous.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. While the weekly quizzes sometimes feel like a burden, they help force you to keep up with the material. By the time of the final, most of your grade is already set. Luckily, there are help sessions several nights each week, so you can have someone answer your questions in a smaller setting. If you like biology, you will probably find this class interesting, even though it takes a lot of work.",
    "Not as bad as past reviews have implied. Not my favorite. We skipped over the one subject that motivated me to take the course because we were always shy on time.",
    "Genetics was not a fun class. Dellaporta goes through his lectures super fast, so it is hard to keep up. His quizzes are difficult. Roeder is not animated, but at least her lectures are clear and her quizzes are straightforward. They just require a lot of memorization. Although I didn't really like either of the professors, I found the material pretty interesting, which I wasn't expecting. The final was reasonable.",
    "I would recommend it as an interesting Biology course. There is a fair amount of material and text covered and it is overall well-taught and clear.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless it is a major requirement. Never have I had a lecture that passed as slowly as this one. Dellaporta is energetic and well-intentioned, but terribly unorganized. Roeder, while much more organized than Dellaporta, is the single most boring lecturer I've ever had. Her lectures are nothing short of painful.The class is a survey of basic genetic topics but material is covered in such a way that we never delve deep enough into something to really be able to appreciate it or find it interesting.I acknowledge that making an intro science course interesting is challenging, but this class really floundered.Studying for the final can be overwhelming.",
    "Final was very fair. Do pset questions in preparation for it. Dellaporta's quizzes are notoriously difficult even if you study hard. But Roeder comes in and saves the day so hang in there. This class although it is frustrating should absolutely be a requirement cuz its so important for understanding diseases.",
    "I would recommend this course only to pre-med students or students majoring in biology. Since the course is 80% upperclassmen, I would hesitate to recommend it to a freshman, although I personally felt comfortable in the class.",
    "Genetics is now an intermediate level course required for biology majors. It covers some fairly interesting topics (quantitative genetics, human genetic markers, etc.) and some fairly mundane ones (double-strand break repair of DNA, etc.). Both Professor Dellaporta and Roeder are straightforward about what information they want you to know. Do the practice problems before the weekly quizzes and you'll do above average every time! The weekly quiz system is great. The final the last week of class (in-class!) was GREAT because 1. we were done early AND 2. it was a very reasonable assessment of what we learned over the semester and did not require us to do anything ridiculous if we studied. It's required, so you probably have to take it. But, its really not a bad class. Some of it may even be interesting!",
    "i would recommend if you have good memory. plus you don't have to go for every lecture since everything s either on ppt or in the textbook.",
    "Dellaporta - looked like dreaded everyday he came to class. His material is denser than Roeder's (more math-heavy, statistical), though clearly applicable to Genetics. His quizzes are arbitrary and trickier than they are focused on the material. Pay attention to the wording of questions on his quizzes.Roeder - great lecturer, if a little dry. She was always on top of her material and her problem sets\/quizzes were very straightforward and based off her material.Weekly quizzes are a grind, but they're not terrible. Actually a great change of pace from the midterm-midterm-final format of most science classes. Not as bad as upper bio classes.",
    "I recommend that you take this class - if this is your first biology class at Yale it will be harder for you.",
    "I would only recommend the class for science majors. If you're not a biology major and are just looking for an extra science class, this isn't the one to take because it really requires an understanding of the fundamentals of molecular biology.",
    "I would not recommend this course.",
    "It sucks. Most people take it because they have to. If that's you, get it over with as soon as you can.",
    "I would recommend especially if you can manage a quiz a week.",
    "This is definitely more in-depth genetics than you would get just from the intro bio course. The weekly quizzes are good in that they require you to be on top of the material. Professor Dellaporta is generally pretty good and really enthusiastic about teaching. He focuses on problem solving, while there is more memorization of material for Roeder's lectures. Professor Roeder has really clear slides and lectures, so make sure you understand the slides. Do the problem sets--they'll really prepare you for the quizzes and the final. Overall pretty standard bio class. This will prepare you for other biology classes or will be easier if you take it after them.",
    "Class was not bad. Delloporta's lectures corresponded with the textbook's very well. During Roeders lectures, however, the quizzes became memorizing her slides and practice problems. Did not really feel like I was learning.",
    "Yea, it's a good course, if you need to brush up your knowledge of basic biology \/ learn some basic biotech techniques this is a great coruse.",
    "Overall, genetics was a good course. Roeder's material was at times very interesting. Both Roeder and Dellaporta have their own strengths and weaknesses, but they are generally quite good lecturers. The course is not extremely hard or time-consuming, but it's not extremely well-taught or interesting either. Pretty average. The weekly quizzes are alright--there was a time crunch to finish Dellaporta's quizzes, but Roeder's quizzes were fair. The final is fair.",
    "I would recommend this class as a good bio credit. I found it to be interesting for the most part, and enjoyed Dellaporta's lectures (although the last half of the class was much more boring). The class is labor intensive because there's a short quiz each week, but this format makes it much easier to study for the final and to stay engaged throughout the semester.",
    "It's a MCDB requirement so you have to take it. In the end it's actually not THAT bad. The first half is worse than the second, so it gets better! Just get better for some pretty miserable Mondays before the Tuesday quizzes.",
    "Don't take unless you have to.",
    "If you have to take it, make sure you study lectures after every class.",
    "The weekly quizzes keep you on top of your reading and make the class very low-stress. Figure out how to study for them early and do the assigned problem sets.Prof Dellaporta's lectures are more interesting and passionate, and he teaches you to apply the material to new problems, but his quizzes are harder. Prof Roeder's lectures are more clear and concise, her quizzes are easier, and you don't have to open the textbook once during her half of the semester because she only quizzes you on her lecture slides. That said, she is a monotonous lecturer and she just teaches you to regurgitate info.Overall, take it if you are interested in the material. Pretty good for a science class at Yale.",
    "You have to take this course to be an MCDB major, and it is definitely doable. Be prepared to spend Monday nights studying for the quizzes.",
    "This class covers a lot of material, most of which was new for me, but is manageable as long as you do the practice problem set each week before the quiz and make sure to clarify the things you sort of understand but not really.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Not too much work, definitely very interesting, and well-taught (I loved the Dellaporta lectures).",
    "You're a dummy if you don't take it. The reviews last year are bullcrap and you shouldn't read a single one of them. The class is extremely well-organized (72% quizzes, 28% final, each quiz is 8% with one dropped, Dellaporta's had 11 questions with one question you could drop and Roeder's had 10 questions, final was very fair). Dellaporta took a lot from the textbook, Roeder...well everything was her own material. I wish the MCDB classes I take from now on are as awesome as this one. With the qeekly quizzes, you get an update on how you're doing every week and it's great not having to cram for individual midterms.",
    "Great class, very applicable material, and fun to attend. You should take it.",
    "A lot of time and work--be prepared to do all the things that are listed as optional in addition to just going to class and doing readings. Genetics is a very interesting subject but may not be taught as best as it can be at Yale. Take if you need to, but be prepared for a lot of self-instruction. Look for a study buddy too.",
    "not too bad as a standard bio class",
    "Take it if you have to.Otherwise, the material is dense and scattered, not too engaging, and you should expect to be in a room full of pre-meds who will push the curve up ridiculously high.",
    "Take it if you must, but otherwise steer clear. It takes a lot of time and energy to even get a B, and sucks out your life force in the process. Dellaporta's quizzes are out to trick you, Roeder's are straightforward. The final was tough on memorization by Roeder. Keep up with your readings for this class!",
    "Just memorize what you need to learn. I was very interested in certain subjects because they were relevant to what is done in a real lab setting. It's a decent class.",
    "I'd HIGHLY recommend this course. Genetics was probably my favorite science class at Yale so far (current junior). Both Dellaporta and Roeder were very clear lecturers, and it was hard not to get excited about genetics over the course of this class. The material is super interesting and a lot of it was based on pretty recent advances. Consider the reading optional--I found studying from the powerpoints was sufficient. There's a reasonable curve and non-intimidating, weekly multiple choice quizzes.",
    "Genetics is required for the MCDB major, so you're probably taking it because you have to. It's not fantastic, but you will survive. Dr. Dellaporta's weekly quizzes were pretty rough but it's not as hard as Cell Bio, and Roeder's quizzes were fine.",
    "Take it if you have to. The material is interesting, but there are better biology classes available. The grades are cut off at B\/B+ but the class average is also around there, so the curve isn't that helpful.",
    "do the problem sets, go to lecture and pay attention, go to the help sessions",
    "This class is great if you love biology and are interested in the material, but it's very hard to get a good grade in. Good luck.",
    "Much better than it apparently has been in past years, due mostly to a switch to a cell-bio style weekly quiz format (which works very well) and also to getting rid of a third professor (the two that remain, Shirleen and Steve, are both good \u0096\u00a0at least, it's easy to learn from their powerpoints). The quizzes were relatively easy, though they get harder as the semester progresses. Shirleen's slides are much more in depth than Steve's, though his are also more quantitative \u0096\u00a0depends on your strengths, I guess. I found there was a downward trend in my quiz grades. Taking notes is difficult and worthless, I think, because most everything is on the slides. I also did not read a page of the text. My raw score was 89% and this got me an A-, so there is a curve although it is not all that generous.",
    "Yes, I recommend MCDB 202 to other students, especially for exploring topics that are not usually covered in introductory biology courses.",
    "You get a complete overview of genetics, from Mendel to modern methods. I definitely recommend it for pre-meds. The quizzes are not so bad, so long as you go to lecture, do the problem sets, and look at the practice quizzes if they're posted.",
    "Great course - tremendous improvement over two years ago, when the course had many professors and midterm exams rather than weekly quizzes. Professor Dellaporta is very approachable and a nice guy, although his lectures can get a bit confusing at times. Professor Roeder has amazing powerpoints and clearly takes the time to prepare her materials beforehand, so she cares about teaching undergrads. The quizzes help you keep on top of the material, and if you've already been through Cell Bio, they should not be difficult. I personally thought the material was very interesting, and if you're going to work in the biological sciences (including medicine) in the future, this course is going to be a must-take.",
    "Genetics is a reasonably hard course, and it is important to develop a regular study schedule, in order to perform well on the weekly quiz.",
    "The bad reputation is really unfounded. The expectations are clearly laid out. You have weekly quizzes which sounds terribly stressful at first, but trust a former slacker, it really isn't. Study the lecture material and use the book to clarify points you don't understand for Dellaporta's lectures and don't bother reading the book only focusing on lecture material for Roeder. Quiz questions will be short recall. You won't need to do long problems. You get into the swing of things after the first two quizzes, and the rest just fly by. Doing quizzes every week forces you to be prepared for the exam when it comes making it nice. Be warned: don't think you can skip class and pull yourself up for the final because you'll be in for a long and fruitless night of cramming.",
    "Yea, fear not, for if you study for the weekly quizzes, you will do fine. But make sure to study for them. Really. No joke. Dellaporta's quizzes are a bit wonky - often wordy and confusing. Be prepared. Roeder's are straightforward. Read her slides - don't bother with the book - and you'll know everything you need. Good luck, brave student.",
    "It was an average class. I particularly did not enjoy it too much as I found the subject matter boring and so small that it was hard to understand its practicality. others may feel different, however. I would hestitantly recommend mcdb 202. Its not that bad of a course and the format of 10 quizzes makes it extremely manageable on a week to week basis but I wasn't in love with the subject material. I had to do it for my major so i did it.",
    "It's astounding that a class of such poor quality is such an integral part of the undergraduate biology curriculum. The poor level of instruction in this class borders on pedagogical terrorism. With Dr. Dellaporta, the lectures were scattered, incomplete, and largely a waste of time. With Dr. Roeder, they were pedantic, tiresome, and also a waste of time.If you're going to takethis class, it's probably because you need to. I'm sorry.That being said, this class fails for multiple reasons. Firstly, it provides no ability to apply your knowledge. Aside form the stupid toy problems they give you in quizzes, there's no chance where you can actually see how to apply the facts you learn. This class also uses nothing from the primary literature. Once again, any good scientific instruction should show how it is applied in the field.Either way, this is a horrible, unsatisfying course. At least it isn't all that difficult.",
    "Yes, it is a great class and the weekly quizzes weren't bad at all.",
    "No. Although this class is a requirement for the major, if you can avoid it, please do. It's terrible.",
    "THIS IS A HORRIBLE COURSE. run away! unless you're really set on being a bio major. in that case, it's necessary. but i feel as if I didn't learn anything from this class, AND the grading is harsh.",
    "This was an okay class. As long as you do the problem sets and pay attention in lecture you should be able to do well on the weekly quizes. Dellaporta's quizes were trickier. Make sure you read his questions carefully. Roeder's were easy and straight forward.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it because its a requirement for MCDB. If you're remotely interested in it you're likely already an MCDB major.",
    "The first half of the course is pretty repetitive, while the second half covers more new material (or maybe I knew more about traditional genetics than about bacteria going in). There's a quizevery week, and the quizzes are pretty important so study the day before. For both professors, if you can do the homework, you can do the quiz. Be warned that Roeder's homework and quizzes are much harder though. Dellaporta is a more entertaining lecturer, but he covers less information. Roeder basically reads her slides, but almost everything she says is new and interesting. If you miss class or don't understand at first, you can learn it all by going over her slides, but it's easier to treat the lectures as if you're studying for the next quiz.",
    "If you're an MCDB major, you have to take this class. It's a fairly typical intro science class, a bit similar to cell bio especially with the weekly quizzes except less fast-paced and MC quizzes. Thus, there will be cramming on Monday nights. The curve is also still something to watch out for. The final was fair, even a bit on the easier side perhaps.Professor Dellaporta is a bit all over the place, so his lectures can be confusing and his quizzes can be rather hard. Professor Roeder, though, is much more organized and straightforward.If you don't NEED to take this class, it seems unnecessarily painful for just a science credit."
