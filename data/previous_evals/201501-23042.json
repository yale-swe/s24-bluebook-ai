    "Yes I would recommend the concept of voice lessons for credit, unless Jana Batty is in charge of it, in which case only if you can deal with SERIOUS ORGANIZATIONAL DYSFUNCTION. Truly. If Jana is in charge, only take this if you don't mind having no information about anything and then being asked to sing a jury the night before finals start on 3 days notice. Ya, so maybe don't take it.",
    "Yes. If you sing, do this. It's a great way to improve your singing, regardless of the genre you like to sing.",
    "A great way to maintain your vocal technique and attention through the entire year! There is no real reason not to take voice lessons for credit if you can!",
    "I would recommend this course. This is a great opportunity for serious undergrad singers to improve vocal technique and learn new repertoire."
