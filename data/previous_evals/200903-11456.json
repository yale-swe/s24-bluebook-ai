    "Basic intro language course: meets everyday, average of an hour or a little more homework a day (depending how much you want to put in). Fun, not too stressful but you definitely need to be prepared for class so you can participate.",
    "Yes, definitely take it with Melike. She is amazing.",
    "It's probably not the best language offered at Yale in how it's run, but I definitely enjoyed my experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend German 110 any other student interested in learning the language. It was a good introductory course that provided a solid foundation of grammar and vocab, and had a good balance of spoken and written work.",
    "I would recommend German 110 for any student looking to gain a ready familiarity with the rudiments of colloquial German."
