    "I think this class was organized very well, and I found classes to be engaging! I do have a suggestion though- when we reached adjectives in the plural, I felt like we still hadn't really internalized adjectives in the singular. We did practice using jak to determine adjectival endings, but I think we should have practiced more figuring out adjectives without the help of jak (e.g, inserting adjectives into short sentences in all cases). It wouldn't take much since it follows very easily from ten\/ta\/to, and internalizing it would have helped with plural. Also, a general note is I found worksheets to be very helpful overall."

While it is not too much work to just get by in this class, if you take it I highly recommend you take learning the language seriously."
