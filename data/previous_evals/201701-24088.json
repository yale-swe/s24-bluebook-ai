    "Wow, I learned to write a lot more effectively! Thank you so much for all your thorough feedback which came in a timely fashion!",
    "I had no previous knowledge of the topic before I came into the class so I learned an incredible amount. I learned how to engage with primary sources and analyze them skeptically at times. I learned how to interpret biblical text and how to use it. Overall, everything on the syllabus was new to me, so that is everything I learned.",
    "Had no knowledge of ancient studies before this and Professor Doerfler did a great job making sure that I the material was approachable and comprehendable.",
    "This was a fantastic class that I got a lot out of. Professor Doerfler guides the class discussions well, and these discussions are almost always based off of fascinating readings from the period covered. The course reading list is fairly light but also engaging, and there are a number of assigned readings that probably arent assigned anywhere else at Yale, and Professor Doerfler is very good at both clearing up questions and asking news about these texts in class as well. One important aspect of the course is the role-playing game based off of the Council of Nicea. This game takes up a number of weeks of the course - but it is well worth it. As an introvert and someone who is skeptical of these sorts of class activities usually, I was very surprised at just how enjoyable and informative the game was. The first session of the game took some adjusting to, but after a class or two, everyone settled into their assigned roles and the game went very well. Two of the grades in the course came from this game as creative role-playing assignments, and overall the course grading is quite reasonable. This course doesnt really require any sort of background in anything, but preliminary work on Rome may be helpful in some cases. Taken all together, I absolutely recommend this course to everyone, particularly those interested in religion or the ancient world."

   "comments": [
    "This course was genuinely fun, informative, and I really enjoyed doing the work! I just wish there were more people taking the class so we could have more opinions and better discussions.",
    "The most engaging part of the class was definitely the Nicene Council. It was really fun and got everyone involved in a way that was sometimes lacking in our class. I think a weakness is that sometimes I was unsure what I should be really remembering and what was just background information. It led to a lot of notes.",
    "really liked the lecture and then discussion format. Could be a seminar once a week."

    "YES! Take this class. It's not a \"gut,\" but it is fun! However, the course may be more difficult for you if you are not familiar with the Bible in either a religious or academic contest. I really, really loved learning about the early church. It's just one of those things that fascinates me. Also, professor Doerfler can answer ~any~ question, not like professors who say \"yeah, i'll get back to you on that.\" Wonderfully knowledgeable professor about material I always want to learn more. There were also baked goods at two points in the semester if your loyalty can be bought like mine.",
    "Yes.",
    "if you are interested in the material."
