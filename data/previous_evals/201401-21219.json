   "comments": [
    "I recommend those who interested in urban design, architecture, and urban politics to take this seminar. The course fosters creativity and allows room to pursue your particular interests within these fields.",
    "Great! Not too much work. Learn a lot. Field trips.",
    "Very chill seminar. Lots of opportunity to do cool projects if you're interested in infrastructure. Field trips were great. But discussion was very unfocused and at times frustrating. This is more a class about architecture, design, and representations of infrastructure--not politics. It's much more rooted in history and culture than in contemporary debates.",
    "If you're interested in the topic and you want to take the class it's not a bad class by any means, but it's not amazing either. It won't change your life. You might write a paper you really care about and you might not.",
    "Very informative class, it's a great over view of infrastructure and how it shapes society and how crucial and complex is it. There are a lot of parts of the class that apply to New Haven, so it's easy to visualize the topics on a more personal level (because were all living in New Haven) Prof.Rubin is extremely knowledgeable, very enthusiastic about infrastructure, always trying to go above and beyond to make the class more interactive and enjoyable, while still keeping it informative. Very understanding of the needs of students, willing to work with students to make the the projects and work more comprehensive. Very friendly and approachable",
    "If you are looking for an overview on the some of the less glamorous but probably most vital parts of the urban environment this is a great class. If you do it right you should be able to gain a general foundation for infrastructure while being able to dive into something you may find more interesting with the final paper\/project."
