    "Take it ONLY IF you are comfortable reading for at least four hours a week and can have interesting comments in class but if you can definitely take it",
    "ENGL 130 was a great class with a great reading list. Strengths: You really get a sense of the trajectory of the Epic tradition over-time from the Odyssey through Ulysses and Infinite Jest (in our section's case). Lots of good class discussion. Weaknesses: I thought the reading assignments (for Don Quixote and Infinite Jest, the two longest books) were unreasonable and most people in the section were unable to do all the reading in a thorough way. It would make more sense to assign fewer pages, because assignments of 150-200 pages are simply impractical considering students have 3 or 4 other classes, many with heavy reading-loads of their own. That being said, if you can keep up with the reading or are good at skimming, take the class. I wouldn't necessarily take it with Neuman who has a very particular style and a bit of an ego -- shop around. But take this class if you want a good reading-heavy seminar.",
    "This was a fantastic class. Couldn't be happier that I took it. The books would have been intimidating on my own but reading them in class was a joy.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It is a great way to get familiar with classic texts. The reading list was phenomenal; of all my classes, this was the one I did work for first. This section was especially appealing because of its inclusion of Infinite Jest, one of my favorite books from the semester. Although a lot of time is required to complete the readings, especially with the thousand page Infinite Jest, the workload beyond the reading is light. The classroom discussions were so insightful, and students brought important perspectives influenced by past experiences. Professor Neuman was a great leader of class discussions and often brought ideas of his own that he wanted to debated. This was important for me in gaining new perspectives on the books.",
    "I would recommend Engl 130 if you want to read huge books of \"world-historical importance,\" as Prof. Neuman would put it; I definitely enjoyed reading them. You have to be willing to put in the work -- there's a lot of it-- but it's definitely rewarding.",
    "This course was a great exploration of the epic genre- you read books that are important for any student to read and the class incorporates great discussion.",
    "Yes, very interesting way of looking at epics (even if its not really your thing). Be prepared for lots of reading.",
    "Epic is a challenging class because of the reading load, but it's so worthwhile. When else are you going to get acquainted with Don Quixtote and Ulysses in the same semester? Though not enough time is spent on any one work, students get a really good sense of each author's project, so you can go on to study any one of the epics in-depth in other classrooms. Take the class with Justin Neuman, if you can. He's such a fun, cool person, and his enthusiasm buoyed the class all semester."
