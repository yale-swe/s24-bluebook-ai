    "This course offered a wonderful amount of insight into film history and development, while giving me access to the language of film analysis and more skills for film analysis.",
    "how to think about and analyse film",
    "Film form, style, and theories.",
    "I learned how to analyze the choices made in the construction of a film and how that affects meaning. I learned concrete elements of film making such as mise-en-scene, types of shots, and editing techniques. Further, we explored various schools of thought throughout the history of film.",
    "I gained a cursory overview of film theory and analysis, learning critical vocabulary and technical terms in the film world. I learned how to analyze all kinds of different films from many perspectives. It has changed how I view every film I see in a different way and given me a way to analyze films in a more elevated way. A film can affect me or move me and I now have the tools to explain why. This course has given me a fascination for film and how it is made. I've also developed my writing skills by taking this course. I've been able to critique my own general writing process and find new ways to go about organizing my writing and developing an argument. In short I've gained a new filmic vocabulary, a new analytical eye, and new writing tools.",
    "Critical thinking.",
    "how to analyze films with more artistic perspective",
    "I got some very good experience writing college essays (as a first-semester freshman, this is very important) in this writing-intensive course. I also learned a lot about film history and how to watch and analyze movies.",
    "I developed strong techniques to analyze many different genres of films.",
    "I learned how to analyze and read a film as well as write cohesive, original arguments about those films. I also sharpened both my writing, reading, and public speaking skills.",
    "I learned practical approaches to the classical hollywood narrative and conventional structures of filmmaking, as well as ways in which those conventions may be bent to construct new approaches to creating movies. I also learned the correct terminologies used in filmmaking and many people and ideologies regarding the subject which influence film narrative and form today.",
    "I learned how to be critical of films by gaining an understanding of the components of the medium.",
    "I gained an appreciation for film theory in a way I hadn't before. There are so many classic films to watch, of course this class wouldn't be able to cover them all, but at the very least it provides the vocabulary and the exposure to discuss true auteurs and classic cinema.",
    "Knowledge of film analysis and techniques, as well as theory.",
    "In this course, I learned how to analyze and discover film in a new and interesting way. I learned how to love films on a deeper level, and I learned how to express my passion for this media."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I personally felt that the course was an excellent survey of film form, tradition, and history, giving voice to non-mainstream forms of film. My greatest difficulty was connecting the readings to the material we were studying, because some of the readings felt less connected to the lectures and weren't brought up in the discussion. Although I greatly enjoyed the guest lecturers (it was so cool to hear from filmmakers who were working in the present environment), I sometimes got confused when it came to the readings, because I couldn't tell what we were trying to emphasize those weeks.",
    "lecture wasn't really necessary to the course, which is probably problematic I understand importance of film cannon but the films on the syllabus could've been much cooler",
    "The lectures were engaging and interesting. The material was taught well however as this is an introductory course a lot of topics were covered in a short amount of time. There were very few assignments to base the entire grade of the class which is both a pro and a con. However, maybe a few quizzes interspersed throughout the course would be helpful in gauging students' grasp on the vocabulary and key concepts, because it is a lot to learn.",
    "Ron Gregg is an incredible professor and incredible person.",
    "maybe make lectures more interactive and show more modern films",
    "All the required viewings are western films, with the exception of the final week's screening on global cinema. Can we really not include more eastern films?",
    "Great lectures that were very informative. Time commitment to movie screenings was a weakness.",
    "I loved this course but it might have been just because I love film. If there was a more structured discussion section, meaning a way to discuss the reading\/film\/lecture all at one time it would have been better. It was also unclear as to what we should be writing on for some essays. Building on this, essays were supposed to be original and independent from lecture, readings, and section discussion so I did not see the point of going to any three of them even though I did.",
    "The great strength of the course is Professor Gregg's lectures, as they are all insightful and provide a vast knowledge of the cinema. However, some of the films screened during the course, though relevant to certain aspects of the film industry today, were frankly not great and had me wondering why he hadn't screened others instead. Also, I don't think that the sections needed to meet every week, and often they were quiet and felt unnecessary. Perhaps the TA's could be used as aids to essays and looked to for guidance rather than them teaching a section every week.",
    "I think the course places too much importance on the lecture, not allowing for study of the course outside the class. The class is great in clearly communicating material in the lecture, though.",
    "Strengths: Comprehensive and accessible material. Weaknesses: Keeping up with the 3-hour screenings on Tuesday nights can become difficult.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is that it was very engaging, especially the student discussions. I enjoyed getting to hear different perspectives. One of the weaknesses of this course was that lecture sometimes seemed repetitive and drawn out.",
    "a fair, good glass in introductory film studies. Would have enjoyed more modern repertoire in the film screenings to complement earlier selections.",
    "Excellent film selection, syllabus and teaching."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, because film is a language all of us understand instinctively but we never remember learning. Film is ubiquitous and insidious and influential, and I think that the study of film is just as important as the study of cognitive science or the study of statistics, because it profoundly affects the way we think without us realizing it. Also, it's a fun humanities\/writing credit, for those people who need it.",
    "i don't think so, too much baseless theories",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to film study. Professor Gregg is a treasure and you will enjoy his insight into the films you watch over the semester, and discussing them in section. Just do the reading, go to the screenings, and attend section and you'll have a good time.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It is an engaging course, and really interesting! You learn so much about how to analyze films and gain a whole new vocabulary for discussing films. The films we watch are great. You don't get too many chances nowadays to see films on 35mm. The workload is very manageable: a lot of readings, 3 papers (7-8pp; 7-8pp; 10-12pp) The final exam isn't that bad. Professor Gregg is great and a great lecturer. Section is great. I really enjoyed this course a lot and will never look at films the same again.",
    "Yes. A great introduction to thinking about film and cultural media in a new way.",
    "I would recommend this course because it was very interesting to me and it really inspired me to continue pursuing my aspirations toward a career in film. It is an essay driven class though, so do not be fooled if you do not want to do a lot of writing.",
    "Definitely take this if you want to know more about film, but certainly not an easy class to just watch movies.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student willing to work hard to understand film theory and dedicate time to watching all of the movies. I personally enjoyed it, but I know many people wouldn't want to devote so much time to this subject.",
    "Yes for sure!",
    "I highly recommend this course- if you were willing to put in the effort. It may seem like this will be an easy class but between the 2 lectures, 1 section, 2-3 hour screening and large amounts of reading each week, there's always something to do. That said, Professor Gregg is wonderful and you will come away from the course with an excellent understanding of the basics of film form and practice.",
    "Yes. It is something every person who has an interest in movies should take a look at.",
    "Would not recommend to a student just looking to fulfill a writing credit.",
    "Yes, I would because it is a great introduction to a subject that I find interesting and compelling.",
    "yes! movies are great."
