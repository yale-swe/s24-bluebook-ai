   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Topics are very interesting, Gusmano is extremely knowledgable.Weaknesses: Some examples and discussions were very vague.",
    "Enjoyed discussions. I would have liked a little more structure to emphasize key points",
    "This is an interesting course that covers most elements of the US political system. It's interesting to learn about the legislative process, the judicial process, etc. I expected a greater focus on health.",
    "Strength: informativeWeekness: A little bit boring, students are not actively involved in class discussion.",
    "Really great foundation of how health policy is ACTUALLY made in real terms. Complete antithesis of health policy and systems, in a great way. This is the foundation we really should have received in our first semester as policy students.",
    "This class was a great counter to Mark's 510 class. The assigned readings were really great. It was a shame that the weather resulted in several cancelled lectures.",
    "I thought the themes of the course were much more concrete and practical than those of the policy class in the fall. I liked how the two papers were on the same bill because we could apply different topics\/themes to the same thing as we learned about it throughout the semester.I would have liked to taken Finance&Delivery before taking this class, but they were both offered this semester and I didn't have room for it in my schedule. I may still take it during my second year spring, but it seems a bit too late to take the \"nuts&bolts\" class right before graduation.",
    "Strengths: great instructor, interesting materialweaknesses: It was lecture style and it may be a better seminar style with more interaction with the students; too large",
    "It's a good class that teaches you the functioning of health policy from a very realistic and rationalistic perspective. I think it really helped me understand the institutions that are responsible for setting up many health policies and how different stakeholders enter into that sphere.",
    "This course was an excellent overview of the political system and how implementing public health policy is difficult or successful in a political environment",
    "This class was great. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen things like the weather, we got gipped out of a few classes. Overall, I think the class could be a bit less Civics 101ish and a bit more actually delving into the issues. I thought the last few lectures on actual issues were by far the best. Still, the professor clearly knew his stuff and could easily relate whatever we were talking about to healthcare law using both current and historical examples.",
    "I thought the course material was very interesting, but the progression was poorly organized and structured. It was never really clear to me how all the different parts of the class connected (and part of this is just the nature of the complicated policy process), but I wish there had just been more explicit connection. I also thought that lectures would get a little muddled, and I occasionally had difficulty following the flow of the lecture. It might have been helpful for Professor Gusmano to give an overview of what he was going to talk about at the beginning of each lecture.",
    "Dynamic instructor. Too focused on political theory and not enough on policy.",
    "Very lively and interesting run through the political institutions of the U.S. as they relate to healthcare. We lost a few lectures through the weather and other clashes, which was a shame. Needs to be planned a little better next time.",
    "Great course. I wish there could be an introduction to healthcare reform at the beginning.",
    "good course overalllot to learn",
    "Excellent topics",
    "It was a great course. Very relevant to health policy students. Topics were broad, but examples were current. Always engaged. Excellent course!",
    "The course was very interesting and involved many appropriate topics students should be knowledgeable of for future reference. I do believe the course design should have involved more interactive activities to involve students. Perhaps a weekly section would have allowed students to discuss the material in greater detail.",
    "Strengths: lecture style, assignments, readingsWeakness: tardiness in giving paper feedback",
    "Perhaps really flush out specific major events more... found some of his lectures online from a different professor in the UK. Questionable authenticity?",
    "I really enjoyed this course. The subject was fascinating and well taught. I feel I have a much more thorough understanding now not only of health policy but of the political process.",
    "It was difficult to get a sense of the unifying message in this course, both collectively and within individual lectures. The lectures seemed unfocused, and the instructor would often follow rabbit trails, further leading to incoherence in the lecture.",
    "I would have liked to see more integration of the lectures and the readings. While they were clearly relevant and carefully chosen, for the most part they were glossed over in class.On a side note, considering the amount of class which was missed for various unforeseeable circumstances, I would have appreciated at least one make up session for the lost material.",
    "really enjoyed the course. gusmano very engaging."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Very knowledgable, sometimes the examples Gusmano used were too vague. I'd take another class with this professor.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0great. energetic and interesting to listen to",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr Gusmano is clearly an extremely smart professor who knows his subject very well. However, I felt that he lacks experience in effective teaching and I hope that he can use our feedback to improve his style so that he can do a better job at engaging his audience.First of all, he has a hard time staying focused on his subject, which in turn makes it difficult for us to keep focused on what he's saying. This is because his powerpoint slides do not provide a backbone (too bare) and whilst he starts on point, he loses himself in a myriad of stories and then 90 minutes later he's still on the same slide - and 70% of the class has lost his train of thought. My advice would be to have more detailed powerpoint slides and to make an effort to keep on topic, so that we can focus on what he's saying better.Secondly, setting the final exam needed 3 explanatory emails because noone knew what to do. Again, a lack of focus from his part. My advice: he should say exactly what he wants on the final (explicit instructions), so again we know what to do.Finally, we hardly saw him in the first month because he was snowed in or was 1 hour late because there was traffic. That is problematic when he has 50 students waiting for him who have all paid thousands of dollars to take this course. My advice: he should book a hotel room in New Haven for the night prior to the 1 day he teaches at Yale.Otherwise, he seems very nice and I do hope he will take some of these points into consideration so that the quality of teaching improves!",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Interesting and informative. Skip some classes this semester.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He was fantastic and very obviously cares about his students. He is very realistic with the type of work he assigns and his expectations of his students. I would suggest very small, sporadic quizzes that are worth very little if anything, just to create incentive to keep up on readings.YSPH would be extremely lucky if Professor Gusmano would come on staff full time.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Gusmano was a great lecturer. His knowledge of political science and health policy is impressive.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0I thought Dr. Gusmano was a very engaging instructor. He could be more prompt on posting readings on Classes v2 and it would have helped if he posted the PowerPoint slides before class. I liked his teaching style and think I understood the material better than the policy class in the fall, but I still feel like we bounced around a little bit during class. I realize it is difficult when many of the students were political science majors in undergrad, but sometimes I totally felt out of the loop when names of political players or Supreme Court justices were dropped or when historical political events\/stakeholders were mentioned and I was clueless. Getting the first paper back with comments (like we got in the second) would have been helpful, as well, because my email evaluation didn't have many details.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Very knowledgeable and funny",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Gusmano is a very animated yet realistic professor. He teaches a lot from experience and knowledge.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He was willing to help students when they were in trouble with respect to completing the assignments.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano was an excellent professor and a breath of fresh air among YSPH faculty. He was lively, engaging and thoughtful.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Great! One of the best Profs I've had here. Really liked the way he ran class, really liked his style as a lecturer and really liked the assignments he gave us. Just let us know whats up with grading and why we aren't getting the grades back in a timely manner.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano is great. He's really energetic, and wants his students to engage in the material. My only problem was that he tended to go off on tangents that (at least to me) never really seemed to come back to the topic at hand. I also wish he had returned our papers in a more timely manner with more specific comments. I'm also not entirely clear how \"participation\" factored into our grade when he didn't give us a lot of opportunities to participate, and I don't know if he learned everyone's names.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dynamic, keeps your attention. A welcome addition to EPH",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Every engaging instructor, clear in what he was trying to say, and with just the right level of class discussion. Brought the material to life with interesting asides and examples. Clearly knowledgeable not only about his subject but also how it related to other subjects.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Great lecturer with stories that keep you interested in and help you remember the material",

    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano was very enthusiastic and led a very interesting weekly lecture. I do believe he could have been more timely with delivering responses and grades for his assignments though.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Strong lecturer. Good contextual basis.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Engaging lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Michael Gusmano was a great teacher. His lectures were energetic and interesting. My one suggestion would be that there was not a need to spend an entire class going over what the assignment was for Paper 1. I was very disappointed to sit through that class hoping that we would get to the day's topic and instead spend the whole time discussing how to write the paper.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He was extremely knowledgeable and a dynamic lecturer.Regarding feedback, if solicited, he was extremely helpful, however, feedback on the assignments was minimal.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0really good lecturer. i did think the class started to decrease in quality as the semester went on though."

    "I would recommend this course to another student because it was much more practical than the fall policy class. Although some of the specific examples\/discussions were beyond me given my lack of poitical science background, the set up of having the 2 papers allows you to focus on a bill you are most interested in and the take home cumulative final is a good tool to get you to understand how all of the themes fit together.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "It's a good class to take. And for a change a class that was required was up to the standards of what graduate school students should expect.",
    "The assignments were somewhat tough, but I was able to learn a lot throughout the process of completion.",
    "Highly recommended. I think the course will only be better next year if Prof. Gusmano is still teaching it.",
    "It's a survey of the American political system and how it relates to politics. There's a lot of stuff on health reform, which is kind of interesting. I thought Professor Gusmano was great though I'm not entirely sure how he expected us to participate in a lecture format.",
    "Great introduction to the US political institutions and how they relate to healthcare.",
    "Great introduction to American policymaking for anyone coming from a health care background",
    "Very applicable",
    "I would say this course provides a great overview of health politics. It has a definite lean towards government structure and functioning. It is a great course and would recommend it to others.",
    "Overview of the history of federal health politics and policy",
    "Good context and background. Worth taking.",
    "Gusmano is very knowledgeable and experienced and gives great lectures. It is an interesting and enjoyable course.",
    "This course is designed to cover a great breadth of health policy topics, but is only mildly successful at accomplishing this task. It does touch on some important points, but these points run the risk of being lost in a cacophony of mixed messages and side stories.",
    "This course was an overview of how policy in made in America with an emphasis on understanding the political environment it is happening in. I thoroughly enjoyed this class and would recommend it to anyone interested in domestic policy or the politics of the country.",
    "really great."
