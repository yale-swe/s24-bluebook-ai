    "Yes! Billings is the best! He's a tough grader, though. But your grade is the worth the sacrifice to learn from him.",
    "Spring DS lit picks up where we left off in the fall, and adds a whole array of interesting prose works to the mix. Paradise Lost was rewarding to read as the continuation of the epic tradition, Don Quxiote and War and Peace were almost impossible to finish (read during the breaks! read during the breaks! I repeat, read during the breaks!) but so rewarding to read. Professor Billings in particular was an amazing professor for the course. He is brilliant in the few comments he makes on each text at the end of the class, and allows students to run the section for the most part. He is a tough grader for essays, but trust me, if you allow his high standards to help improve your writing, this will be one of the most rewarding DS sections you'll ever have. He made DS worth it for me this Spring!",
    "I would definitely recommend DS Lit for exactly what it claims to do - get you to read a lot of important books in a short amount of time, with a lot of interested and intelligent other people.",
    "The second semester lit syllabus is phenomenal--from Cervantes and Milton to Proust and Woolf, everything we read feels urgent and relevant. Lectures were generally good, and they often offered extremely insightful perspectives. Professor BIllings' class is really a Yale seminar at its finest. He's incredibly intelligent, but also takes care to make himself approachable. Our seminar felt warm and close, but discussions were also extremely challenging. He has individual meetings with each student before each paper is due, to discuss theses and flesh out ideas. He also leads some of the best discussions I've had at Yale, and is careful to let students do the vast majority of the speaking. And when he does speak, it's often to share a thought-provoking insight. I learned so much in his class about the works we read, reading and writing, literature in general, and, for that matter, education in general. His class was the most rewarding class I've taken so far, and the most enjoyable.",
    "By now, you know if DS is for you. If it is, dive right in. Second semester is even more rewarding than the first. If you're lucky enough to have Billings, you're in for one heck of a ride. He will expect a lot out of you, but rest assured, you can expect a whole lot out of this semester.",
    "A lit of reading but the majority very enjoyable. Take the class!!!",
    "Great introduction\/overview of Western literature from Petrarch\/Don Quixote to Virginia Woolf. Hard to go in depth with the novels and a lot of work, but absolutely worth it. I loved it.",
    "If thousands of pages of novels sounds as enjoyable as it is daunting, then DS Literature is for you. If you would be the sort to read the Sparknotes for Don Quixote, Paradise Lost, or War and Peace, then you would do yourself a favor by trying a less rigorous offering.",
    "This was the best class I've taken so far at Yale. We read a series of incredible books, and Professor Billings is an absolutely amazing teacher and brilliant mind. Take it.",
    "It's a lot of reading, because you won't want to miss any word, but the payoff in section (and life, of course) is greater than in any other course. This class teaches you to be a skeptical reader who roots for the text as she roots thoroughly through it."
