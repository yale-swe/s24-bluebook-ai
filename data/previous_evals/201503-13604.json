    "definitely take if offered again, one of the best classes.",
    "This is the best class at Yale. I had fun in class each week, like actually really enjoyed sitting in class. The reading list is amazing, Professor Radin is a wonderful teacher, and she picks genuine classmates, so you won't end up with a room of people you don't like. If you are lucky enough to get a seat in this course you would be absolutely crazy not to take it.",
    "More-or-less this is a course on science fiction and their integral technologies. Prof Radin gave us a lot of room to navigate and most (if not all) avenues of discussion were fully heard. I would highly recommend.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in science, medicine, bioethics, or science fiction! This course provides students with an opportunity to explore relevant questions about science, technology, and biomedicine in the context of both historical and present day fiction and nonfiction. The material is interesting in of itself, but Professor Radin engages the material in such a way so as to make class even more engaging and exciting.",
    "Take this with Prof. Radin. You read really interesting books and articles, and discuss fascinating topics.",
    "You watch science fiction films, read science fiction books, think about them in relation to your own world, and then have your mind blown a few times. It's pretty great. I'd do it again if I could.",
    "Definitely take this course! There is a good amount of reading, but it is truly fun! We read science fiction novels most weeks, but others had short stories or films. The work load is very manageable, as there was only a reading response each week and a final paper. The discussion in the seminar, though, was what made it truly remarkable. There was never an awkward pause or a need for Professor Radin to move the discussion along because the topics and readings were truly so interesting that every person had something to add.",
    "Reasonable workload (reading responses encourage you to not slack off on all readings, but are entirely doable) and great discussions led by Prof Radin. Take it!",
    "Definitely would recommend. Take it!",
    "A broad discussion of past and present notions of what the future of technology and biomedicine might look like. Primary literature consisted of science fiction (including Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park)",
    "This class was awesome! The content of the course, the readings, the discussion and the professor were all amazing and intellectually stimulating. I think this class definitely changed my views on many aspects of biomedicine. This class was an mind-opening experience. The readings were very good and super interesting. The class discussions were engaging and eye-opening. I strongly recommend this seminar. I can't really see any negative points."
