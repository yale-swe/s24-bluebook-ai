   "comments": [
    "A better understanding of the role of frictions in macroeconomics and numerous techniques used in macroeconomics and other fields of economics.",
    "Second half of the first-year Ph.D. macroeconomics sequence. Much more applied than the first half, which is nice since you get to see all of your hard work in the first half come to life. Also heavily on MATLAB coding, which is useful prep for research. Perhaps the most valuable thing learned in this class was not necessarily the models themselves, but how to carefully choose (and break!) assumptions to create a model. This class helped me realize the sheer amount of thought that goes into creating (seemingly simple) models that represent the world in some way.",
    "Interpreting and manipulating macro models, several important mathematical tools and economics' concepts",
    "investment labor market monetary econ",
    "The course covered a vast amount of literature and tools and some in depth as well. It was great in terms of introducing tools and showing their application.",
    "Skills that have to do with optimization techniques basically.",
    "Knowledge: basic idea behind monetary economics (why money exists, how to choose an optimal monetary policy, etc.)",
    "Theories of investment and money. All about HJBs.",
    "Macro methods (Ito's lemma, diffusions, arrival processes), investment theory, labor markets, monetary policy",
    "Learned a lot about models and tools in macro. Coding assignments were very useful."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course helped me a lot. I learned a lot of intuition of how the models are built.",
    "The course was excellent all aroung.",
    "Exams covered a small amount of material and the long question tested understanding of 2 small macroeconomic facts and then the rest of the question was predicated on performing algebraic manipulations. I found that the final left a lot on the table in terms of evaluating our true understanding of the material.",
    "Lecture notes were highly appreciated, and lectures engaging. Weekly problem sets, while sometimes long, really helped cement the material. No complaints (although someone should come to exterminate the flying ants in the classroom).",
    "The course is great",
    "great presentation and PSs but could have left out some material",
    "Strength: It is a course in which you can learn many new tools, used in Macroeconomics. Weakness: The weakness is that the focus sometimes is too much on the tools.",
    "Slower pace and reminders of the bigger picture at beginning of each lecture would be helpful.",
    "Strength: The course covers monetary economics in a comprehensive manner, including detailed derivation of important concepts, lists of empirical strategies linked to theories learned, etc.",
    "It is a very good class. The pace increased in the last few weeks, which made it much harder to follow.",
    "Strength: well-organized, notes were clear Weakness: The final exam seemed like it had a typo on it (no one I talked to could get x* in 2d!)",
    "Clear, helpful, interesting lectures, a lot of material but well explained, good coverage of applications to policy\/relevance beyond the theory, but more of that could always be useful. Fair problem sets and exams. Great class, convinced me to do Macro.",
    "Well-organized with clear lecture slides. Maybe make more problem sets three slightly shorter questions as opposed to two long questions. This way, we'll have practice with more topics."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. The lectures are really useful to understand the material",
    "I would recommend it to other economics graduate students, but they don't really have a choice of whether to take it or not!",
    "In undergrad, you learn about models, and you maybe touch on their assumptions. In this class, you learn more models, but more importantly, you start understanding how to carefully choose (and break!) assumptions to fit these models to your research questions. At first, I found it difficult to tease out the economic insights from these technically involved models. But the \"ah-ha\" moment makes the challenge worth it.",
    "Sure, the course teaches really important tools for the profession",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes I would recommend it, because it helps students to learn the techniques used in modern Macroeconomics.",
    "Yes",
    "PhD students in economics should take this course, whether or not they major in macroeconomics. Reasoning behind development of models as well as models themselves is worth learning.",
    "Required so yes.",
    "Yes, any economist should know something about monetary policy.",
    "Yes. Lots of useful info about models and tools in macro. Helps further develop good skills like defining a model\/equilibrium and programming."
