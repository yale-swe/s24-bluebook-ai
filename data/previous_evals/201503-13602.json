    "This class goes through the progression of science from around the 16th century to the 20th century. It is interesting material, but is not taught in a fitting way. I was personally very bored in the class every day, but if this is your passion, you will probably find it interesting.",
    "As a science major, this was the perfect class to fulfill my humanities credit. Not having to write a paper was very appealing, as well as learning about the historical context of many things taught in STEM courses. You should definitely take this course if you want a survey of history of science.",
    "Lecture material is easy but readings are dense. You learn a lot. Pretty interesting",
    "Take it only if 1) you need a HU credit, and 2) you're actually interested in science.",
    "I took this class as it's out of my pathway... not a terribly difficult one but I wasn't inherently interested in the material which made it a little harder. If you're interested in the history of science, etc. it's a good class.",
    "A good overview of the history of science. Only problem is I have no idea what my grade is; 20% section, 30% midterm, 50% final. Don't know how tough the final was graded, if the class is curved, etc.",
    "No. There are much better courses in HSHM.",
    "The class is interesting but can get very technical, which is difficult if you do not have a strong science background. In the end, you do not need to understand the science in detail for exams, but it can still be frustrating throughout the course. The workload is light and there is only a midterm and final, so if you're looking for a 5th class, this might be a good choice."
