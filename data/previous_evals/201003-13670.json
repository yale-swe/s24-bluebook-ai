   "comments": [
    "It's one of the best classes I have taken in MCDB at Yale, and one of the only small discussion-based classes in biology that are available at Yale. For shy students, the class discussion part may be intimidating, and the professors will make you talk even if you don't too. However, if you want to improve or can just make yourself talk, then Landmark is a great experience. Where else can you read crucial papers in biology while listening to the professors tell stories about how the research was done next door?",
    "This class is a great way to get your upper level bio class for MCDB. At this point, you should have enough background to be able to read papers well and develop your skills at reading science papers. Mooseker and Rosenbaum pick good papers. The professors are very much interested in you and your development as scientists.It's also pretty painless... the work is reading about two papers a week and participating in class. Everyone in the class presents for one or two weeks.",
    "Definitely Recommend. Such a better experience than any pure lecture-based class could offer.",
    "This class teaches you how to think. It really cemented a passion for research in me. It's also a fantastic opportunity to take a small science class and get to know fellow science students and professors really well.",
    "If you are a senior MCDB major, TAKE THIS CLASS. By this point you will be used to the huge lecture classes and passive learning. This seminar can be initially intimidating, but you will find yourself getting more and more comfortable contributing, which I found very valuable (as a shy person, I was happy to find myself growing more comfortable talking in class). There is not much weekly work: just intensive reading of 1-3 scientific papers. HOWEVER, you NEED to do the reading for this class, and do it thoroughly. It becomes obvious when you haven't done it, and your grade is entirely dependent on your participation. If you are interested at all in scientific research, this seminar is a great way to engage in scientific discussion of papers: how people drew conclusions, why they did what they did, what they did wrong. It's also fun reading about historic discoveries that we take for granted in textbooks. You will also find it refreshing to actually get to know the people in your seminar.",
    "I highly recommend Landmark Papers for seniors who are looking for a seminar in the sciences. Itis a great opportunity to finally use vocabulary you learned in the past three years in conversation. Even though the class is two hours long, it actually passes by quickly because we go into the papers with great depth. Be prepared to learn more about the subjects we cover in these papers than you've ever learned before, and really understand them.",
    "Yes. It's a good class, and you'll get a better appreciation for experiments and papers. Helps you question every detail of the methods and think more critically about the data. Pretty low stress and very good.",
    "Landmark Papers is a seminar-style biology class in which students read one or two classic and foundational biology papers and then discuss them. Each week, two students present background information and facilitate the discussion. No written work or tests are required. I found the class quite worthwhile and less stressful than a standard memorization and test heavy course, and I appreciated an emphasis on methods and logic. A thorough reading of the papers andcommand of the at times arcane methodology may be required. A participant probably should enjoy speaking about science and answering questions in a group setting.",
    "This was a valuable class for any science student; it is a valuable skill to assess and question the experimental procedure, interpretation of results, and writing style. A deceptively difficult class - reading the papers to prepare is no walk in the park.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. There's really none other like it at Yale, and the rather personal setting allows you to be able to contribute to the group's discussion as well as get to know the professors."
