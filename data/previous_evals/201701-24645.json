   "comments": [
    "This course provides a constant exercise in critically examining popular culture objects within historical and social context. It emphasizes critical thinking, observation, historicization, writing--all through the fascinating (and terrifying) lens of the US War on Terror. An incredible look into the way contemporary US culture functions.",
    "Gained skills in summarizing authors writing about challenging theory and practical applications of that theory, learned about cultural reading, how to look at culture and the work that does in this case in the War on Terror. Learned a lot about the ways the WOT is embedded in everyday life.",
    "I learned how to develop my critical thinking skills, and how pervasive the war and terror is on our culture. From language to imagery I was exposed to influences I never considered before",
    "I knew just generally that 9\/11 affected American culture deeply, but it wasn't until this class that I realized the incredible depth of that influence. As someone who loves cultural studies, it was really amazing to approach each week with new objects\/films\/artifacts to analyze -- it was almost like a workshop in analysis.",
    "By taking this course, I learned about portrayals of the War on Terror in popular culture as well as the influence the war on terror has had on popular culture. While the readings were at times quite dense, the class helped me feel more comfortable parsing through complicated texts, such as Judith Butlers writings. The class was so interesting, and Najwa was so great in helping us work through the different concepts and develop our critical thinking. I definitely developed more analytic skills and also was challenged to constantly think and attack theory head on. We did not accept thoughts presented in readings as fact but rather worked through them to come to our own conclusions. Najwa also asked that we choose our own topics for our assignments (although she always helped if we needed guidance), which made me feel even more engaged and dedicated as I had to think of and explore topics of my own choosing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was so fantastic! Really, no weaknesses.",
    "I think the course did an awesome job of challenging the students in the class, I think the course made the students think across cultural objects and theory in an interesting way. I think one weakness is that sometimes the discussion in the class lagged, but I think that could easily be solved by adding more students to the class. There should have been 16 i think instead of 12 that would have made the course a bit more dynamic.",
    "I really enjoyed analyzing the cultural objects and considering how those fit in the themes of the class. No real weaknesses",
    "The one area this course could improve in is maybe incorporating some more foundational theoretical texts--at least excerpts or like a powerpoint version of some of the foundational ideas that will be useful to this field of study: cultural analysis, gender studies, masculinity, biopower\/necropolitics. It felt like we were reading a lot of examples of the kind of work we ourselves would be producing, but not a lot of the foundational texts themselves.",
    "The course worked really well as a seminar as it gave us time to discuss the readings in depth and work through questions or even challenge theories at times. The readings themselves were extremely interesting, were varied, and all felt very relevant. The theme of the course was quite broad so it was a bit difficult yet exciting to try to tackle everything, especially since every aspect of the course was so engaging. Because the field is newer, we were studying current day culture or the culture of the past two decades, we had limited scholarship to work with, although everything we discussed was interesting. We in general had a good balance of theory and example cultural analysis essays for the class. Najwa also offered additional background theory readings."

    "Take this course! Najwa is a fantastic instructor, and this course is an incredibly relevant and important one. It teaches you to look critically at the contemporary moment with an eye towards history and context, and you begin to understand *just how much* our current society is structured by the war on terror.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I think for American Studies majors it is really interesting, but I think that it transcends just the major. The WOT is so so a part of the landscape that we live in and it touches all things.",
    "Yes! This is an incredibly interesting topic and Najwa does a great job facilitating discussion. The content was new and relevant to my every day life, and I really enjoyed learning about something that continues to unfold in front of our eyes",
    "I would highly recommend this course! You will learn so much about the world post 9\/11, plus Najwa is so amazingly knowledgeable about all things relating to post-9\/11 American pop culture, which is great for the academic work but also really fun to just chat about.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The course material is fascinating and also not necessarily something you would typically spend an entire semester exploring in other cultural studies classes. Najwa was such an incredible teacher. She was genuinely interested in everyones comments during class discussions and encourage all students to find what interested them most within the broad course material. I looked forward to class every week."
