   "comments": [
    "Of course it's a lab you're probably only taking because you're premed. But, that being said, it's honestly a really great lab, albeit a little repetitive at times.",
    "Yes. I mean, it doesn't really matter, because you're going to take it for your major, but it's a great course. Very chill, and you learn useful, cool material like Diels-ALder reactions and Friedel-Crafts acylations.",
    "Yes definitely. This is a great lab course that is taught well and has a good amount of work but is doable.",
    "Not too bad at all. It is recommended.",
    "It's a fun class, although I definitely don't think I would have taken it had it not been for needing it for my major. I'm glad I did though-second semester really cements some of the techniques learned first semester, and is a useful overview. I like working in chemistry!",
    "Yes",
    "It is not bad at all. However, I would not take it unless you have to take it.",
    "Continuation of Orgo Lab I with a couple new techniques (most notably NMR)",
    "As a continuation of first semester orgo lab, it's run the same way, very laid back, bad pop music playing in the background, so organized in comparison to the 230 lecture, etc. There's a lot more reflux in this semester than last, so there's more free time which is nice. You get a hang of what is expected in the post-labs, so the workload is not too bad and points won't be taken off for silly things. One of the better chemistry labs, I think, and one of my favorite classes here so far. DiMeglio is one of the most charming professors in the chemistry department, and paired with a good TA, it's a relatively painless lab (but I enjoy orgo lab more than other science labs, so biased) You don't necessarily learn any new techniques, so most of the time it's individual work at your own pace kind of stuff. You do learn NMR at the end of the year. Great lab and probably required if you're taking it.",
    "If you're considering this class, it's probably because you have to take it, but that's definitely not a bad thing! CHEM 223 was definitely the most fun lab I've ever taken, and it was one of my favorite courses this semester. Expect weekly pre-lab assignments, 2 full lab reports, and a handful of other shorter post-lab assignments. There is no final practical exam, just a written test that has a lot of mechanisms and such.",
    "I love this lab. I would definitely recommend it. It is a great way to learn and understand important reactions in organic chemistry while enjoying experiments.",
    "You're probably taking this because you have to, but this course is pretty solid. The unfortunate thing with labs is that your experience is entirely dependent on TAs (i.e. if your TA is a super hard grader or a fair grader). But again unfortunately you can't choose your TA. If you put in the effort, it will pay off. I also thought that 223's exam was better than 222's, but that may be because I knew more organic chemistry for 223's exam.",
    "I had a pretty good experience. If you end up with a good TA, this class ends up being quite manageable and sometimes enjoyable. The workload isn't horrible, and it's straightforward after taking 222",
    "Most people don't take lab unless they have to because it is a huge time commitment. Orgo lab is very relaxed and enjoyable. Often you can get out early and assignments are shorter than for gen chem.",
    "def take it",
    "This was a good course. It's cool to apply what you learned first semester to do more complex labs, and they also end up taking less time than last semester.",
    "Good course - similar in structure to 222L, though I would say that I found 223L to be more relaxing and enjoyable during experimentation.",
    "Definitely take this lab.",
    "I would recommend this course as it is one of the best labs I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend that you take this class if you are taking Orgo along with it. It really helps strengthen some of the principles learned in class, and also helps you understand how to use the machines they teach at the end of Orgo class.",
    "Chem 223L is like a slightly more relaxed version of the first semester lab. If you thought first semester was fine, then you'll have no trouble with this course. There's only a few full write-ups (maybe 3?) and most of the labs (if not all) are just straight-up synthesis experiments. I dug the class overall, you shouldn't dread taking it at all! It's pretty fun.",
    "If you're on the pre-med track, you'll probably have to take this anyway. The course was conducted pretty well, again much better than General Chemistry lab courses. However, I felt grading was arbitrary and unduly harsh in many cases (maybe it was my particular TA but I've heard horror stories from others with different TAs). Points would be taken off just for not using a key word in a sentence even though the same information was being conveyed. In many ways, it seemed as if they were just looking for something, anything to take off. On the bright side, the experiments were interesting and the chemistry wasn't too difficult, although the final was a bit tricky. The TAs and Prof. DiMeglio were helpful as always. It was just difficult when it came to grading: they seemed much harsher than first semester Orgo lab.",
    "CHEM 223L is the second semester of organic lab you'll need to take with the second half of organic lecture. I absolutely recommend it. It's not a lot of work, but it's a lot of fun and cool.",
    "Take this course if it is required for your major. However, if you are looking to learn more techniques and to think about problems experimentally, then you should definitely work in an actual research lab.",
    "It's a decent lab.",
    "You're going to take it because this means you're taking orgo II. I enjoyed this semester's lab even better than the last semester! Experiments aren't too complicated, though the final exam is unnecessarily hard.",
    "Very similar to first semester of orgo lab. You should already know what to expect when you go it (and the labs go faster now that you know what's going on).",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The course is much more relaxed than orgo 1 lab and labs usually end an hour and a half early.",
    "Chem 223 is a good lab! You get to synthesize really cool things and the teaching fellows make the lab great. Everything you need to know is in Professor DiMeglio's lan handbook and if you come prepared to lab (having read the appropriate pages in the handbook so that you know what you're doing,) you can get out pretty quickly.",
    "Definitely one of the best labs at Yale. A great continuation of first semester with an equivalent amount of work.",
    "I would highly recommend it to another student. But most people taking the course are in it because they have to be.. But it's still a great course.",
    "This was a good class. Often I would look forward to Orgo lab because it gave me a chance to talk to friends while waiting for reactions to reflux. The lab reports aren't very time consuming and graded fairly (Patrick is a great TA!). Overall a good class that I would recommend to others.",
    "Overall, it is very similar to the Orgo I lab but with a lot of reflux. It isn't a lab for slackers but nor is it a lab that is super difficult. The lab reports vary from week to week so some days one may have to do a full lab report which takes hours or just have to write a summary\/conclusion for the lab results which doesn't take nearly as long. So if one is responsible enough and willing to work, I think the class is more than manageable.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have an interest in a more advanced understanding of organic synthesis or if you have to take it.",
    "as relaxed an environment as you can get for an orgo lab. you learn cool techniques and might even have fun doing it.",
    "Organic Chemistry Lab 2 is a very strong lab course (probably the best at Yale that I have taken so far) and professor DiMeglio is an extremely good professor. If you are thinking of taking this lab course you probably have to for some requirement, but be assured that it is not that painful.",
    "I would recommend taking Orgo II lab. It is not stressful at all. Your grade will ultimately probably hinge on how well you do on the checkout exam.",
    "A great organic chemistry lab class that allows students to apply and practice techniques learned in CHEM 222L.",
    "If you liked CHEM 222L, you will like CHEM 223L. It pretty much uses the same skills, just the students are expected to use them more as tools during synthesis labs.",
    "This class requires knowledge from the organic chemistry lectures, and sometimes the grading is kind of harsh.",
    "Chemistry 223L is similar to what one would experience during first semester organic chemistry; the similar layout, in terms of experimental planning and report writing, is very convenient for helping students focus on what information is important. However, it is very important that a student retain from first semester a well-developed idea of how to use certain techniques such as distillation, FTIR, and TLC; this familiarity is crucial for success in these experiments. Furthermore, there is a greater focus on being able to find applications for some of the synthesized product and to find reasonable ways to improve experimental protocol. If a student invests the necessary amount of time and energy into these experiments and focuses on understanding concepts throughout the semester, then he or she can do well.",
    "Like first semester orgo lab, but more chill since you already know the basics of what to do. The concepts are harder, as expected, but that also means you get to perform more interesting experiments.",
    "Yup. It's much better than orgo I lab because you actually know what's going on. The material is relevant and syncs up with the concepts you're learning with Phillips. The chemistry is more interesting. The work isn't significantly harder. The grading can sometimes be picky and the lab reports can seem rather formulaic, but at the end of the day you learn a lot from the pre-lab lectures and from studying for the final. This is a very chill lab and you will bond with your peers and your TA in a way that you can appreciate.",
    "Definitely! This course changed my entire perspective on lab courses. While most labs are taxing and a pain to attend, this course proved the opposite. Dimeglio makes sure you learn about procedures and equipment thoroughly, all in a relaxed and conducive environment. Take it!",
    "Chemistry 223L is the second half of organic chemistry lab. It's structured pretty identically to the first half -- ten experiments, each requiring an experimental plan, with occasional post-lab assignments and lab reports -- except the material is more focused on making practical compounds like anthraquinone and peach oil.",
    "Lab 223L feel much more like preparation for future research work than 222L. You feel a larger sense of freedom in running experiments and the greater emphasis on explaining why you got a certain yield or purity rather than getting penalized for not having a high yield and pure product made this lab more of a learning experience rather than a perfection contest. All in all, this lab was much funner than 222L even if the grading did seem a bit nit-picky from time to time.",
    "223 is pretty fun, much better than 222. Don't let first semester turn you off."
