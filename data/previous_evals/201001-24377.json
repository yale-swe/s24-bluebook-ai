    "NO NO NO NO NO",
    "He is not a very engaging lecturer, and it takes a little while before you can completely understand him. Once in a while, he will catch you off guard and say something absolutely hilarious. Take the class if you need to.",
    "definitely take it if u r an econ major or if u are interested in math. it is quite a practical an insightful course",
    "No, no, no. If you have to take it, take it in the fall.",
    "Why would you take this unless you had to.",
    "This is a great course. Could be more enjoyable, but definitely be consciencious in keeping up with the materials.",
    "Never. Unfortunately, most folks can't choose whether or not to take it. Expect lectures that can't be understood. I had to teach myself the material. They don't have a category to describe how poor this class is.",
    "Taking statistics before you take this class will make it much easier. Don't take this class as an elective, either. Econometrics is a useful tool, but it is very boring.",
    "If you're planning on majoring in economics you'll have to take this course. That said, it's definitely a very useful subject to know for anyone interested in economics.",
    "I recommend this class to any Econ major",
    "Run like the plague! Actually, don't run, do what I did: enroll, stop going to lecture and section, and coast by on the generous curve. The slides are so clear you won't have to put in any effort except the weekly problem sets. You're not going to take this unless you have to, so you might as well make the most of it!",
    "Yes take it you are a major. You have to. Also take the next course in the series!",
    "Required for econ major. Also learn some important stat and econ concepts. However, you will soon learn that lecture attendance is really not helpful but section attendance is VERY helpful!",
    "Take it, but take it with a different professor, unless you do not mind teaching it to yourself or relying on the textbook.",
    "Do NOT take it with Taisuke Otsu, unless youcan be diligent with the textbook on your own. If you've taken stats before, this shouldn't be difficult at all. If not, you have to really be sure you learn it on your own (and don't waste time going to lecture, because you won't learn anything.) Spend that time learning the material.",
    "Unless you have to, do not take this course.",
    "Only take it if you need it for your major. otherwise, prepared to be very bored in class, every single time. Midterm was awful, final was a lot more fair.",
    "Only take it if you absolutely have to for the Econ major.",
    "Fairly easy class if you are math inclined and do the little work there is. The exams are a complete joke if you study for them and so are the psets. Professor Otsu was awful, do not take this class with him. Because of the poor teaching only about 20% of enrolled students actually attended lecture. The first book on basic statistics was very bad but the book on actual regression was so much better.",
    "Econometrics is not such a fabulous course, as it is currently constructed. It does not go in depth enough. We neither understand the mathematical foundations for our activities or the practical applications of it. This, then, boils it down to a lot of memorization unless you do that work on your own (and lets be serious, most of these students are not). But the real pity is that when taught at this level, the entire semester can be boiled down to a weekend workshop. Indeed, I ran exactly such a workshop for three of my friends.",
    "If you are an econ major, you don't have an option. Its not as bad as it sounds.Midterm and final are straightforward and based on problem sets. But be prepared to teach the material yourself, class becomes a bore so there is temptation to miss it, if you do miss class keep up reading the books otherwise you'll find the midterm around the corner and you know nothing! Practice practice psets and book questions.Professor Tai has some jokes here and there.",
    "The material covered is extremely simple. Take it to get an econometrics requirement out of the way. Don't expect interesting lectures though.",
    "If you're not an Econ major it's not at all worth your time. You also might be better off taking it from a different professor because Otsu doesn't really speak English well enough for lectures to be worth attending.",
    "Not very interesting and hard to follow. I don't recommend this class",
    "Pretty straightforward econometrics class. not too difficult; professor was smart",
    "It's a lot of stats the first half, which is great. Then the regression part gets a little dense. Take it if you have to as an econ major.",
    "Econ 131 is by far the easiest of the 6 econ core prereqs. The professor's notes are clear enough that you barely need to go to lecture. The tests are very fair, even a bit on the easy side, but somehow the curve is really nice. Admittedly, the material can be boring as you learn it, but its pretty useful and interesting toward the end. I think the biggest reason people hate econometrics is that they aren't willing to put in the effort\/they psych themselves out. Take it with Otsu if you can, you won't regret it.",
    "i would recommend it, just make sure you choose a good ta, lectures arent that interesting, but problem sets are doable, exams arent too difficult, not too much work, good books, my only complaint is that at times it felt that what taught in class was very different\/had nothing to do with the psets",
    "Take it if you have to, but try to take it with a different professor if you can.",
    "i guess i can do the econometrics now",
    "You're probably taking this as a prerequisite - and it's not too bad as prerequisites go. The class gives you the necessary statistics background, so don't worry about going in without much prior knowledge. Some concepts are a little tough to grasp, but pretty rewarding once you get them. Unlike a lot of other prereqs, this one actually feels pretty geared to the real world. In fact, might recommend just because it's really interesting material to know.Otsu's lectures are actually fairly good, although no one really went to them, as you can get most of the material out of the textbook. But if you can deal with mathy lectures it's worth going to experience his antics. He is pretty entertaining at times.",
    "from what i can tell you learn more than in intro stats",
    "This is a course that provides the basic concepts in statistics, probability theory, and econometrics. You do not learn any subject well, although you learn enough to get by in the future. The course is not taught too well, however, and is infamously boring.Take this course if you want to fill your econ major requirement and if you don't plan on getting too involved in econometrics. If you feel you need more, you could take the second course which is all about econometrics. Or you could take the stat\/prob course, then econometrics course combination.",
    "A pretty straightforward class, considering that the first half is just basic probability and statistics. You learn how to use STATA in the problem sets and through special sections, which is very useful. The class seems to be designed in a way to make it easy to skip lectures: everything is uploaded online, and the professor simply tries to read what is on the already uploaded slides. The midterms and final were fair and rather easy.",
    "Very organized and well taught class. The professor is a a good lecturer and very helpful, the textbooks are very good, the TAs are helpful and the material isn't that hard.",
    "I would only take this course with this professor if you have to. I've heard of better professors who teach econometrics, so wait to take it with them.",
    "No, avoid taking econometrics if possible. People says it's bad -- it really is. The topic material is really interesting, but it's often hard to digest and very confusing.",
    "Yes.",
    "Really enjoyed Economics 131 and I found the course very interesting. The material is easy, and the exam and midterm are very straightforward. You learn some cool stuff in the class, and it has made me look forward to Econometrics II.",
    "This is not as bad as it is made out to be, as long as you do the problem sets yourself. Stay on top of the reading and go to class and you'll be fine.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in learning about statistics and econometrics. It is a very useful and interesting course.",
    "First half of the course is statistics, the second half is metrics. Take it if you need the econ requirement, but if you are just looking to learn statistics take intro stats.",
    "If you can avoid this, avoid it. Sign up for like classesv2 and grab the lecture notes though. They're pretty useful, but the problem sets, the lectures, and the tests are a complete waste of time.",
    "If interested in statistics or pursuing economics, it should be taken.",
    "Terrible. Avoid the course if at all possible.",
    "Take it in the fall.",
    "If you're an Econ major, I guess you've got to bite the bullet...",
    "Important stuff! Not particularly well taught though. If you're good at mathematical thinking you should basically be able to figure things out and do well. Lectures are sometimes confusing and always make you drowsy, but ultimately if you discipline yourself to go regularly it will help you some. The curve is friendly too."
