   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot more about calculus.",
    "I learned the workings of multivariable calculus. Vectors, extrema in 3 dimensions, vector line integrals, scalar line integrals, flux integrals, scalar surface integrals, and flux integrals.",
    "Multivariable calculus! Everything from finding extrema to multiple integrals, various manifestations of Stokes' Theorem, lots of cool math",
    "I gained a better conceptual understanding of multi variable calculus and why it is useful for us to work with.",
    "It is hard to catch up in a math class where your peers took linear algebra and multi-var in high school. Attend office hours.",
    "Multivariable Calculus and the Generalized Stokes Theorem",
    "This class was fascinating to me. I always love it when a whole new area is opened in math, and this class certainly did that by introducing a third and fourth dimension to calculus. The course was also very helpful in my physics class, as many of the theorems and ideas correspond to an application in physics, which of course mostly occurs in more than two dimensions. I feel I have a fairly complete and solid understanding of the material of the course, from lines and planes to the divergence theorem.",
    "I learned how to manage my time with problem sets.",
    "Multivariable",
    "How to evaluate higher-level calculus",
    "I would say I adequately learned calculus of several variables, as in differentiating, integrating, and applications of such. I definitely have stronger points and weaker points. For instance, I would say I'm much more comfortable with integration than I am with differentiation. I also didn't exactly learn parametrization before this class, so the first few weeks caused quite the struggle (I think it was assumed we knew basic parametrization). However, I was able to get at least somewhat used to the pace of this class (which was blazingly fast compared to my high school math classes). Overall, the class was very helpful in that it taught me what I wanted to learn, and it gave me insight into what major I'm potentially choosing.",
    "I learned about vectors and integrating surfaces and lines.",
    "-Good continuation of Math 115 \/ Calc BC -Stokes Theorem\/Gradients were interesting concepts",
    "I learned time management as well as how to reach out for help in the college setting.",
    "I gained an understanding of multi-variable calculus, picking up from where calc BC left off and extending to subjects such as stokes theorem. I had never dealt with three variables before, so there was a lot of new information to learn."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really liked how there was guided notes because I could focus on doing the problems instead of having to copy down a bunch of words or waste time setting up problems. I also felt that the examples done in class were comparable to the homework as well as the midterms. For weaknesses, I felt that some of the concepts were not really explained, and it times we were just told how to compute something. I would love to understand the application of these theorems, especially in various fields.",
    "Course material is taught clearly and well organized but can be a little fast paced. More learning by doing problems would increase engagement and understanding.",
    "All of the information we learned was very prevalent for the kind of problems we were handling, but I think it was a bit overwhelming at times and could be split into different courses.",
    "A strength is Byungmin So. The main weaknesses are the pace of the class and the lack of time to understand the materials.",
    "Different instructors gave really different experiences for the course.",
    "The course is well designed, and the order of topics is logical. I did find myself wishing at some points that the class was more proof based, and that there was more explanation about the reasoning behind some of the theorems. Otherwise I think it's a great class!",
    "The weakness of this course is the differing difficulties of the teachers. I know that several students switched teachers after the first midterm because they felt as though their teachers were hard to understand.",
    "Lots of practice material.",
    "I think the structuring could definitely have been improved, and the pacing was really quick.",
    "Strengths: This class was very organized. If I wanted to find a certain worksheet or homework, I knew exactly where to go. The professor was also very nice and understanding. Weaknesses: Sometimes, we go through example problems too fast, e.g. we'll skip many steps to get to the answer. I understand that this is mainly due to time constraints, but sometimes it glosses over concepts or steps that I do not understand or see.",
    "This course had a lot of material, which was sometimes hard to keep up with. A strength was all the additional practice problems. A weakness was that it seemed some students were better off depending on who their professor was.",
    "Strengths: Comprehensive Lecture Notes\/Guided Notes Lots of Review Sessions\/Office Hours Weaknesses: Lack of applied concepts\/connections to other fields",
    "Strengths are that Byungmin was able to incorporate both individual and group work during class, allowing us to always ask questions. The only weakness in the course is that I felt like the examinations did not match up with the difficulty of the preparation and previous work done in class.",
    "The one weaknesses of this class is how fast paced it moves. Although I understand that covering so much information is essential, it can occasionally feel like a tidal wave of new knowledge and skills that are difficult to keep up with. However the strengths of this class far outweigh that weakness. The amount of resources available is incredible. Not only are there office hours, but there are peer tutoring hours, review sessions, and online videos explaining every single skill with examples. I was honestly blown away by the amount of help provided, and it really made me feel like I could make it through the course. My teacher also provided packets day by day with the information covered, which made breaking down each skill and reviewing so much easier. This class made me appreciate math rather than fear it, and appreciate the dedication these teachers have to it."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes I would, but it has to be made clear that sometimes, a lot of work must be put in outside of class in order to understand the concepts being taught.",
    "Yes, especially if you are looking for a basic QR requirement and finished single variable (through BC) calculus. It's pretty cool stuff",
    "If someone has a good conceptual understanding of mathematics, I would recommend this course for them.",
    "If this is not in your requirements, think about not taking it--unless you really enjoy math.",
    "Yes totally if you want just applied multivariable Calculus.",
    "I know this class is important to take, especially for potential physics and math people, so for that reason I would recommend it. For people just looking for a random math experience, I think 115 might be a better choice. Overall, I think the class was definitely enjoyable and interesting enough to recommend.",
    "This course was not extremely engaging. However, I thought Byungmin was a great teacher, and I would highly recommend him.",
    "I would recommend if the student enjoys math and is willing to go that extra step",
    "If this is part of the student's major, I do recommend this course. However, I would not for someone trying to complete their QR credit or something like that. Multivariable calculus is not a walk in the park, and neither is this course. Take it if you feel like you have a strong foundation in calculus or if you have to take an equivalent course for your major.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they like math and like to be challenged. It's a lot of work though.",
    "I would only recommend to those who need to satisfy major requirements, I thin there are more interesting QR courses out there for non-STEM majors.",
    "I would. I would warn them that it is hard, and that it requires time outside of class, but overall it's a worthwhile and beneficial class. I would also tell them about all the out of class resources (tutoring ximera etc), and I would tell them how helpful those are."
