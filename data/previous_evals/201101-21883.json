   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend it. A great course on an important subject. However, people should keep in mind that it really mostly covered the political and economic events and mostly left out the socio-cultural side of things. Definitely a great class, if you don't end up taking it, read Snyder's book Bloodlands. Also watch out for the map quiz- not an actual map quiz, more of a written test on everything covered til that point.",
    "One of the best lecturers at Yale, not a bad workload, chance to learn a lot about an important region that likely didn't get covered in your high school history class. This class will really help you understand current events in Europe. A must take.",
    "Take this course! Now! I knew nothing about Eastern Europe before taking the class, and now I want to learn much more. Snyder is an amazing, amazing lecturer, maybe the best I've ever seen at Yale. He knows Eastern Europe like the back of his hand, and wants you to, as well. You will look forward to every lecture.",
    "You lost the game",
    "Definitely recommend. It's not an easy credit, but you will be glad to hear some amazing lectures and feel proud of all that you learned at the end.",
    "It's a fantastic class. A near-must take for history students and basically anyone. Lectures become like story-time as you listen to the latest shenanigans that Eastern Europe's cast of characters are up to. You really get a sense of the narrative and historical arc of the region, 100% recommended.Just watch out for that map quiz, he might change it, but for us, it wasn't actually a map quiz, just a quiz. Midterm\/final fair.",
    "Eastern Europe since 1914 is a great lecture. It is more interesting and engaging then the first semester class (Eastern Europe until 1914). Snyder makes the course incredibly interesting and engaging. His lectures feel less like lectures and more like seminars. Take the course if you are interested in the World Wars, nationalism or Eastern Europe.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course for anyone interested in the material and subject matter. You will learn Eastern European history from the Eastern European, not American perspective, which is very enlightening.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It provides an important introduction into a critical part of the 20th century from a perspective that hasn't been examined as much in historical scholarship. Prof. Snyder is a fantastic lecturer and it's cool to learn the history firsthand from the person who did the groundbreaking research.",
    "I would definitely recommend Eastern Europe Since 1914. Professor Snyder is one of the best lecturers you will find at Yale, and you couldn't ask for more on a subject so topically relevant to contemporary international politics. The course is very reasonable -- just a midterm, map quiz, and final. Be prepared for a few curveballs on those assessments, however (like a map quiz with no map). On the whole, a fine class with some memorable readings.",
    "This is a very interesting class, but be prepared to do a lot of reading, around 150 or more pages per week. The course packet is HUGE. Section was difficult to get through if you haven't done all the readings too. Also, the midterm was lecture based, but the final is more reading based. Knowing that helps to know how to prepare for each. Timothy Snyder is very funny and a great lecturer though. I didn't take the first half if the class (Eastern Europe until 1914), and it's not necessary, but it's helpful to have taken it I hear.",
    "I loved this course. Professor Snyder is great, and I highly recommend this course to anyone who even has a fleeting interest in Eastern Europe. The course covers material from WWI through the present, with an emphasis on the effect of communism on the area. There isn't much discussion on these countries in the present day, but the historical content of the course is superb.",
    "Eastern Europe Since 1914 is a great class if you are interested in general history of the world. It makes sense of many of the major events of the 20th century. It is a must for any history major, but it also covers a lot of history than any one should know.",
    "So... look at your schedule. If you have something i the same timeslot as this class then erase it and save it for next year. Prof. Snyder is an amazing instructor and his class is awesome. His book is so intense it made one kid throw up. He can give you a better understanding of everything that occurred in Eastern Europe. A word of advice tough... show up early during shopping period, and don't bring anything electronic i.e. laptop cell phone i pod etc.",
    "If you think there's a slight chance you may be interested in it, TAKE IT. TAKE IT. TAKE IT. Or at the very least, shop it. This class got me passionate about a subject I never really cared about before. You learn about WWI and WWII from a completely new perspective than in high school or typical, Western perspective history classes.",
    "I heartily recommend this. It's a straight, no-nonsense lecture course about Eastern Europe since 1914, drawing together the histories of the various countries in a comprehensive way. Expect a lot of note-taking by HAND, but it's definitely manageable. The course material and readings are really interesting, too.",
    "Prof. Snyder is an amazing lecturer, and the material is really interesting. Definitely a course you should take.",
    "I would recommend it for sure, but be ready for some challenges",
    "WONDERFUL lecture class. Professor Snyder is a fantastic lecturer. While the course readings are very extensive and probably impossible to do them all, but they are all interesting. Watch out for the map quiz.",
    "Take this class. It is interesting, the Professor\/lectures are great and the reading is manageable.",
    "Snyder is an amazing lecturer, and this is an awesome survey of a really interesting and important region. A good Cr\/D - just don't do the reading.",
    "Great course on the history of Eastern Europe, a place often neglected and marginalized when examining the history of the world. Great class to take, ESPECIALLY if you take it Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "As a junior history major, I've never learned so much in one class. It's amazing how much Snyder was able to get into each lecture. I was shocked at how little I knew about the history of Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, etc.The tests were difficult to study for because there was so much information (and so many unfamiliar names), but this was one of my all-time favorite classes. Unfortunately, like many of the great Yale history classes, there was too much reading.",
    "TAKE IT. If you're a history major, you will do very well and get a lot out of it. If you're not, Snyder is so brilliant that you'll be engaged all the way. But do the reading! Don't take this class if you already have a packed schedule, you'll regret it.",
    "Take this course. Do not hesitate. The content is fascinating, and Professor Snyder may in fact be god.",
    "It's essentially everything from WWI to the foundation of the EU. I would enthusiastically recommend this class; the professor is a BOSS, the material is great and, despite what you might think about Eastern Europe, incredibly important today.",
    "Yes, this class is incredibly interesting and teaches history that is important for people to know.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, it is a lot of reading, but extremely interesting."
