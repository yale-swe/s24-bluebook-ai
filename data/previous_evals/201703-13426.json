The course which is supposed to be on clinical trial turned out to be rudimentary biostatistics giving only formulas with almost no or one practical question for students to figure the rest. It is absurd that we spend hours doing calculations manually which can be done and are done in the real world with a software and two key strikes",

   "comments": [
    "good",
    "very applicable to outside research",
    "Good course overall. The instructor can pay more attention to the slides.",
    "good, homeworks should be worth 20%",
    "I think that Dr. Makuch knows a lot about the topic of clinical trials, but I don't feel like I learned a lot in the class.",
    "The course is horrible. Taught poorly Put weight on issues not related to the title of the course. In improvement I think you should find someone interested to teach the course and ensure that if you call a course Fundamentals of clincal trials then that is what it is. The way it is been taught you should call it Statistics in clinical trials to fit its current syllabus",
    "I think that this class has the potential to teach a lot and be useful, but the execution doesn't live up to the promise. It would benefit form more enforced structure -- it usually feels like you talk about whatever Dr. Makuch feels like talking about in a given day instead of a concept that fits into an overarching plan. The readings, homework, and lectures are also not very cohesive.",
    "Useful for anyone interested in regulatory affairs. Useful practical information.",
    "It's a good course with a lot of interesting material. However, I thought the readings were a tad overwhelming, and a lot of students simply stopped doing them as a result. I think I would have enjoyed the class more if the readings were less dense and more concise.",
    "good",
    "strengths: great material, obviously informed professor Weaknesses: Didn't quite grasp concepts. could have gotten a lot more out of it",
    "Perfect.I can't find a more suitable course for me like this in YSPH. Hope the course will keep current format and content.",
    "Strength: great introduction course to clinical trials",
    "useful knowledge for clinical trials",
    "Strength: 1. Well-organized lectures 2. Helpful homework solutions 3. Open-note, open-internet exams make the midterm\/final easy Weakness: Some overlapping knowledge with the other course Regulatory Affairs",
    "Strength: open learning, engaging class, casual dialogue Weakness: no depth of learning",
    "This course provides helpful insights on common issues in clinical trials, covering both theoretical and empirical topics.",
    "The class introduced me to the world of clinical trials, which I had little\/no prior experience with. Although Professor Makuch has much experience working in this field, his slides are sometimes disorganized and he would go off on tangents. The homework assignments, midterm\/final exams may not correlate with the material taught in class. Although everything was open-notes, I found the course sometimes frustrating because of the discrepancy between course material and assignments\/exams. The guest speakers were generally great.",
    "very useful in knowing the process of clinical trials",
    "Excellent!",
    "Very good",
    "Good course to give you foundations of clinical trials - easier than most biostats courses I've taken. I like how the professor does exams as open note, open laptop and encourages learning how to do something instead of memorizing equations. Sometimes the slides he uses could have more details or be connected better. It was always a bit difficult to do the homework because the slides didn't have enough information and the book is a bit dense.",
    "Real life examples are very informative, including guest lectures",
    "Good introductory course to clinical trials, but there is a lot of room for improvement in terms of how the materials were taught in the lectures.",
    "Remove homework requirement. Simply suggest it as part of the reading. Otherwise the course was great. It would also be great to have a speaker from the FDA do a visit lecture.",
    "Makuch is a wonderful teacher. However, the lectures are extremely disorganized and do not teach students.",
    "Everything in the exam were asked in homework and the solutions were provided. All important knowledge points were addressed in details on class.",
    "very very poor course do not take it!!!",
    "Excellent. Would be great to use more real examples"
