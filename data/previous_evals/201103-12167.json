   "comments": [
    "Very informative and helpful class if you are interested in learning how to analyze and read papers. Paper was a bit difficult but with planning, very doable.",
    "This is a great course to supplement your understanding from MB&B301 and to help you to learn to read scientific papers. The material is very new, interesting, and very relevant to medicine (Medical Impacts). Really great course.",
    "This is one of those competitive pre-med classes that, while incredibly interesting and informative, can also be very stressful. It was a good amount of work and the final paper was one of the most difficult assignments that I have had at Yale. That said, the course was probably one of the best science courses I have had here in terms of how many scientifically relevant\/current things I have learned as well as the skills I have acquired. I would definitely recommend this course to another MBB student with the caveat that they will have to put in a lot of effort into this class.",
    "Take this class if you have a strong science background and want a reasonably challenging seminar. Be prepared to put work in, but not to kill yourself.",
    "Absolutely! Probably one of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far.",
    "This is a truly fantastic class- definitely my favorite class at Yale, and makes all of the MB&B prereqs worth it. You learn an incredible amount about research related to human disease, and if you're at all interested in research, this class is both helpful and inspiring. The TAs were wonderful, as were all of the lecturers. Completely worth the work in terms of reading papers, which are almost always extremely interesting.",
    "Great but kind of brutal class. Ties together everything learned in MB&B 300 and 301 in a very elegant beautiful way. Everyone major should take it regardless of the damage it will do to your GPA (I expect!)",
    "Take this class. It really taught me how to actually read a journal article, and I learned more biochemistry from this than from the other classes I've taken. Wednesday questions are stressful, but they're actually fun as long as you prepare (and everyone in your group did as well). The paper is a difficult assignment, but I really feel like I got something out of it. So far, this is my favorite class in the MB&B department.",
    "Excellent papers-based course. You get much better at reading papers analytically, which possibly translates into better at writing your own papers. I enjoyed it in a way that I did not enjoy the biochem lecture courses.",
    "Great course. You get to learn about a variety of salient topics in science and medicine and key molecular mechanisms and pathways, and for those who have never taken a course that focuses on reading and analyzing scientific articles, this is a valuable skill.There's not that much work, and if you're already good at reading papers, this will be an easy class for you. The work load is well-balanced and spaced out - just make sure you take the time to read the papers.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course. Great follow-up to MBB301,incredibly stimulating and mentally challenging but not too much of a burden in terms of workload. This class made me feel like I was thinking, for the first time, like a scientist.",
    "Great class. Very challenging but probably worth the work if you get something out of it in the end.",
    "This course really teaches you how to read through journal articles. You have the chance to work in small groups on a weekly basis, and it's amazing to see what other people know through their research backgrounds. It was an interesting course, but a bit stressful at times with weekly discussion sessions."
