    "This was a wonderfully led seminar! I loved the syllabus, and found the discussions extremely stimulating. Professor Avilez does a great job incorporating various tidbits on authors or related historical \/ artistic contexts to the discussion, which was helpful for someone like me who isn't extremely well-versed in African American studies. Our class sadly included some people who simply didn't speak after the first day, which was quite frustrating. I wondered if they could have been drawn out to speak in some way, or not. Professor Avilez sort of left them in the dust.Professor Avilez really knows what he's doing. We were challenged to come to the class ready to jump right in with engaging the text with as much fervor as he does, without fail. He has a great way of giving each comment as much value as possible, rephrasing it when necessary, or giving it a hefty amount of weight by thinking it through for some moments after it's presented. I wondered, at times, why he didn't call out people for not speaking, or point out the statements made that were blatantly not rooted in the text. Though, perhaps that's the job of the other students in the seminar, not his. Instead, he very tactfully praises people during discussions in a way that's the BIGGEST upper you could ever receive. Similarly, every comment on my papers made me feel good; every mark-up was decidedly constructive.I hope Professor Avilez continues doing what he's doing, because he does it better than any Professor I've had yet.",
    "yes! awesome course!",
    "This course was interesting in subject matter. It took me out of my comfort zone and allowed me to see and dissect how sex is portrayed and used in the media, pop culture, and literature. So many layers and topics to discuss! It a great discussion course and not high pressure.",
    "Take this class! The material is awesome and the seminar is fun and provocative. The workload is light but meaningful and it's just a really good time.",
    "It's an overview of Black Diasporic sexuality. From the Civil Rights Movement to Michael Jackson. Get to read some books that you've never heard of, and watch some interesting movies (on homosexuality, rape, etc.)about Blackness. A bit racially-binary (Black vs. White) in its approach. Could have used some more color. The papers aren't horrible, but the amount of reading each week can be overwhelming.",
    "A book (or equivalent, e.g. a film) a week plus a few chapters from more theoretical texts, an ~8 pp paper, a class presentation, and a final project with some flexibility. I would absolutely recommend this class! Professor Avilez is awesome, you will get to work with interesting texts, and you will learn a lot without ever being majorly stressed.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class. Whatever your major may be, you're going to be exposed to new ideas and there are going to be at least a few classes you're going to get excited about and have a lot to contribute to.",
    "Professor Avilez is one of Yale's best. This is a great class - fairly heavy reading but worth it for great discussion. There are a lot of choices for the papers, and Professor Avilez is super accessible. The only downside was that it was so early in the morning!",
    "This class was totally engaging--both in its assigned readings and in the discussions they prompted. I was particularly impressed by the incorporation of expressions of black sexuality in multiple, sometimes complementary sometimes divergent media. I found the midterm\/final paper\/project combo to be really generative. I actively looked forward to this class every Tuesday morning, and I got the sense that my classmates felt the same way. Discussions were always lively, dampened only, I think, by the relatively large seminar size. I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "definitely",
    "Absolutely."
