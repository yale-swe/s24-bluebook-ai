    "I took this for lessons for credit... I don't think I would recommend this class to another student for fun. It is a good introduction for those who want to take higher level music theory courses though.",
    "This class uses a strange way of doing harmonic analysis, but felt ultimately rewarding in the end. It is a decent amount of work during midterm\/final season, but otherwise is very manageable.",
    "IF YOU ARE COMING FROM MUSIC 110, TAKE MUSIC 218 FIRST! I'm not from music 110. But all my friends from music 110 dropped out in the first weeks. After music 110 you need more time with chord names and scale tones until your comfortable enough to manipulate them like you do in 210. This time is available in Music 218, where you consistently speak of chords and reinforce your knowledge of them. That being said, at the end of this course I wanted to see the matrix. I wanted to see what chords were happening where in the music. This course has brought me significantly closer to that goal. Do your damn homework and spend time with the textbook and you will learn a LOT. There's about an hour of reading and and hour of worksheet for each class (twice a week). These are overestimations, but it'd be worth it to spend the time working through the material and letting it sink in. Vvvv manageable and though some of the material is dry, I felt I learned some good stuff. Voice leading, recognizing cadences\/types of cadences. New types of chords (altered sixth chords). Modulation. Good stuff."
