Thus, the level of effort that each student invest in the class can change the evaluation of the overall course",

    "This class was very hands-on, providing a learning experience like no other. Most importantly, this class provided me the opportunity to really make and difference by reaching out to diplomats and formulating substantive policymaking recommendations for climate change negotiations. I believe that students learn best when they really have the opportunity to work in the field and see the results of their work. This course enables exactly that. There is so much more that can be learned from this kind of hands-on experience than just reading readings or textbook chapters.",

The course provided me with the hands-on experience I needed and deepened my interviewing and negotiating skills, as well as informing me of diplomatic language. This course, therefore, taught me the real skills I need to succeed in the field.",
    "The course presented a global view, of some hot environmental issues, focusing in particular in climate change. As such it allowed me to better understand different positions, and how to target the responsibles of desicion making",
    "I am an International Rlations major so the diplomacy of environment is a very important and growing field that shows all of the intricacies related to very important diplomatic issues, not only environmentally-related."

    "The advantages of group work were that different opinions on the issues were heard and that different angles of tackling questions were allowed. This made constructive dialogue that made constructing the questionnaire for diplomats more focused. The disadvantage was that the dialogue took time and were perhaps a bit more inefficient than individual work.",
    "The classas a whole is developed in a group basis, and team work is also encouraged in the interview process - The diversity of backgrounds and skills contribute to make things easier (e.g overpass language barriers)",
    "Working in a group is a great experience as you learn a lot about how things function in a team. Additionally, you learn about the challenges and how to overcome these. The disadvantages are basically issue of resolving disagreement and often spending excess time on issues that don't arise when you work independently.",
    "It depends on the dyamics. Here particularly it was very useful becuase we could use different advantages of students on the same way we would on real life and we were specialized on something."

    "Work on creating a questionnaire at the beginning of the semester, so that there is more time to schedule and conduct interviews.",
    "The class is a very accuarate model of the UN methodology. It will demand a lot of negotiation and consensus among peers.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I would advise you tot ake it if interested in beingpart of a research group that involves commitment and on which you will have a heavy responsibility of producing the key questions; also interesting if you want to see ossues related to diplomcy in general."
