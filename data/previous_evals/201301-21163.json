   "comments": [
    "I would summarize this course as a reflection on the complexity of health politics in the twentieth century with a strong focus on the United States. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially one interested in gender issues. It nicely complemented another course I took on sexual and political theory.",
    "This course provides an opportunity to delve into the interrelations of race, gender, socioeconomic status, choice, coercion and the body in 20th century and early 21st century health care and health politics. The course focuses on America; however, international events and peoples receive attention, as well. History 943 offers a forum to discuss weekly readings with students outside of the History Department, as the class comprised (this semester, at least) students from other schools and departments at Yale,whose backgrounds and viewpoints contribute significantly to discussions and understanding of concepts. The workload is challenging, but not overwhelming. Professor Naomi Rogers keeps a lively pace.I would recommend this course to a fellow student because of the opportunity to learn a tremendous amount throughout the course of a semester. This class teaches skills that transfer and can be applied in other courses.",
    "This was a course that went through various interactions between politics and health with subjects ranging from changes in mental diagnosis to overpopulation and birth control. It was both informative and entertaining and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested."

   "comments": [
    "My emphasis is on WGSS, so this course was invaluable in providing a foundation for the way that discourse about gender issues (in the context of health politics) has taken place in twentieth century American history. It provided me with concrete knowledge of different debates and struggles that I can now analyze through the lens of sexual and political theory.",
    "As stated above, this course widened and deepened my knowledge of history and improved essential skills for this profession. It rates at the top of the courses I have taken throughout my academic career.",
    "I really did not know much about health politics before hand, but I am interested in the different levels at which patriarchy and sexism are institutionalized. Some of the books were more on this topic than others but it really was fantastic and has put a new dimension on my studies in sexism, racism and religion working within the United States political context."
