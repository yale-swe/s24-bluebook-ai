Stephen Davis is a great professor and a great man, and knows exactly how to teach the material for this class in a way that is fun, thorough and rewarding."

    "I am an undergraduate, without a firm discipline or dissertation in mind, but this class certainly changed the way I will pursue my future studies, and possibly even my long term post-graduate plans."
