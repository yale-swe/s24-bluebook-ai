    "Do you want to learn Chinese?Then take this course.",
    "Well, you've probably already taken L1 Chinese, CHNS 110. I noticed that the first few weeks of first semester Chinese were really rough - trying to keep up was difficult. Then, the semester went on, and it got much easier. Then, you'll probably notice that if you continue to L2, it gets much easier to get through Chinese homework - you get into a kind of groove. Sure, you'll see some of the hardest chapters you'll encounter to date (le constructions, ba constructions) but at that point, it's just an exercise of reading sentences over and over and seeing lots of examples.So, basically, it's the same, wonderful Chinese class as last semester - nothing is going to change in terms of texts or teachers. You might find a different class dynamic, though, which usually makes or breaks intro language classes.",
    "Absolutely. Take it. The program is unrivaled.",
    "Yes, great class. Ummm, honestly if you've already taken CHinese 110, you are taking 120, so those evaluations pretty much sum it up.",
    "I highly recommend CHNS120. Your language skills will improve dramatically, and the class is just as much fun as 110.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Chinese 120 to a fellow student, assuming he or she is prepared to put in the effort necessary for success. It's a lot of work but very rewarding.",
    "First year Chinese is the best course that I took this year, and I highly recommend it. It's a lot of work, butthe work is reliable, and after a while, very relaxing because you know how much it is, and how long it will take you. The teachers are excellent.",
    "if you are interested in chinese this class is AMAZING a normal continuation of 110 even though it is somewhat harder so you will have to find better techniques for understanding the material than on the first semester, it doesnt necesserily mean that you have to study more but rather more effectively",
    "Amazing class. You learn so much, but you need to put in a lot of time and effort to succeed.",
    "Its a lot of work but its a class definitely worth taking!",
    "This is a considerable step up from Chinese 110, and the daily quizzes start to get the better of you by the end, but if you really want to learn Chinese, you will get through",
    "Awesome. Definitely recommend. Don't hesitate because of the courseload.",
    "It's Chinese. It's a shit-ton of work. You learn a lot of Chinese. I thought it was worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because although the work is heavy and the class is hard, you learn a great deal of Chinese. The teachers do a good job of keeping your attention each day.",
    "yes it is an awesome class and you will learn a lot. be aware though that it is a lot of work every night and if you fall behind one night it will be hard to catch up.",
    "If you want to learn Chinese, Yale is the place to do it. The L1\/L2 program is absolutely phenomenal. A lot of people say that Chinese is one of most difficult languages to learn, but the program here at Yale makes it a truly enjoyable and most importantly, manageable, experience. I would definitely recommend this class to any student.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is thinking about learning Chinese (and took L1). It is a little harder than first semester, but not that much.",
    "Chinese 120 is an intensive way to learn Chinese. The workload is intense, and it is harder than Chinese 110. However, you learn a lot and really start to get a grasp on the language. Take it!",
    "A great continuation of Chinese 110; a really engaging, effective class. Progress is very tangible, evidenced by skits at the end of the year.",
    "I would recommend if they are serious about learning Chinese. Meeting daily and having homework 2\/3 of the time is a lot of work.",
    "Touch but thorough, you'll learn a lot and bust your butt--even more so than L1.",
    "WONDERFUL. ridiculous. INTENSE.",
    "You will be impressed with how much you learn. I definitely recommend this class. The teachers are great and you'll have fun in class.There's a lot of work for sure, but you'll get into a daily routine to get it all done. I spent such a disproportionate amount of time on Chinese this year compared to my other classes, but I think it's really paid off.",
    "This is a very intensive , highly structured language course that gives you a surprising amount of Chinese in a short period of time.",
    "It is a tough course that you should only take if you are willing to do the work, but if you are it is more than worth it. Chinese is a very valuable skill, and it is also incredibly fun. The teachers are so much fun and the other students are very fun as well. It's a great class.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. I would caution them that it is a pretty hefty time commitment, but I would emphasize that it is completely worth it if you are interested in languages. It is so well put together that it is hard to resent the workload. I never once felt like the expectations were unfair.",
    "If you've ever wanted to take Chinese but never had the opportunity then you should definitely take this course, it is worth all the hard work.",
    "Chinese 120 is a great course if you really want to learn the Chinese language. Only take this class if you're willing to work hard. If you do work hard, you will see great results! The workload is manageable, although I would seriously recommend not taking this class if you're just looking to fulfill the foreign language requirement. After a year of Chinese, I am amazed at how much I can already say and understand. Meeting with a one-on-one tutor once a week really improved my pronunciation. Overall, this course is really welltaught and rewarding!",
    "Absolutely. It is a great course. Extremely intensive, but very effective.",
    "This class is far from easy. It is very intensive but I do not regret it in any way. I will continue to study Chinese with the Light Fellowship this summer and I believe that Yale's Chinese program has prepared me well for this. I also believe that learning Chinese here has been and will be one of the most highly appreciated goals I plan to accomplish during my college career. There is also a culture that develops with the L1 Chinese students that I truly love. You bond with your classmates for the course's intensity and the daily investment students struggle through together.",
    "Chinese is a great language and the teachers are fantastic, definitely a great language choice at Yale.",
    "I would recommend Chinese. The program here is incredible and fool-proof. I will continue with L-3 Godwilling.",
    "A great course if you truly want to learn Chinese. However, it is very time consuming.",
    "Yes. But, be willing to work very hard and diligently in class and keep up with homework and studying on the side.",
    "Definitely take Chinese 120. It is a continuation of Chinese 115 and follows the exact same structure. My most enjoyable class at Yale by far!",
    "If you've taken Chinese 110, then you pretty much have to take 120 if you want credit for 110. 120 is a direct continuation of 110. The workload is about the same. Same teachers, and the class is still consistent and pretty fun. I wish we would have focused more on learning vocabulary though.",
    "This class continues in the same format as Chinese 110. By now, you know it's a lot of work, so I hope you entered it really wanting to learn Chinese. Try not to worry about your grades; they will work out if you put in the effort, because you will learn Chinese \u0097\u00a0it's unavoidable. The teaching quality is simply phenomenal, and I feel like each teacher really cared to get to know me.",
    "I strongly recommend this course.",
    "Yes! Any student who takes this class and works very hard will most definitely be able to have a full, complex conversation in Chinese. Anyone who has any interest in learning Chinese should take this class because it was one of the best I've taken in my Yale career.",
    "I loved it. I felt very prepared after Chinese 110. It wasn't significantly harder than it like some other students suggest.",
    "In choosing to take the L2 class so as not to lose the L1 credit, I made a mistake personally, but the class offers much to anyone committed to learning Chinese as a personal aswell as academic project. Just be advised that Chinese at Yale is a lifestyle, not just a class.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who started first semester; it is worth the payoff by the end of the year to even have a basic foundation of Mandarin.",
    "Great course but heavy workload. If you are interested in Chinese take the course, but if your not sure perhaps avoid it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend. Very good language course.The material is very-well chosen and the structure of the course very well-organized so as to give you a functional command of the language as soon as possible.The curriculum is very dialogue-oriented, allowing you to apply a lot of the stuff you learn to daily life and common situations.",
    "It's tougher than the previous semester (Chinese 110), but nevertheless, one can gain a lot in their command of the Chinese language.",
    "TAKE IT. TAKE IT.IF YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT LEARNING CHINESE, THIS IS THE PLACE TO TAKE IT.Once again: great course material, great faculty, great learning atmosphere, great classmates...YOU WON'T REGRET IT",
    "Any one interested in learning Chinese should definitely consider taking this course.",
    "Chinese 120 is great at improving your chinese proficiency without killing you on grades or workload. It is actually less work than first semester as you already have tones and such down. I would recommend Chinese 120 to anyone who wants to continue!",
    "Yes I would recommend this class. Although very work intensive, it is well worth the effort.",
    "This is a great class! I liked it better than Chinese 110, which is saying a lot. Once you know a bit more, there is more focus on conversation, which makes class more fun, since it's not just drills.",
    "If youtake Chinese 110, you should definitely take 120. Not only because if you don't you won't get credit for taking the full year, but I think if you make it through 110 you will find level 2 to be much more enjoyable. After getting used to the format of everything you are able to focus more on the material, and I didnt think we had as much work this semester as we did with 110.",
    "Great class. come learn chinese.",
    "It's awesome.I started taking Chinese after fulfilling my language requirement in Spanish just because my friends raved about it. Every day is worthwhile and you learn so much.My studying habits have gotten so much better thanks to this course.I recommend using a whiteboard to study characters instead of paper. I carried one around everywhere I went and the pretty colors I had made me want to study more ;)",
    "Chinese 120 is a great course. They definitely pick up the pace from first semester, and the material definitely gets more difficult, but it's all worth it for the teachers. They are all outstanding! They know and care about every single student, and they put massive amounts of time and effort into the course. They make classesfun and entertaining, especially if you have a good group of people in your section. Also, you will be amazed by how much you learn. Only caveat: it didn't take me long to regret taking a 9:20 class that meets every day, in retrospect I definitely would have taken a later section. I would absolutely recommend this class!",
    "Chinese 120 is harder than 110 (which makes sense), but if you plunk down the time and energy to take 110 you'd better be taking 120. Everything said about 110 holds true about 120; be prepared to do a lot of work if you want to do well, don't let yourself fall behind, and characters are a \"female dog.\" If you stick with it though, by the end of the year you will feel like you are actually getting to the point where you can speak Chinese - you know you're not close yet, but you can say the important stuff (like \"why are you always talking about Myanmar\" and explain how to make tea) and understand even more.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Chinese 120. It is alot of work, but definitely rewarding. I often feel that as a Yalie I am worried about the grades I receive in courses, and how I can get that grade with as minimal effort as possible, but Chinese is work. But it is an amazing tradeoff of work and knowledge. You really get from Chinese as much as you put in. I truly believe that Chinese has made me into a better student and a better person."
