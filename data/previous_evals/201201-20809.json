   "comments": [
    "Yes. This course is useful. Teaching you another view of programming.",
    "Recommend! Cool topic and very popular topic as well.",
    "In this course you will learn a several parallel programming APIs. It will be most valuable. I would recommend this course to any student in computer science.",
    "I will. It is a very good introduction to parallel programming.",
    "It is a well-rounded course for those who need to use parallel programming as a tool to accomplish related tasks.",
    "If one is planning on using parallel computing for his\/her research, this course helps one know the ways in which one can do it. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anybody who is involved in numerical and computational studies from any department.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to another student because there is a lot to learn from this course.",
    "no. unless they are really interested in the subjectPlus, the TA who marks the last two hws (4 and 5) are really really bad!I have never seen such a careless and rude comment like: incorrect, no output,Then at least half of the marks are gone!You get paid for the job, then you should do your marking seriously!",
    "Know what you're getting into. A lot of programming assignments - a lot of matrix multiplication. The assignments take a lot of time, but it is cool to use a high performance cluster and to learn the nuts and bolts of parallel computing.",
    "Yes, I will recommend CPSC427. This a useful course and introduce parallel computing to students, which I think is a \"must know\" to CS students.",
    "If you are interested in parallel programming just audit this class. The programming assignments are horrendous and only involve matrix multiplication. Make sure Jiewen is TAing the class if you take it for credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student who might be interested in exploiting parallel programming techniques for his\/her computation. This class can be an invaluable learning occasion.",
    "If you wan to learn how to write parallel programs& use Yale's HPC resources - take this class.",
    "No I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "This course was designed to provide an overview and applications of several of the main topics in parallel programming (i.e., MPI, multithreading, and GPU programming). Emphasis was placed on practical application of each of the programming methods and was intended to inform students of the types of problems that can be solved using parallel programming techniques.I would recommend the course if the student would be using parallel programming in their field. Otherwise, the course can serve as a very good wealth of knowledge but the work load can be quite overwhelming.",
    "I would definitely recommend CPSC524 to another students if he is interested in scientific computing. As I said before it is an hard topic to be introduced to if you are not a computer scientist."

   "comments": [
    "Very hands on, extremely useful techniques. Huge benefit to my professional development and research.",
    "I can utilize many of the techniques introduced in the course, including distributed computing with OpenMPI, parallel computing with OpenMP and Cuda to develop high performance rendering algorithms.",
    "I do not know anything about parallel. This course helps me a lot.",
    "It has helped me start looking into my thesis problem. The tools I learnt in the course would help me write programmes which I will be using to study some physical phenomenon.",
    "As a theoretical\/computational physicist, I will definitely use the techniques learnt in this class in the future. What I learnt in this class will help me improve most of my simulations.",
    "It taught me about parallel computing and the methods to achieve it. It has greatly improved my programming skills and problem solving ability.",
    "This course introduce me to the parallel topic, and give me a chance to do some parallel programming.",
    "Helped me understand matrix multiplication and basic linear algebra.",
    "This course provided me with tools that will surely help me improve the codes I have to develop towards the completion of my PhD studies. The computational part covers large part of my studies, and I really feel like I know much more of this subject (and even that there is still much more to learn)",
    "This course helped in understanding the fundamentals of parallel programming techniques that can be applied to solving complex problems in a shorter amount of time, such as those problems seen in the finite element method or other partial differential equations. The course aided my dissertation research by increasing my knowledge of methods so solve complex problems.",
    "This course did not deepen my knowledge in my discipline although my research will definitely benefit by the improved understanding on parallel programming."
