   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend it with no hesitations, but I think that this was the last year that Garry will be teaching it, so I would suggest looking into who is teaching it before you take it.",
    "Good mix of management, environment, economics and undergrad\/grad mix.",
    "The class is really dependent on how much you put into it. It may be a good class for beginners who are interested in doing a research project on a specific topic and learn skills about presentation and powerpoints, but if you are an advanced student then this class might be a little unneccesary.",
    "a lot of reading, but not very necessary to do it all (or any if you dont want to).. the class was largely run by student presentations, probably too much",
    "Great class, but involves group projects which got kind of stressful.",
    "If you wanna get a good understanding of the intersection between business, environmental management, risk analysis, and how to achieve the triple bottom lone of financial gains, environmental protection, and social equity, this is the class for you!!!",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! It was very interesting, relevant, and overall amazing.",
    "A great practical class that discusses in-depth issues that arise in business and the environment.",
    "Definitely recommend, allows you to really look into an issue and create solutions or plans for real life issues",
    "A little disconnected, but the project was fulfilling work and the lectures were interesting.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The set-up of the course was disorganized and led to periods of time when overwhelming amounts of work were due, and other times when there was no work to do. There were far too many readings, and given that this a course on environmental management, it would have been nice to have the readings online instead of printed out to save paper."
