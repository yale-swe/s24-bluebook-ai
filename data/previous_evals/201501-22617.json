    "Totally recommend. It is a book per week, and because they change every year, there is no way of knowing if they are going to be good. This year's were mostly great but it is going to change. Can be a lot of reading but there is only a presentation and a final paper",
    "I'd recommend taking it. Stathis generally picks an interesting set of books to read, and though 1-2 may not be that engaging, overall, I'm glad I read them. Obviously reading a book per week is a large time commitment, but it's not as bad as I would have thought before taking the course. Stathis is also a character so this class is worth it for that as well.",
    "Take it, but make sure you know what to expect! The workload is quite a bit in that you have to read one book each week and write a one page memo but the workload is also really little in that there is nothing else other than that and 2 presentations you have to make throughout the whole semester (and a final paper). Some of my classmates have expressed their dislike about the unstructured nature of the class and I think it is true that the quality of your class will depend a lot on your classmates and their respective presentations so it could be a hit or miss. Nonetheless, the books selection was awesome this semester and I have learnt so much more about various world issues after this semester.",
    "It was a fun experience to hear Professor Kalyvas' random thoughts on life and his life wisdom. He is also a really brilliant thinker, and pushed us to think in new ways and to draw connections. That said, the reading load was insane, and we never really got feedback or knew how we were doing. Be ready to \"read\" a book a week, and to write a memo a week. Otherwise, low workload and chill class. Professor Kalyvas is a fun guy!",
    "I really enjoyed reading the 12 different books - they're all really different and it was nice to be able to just read a lot of contemporary things. While a lot of other classes are really focused on a signle topic, I really appreciated the breadth of material in this class. That being said, discussions can sometimes be scattered - I didn't really mind as much, but I can see how some people can find it generally unfocused. Overall, I enjoyed the course a lot - even just skimming some of the books taught me a lot, though I basically read all of them. Also, Professor Kalyvas is hilarious and it's worth it just to listen to his thoughts a lot of the time.",
    "10\/10 would recommend. Broad range of topics, usually engaging and always well taught. Often off topic in a good way.",
    "This class is essentially a book club. One book a week with a short reading response and a synthesizing paper at the end. If you do the reading, of which there is quite a bit, you come out with a decent understanding of a lot of world events. All books are published the year or previous year of the course, which makes everything quite relevant.",
    "Think of this course as an international relations book club.",
    "Probably the best class I've taken at Yale, but honestly it's what you make of it. Put in the effort to stay on top of the readings -- it will greatly enhance your understanding of the material.",
    "If you have only the remotest interest in global political issues you HAVE to take this class! It is going to open your mind and you will leave it a different person; you will leave it with a comprehensive understanding of global politics, able to link areas you once considered remote. This is an incredible skill and you will love to have it. Don't be deterred by the workload of one book a week: you will like reading these books so much that you will devour them in your free time. And: if you don't like the material--impossible, if you ask me--you are definitely going to love Prof. Kalyvas; he definitely is one of the mots interesting, most approachable professors at Yale."
