    "Professor Geballe was encouraging but did not do much teaching. Of course, it is a project-based class, so that is to be expected.",
    "My answers about the course instructor apply to Leah Meth, who organized and ran the course. I had very little in-class or out of class interaction with Professor Geballe.",
    "The only reason I declined to give Q10 a full excellent score was that I wish the professor had a larger role in the course. The coursework and classes were managed mostly by the TA from the classes' perspective and it would have added a lot to hear more from Gordon and his views on things.",
    "12 - If the conference of the year is valuable and pertinent to your subject matter, then you can make the class valuable.",
    "Regarding workload - the weekly responses seemed a bit much on top of the work we were doing for our clients, especially for readings that were very different from our field of interest. My recommendation would be to require students to complete a certain number of responses that is LESS than the total number, but let them choose when (\"you must do reading responses 5 out of 8 weeks\", or something like that).",
    "The co-instructor, Leah Meth, made all the difference in the world about how the class was designed and ran. Without her efforts, the course would not have been as educational or organized. I suspect that this course varies very highly in it's effectiveness \/ organization based on the TA's \/ co-instruction. Well done Leah.",
    "Important distinction: Gordon is not an instructor. Thinking of him as such will only frustrate. Gordon is a facilitator, and an hands-off one at that. This course was co-facilitated by a recent graduate. Much like Gordon, though her title was that of co-instructor, she was not a teacher either. She too was a facilitator, and a very effective one in terms of travel and speaker logistics, though not in terms of group leadership.",
    "1. Readings were interesting and we were required to write weekly assignments, however only once did we discuss readings in class. Then what is the point of weekly readings? Just busy work? Additionally, maybe one, of the dozens assigned readings, were relevant to the topic at hand. This, on top of the large amount of client work, was too much. Discussion needed to be built into class time. 2. Guest lectures were disorganized and disjointed. While, many were very interesting, there was never any time for a recap or discussion. I think there would have been more of an impact if only 1\/2 the guest lectures were scheduled and we could have been given the time to talk more in depth about what perspectives the speakers were coming from and how to apply this perspective into work with our clients.",
    "Questions 8-10 were in reference to Leah Meth, who really taught the course."

   "comments": [
    "Going to the conference was great as were the other students in the class. I learned a lot from my fellow students.",
    "The class readings and online discussion forum were very beneficial to my learning. I also enjoyed the presentations on science communication, including on blog writing and storytelling. The World Parks Congress was also a great experiential learning experience and the highlight of the course.",
    "Being able to participate in the World Parks Congress was beyond comparison. Almost as high on the benefit ranking was the partnering with member organizations. I know not all students had the same experience, I was fortunate to have a relatively good stakeholder and so my experience was greatly enhanced by that partnership because of the exposure to how they work and the ability to have a reason to connect with that stakeholder. Without the stakeholder projects, I think students would lose those crucial connections going into the conference that can build incredible things even after the course.",
    "Ability to meet the prominent practitioners of today from around the world (examples from our conference: head of the US National Park Service, CEO of WWF, COO of National Parks Conservation Association, CEO of Y2Y, etc.) and have good conversations with them. Networking. Getting a feel for the state of (in our class) protected areas management globally.",
    "Our participation at WPC.",
    "The opportunity to attend an international conference and network with leaders and managers from governmental and non-governmental organizations. Working and connecting with scientists and managers from the stakeholder organizations.",
    "Travel to the World Parks Congress, and having exchanges with the other students in the class.",
    "The \"field trip\" to the World Parks Congress in Sydney offered the (perhaps) once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to join the dialogue about protected areas as an unaffiliated person interested in learning as much as possible and making as many connections as possible. Along those lines, the connections I made at the congress will be incredibly useful for future moves in my career. Finally, the relationship I and the other students were able to build with our stakeholder, the Wildlife Conservation Society, was invaluable. I look forward to working with many of those folks well into the future.",
    "The other students in it. This is primarily a 2nd year course, and people bring a wealth of interest and experience to the course that is awesome when it gets tapped into. Traveling together also built some lovely camaraderie. The trip, of course. I did not think I was taking the course to go to the congress and was genuinely looking forward to my stakeholder project more than anything else, but the trip is truly the point of the course.",
    "Geting to attend the WPC.",
    "Getting the chance to work with a major organization and do work that they actually use. Great connections at the WPC, and an awesome time in Australia.",
    "The various speakers",
    "The trip to the World Parks Congress was by far the most productive and educational aspect of the course. Connecting with dozens of conservation professionals was inspiring, eye-opening, and an important reality-check."

   "comments": [
    "The TA, Leah Meth, was not great. It was quite obvious she was over her head and unprepared for the role she was given. She was constantly unorganized and unprepared. Documents were constantly put up late onto ClassesV2, which negatively impacted students' ability to post their reading responses. Final deliverables constantly changed and were not consistent with the syllabus. Classes were overpacked, never with room for discussion or logistics planning. This is where Professor Geballe should have been playing a larger role. Leah should not have had to carry all these responsibilities alone--she was not prepared to do so. Additionally, Leah was unprofessional in her relationship with students. It was obvious Leah was involved in the class to advance her own career and that she didn't care about the careers of the student in the class (that is, unless it somehow helped Leah). Leah's behavior at the WPC was unprofessional and created more stress for the students rather than alleviate it. Over the course it became quickly apparent that Leah was willing to step on any student or throw any student under the bus if it advanced Leah's career. I understand the severity of these statements and stand behind them. In the future, I will choose not to work with Leah because of this class. Professor Geballe was so absent from the class's workings that I think he might have missed these political maneuverings.",
    "I was disappointed with my stakeholder project. I felt that there was a mismatch in expectations between students and the stakeholder (WCS) that could have been resolved by a written contract (formal or informal) outlining expectations, deliverables, and a timeline. While each group did complete such a document (although it was not shared with the stakeholder), it seemed that the stakeholder kept switching the project around and in the end it was quite different from originally expected. While I was glad to contribute to WCS' work, I felt that they got more out of the relationship than I did, since I ended up doing office-type administrative work, rather than something more valuable to my education and reflective of my expertise and skills. I would have liked to have had a project that both benefitted the stakeholder but also made use of the diverse skills of the students in the group, so that the students actually had an impact on the work being done by the stakeholder (e.g., contributions to research, writing, etc.) with appropriate recognition of the student contribution.",
    "Management of stakeholder commitments at the actual event seemed to be the biggest frustration among students. Some had relatively well balanced commitments, allowing them to explore topics of their own interest and make their own connections while others were almost constantly booked. Also, given this course was somewhat co-taught, it would be nice for students to have had the ability to provide feedback for both instructors.",
    "Classtime engagement with the readings and writing assignments. The readings were very interesting--but we never discussed them in class. The responsive writing assignments had an odd note to them, as I'm not sure they ever had an audience. Discussion could have been a stronger part of the course.",
    "Although working for 'clients' is great, there should be the option to simply participate as observers of conference dynamics. This would allow for a more critical analysis of conferences as a whole.",
    "Balancing the class-related workload with the project workload.",
    "It was too heavy a workload. Some assignments were less than necessary (e.g. should have options for reading responses, like having the option of skipping 2-3 weeks. The final report was also not necessary.)",
    "Some of the readings were not relevant to my topics I was working on, and the reading responses were just busy work and didn't seem to elevate class discussion as much as I would have liked. It favored people who could bullshit more than people who did the readings.",
    "The classroom experience needs a lot of work. Apparently we had more of a classroom experience than years past, though I don't know if this is saying much. Two points: 1) We did some really great readings that, if woven into the class, could have really informed our experience of our work and of the conference. However, readings were almost never discussed, with the exception of one student-led class. If we are being asked to engage with the readings enough to write a response about them each week, we should be discussing them in class. 2) Instead, class time was given over to invited speakers, many of whom were part of a speaker series that was rolled into class. Due to the interests of the course facilitator, the speakers were heavily involved with marine conservation, despite the majority of the class being involved with terrestrial conservation. Overall, the classroom experience was patchy, fragmented, and lacked time management.",
    "The TA for this course needs to be someone who is professional and experienced in all aspects of their life. Additionally, the TA needs to have the maturity to be able to provide mentorship. This year the TA was unprofessional and immature in every aspect: from leading up to the WPC, to at the WPC, to afterwards. She only cared about promoting herself and cared nothing about the students experience or the students relationship with their stakeholders. She held a steadfast belief that her way of doing things was the right way, she was forceful and intrusive in her 'networking style', something I never want to emulate, so I guess I learned that. Additionally, she created a hierarchal power structure, with herself at the top, that we all had to abide by. When hiring a TA for this course make sure they have some real world experience and a secure understanding of human relations.",
    "I think the relationships with the stakeholders could have been much clearer. What were they going to get from us? Us from them? What we're we going to do, and to get to do at the Congress... Are they actually going to use\/need the things we're producing, because if not it's a huge waste of our time.",
    "A little disorganized in terms of expectations",
    "The teaching assistant situation for this semester could have improved greatly. Leah was a very efficient logistics coordinator, and I appreciate all she managed to organize to make our trip to Sydney a success, but she did not provide the support each group needed to maximize client relationships. She was overly involved in certain groups, which detracted from student-client relationship building, and was absent for other groups. Generally, it felt as though Leah was more interested in building her own relationships with clients than facilitating the learning process for students."

I was fortunate, in that the conference we attended and its subject matter align exactly with my personal goals and interests. This will have a positive impact on the rest of my life, as it has given me invaluable perspective on the field I have worked in and will continue to work in.

    "It was extremely relevant, as I plan to enter the conservation field post-graduation, and am working on several conservation projects at FES. Provided the professional\/client experience, and the chance to be on the stage with other professionals at the WPC.",

Extremely relevant to my interests in conservation and the courses I am taking at this school. More courses in conservation should be offered - as this will rarely be a course on conservation and likely in the next few years will be focused on climate change or other more popular environmental topics.",

One disadvantage was that, given the particular skills of people in my group, some members had to do more work than others which was unavoidable because the other people in the group would not have been able to develop the needed skills to assist that student over the course of the semester.",
    "Advantages: realistic scenario, working in a group on a consultation project helped get a feel for what it would be like if we worked for those stakeholders. Great for brainstorming and dividing the workload. Disadvantages: The only main disadvantage is one of the main ones that normally comes with group work- opposing personalities and group politics. In a context like this where the connections more than the work is the most valuable thing students take away, imbalanced power dynamics can make it difficult for all students to benefit equally from these projects.",
    "Advantages: Great time to get to know other classmates and work with a stakeholder in our areas of interest. Great insight into inner workings of a big international NGO. Supportive team mates--who were helpful in post-processing thoughts about the conference as well. Disadvantages: lack of clear direction from stakeholders and lack of clearly defined role of students to stakeholders resulted in some inefficiencies in how our group time was spent. Final outcomes--with projects continuing forward--are very valuable, but we often felt uncertain and confused during the process.",
    "Working in groups was constructive, but the leadership structures where not democratically defined.",
    "Advantages: we were able to divide the work according to people's interests or strengths. Brainstorming worked better with more people to toss around ideas: Disadvantages: coming to agreement on anything took much longer, especially when it was done over email. Scheduling meetings was difficult was larger groups of people.",
    "I got to work with a great group- we had a lot of fun. Great to exchange ideas, and to divide up the workload when it get heavy.",
    "Advantages were that I got to know a group of students at FES who are interested in similar topics as myself. Disadvantages were that sometimes I felt like we had too many cooks in the kitchen.",
    "Our group was kind of all over the place, mostly as a result of an unclear relationship with our stakeholder, who kept altering our goals. At 5 people, we were also a little too large as a group for the project that we were doing, I think.",
    "Advantages include being able to divide and conquer workloads. Yet, as mentioned, the involvement of the TA in the group pretty much complicated all matters and aspects of our group. From undermining our collaborations and communications with stakeholders, to 'volunteering' our time for other things that we clearly didn't have time for, and using our work to advance herself, without actually doing any of the work. Thus, the group aspect of this course did not go smoothly.",

The World Parks Congress aligned perfectly with my interests, which made this class incredibly valuable to me--the positive repercussions of which I will likely feel for many years down the road. But this course would *not* have been as valuable if it were focused on a different conference outside of my area of interest. The in-class speaker presentations are open to all, and you could likely snag the reading list as well without joining the class. It was the conference itself, and working with a stakeholder who presented at the conference (thereby becoming intimately involved) that made it so specifically valuable.",
    "Make sure to choose a project you're interested in. Also, don't squeeze yourself into a corner with the work expected by the client. Give yourself space to explore your own interests at the conference. If you're too occupied by deliverables and tasks, there's a heavy opportunity cost.",
    "DO ANYTHING YOU CAN TO PRESENT AT YOUR CONFERENCE. Don't be intimidated, it will be an incredibly valuable experience for you. About half the talks I went to at WPC were terribly done - reading off powerpoints, too much text, too quiet, bad speakers, etc. Anyone at FES could do a better job - so go for it! You won't regret it.",

If you are extremely proactive and want to spend a lot of time massaging your stakeholder into letting you do a meaningful project or pursuing an alternative means of having an impact at the conference you will attend, take this course. Otherwise, I would proceed with caution. The travel reward is great, but you will definitely get more out of other classroom experiences.",
