    "Intense. I can see how transport is useful in many engineering fields, but be prepared to devote a significant amount of time to this class - it can consume your semester.",
    "This class sucks, but you\u0092re majoring in chemical engineering, so you\u0092re probably a masochist anyway. Sorry, that was mean, and your year is going to be rough enough without my snark. Keep chugging along, you\u0092re almost done. Almost...Professor Osuji is a great guy who genuinely cares about his students, but he doesn\u0092t quite understand that not everyone is as brilliant as he is. During lecture you should definitely stop him as often as you can to ask questions. I promise you no one else in the class will have any idea what\u0092s going on either, and the more you force him to stop or slow down and actually explain things, the better for everyone. Start the problem sets early, read the book since it\u0092s exactly what he puts up on the board, and become an expert with MatLab as soon as possible, because even though it\u0092s not a prerequisite, it really should be since Osuji expects you to be able to use it in just about every problem set. Lastly, if you\u0092re lucky enough to still be a freshman or sophomore looking into the classes you would have to take as a chem-e major, do yourself a favor and switch to something else if you\u0092re at all unsure that this is what you want to do. I may just be a jaded junior, but when over 3\/4 of the people in the major regret choosing it, I get the feeling it\u0092s probably not just me being whiny.",
    "If you are looking at this class, you will probably have to take it anyways. Depending on who teaches the class, it can definitely be an intense class material-wise. Be prepared to work together with classmates getting the problem set done, and spending chunks of time studying to learn the material. You will be okay at the end though, good luck!",
    "Heat transfer, mass transfer, and momentum transfer, and how they relate.",
    "This is a requirement for the Chemical Engineering major, but you do get a lot our of the course and Professor Osuji goes through the material very thoroughly. However, this does require a lot of work and you will go through several lectures not understanding the material until you finally get it. Overall a very good class and you come out of it knowing core material of the chemical engineering major.",
    "Only take if you're chemE. This is a very difficult course. Problem sets took a long time."
