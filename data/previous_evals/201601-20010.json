    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Really nice TF. Easy to reach via email and always available to talk in person. Very good leader in sections, took the \"pressure\" off of exams, which allowed me to focus on the material itself.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom was extremely well versed in the material and presented stimulating questions for discussion during section. He was very kind and considerate of all the students and encouraged questions. Tom is an outstanding teaching fellow and will be an asset to academia in the future.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Thanks to him, I had a great semester!",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0I think Tom was very helpful. This may not have been his fault but had to do with class structure, but I often felt like we weren't engaging deeply in the texts. Rather, I feel like we were often skimming the surface of arguments and only engaging in summaries instead of getting into substantive discussions. A time where I found this particularly frustrating was the class period on sexuality, where Tom had us write down some of our thoughts on the strengths and weaknesses of different arguments. I feel like this was probably done because it was such a heated topic. I understand that it would've been a difficult conversation to have, but if we're going to have it anywhere, academically, that would've been the place. I didn't like being denied the chance to really discuss it.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom was very approachable! He was a great facilitator of section. He ensured everyone in the group had an opportunity to say something. He was prepared and organized. He also started and ended on time. He was proactive in addressing concerns and able to address questions students had about assignments and course material.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0He was able to create an inclusive environment in sections, so every student can feel comfortable to speak up.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Made himself very accessible Fair grader",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom is great! He clearly cares for his students and knows his subject matter. He's a wonderful teacher!",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom is a great TF, incredibly responsive and kind. His sense of rigor in discussion is complemented by a graciousness in his facilitation style. At times, though, he seemed a bit rigidly attached to maintaining certain threads in the conversation, not always being flexible enough to fluidly move the conversation in the direction he ultimately wanted to go.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom is very knowledgeable and a great TF.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom did an amazing job with a huge section. He was able to keep conversations on task and he encouraged all students to fully participate. His presence in the classroom created a calming and welcoming effect, which allowed students to feel comfortable opening up more about themselves and their academic journey.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom helped us focus on understanding the key arguments of the articles we'd read for section, and made sure we knew the relevant Biblical texts. He also helpfully encouraged us to engage with our own traditions and formation to see how we've been taught to read the Bible and think about the issue under discussion. Tom faced the challenge of encouraging deep and balanced engagement with controversial Biblical texts in a group of people that often didn't see the value of such an enterprise, either because of ethical issues related to even thinking about certain viewpoints, or because for them such texts need not be read as scripture. He did a great job keeping us focused on listing and analyzing the relevant arguments. Tom's knowledge of early Christian biblical interpretation was a welcome boon, giving us a broader perspective on the types of questions we were asking.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom was a kind and courteous Teaching Fellow. Overall, he did a good job leading the section discussions. I looked forward to our weekly meetings. I do believe that Tom's grading was a bit too severe and I disagree with the logic that harsh grades are warranted on a major paper because people scored so well on a midterm exam.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Very good.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom did a good job of mangaing the classroom and encouraging students to contribute. I liked many of the ways he went about facilitating conversation. However, sometimes I think we spent too much time reviewing the basics of the secondary readings without going deep enough into them. I liked that we did a quick summary, I just wish it were briefer so that sections could spend more time digging into issues. The more in depth conversations we had about slavery for example (and 1 Cor 7) were great. Sometimes we talked about implications of applying the text (like women in church leadership and whether one should force a belief, for the sake of justice, on cultures, particularly non-Western ones), and I think these were great but sometimes got a bit too off topic.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Tom is very kind and very knowledgeable about the Bible. My final paper however was graded unfairly. I spent the whole semester digging into Paul's understanding of both our worldly and resurrected bodies. Admittedly there were problems with the genre of my first paper which was supposed to be a traditional exegesis paper. My second assignment, however, deeply based on the first, was by definition an alternative writing piece with a real world application. I had been asked by a magazine (christian century) to write about the NT and the body.The work I did on the passage while not obvious in this piece, was absolutely FOUNDATIONAL. It was not obvious because I was trying to make a better piece of writing FOR my real world application. I was also criticized for not writing in prose. Modern day prose can include sentence fragments, allusions, poetic license, humor, imagined dialogue. It is simply not fair to ask us for something alternative and then not be able to recognize the values imbedded in an alternative when you get it. If you want to keep us in our boxes and make sure exegesis papers stay in the classroom, then don't invite us to step outside of those boxes. If you want us to step out of those boxes and let this work matter to us and potentially let it matter more to the world... be open to feeling differently about what you read. All of this brings into question what the Bible is in the first place, a very good question indeed.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Coffman Schmidt \u00a0Strengths: Holding space for and validating different viewpoints in discussion; bringing in material and speaking to his own interest in a way that offers further insight to the texts studied; skill in explaining material clearly and concisely in ways that never felt patronizing. Weaknesses: Not cutting off conversations tangential to course content that went on too long; giving a little too much space for vocal members of the class to guide the discussion",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0This is feeling a bit saccharine, but the following is also sincere and tempered. Zachary is an EXCEPTIONAL teaching fellow. He also spends considerable time with his students. His review of my first essay was so thorough that there was no utility in asking for any further clarification. The above can be accomplished by many, however, provided they put in the time. Perhaps the greatest challenge facing any NT Intro teaching fellow, however, is the same faced by Prof. Dinkler, viz., having a mixed MDiv and Mar student body. Since the sections were often responsive to morally controversial topics, Zachary faced a serious challenge framing the discussions impartially, and encouraging, to the extent possible, the expression of contrary views. This he did marvelously. I never knew where he stood on any of these issues. I only have suspicions even now. He also balanced the different levels of academic training his students possessed. Some of us were more responsive to abstract discussion, others more receptive to pastorally focused questions. Zachary nimbly negotiated this balance. I would suggest to Zachary that, and this is particularly troubling for a dedicated scholar, he should spend more time with the M.Div students who may struggle to see how otherwise abstract discussions could and should inform their pastoral care. The above two strengths, contrary to reviewing essays, etc., are the kinds of strengths that \"can't be taught.\" Here I hope Zachary is given permission to read this review. He is a natively gifted future professor. His students will be fortunate, indeed, to have him as their professor. Thank you as well Zachary.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0See above.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Zachary is a great facilitator and very knowledgeable. Many times during section he would offer additional scholars not listed on the syllabus for us to read.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Zachary was one of the absolute best TFs I've had in my time at YDS. Always prepared, thoroughly knowledgeable, and in control of the classroom. I was appreciative of the careful reading he gave my exegesis paper and his thoughtful commentary (which was correct). He's also just fun, and that's a big help. He's really going to be a wonderful professor.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Zach is a great section leader. He is good at leading discussion and at drawing connections between the comments that students say. He made section helpful and enjoyable.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Zachary was great at making sure everyone was able to voice their thoughts and opinions and as an introvert I appreciated his understanding and ability to include me in a way that lessens my anxiety in group settings.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Zachary was one of the best teaching fellows that I had while at TDS. He was organized, prepared and insightful. He was respectful of everyone and patient. I highly recommend him.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Fantastic job leading and conducting sections. Communication regarding weekly meetings and additional and necessary information was fantastic. Overall, my only complaint is similar to last semester. The expectations and directions regarding the exegesis paper were unclear.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Undoubtedly the best teaching fellow I have had at Yale. He displayed fair and reasonable expectations that were both rigorous yet balanced, healthy knowledge of the subject, clear indications that he put care and effort into planning sections outside of class, great feedback, respect for student opinions, healthy facilitation of discussion balanced with times where we were able to receive his opinion\/perspectives on subjects where he was more learned.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Zachary did a poor job of making expectations understood. His approach to grading was inconsistent and seemed arbitrary.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Zachary was organized and prepared for sections. He consistently tried to engage all students in our discussions and was able to do so.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Zach did a great job. Extremely tough grader in my opinion but fair, no complaints about it. I am committed to improvement and appreciate such things.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Section time was used in a helpful way. Section time is usually wasted time, so this is actually a huge compliment to Zachary.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0He was very well organized. Always sent emails before section with clear instructions. Facilitated healthy discussion. He's going to be a great professor.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Zachary was very supportive of the learning process in this course. He facilitated the discussions well in the section meetings. I found his comments on my papers to be thorough, insightful and encouraging. He obviously cares about his students and their progress. Thank you very much.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Zachary was a phenomenal TA. It is clear that he cares about the subject material and his students. I appreciated the energy and expertise he brought to section. At times he may have spoken a little too much, but I appreciated the consistent direction and thought provoking questions that he provided. He was also very effective and ensuring that everyone had room to speak in the class and was great at time management. One of the best TF's I have had so far at YDS.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Love Zachary. Extremely knowledgable, thoughtful, respectful. Demanded a lot. He wasn't \"easy\" but really always felt he wanted us to learn. Nice easy going manner, organized. I hope he stays in teaching. Really very good."
