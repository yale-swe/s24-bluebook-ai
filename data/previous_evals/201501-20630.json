    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in primates. Especially for those people who study living primates this class is great because it provides you a glimpse into primate evolution.",
    "This class deals with the origin and diversity of primates. It is great for paleontological background and I would definitely recommend this class to any anthropologist.",
    "In PD&E, you learn about mammalian evolution, the mammal groups closely related to primates, and the major primates groups in the context of their evolutionary history and morphology. A new group is introduced every week, generally along with some current or recent primary topics of interest being studied by the experts researching those groups. These topics bring us larger issues in evolutionary biology that are discussed."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped me to better understand general patterns of primate evolution. I learned a lot about extinct primate taxa as well as how those taxa fit into the general primate phylogeny.",
    "Through learning more about variation in primates and through my final paper, which I hope to work towards publishing, this class will be helpful in my career.",
    "This course much strengthened by background in primate evolutionary history\/paleontology. Even if I probably won't remember much of the relevant morphology, at least now I will know what the different primate relative and fossil primate groups are that my colleagues talk about and study, which seems pretty important for a biological anthropologist! Most importantly, I think this course will really help me for teaching, particularly about primate origins, but also about primate evolution in general, as well as what some of the main issues are related to certain primate groups. This course didn't contribute to my dissertation research that much yet! But I think it will be mostly helpful in thinking about big questions that are interesting in primate evolution that I can hope to touch on with my dissertation research."
