   "comments": [
    "A survey of modern historical and political thinkers. Worth all the effort.",
    "I would totally recommend Directed Studies. Even if you're not into the humanities or will be majoring in something in the math or sciences, you will learn so much from doing Directed Studies and probably enjoy it, too.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is willing to read a lot of text very closely and is prepared to think deeply about what authors are trying to say. It is rewarding, but only if you make it so.",
    "This course involves a lot of reading -- but almost all of the reading is incredibly interesting, and the course as a whole is great. It involves a lot more political theory than the previous semester, so people who were dismayed by the sheer amount of history first semester will probably like this one a lot more. The thinkers are all very relevant, and I felt like this class provided a grounding for a lot of courses I might want to take in future years. Professor Thompson is great -- her section was enjoyable and informative, and she gave excellent feedback on essays.",
    "Second semester DS H&P is much more theoretical but much more applicable to the world than first semester. Brace yourself for tough readings and very little history. Professor Thompson is intimidating, but in the end what you've learned should make up for any stress you may have experienced because of her. I recommend the class to anyone who is excited by challenging material and deep thought.",
    "Prof thompson is SO SMART. She's a little intimidating but it was worth it. Great class great material great discussion.",
    "I really enjoy the curriculum of history\/political thought. There were so many thought provoking questions and themes that were considered and of course it's just nice to finally read the text of all the big guys directly. Thompson is a great section leader and directs conversation well. She doesn't intimidate so that students feel comfortable enough to speak in discussion, and doesn't dominate the discussion either, preferring to let students go on until she gets to a point where she will jump in and add her own input to sort of supplement the students' conversations.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. Directed Studies is not for everyone, but if youare willing to commit to it (and are a fast reader) this is an excellent program for freshmen interested in humanities. History and Politics, in particular, really helped me change the way I look at world history and politics: all the books that we've read were extremely interesting and thought-provoking. Also, Norma Thompson is an incredible professor: she is really knowledgeable, helpful and approachable.",
    "DS really helped make my freshman year great. Honestly, I feel worried going into sophomore year because I wouldn't have the support that DS offers. You are given the chance to study a huge range of works in a small seminar setting with other students who are really smart and have similar interests and then listen to lectures given by people who have studied the works for years. Also, the DS community is so supportive and fun. I would definitely recommend DS!",
    "This is an incredible course which provides a great foundation for understanding political thought and for opening up a discussion about how ideas evolve and influence each other.",
    "The second semester of directed studies history and politics covers political thought beginning with Machiavelli and ending with Hannah Arendt. In taking this course you will learn to engage closely with the political thought of different authors from different historical periods and learn how to analyze and write about their ideas. You will also learn how to compare different thinkers and will begin to see differences and similarities in how they think about the role politics and of history. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in the humanities because of the basis it will give you for anything you read afterward--whether in the field of history, literature, or philosophy. I went into the course as someone who did not have a great interest in political history and came out with a desire to learn more about intellectual history and how political thought fits into its historical and literary contexts. This course definitely focuses more on political philosophy\/political thought than onhistory in a traditional sense, but you do learn a bit about each historical period through reading each different text."
