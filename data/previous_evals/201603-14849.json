   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "more knowledge about economic growth. I learned about building models and I gained insights into new monetary systems.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about different growth theories, the lasting impacts of historical institutions on present-day economies, and the theories associated with inter-temporal consumption, job-matching, and the impacts of monetary\/fiscal policies. Additionally, I was introduced to new forms of money, how these forms have benefited various societies, and the potential future impacts of these digital currency systems.",
    "More changes to the standard growth models learnt in undergrad",
    "I gained a better understanding of macroeconomic theories as well as economic policies that can help to address some of the biggest issues in the world, including poverty alleviation and international development. Furthermore, the course helped me to learn new skills in STATA. The coursework was also rigorous and tested my understanding of the economic concepts and my ability to apply it to empirical observations.",
    "growth accounting, economic steady state, consumption",
    "This was a wonderful class that really look my basic knowledge from my undergraduate Macroeconomics classes and built upon them. Though the first half of the course we went through the Solow model which anyone who has taken undergraduate Macroeconomics has seen, but we spent a lot of time with it and we really developed it with all the complexities that the Solow Model can encompass. Then throughout the second half of the semester, we went through numerous different models that allowed us to discuss topics that are foundational in Macroeconomics. I was particularly fond of this part of the semester because many of these models I had not seen before. I feel this section of the course really helped to build my knowledge of Macroeconomics. I also really loved that we had guest speakers come in throughout the course to teach us various topics that they were expert in. These were the moments that truly made this class exceptional!",
    "Solow model and other important theories in explaining development",
    "Economic knowledge",
    "I learnt a great deal about growth models, unemployment, consumption and other topics in Macroeconomics. The problem sets were useful and challenging. I also had the opportunity to develop some skills in excel and stata.",
    "- Growth models - Ability to relate thoeretical models to real world events e.g. failure of conventional monetary policy, recessions",
    "The course was really very interesting and well taught. I am more interested in macroeconomics as a result. I only wish it was a 2 semester course instead of one; it was too short, there was a lot more I wanted to learn. However, the class was incredibly interesting and well taught (that too despite a 3 hour class on Fridays)!",
    "I developed a broad understanding of growth theories and an ability to comprehend the underlying macroeconomic dynamics.",
    "I understood better how models can be built upon, from simple to complex ones that are able to explain aspects of the economy to certain degrees.",
    "The course was helpful in building intuition of the many modifications that can be applied to traditional macroeconomic models. There were also several instances to apply the concepts to trace real-world developments and understanding past macroeconomic trends."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved the guest lectures and especially the one on new monetary systems, the zero lower bound and mobile money.",
    "Couldn't really find any weaknesses. I do wish we could have covered international trade, however, we did have some scheduling issues that we worked around so I understand why we couldn't get to everything this semester.",
    "good comprehensive lectures, but perhaps we could have had better delivery of the course in terms of having more sessions instead of one long lecture that will have helped in the learning.",
    "I think that the tutors are very succinct and are very clear in their explanations of the economic concepts. They are also very helpful. Furthermore, the assignments are very rigorous and helped to improve my understanding of macroeconomic concepts on top of my undergraduate work. It could be improved further if there is more training provided on stata and perhaps other types of econometric software.",
    "I really enjoyed the course. It was well-structured, there was room for discussion in class and the models were always applied to actual economic developments, which I really enjoyed. It would have been nice to show economic data from a more diverse set of countries rather than solely focusing on the US, China and India. For example, I really liked the lecture on institutions, the case on the Mita natural experiment etc., because it introduced research on other countries.",
    "The strengths of this course are the guest lecturers. These were a great opportunity for us to learn about Macroeconomics from experts! I also generally think that another great strength is the class structure. Only meeting once a week and being about to go through a complete model each week is very beneficial. I honestly can't think of any weaknesses for this course. I have really enjoyed this course.",
    "Strengths -The important of foundation of the model -The way of teaching Weakness -Could have use the real world examples\/recent research to incorporate with the course",
    "Already very well structured.",
    "Strength- The course material (slides, readings) are highly relevant and very useful. Weakness- The scope of the syllabus is quite broad considering the time crunch of one semester.",
    "Strengths: - Good coverage of the main macro topics Weaknesses: - Could involve more discussion on empirical papers - Could include topics on international trade models",
    "The strength of this course is that a variety of different models were taught. The weakness is that it is a survey course- it felt as if we learned a bunch of different things but without any depth to any of them. That is more a consequence of the time constraints of a semester than the instructors. Personally, I would have enjoyed learning about trade models and foreign aid; but I understand that it would have come at the cost of another just as important model.",
    "It's super clear and well instructed.",
    "It covers a wide aspect of macroeconomics very well. It would've been better if it wasn't one class in a week.",
    "Strengths - The assignments help to extend classroom teaching to applying it with intuition and software. The curriculum covered a wide range of traditional and contemporary concepts and global trends.",
    "I think the course could have delved into more foundational macroeconomics. We could have also focused a little more on research papers in macro, given that it is a one-semester course with a more applied focus. The course focused on very interesting applications of Macro, which I really appreciate as well."

    "Yes, definitely!",

    "Yes, I think that this is one of the most important economic courses and I will strongly recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes. This is a core module for IDE students.",
    "Absolutely! Great course, if you would like to learn more about growth and macroeconomics and pick up some research\/data analysis skills along the way.",
    "Yes, this is a great class. It will be a lot of work but it is an incredibly enjoyable class.",
    "Yes I do!",
    "I highly recommend this course to any student who has already taken introductory Economics courses before.",
    "Yes, if they would like to take a course that gives a good overview of major topics in macro",
    "Yes. It is a broad sweeping course; if the student has previous extensive knowledge of macroeconomics this will seem too shallow. However, it is a great course; very interesting and well taught, especially with Gaurav and Taha.",
    "Yes, excellent course",
    "I will certainly recommend this course to another student. My recommendation is due to the fact that the instructor was very enthusiastic and diligent in explaining arcane concepts with simplicity. Essentially, this facilitated a buoyant learning experience.",
    "Yes. It's a challenging but great course!",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. For those interested in Macroeconomics, it's a great course.",
