   "comments": [
    "Focused on the paper. Very in depth.",
    "I'd recommend this to anyone with an interest in American politics. You learn a lot about our political system and some of its major figures. It's also nice because it focuses on recent history and even some current events. It's fun to be able to read the news and then discuss it in class with a knowledgeable professor. Doing the research project is a pretty cool experience and I enjoyed it a lot. An appropriate workload and it's all interesting.",
    "Great if you are interested in politics, especially current affairs",
    "This class was super boring. I had read previous positive reviews and thought it was going to be great. But it was horrible. First, don't take this class if you aren't majoring in PLSC because polisci majors are the absolute worst. They think they know everything (because they know esoteric facts) but they're smug and horrible. Anyway, I was hoping to learn more about Congress in this class because I actually find it interesting. But I didn't learn very much. Half of the classes, Professor Powell didn't even teach; we were either watching videos or class was cancelled or students were presenting their research. It was honestly a huge waste of time. I don't recommend taking this course at all.",
    "I'd recommend it if you have any desire to go into something politics related after graduation. It's not too hard, and some of the readings are very interesting.",
    "If you are interested in Congress you need to take this class! The readings are genuinely interesting and writing the research paper is rewarding because it is broken down into manageable, stress-free segments. If you want to learn how to write a proper political science paper, this is the perfect atmosphere--a lot of help and encouragement.",
    "I would recommend it to any student interested in Congress\/American political history. Even if you know a lot about American politics already, you'll learn a ton in this class -- and the independent research project will really let you spread your wings (should you so choose).",
    "Awesome intro course to learning about writing PLSC research",
    "I would recommend this class to someone looking for a not too stressful seminar. If you pick an interesting paper topic, you'll end up spending a lot of time learning about something you enjoy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this seminar. However, you must have a passion for Congressional studies. This is not a primer class; rather, it is very detailed and expects you to have some base understanding of Congress. Professor Powell is a wonderful professor, and she really makes the class great."
