   "comments": [
    "I learned how to read, write and speak the Arabic language at the elementary level.",
    "I definitely gained a good foundation of the Arabic language and acquired basic speaking skills.",
    "Students are assisted in mastering the arabic alphabet, learning basic and conversational vocabulary, rules of speech, sentence structure, and presentation skills.",
    "As this was a Level 1 Language course, everything we learned was new to us. We learned to read and write the Arabic alphabet, construct sentences using various structures, conjugation and tenses of verbs, and expanded our vocabulary. All in all, a great semester.",
    "This class was excellent for practicing the fundamentals of MSA, and learning some of the differences between MSA and Levantine dialect. I don't quite feel like I could survive in an Arabic speaking country, but I feel like I've got a good handle on the fundamentals for sure.",
    "How to begin writing the Arabic alphabet fluently and the basics of Arabic Grammar, with a little idea of how to speak the native dialect of the Levant.",
    "I learned a new alphabet and a new language, along with beginning to learn about a different culture. I learned to think differently about words and sentences and sounds because Arabic is so different from any of the languages I've studied before.",
    "I learned how to read, write, speak, and comprehend Arabic in a much more constructive and developed way than I could have imagined. I also learned a great amount about the diverse scope of Middle Eastern culture, and the cultural and linguistic varieties in different areas (along with learning 3 different dialects).",
    "I learned a lot of vocabulary and basic grammar skills.",
    "I learned how to improve handwriting, understand using context, and I developed vocabulary."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot. If anything, students should seek words and grammar they don't know online to supplement their learning.",
    "It is extremely disorganized. I didn't feel like I really had a handle on things until the middle of the course. Al-kitaab has the most illogical flow of any textbook I've ever had. I feel like we could've done more in the course if we had more organization.",
    "I love Professor Aziz!!! He is tough but fair and is a fantastic teacher. Sometimes the homework assignments were unclear, however.",
    "I think the fact that the course is taught daily works well since it is a language course. It was important to get back in the classroom and practice Arabic every day. It's not so much that the course would be improved, but the Arabic department might consider instituting a Sha'mi dialect only track\/course for those students interested and maintain the MSA track for every one else.",
    "It was sort of unclear which work was optional and which work was required, and the workload was very very book heavy. My favorite parts of the class were when we did activities from outside the book, like reading the short story at the end of class or playing charades or doing presentations. Perhaps more of that?",
    "Strengths are the thoroughness and relevance of vocal and grammar learning for the tests -weaknesses include the irrelevance of a lot of the online assignments.",
    "I think this is a pretty well-run course. I liked how we began with conversation and learning the alphabet. I think it can sometimes feel a little scattered in the organization of the class in terms of what kind of vocab we are learning, or whether we are learning vocab or grammar or both. I also wish we could have spent a little more time on pronunciation and accent, because I definitely needed to work on that.",
    "I think the class was a little disorganized at first, in how the assignments were given out- hopefully the discrepancies between the syllabus and what the \"online textbook\" assigns can be solved next time around.",
    "The class needs more structure and maybe insight into the Arab culture. Needs more focus on shami"

   "comments": [
    "Take it if you want to know a critical language.",
    "Yes, if they really want to learn Arabic but not just as a fun, interesting course. It's too much work for that because you literally have to teach yourself.",
    "Yes, but only if you truly want to learn arabic. The language and course rigors are difficult, so you need to be determined!",
    "Being a language course, it is really a matter of whether or not the language interests the student. I think Arabic is a wonderful language and can be very useful in the future, so I would certainly recommend it. I learned a lot in my first semester of the language and am sure they would, too.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were willing to put in the work. You also kind of have to meet Aziz halfway on a lot of things, so it's hard to recommend the class wholly without reservation, but I enjoyed myself and my classmates, and I felt like I learned a lot.",
    "Yes, a very good introduction to Arabic.",
    "Yes I definitely would. I think Arabic is an amazing language and everyone should get the chance to appreciate the beauty of the language and the culture.",
    "Definitely. This is a class that is a lot of fun to take and if there is any interest in learning a new language, or learning about the multi-faceted culture of the Middle East and Arabic speaking countries, I would advise this as a great first step into the Arabic-speaking world.",
    "The professor is very friendly and it's an enjoyable experience plus you actually learn how to speak Arabic.",
    "Yes I certainly would. The class was very enjoyable, and I learned a lot."
