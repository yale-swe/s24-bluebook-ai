   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the class to a fellow student. The material is very new and fascinating and Professor Kaufman will make the class very engaging.",
    "Recommended for anyone who is interested in human rights issues and global issues. And take it if you want a great professor.",
    "PLSC 125 is about examining the political and social issues that arise from rapidly developing technology . I would greatly recommend this to another student because it is highly relevant no matter what field a student is going into, and because it is taught in a dynamic manner.",
    "Take this class! Professor Kaufman cares a lot about the material and is infinitely knowledgeable, the material is fascinating, and the guest speakers are all really cool. I learned far more than I expected to and got way more out of the class than I thought I would, and that is what defines a successful class for me.",
    "Great course! Incredibly interesting and relevant. There was a lot of reading, but most of the articles were actually enjoyable because they were news articles from the NY times or other news outlets. Professor Kaufman also brought in several guest lecturers that were experts on the topic that we were discussing for the week.",
    "PLSC 125 is a class that covers the very current world where media (in all its forms) and politics become intertwined, so if you are looking for a course that allows you to talk about this relationship then this is the course for you.",
    "Take it!!",
    "A wide but deep treatment of a number of \"politics and media\" related themes: social media, the link between speech and violence, information technology and development, censorship etc, often with a legal twist. Lots of guests were brought in, so we meet cool peeps and saw how the world actually handles these issues. Zach took us out to pizza twice and gave us a ton of advice about real life\/post grad decisions (esp. related to law\/grad school and government\/private work). He's the perfect combination of super relatable (he's graduated from Yale in 2000) and qualified to advice you. Also as a JD he's willing and able to engage in that side of the conversation, which can be super useful.",
    "Yes! Definitely take this course if you get the chance. The professor is great and the readings are always interesting.",
    "This was definitely one of my most favorite courses of the semester (and I've been around Yale for quite a while). The reading was good, the class discussion was good, the final presentations of final papers were interesting and diverse, and the other students in the course had interesting things to say. I was not a huge fan of the guest speakers, so hopefully that changes. But overall I think this topic is a really important and interesting topic with a TON of room for relevant and updated examples\/applications\/further research and if the course is taught in the future you should definitely consider taking it!",
    "Excellent survey of some of the most prescient issues in today's political climate (social media activism, the role of media in international atrocities, Snowden and public access to information, etc.). This is a fast-paced seminar with a correspondingly significant amount of work (100-150 pages of reading per class, plus a ~14 page midterm paper and longer final paper), and expectations are high, so I would not recommend this course to a student who has never taken a PLSC seminar before. That said, Kaufman is excellent at offering his own expertise on very complex issues while still encouraging (respectful) dissent and discussion in the classroom. If you have some background in contemporary politics and want to push yourself in thinking about how structures of technology and media shape the world, consider this course."
