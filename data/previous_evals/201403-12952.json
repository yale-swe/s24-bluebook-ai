    "If you're interested in the topic, recommend. Great lecturer, interesting material.",
    "This is a great way to get an introduction into American art before 1900 and I definitely recommend it. The papers aren't too bad, the exams are, but if you go into it knowing that and knowing the work you have to put in, it's still really great and you can get a lot out of it!",
    "Do you like operating theaters, Puritan babies with wonky faces, and sprawling South American landscapes? HSAR 217 is for you! This the second HSAR class I've taken with Jennifer Raab and she is a great lecturer with a straightforward and info-packed style -- it might not be to everyone's taste so shop it before you take it. Would recommend, especially if you are an American history buff but unfamiliar with our great country's early artistic traditions.",
    "Take it! Great class!!!",
    "An absolute must-take! American Art and Visual Culture to 1900 was without a doubt the best art history class I have taken at Yale. I am an art history major, but I had never studied American art before this course; and now I can confidently say that it is my favorite domain of art history. Professor Raab is an amazing lecturer and scholar, and I enjoyed class every single day. This class was the perfect example of what makes art history classes great we learned about individual works of art, but were also asked to make broader connections and find larger themes that really enriched our experience and expanded our thinking about what we were learning in lecture and in section. Section in the Yale Art Gallery was also amazing because we have such a great collection of American art right here in New Haven. I would recommend this class both to majors and non-majors, because its a great experience and Professor Raab is not one to miss.",
    "Take this course. It was the best one I've taken at Yale so far. The professor is brilliant, as are the TA's. Lecture is a joy, getting to listen to Professor Raab talk eloquently and insightfully about important artworks and important history. Section is even more of a joy, getting to talk amongst yourselves about the actual works in Yale's Art Gallery - like a fun, but more informed visit to an art museum. The assigned readings and even the two exams are enjoyable, giving you a chance to make connections between all the works we look at over the semester. The first paper is pure description and the final paper includes more research about the same object, allowing for a deep and meaningful understanding of your individualized niche of American art by the end of the course. I've found that I'm able to think, talk, write, and research about art much better after having taken this course and been surrounded by the people who lead it. I'm an art history major, but it would have been a manageable and beneficial course for anyone, not requiring any background knowledge or too big of an image load. The course and all if its materials were extremely well organized, which I respected. My sadness at this class having ended is made okay only by the fact that Professor Raab is teaching another course on American art this spring.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It was extremely engaging and enlightening. For anyone who would consider themselves more math\/science inclined, my only advice would be to take this course Credit\/D\/Fail because the papers are not graded generously and the midterm and final require a large amount of memorization.",
    "Amazing course!! Brilliantly taught. Take this!!",
    "Couldn't ask for a better first experience with History of Art. The material was basically the background on every painting or image you've seen in an American History textbook, which is pretty cool if you're a history fan; you gain an understanding of the social and political nature of America throughout its history through photography, print, sculpture, and paintings. Professor Raab is wonderful, and the sections in the YUAG introduce you to one of the gallery's best collections. Would absolutely recommend.",
    "Great course that provides a comprehensive view of American art, with some basic American history, up until 1900. I was not sure how I felt about American art before this class, but I discovered several fantastic painters along the way such as Thomas Cole, Frederic Church, John Singer Sargent, etc. The two exams for the class are very doable, and while the 10-page research paper is a challenge, it is rewarding in the end. Section in the gallery is fantastic. And Professor Raab is a wonderful lecturer, very kind and clearly extremely knowledgeable in her field.",
    "take this course! Professor Raab's lectures are incredibly engaging and vivid, and section in the YUAG is a treat. also, not a lot of work.",
    "Course on American art that also lends an understanding of the cultural foundations of the country. I would definitely recommend it for reasons that should be pretty clear from my previous answers.",
    "Take the course if you're interested in a survey of pre-twentieth century American Art. This course does a great job of covering this material in a thematic way.",
    "prof. raab is a great lecturer--her lectures were always brilliantly arranged in order to cover lots of ground in just 50 minutes. i shopped the course for fun and ended up taking it because i enjoyed her first lecture so much. listed under hsar but also a great course for amst majors (it should be crosslisted!) as it offers a survey of visual culture from puritan new england through the civil war and ends with the turn of the century.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! Raab is absolutely amazing, the readings are fantastic and not overwhelming and the material really exposes you to an artistic heritage that many people don't particularly think about. A place of immigrants, the American Art story shared in this course is a window into an amazing, changing world. Great for people of all majors and something that fits any schedule as a 5th or as someone testing out the Art History waters."
