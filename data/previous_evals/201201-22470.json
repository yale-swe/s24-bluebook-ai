    "MCDB 341L is an awesome class. Throughout the course of the class you're assigned to imaging an organ of a mouse. Using light microscopy methods and transmission electron microscopy, you investigate the cell and tissue ultrastructure of your organ. Time commitment: during the semester you're supposed to go in ~2-3 hours in addition to class time. Requirements: a 10-page paper at the beginning and a 25-30 page paper at the end. Don't worry about the 30 pages--it's pretty straightforward and can be written in a couple of days if you're in a crunch. YOU WILL LEARN SO MUCH IN THIS LAB. DEFINITELY TAKE IT. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST STRUCTURED AND TAUGHT COURSES IN THE BIO DEPT.",
    "This was a very straightforward, not very rigidly structured, but pretty interesting class. You select an organ from a mouse, take light and electron micrographs, and then analyze your images. Analyzing your images, identifying structures, and then writing the very long final paper takes more time than you'd think it would but you learn a lot about the organ you select. It's actually very cool to see all the different structures in the tissue sections. Overall, not very stressful but you put in a lot of work outside of class.",
    "I would summarize this class as a great experience but a ton of work. You will end up putting in at least one full credit's worth of work during the semester, and probably more. In addition to three hours of class time per week, we came in 2-3 extra hours each week and the whole month of April I was probably doing four times that amount when I began working on my paper as well. You will do a lot of writing too: one 10 page paper and one 25-30 page paper, in addition to a 10 minute presentation. However, this work is (mostly) worth it in exchange for the experience of looking at cells firsthand under the scope! You will produce great pictures and really learn a ton about your organ, plus it's so amazing to be seeing things on the nanometer level. It also wasn't graded too harshly. Just be aware that you will likely put in way more work than you're anticipating. It's not that the work is hard, there's just a lot to do.",
    "A great biology lab course to take. At the beginning of the semester you are given an organ and spend the entire semester working on a paper.",
    "Excellent. A lab where you feel like you have a tangible goal and where you're working to create a tangible product. You learn a lot of useful skills for bio labs (using a light microscope, an electron microscope, fixing tissues, staining, etc.). I didn't feel the workload was a lot at all, contrary to some of the comments from past years."
