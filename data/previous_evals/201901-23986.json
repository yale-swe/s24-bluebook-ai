   "comments": [
    "Learned a great deal about the development of ideas of and within Buddhism in the modern period. Had an opportunity to see who is working in the field and the different approaches they take.",
    "Understanding the history and development of Korean Buddhism in a transnational perspective",
    "I learned about modern Asian Buddhism and how to view Buddhism from a global perspective.",
    "I feel like I gained a good sense of the historical arc of modern Buddhism as it developed trans-nationally around SE and East Asia. It was also helpful to see how different scholars are tackling perennial questions of religion and modernity.",
    "Over the course of the semester, we covered nearly two centuries of Buddhist history. We began with the shift in Ceylon from premodern modes of Buddhism to a kind of Protestant Buddhism and concluded with transnational understandings of Buddhist modernism in East Asia. Our discussions were anchored by memorable readings, both from primary material (e.g. Olcotts Buddhist Catechism, Dharmapalas court proceedings, Han Youngun and Kim Iryops treatises) and secondary sources. As the seminar progressed, we tried our best to keep track of various threads of intellectual development in different places over time in order to see how those threads converged. Some of these threads include the histories from Orientalist productions of knowledge in the 18th century, the influence of Christian missionaries, and the rise of nationalism in Buddhist histories. Overall, the course challenged my views on how modern Buddhism might be defined and understood. In turn, Im leaving the class with even more questions about religion broadly as a system of classification."

   "comments": [
    "The sole weakness lies in the frequency of guest speakers. While most of the guest speakers, especially those that came in person, were excellent, others were less helpful. Strengths include instructor's engaging teaching method, the structure of the course (i.e., looking at spatial and temporal shifts), and the weekly responsibility to lead seminar.",
    "The strengths is that the Professor engaged us to think critically about the readings and to lead our own discussions.",
    "All are good!",
    "The readings for the course were excellent and the discussions were very engaging and well-led. The only area that could be improved would be greater clarity around the final paper.",
    "One of the greatest strengths of this course was the enriching classroom environment Professor Kim facilitated each week. I appreciated the flexibility in discussion where different perspectives were encouraged and welcomed. I also felt that the right balance was struck between lectures and free-flowing student-led discussion. Another part of what made the course successful was the course material itself. I enjoyed how the material drew from a wide variety of sources: we read debates, academic writing, expository articles, sutras, legal proceedings, treatises, personal reflections, films, etc. It is clear that the syllabus was thoughtfully put together. A big plus was also the guest lectures; they were all insightful. I especially enjoyed Professor Rangdao Lai and Hyongak Sunims (skype) visits."

    "Definitely. Material was interesting, and most of the guest speakers helped to augment the seminar's larger discussions.",

    "Yes, this class will help students to know not only Korean Buddhism but also Buddhism in Asia. How Buddhism, functioning as soft power, to help those nations to get cultural independence.",
    "Highly recommend!",
    "Yes, I enjoyed the class greatly and I would recommend to anyone interested in Buddhism, Asian Religions, and Religion and Modernity.",
    "Definitely take this course with Professor Kim! It will challenge you on your conceptions of Buddhism and religion at large."
