    "YES!",
    "If you want to learn Russian, TAKE THIS CLASS. It's a lot of grammar and vocab, but it's doable, and you learn so much in a short amount of time. Professor Titus is amazing. If you're willing to put in the effort, this class will be very rewarding!",
    "This is basically an introduction to the Russian language with basic grammar and vocabulary. I would absolutely recommend it to other students, because in my experience it was a fun language to learn.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. It definitely starts off very overwhelming at first with having to learn a new alphabet but the rest of the class is really manageable. The speed is good and doesn't get repetitive at any. I'd really recommend this to anyone who took a Romance language in high school and is looking for something really different!",
    "It's Russian. It's hard. It's fascinating. You choose.",
    "I really enjoyed L1 Russian. Julia is amazing - funny, informative, charistmatic, clear. She has tons of interesting things to say about differences between Russian and American culture and language. I didn't like the TA quite as much - he was less precise and less organised. But Russian is a really neat language and the workload was just right - enough to keep your skills developing but not overwhelming. Definitely recommend Russian if you are looking for a not-totally-mainstream language credit.",
    "I would! Challenging but rewarding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any students interested in learning Russian! I learned a lot of Russian, and the workload was always pretty reasonable. The class itself is fun and engaging.",
    "I loved Russian, and I would definitely recommend it. If you believe that you would enjoy Russian, you will. The professors are great, and so is the language.",
    "First year Russian is an excellent class, and as I reflect on this semester, I realize that I have learned a substantial amount of Russian in a very short period of time. This class is great for driven students who have a particular interest in Russian language and are willing to challenge themselves. Professor Titus does not overload her students with an incredible amount of work, but students who care about learning the language should put in serious effort to get the most out of this class. Do not worry about tests or your term grade, if you put in hard work, you will see results. You should absolutely take this class if you are interested in Russia. Professor Titus is so happy to see students interested in Russian language, and her enthusiasm shines. This semester is largely focused on vocabulary and grammar, though you will be getting a lot of oral practice. Professor Titus has you speaking basic conversation even on the first day of class. Do not be concerned about learning the Russian alphabet or writing in Cyrillic script. As Professor Titus says, she can teach any student script and the alphabet in fewer than 3 weeks. It is true, and you will be up on your feet before you know it. The textbook we used is excellent, well-structred, and it ensures that you are learning vocabulary effectively. Great class. Take it!",
    "If you want to learn the language through a classroom setting, then yes, take it. However, it's not the most effectively run class by any stretch of the imagination.",
    "Definitely an interesting and worthwhile class for learning Russian at a moderate pace. It's a fun and useful language, and the cultural tidbits are cool too.",
    "Russian was an enjoyable language to learn for me but it was not easy. You have to be willing to work and practice every day. You have no choice but to participate in class. The homework isn't too bad and helps a lot.",
    "Among the best language courses I have ever taken. The instruction is spectacular, and you will learn a lot, very quickly. Highly recommended."
