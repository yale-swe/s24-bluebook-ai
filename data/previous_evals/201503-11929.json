    "This was an amazing class. I looked forward to each seminar, and left each seminar feeling like I reached some kind of narrative revelation. I was doubtful at first - why take a class about one contemporary South African writer when there is still so much to read? (Especially given the fact that I am a junior, and have to fulfill requirements). But Coetzee's works are so important, so powerful, grapple with themes of storytelling, race, sex, violence, globalization, charity, human rights, interacting with the \"other.\" They are so rich that you feel like you are constantly learning, delving into the stuff of life. And Professor Neuman is great. He's engaging, incredibly smart, kooky, provocative, and knows how to keep the seminar discussion going. I particularly appreciated his emphasis on writing theses and papers that teach something new, on \"reading for the strange.\" He also low key is an insane bikerider\/rockclimber and cooks mean Thai food.",
    "A course that will make you rethink many things - the way you read literature, the politics of South Africa, animal ethics, and many more. The novels of J.M. Coetzee are difficult but extremely interesting; I often felt at times that I required a more extensive knowledge of such diverse fields as Russian 19th c literature, early-mid 20th c Continental philosophy, philosophy of mathematics, and others in order to fully appreciate what Coetzee is doing and alluding to in his fiction - the novels will often leave you with more questions than answers. That being said, I greatly enjoyed this course, and am inspired now to go back and study the novels again. And Prof. Neuman is a fantastic seminar leader - energetic, organized, and always willing to work with and help you.",
    "Coetzee is a must-read, but bleak and difficult take if you need someone to push you through the literature.",
    "Great way to become familiar with Coetzee's work, regardless of previous experience. Consistent workload: one book and blog post a week, plus a 5 min presentation and two papers (6-8 midterm \/ 15-18 final). Highly recommended--challenging but very rewarding.",
    "Definitely take it! Coetzee's work is disturbing, beautiful, and important. Prof Neuman is excellent. You'll learn a lot.",
    "This is a fantastic course because Coetzee is an incredible (and incredibly difficult) writer. Studying his novels has forced me to reconsider my notions of literature, of reading and criticism, of ethics. Coetzee's novels are an opportune place to go and do some good thinking (and, despite their often intentional elusiveness, are some of the most relevant discourses on contemporary human being that I have encountered). One other note: the course also proceeds through all of Coetzee's novels, from his first to his most recent, which I had never done before with any writer. With another write such an approach might end up feeling myopic or self-limiting, but with Coetzee there is 1) never a shortage of material for discussion and 2) makes palpable the sense of his struggle with his own work (all writers have such an experience I'd imagine and their struggles, too, manifest in their work, but we as readers tend to miss it when we read novels in isolation). I suppose this to say that there is something personal (interpersonal almost) in this approach to Coetzee, which is a rare thing, at least for me, in an English course. Basically, take the course if you're down. You won't regret reading.",
    "Really great class. It's great to read Coetzee from start to finish, and Professor Neuman's passion for the material is evidence--he leads section well, and he's always available to meet\/help outside class as well."
