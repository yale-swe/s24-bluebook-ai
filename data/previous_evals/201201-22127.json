    "If you don't have to take it, I wouldn't. Prof. O'Hern is pretty disorganized (i.e. canceled review sessions for when he was out of town, posted topics lists for exams less than 12 hours before the exam, etc), and the exams were incredibly difficult. I found it difficult to know how what we learned in lecture was applicable and connected to real-world applications.",
    "required, so i don't know why you're bothering to read. if you must know, and some of you already know from past experience, corey is not a particularly good teacher. he writes everything on the board at once in the very beginning then goes through it like reading through a wikipedia article. at least from my experience, this makes it seem like everything makes sense, oh that seems logical, oh ok that's how it works, oh i see how that is, prof must be correct. then i go back to look at some of it and i have no idea what's going on. what he should do, as most profs do, is go step by step with the class, writing on the board as he goes along. subject material is extremely dry, everybody but a few people actually had a thorough understanding of the topics, missed something like 5 classes (i don't care if he mentioned this ahead of time), then proceeds to cancel all classes during reading week (a blessing and a curse) as if he's given up on teaching, uploads helpful test studying materials at 1:30am the night before a 10:30am exam, etc. just get through it, but unfortunately you won't be enjoying this much. the only good thing is that grading is pretty fair and he has a cool test policy where you get to take an optional final to replace one of your shitty midterm grades.",
    "Honestly, no. But if you're taking it you're probably ABET. If you aren't ABET, stay far, far away.",
    "The class was more like a math class than an engineering class, but that comes with the nature of dynamics. We learned a bit of Matlab which was very helpful and useful. The class did not require a lot of effort on problem sets and the exams were not too difficult. The final is optional.",
    "this course is terrible. dynamics should be one of the most interesting classes in the engineering curriculum. but it is taught poorly by ohern and is completely uninspiring. the first half of the semester is useless. the second half is mildly useful. you have to take it though.",
    "The only reason to take this class is because you have to fulfill a major requirement.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student. It was interesting, well taught and fairly manageable. The concepts are pretty theoretical, but I personally loved that. It is the type course that you actually sit back and think about the problems instead of mechanically plugging numbers in a calculator.",
    "No, definitely not.",
    "Go to the sections - they are a lifesaver. Workload isn't that bad. Make sure you study hard for the midterms so you maybe don't have to take the final. Learning how to use matlab was good\/fun\/useful.",
    "Corey's pretty disorganized, and I'm not sure how much dynamics I actually learned from this class. It could be taught so much better; don't take it unless you have to. Luckily though, the workload was not too intense, and if you are satisfied with your grade after the second midterm (when classes are over), you don't have to take the final!",
    "MENG 383 was actually rather enjoyable in the end. We didn't do too much work during the semester, and we're at least somewhat better prepared. The class is much more physics oriented than \"engineering\", but you'll definitely want (and need) to take this class to be a good engineer.",
    "Boring course, poorly taught. I don't know if anyone other than O'Hern teaches it, but if they do I'd suggest taking it with them."
