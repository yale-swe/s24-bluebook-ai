    "Great speakers and great topics.",
    "Sure. It's a good course if you're into basic science.",
    "Cell Biology 601 is a course that relates molecular pathways with major disease processes and emphasizes translational research. I would recommend the course to another student as a good starting point to build a solid foundation in understanding basic molecular disease processes in human disease to apply to one's own research.",
    "A well-run journal club that covers a great breadth of medical topics.I would recommend it to medical students as is.With a few changes, I think that the people from IM would benefit more from this very good course.",
    "The format of CB601 is that of a weekly journal club focusing on topics relevant for MD\/PhD students interested in careers in translational medicine. The discussion topics span disciplines but mainly focus on topics related to internal medicine. One particular focus was cancer biology."

   "comments": [
    "Very much.",
    "Sure.",
    "I think the course as a whole allowed for a wide exposure to the main molecular cellular processes and to new techniques in biomedical research. Overall, this course will help in guiding my experimental design as well as asking appropriate questions.",
    "It was a great opportunity to get to know some of the important researchers at Yale. The fact that they were nearly all clinician-scientists was also very inspiring as you can see the variety of paths taken by these great men to get where they are.I cannot say that it directly contributed to my dissertation.",
    "I think that the course provided a broad overview of important current research topics in molecular medicine."
