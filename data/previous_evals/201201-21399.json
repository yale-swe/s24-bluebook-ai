    "Yes...I definitely felt more comfortable with the language this semester and feel like I'm in good shape heading into L3",
    "Yes.",
    "Fair warning, the work load triples\/quadruples from L1 to L2 German, and it was a complete surprise to me. It's just a continuation of the book from L1, so the format honestly isn't that varied, there's just more homework and the grammar gets trickier.",
    "German L2 is a necessary continuation of L1. You will become better at prepared writing and speaking, but don'texpect to be anywhere near proficient by term's end. Exams are seriously hard, and I would only recommend taking this for a grade if you are committed and it is your first Yale language. Do if you must, or if you really love Germany. Otherwise, steer clear. I wish Yale would not ask for both L1 and L2 for students taking a second language here.",
    "Lots of daily work and memorization, but a fun class if you're on top of it. I wish we'd moved through the textbook at more of a constant pace, because the later cultural units were so disjointed that I had trouble following along and feeling like I was still improving my German."
