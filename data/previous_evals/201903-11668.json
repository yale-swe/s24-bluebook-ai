   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot",
    "I learned a lot in this course.",
    "I learned a great deal about the different types of learning and memory and how they interact. I also learned more about neuroanatomy of regions involved in learning and memory. I improved my research-interpretation skills.",
    "This was a very in-depth course about learning and memory systems. The labs were very interesting and helpful.",
    "I learned the more advanced functions of brain structures related to learning and memory. I learned about different paradigms on the macro level and cell functioning on the micro level as they relate to learning and memory. I also learned about different neurological disorders related to those concepts. The class also explored neural networks briefly, which was interesting but not very clearly explained.",
    "General understanding of the psychology, neural mechanisms, and diseases of learning and memory.",
    "Really useful reconciliation of the neuroscience and the psychology of learning and memory. This is the space where these two fields come together most clearly, and it was fascinating to see where biology and the study of the mind intersect, for a better understanding of both fields.",
    "As a complete newcomer to Neuroscience, this course gave me a great overview of both psychological and biological elements of Neuroscience, an guided me through different topics in Neuroscience.",
    "So much knowledge on both learning and memory",
    "The neruoscientific processes of learning and memory"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Lectures could be taped and put online. Would be helpful.",
    "Quite often throughout the semester, Professor Brown's wife made cookies for the whole class which was always a nice surprise. The exams could be quite difficult because they ask a bunch of really specific questions but for the most part they try to curve them if the class did not perform so well.",
    "I think the information and assignments are great. I think the lectures could be slightly more engaging but overall the course is good.",
    "The content was very interesting, but there was no enforcement of reading the text before class (if I'd actually done that, I probably would have gotten more from the lectures). The textbook was really good! The exams sometimes tested our knowledge of how well we knew Professor Brown more so than important concepts (e.g. Professor Brown likes asking about famous people). Study guides for tests would help",
    "Strengths include: interesting content, labs to understand learning paradigms, powerpoints being available online, the proximity of taught content to the textbook, extra credit availability Weaknesses include: main themes not being tested but instead, the over-emphasis of researcher surnames and small details. Despite engaging with the course on a more intense level, the exams were very difficult due to their unpredictable nature.",
    "Fair grading, well-structured lectures (generally following the book), and interesting labs are all strong points of this course. A lot of students were frustrated by the amount of memorization expected for exams, but it's a memory class so that should be expected. When students asked the professor how they should study all the material, he always recommended flashcards and a lot of practice. It takes a lot of time to study for exams due to the fact that they are heavily memorization based (especially in regards to names!), but in the intervening weeks, there's not a lot of work that needs to be done. Expectations were clear, even if they were difficult to meet. I appreciated that. However, I realized pretty quickly that I would need to miss my class following this one on the days of the review sessions, because the review sessions were so valuable. I feel like the course would be improved if everyone, even those who are unable to attend the review session immediately after class, was able to benefit from the information given out during those sessions because it seems slightly unfair.",
    "The content from this course itself is incredibly interesting. However, lecture often felt dry and disengaging. We covered a lot of ground each class, but not with a deep understanding. In terms of assignments, I appreciated the lab reports and movie paper--these were fun and interesting ways to engage with the material. However, the examinations were much less reasonable. They asked you to recall the names of every psychologist mentioned in class or nitpicky details rather than demonstrate a more conceptual understanding. We also did not receive feedback on the last two homework assignments until AFTER the final, which made improvement and engagement with the professor and TA extremely difficult",
    "More neural mechanisms.",
    "The course was extremely well-taught, but the exams are a bit gratuitous in the level of detail they demand. Essentially, you must know everything that was taught in addition to the more overarching themes. Details are tested.",
    "This class was interesting, however, the teaching style and exam style could be improved. For the teaching style, each class consists of moving hastily through about 65-70 ppt slides, crammed with important information, people, dates, and tangents yet there is no clear demarkation as to what topics or concepts are the most important to focus on. This leads me to the exam style, its mostly multiple choice and fill in the black, yet the questions can be random little things in the slides, making this class hard to study for. I think it would be better if there were actual review sessions and some sort of study guide to narrow down the lectures' key points\/people\/dates; the tests are one about every 7-8 lectures, which comes to ~500 slides to be tested on, and little to guide you on what will be tested.",
    "Strengths -a great overview of various topics -freedom to explore one's own interests in the form of a presentation -an amazing approach to learning! I highly appreciated the form of assessment and the professor's clear mission to ensure we are *learning* and not just studying Weaknesses -it was very lecture-based, and due to the amount of content covered sometimes pretty shallow -the engagement with other students was minimal -there was not much feedback or discussion",
    "I cannot really think of a way this course could be improved, the tests are a little memorization heavy but welcome to neuro.",
    "Prof. Brown is the nicest guy ever and made a very difficult class very fun and exciting to go to. I liked the way the material was organized. The exams were very hard as they were all fill in the blank, but the homework was a good way to raise your grade if the tests were a struggle."

   "comments": [
    "For cog sci I think this was a good class to fulfill depth",
    "I would, I enjoyed this course a lot.",
    "The content is really important and cool stuff, and Professor Brown is a very nice man. I would definitely recommend taking this course if you're looking to learn more about these topics.",
    "I would recommend this course to neuroscience majors because the content is still very interesting and relevant, and Professor Brown keeps the content very updated. Prof. Brown also cares a lot about his students and it shows, even if the exams can be difficult to perform well on if you are unable to memorize every detail of every lecture.",
    "Yes, but remember to always attend the review session after class on the class before an exam. The professor will literally ask questions directly from the exam and it will help significantly to guide last minute studying, which is invaluable given that there is a lot of memorization expected for exams. Knowing in advance which names will definitely be on the exam and which facts out of the hundreds that we cover will definitely need to be known (and even which questions will be 'tricky' and how to answer them) gives you a significant leg up in your preparative efforts. During lectures, he will also give hints about which pieces of information (and some relevant questions) will be on the exam.",
    "I would! Very interesting content, especially for psychology or neuroscience majors. A background in the Human Brain would be helpful. Just know if you learn well under this type of lecture style and be prepared for the details demanded from the examinations.",
    "I would certainly recommend it to anyone who is interested in Neuroscience and somewhat new to it. I am not sure if it might have been to shallow for Neuroscience majors.",
    "Yes this was one of my favorite overall classes at Yale thus far",
    "Yes, if they are interested in the material I think it is a really good way to learn about neuroscience"
