   "comments": [
    "Surprisingly fun and engaging class. The professor kept to basic econ principles, which I appreciated.The case studies were entertaining and allowed for lively class debates. I could, however, do without the cold calling... It is intimidating and made me initially less inclined to speak up if I did have something to say. Luckily, the cold calling calmed down towards the second half of the semester.",
    "As someone with no background in economics or health policy, this course was great to help me begin understanding the problems and challenges of the US health care system. The first two weeks you get slammed with microecon but do not fear, it stops soon after and those are the hardest classes of the year. But it also is enough to help you understand the insurance market and how it works which is absolutely essential. Policy briefs are manageable and do yourself a favor and look at the example brief! If you follow that format, you are on the track to high marks on the briefs.",
    "The course is an excellent overview of health economics and US policy. Professor Cooper's first lecture sets a clear roadmap for the course and subsequent lectures expound on each section of the original lecture. The assignments are aimed at helping us as students synthesize the information in ways that will be useful for us in our future careers or as engaged citizens.",
    "Great course. Topics well selected, up to date and relevant. Instructor very well prepared for class.",
    "One of my favorite courses at YSPH. Great capstone learning experience for my time here.",
    "Good class overall; policy memos were good but inconsistently graded since they were graded by two different TAs and the professor (3 different people total). Also they sometimes didn't have consistent feedback. The take home final was too long (one policy memo instead of two would have been more appropriate because each policy memo takes about 5 hours). The cases were interesting but I think Professor Cooper should have given more instruction as to HOW to prepare them -- i.e. what to look for when reading the cases -- and more instruction might have avoided the situation in which people didn't prepare the case that one day. I thought the seminars at the beginning were not super helpful -- they should have been discussed more briefly in class and then have the seminars be optional for those who want to discuss further. I think it would also be good to have the \"best\" policy memos each week be uploaded to Classes*v2 (with or without names redacted) so that the class can see what the best students are writing \/ what we should be working toward.",
    "I thought that this course was fantastic. I think it incorporates just the right amount of economics with lots of room for discussion and debate. I felt like I left every class with a better understanding of a topic than when I went in, which is not as common in courses as one would hope or expect.",
    "This is a great intro to the different ways to finance healthcare policy. I left each class feeling as though I could articulate the positives and negatives of each funding scheme. It was very engaging, but it did feel like a core group of students who attended most\/all classes and contributed effectively and a lot of people who were both ill prepared or largely absent.",
    "Great course! If you do the work (readings) and listen in lecture, you learn so much about US health policy and health economics. Definitely a great foundation for health policy work.",
    "I really enjoyed this class and learned a lot. I personally did not enjoy the policy memos and do not think every student will necessarily be going into a profession that requires writing policy memos. Since this class is a required course for all of MPH and not just policy students, it would have been nice to have other assignments besides just policy memos.",
    "The readings were relevant and I especially liked the case studies. I learned a lot in this class and felt the assignments were great ways to apply those concepts.",
    "I really enjoyed the lectures, which were more of a discussion on real world problems in the industry.",
    "Good course, good intro to health policyPolicy memos were great assignments and enjoyable, good skill to haveInteresting lectures\/discussionsThe main issue I had with the class is that it was on a Friday afternoon, which definitely factored into why so many people missed class often. I think it's a hard time to make for people who commute or travel to conferences, etc. on the weekend.",
    "Strengths: Very clear and articulate structure and course design. Good overview of varied and different subject material including health insurance and policy in the United States and especially Affordable Care Act. This is a broad subject and the class covered a vast majority of it in a clear and concise manner, especially for someone unfamiliar with health policy. Would be able to converse intelligently about general health policy topics and terms (e.g. adverse selection) after taking this course.Weaknesses: Often too many readings to digest fully for class, additionally few readings were discussed in depth. Would suggest at max 3 good summaries or discussion papers, maybe a shorter news article. Did not enjoy being marked down on policy memos for formatting, this seems like a half-point issue. YSPH should pay for harvard business review memos, memos were very useful in class, but paying an additional $20-$30 for memos was a disincentive to read them.",
    "Good",
    "The course was well organized and well executed. Some of us have never done \"cases\" before, so while it was not that intimidating, it might be nice to have a better idea of what the expectations are for engaging (and paying) for them instead of finding out about it that week of the assignment. Just a quick overview at the beginning of the course would help, or have a TA address it in the separate sessions.Otherwise, making students do policy memos for assignments is brilliant. Distilling lots of new information in a cons ice manner is a skill that is transferrable to ANY job!",
    "Strengths: the class is engaging and covers topics that are extremely relevant to today's health environment. I learned a lot of useful principles for thinking about health issues through this course. The assignments are also helpful toward this end.Weakness:The assignments tend to have a conservative slant. Having to write for both sides would be nice.",
    "Good introduction to health policy and basic economics as it applies to healthcare. Appreciated the short sections earlier in the semester to go over basic healthcare and economics concepts, but wished it was more substantial - I felt it was a wasted teaching opportunity, especially because the first 2 policy memos was heavy on the economics.",
    "This was a fantastic introduction to the intersection of health economics and health policy. I considered this course to be essential to my education at YSPH and feel that I learned many important concepts as a result of Dr. Cooper's extraordinary lectures, the in-class discussions and debates, as well as the policy briefs.",
    "Grading was too hard for a core class and consideration was not taken well for non policy students",
    "The course provided great economic insight into the world of health policy, however I feel there were some lacking basic concepts, and a general lack of direction with particular regard to the policy briefs."

    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Zach was a very entertaining professor. His lectures were well organized and engaging.His feedback on course work was constructive.He was accessible and friendly.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0excellent lecturer and motivator for this subject. Paralleled a lot of the current issues with the subject.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0One of the best professors to just sit and listen to. Zack Cooper is engaging unlike any professor I've had which makes dense material like insurance markets more approachable. Also he is incredibly approachable as a professor and welcomes all students to email him, attend office hours, ask questions, etc. If you have any concerns you would be wise to talk to him as he will help you out.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Professor Cooper is an expert on the subject and clearly has a passion for the topic. He genuinely wants students to understand and appreciate the subject matter. His lectures are clear and well organized. He creates interactive activities aimed at helping students synthesize the information provided. He makes himself available for additional assistance with regular office hours, willingness to answer questions after class and he responds to email queries quickly. I can't say enough positive things about him. I would not change a thing.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Great lecturer, passionate about what he teaches. Needs to be a little bit more understanding that we have other courses and obligations when it comes to assigning readings.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Professor Cooper is really great. He cares about his students a lot. The fact that he had guest speakers come in shows that he really wants his students to fully experience everything we're learning in the classroom. I think that with time he will get better at handling situations like the one when no one was prepared for class",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0I really liked Dr. Cooper's teaching style. He is very enthusiastic and makes an effort to include the whole class in discussions. I also really appreciated his approaching topics in a way that was accessible to both policy\/econ track students and students with little or no background in economics or health policy.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Zack is really an amazing professor. He promotes discussion and debate and loves to play devils advocate. He is engaging and demands a class's attention. He is also sensitive to the needs and desires of a class and is infinitely willing to adjust his teaching to better suit his students. I think the thing I will never forget is the time that he sent a 5 or 6 page email (with graphs and charts and explanations) after a class where he thought that he was not clear enough with his in-class explanations. I truly feel like anyone could learn from Zackwhich is a mark of a great professor.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Very strong lecturer and very engaging. One class I really did look forward to attending.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0It is clear that Professor Cooper is deeply invested in this material and in the success of his students. The flow of the class is very good, I loved the topics, and his teaching style is engaging and fun. He slowly increased his expectations for students throughout the semester, for both the policy memos and case study discussions, which allowed us to find our feet in an area where few of us had much experience. He is a very fair professor, and always made himself available to students.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Dr. Cooper is a phenomenal lecturer. He explains things extremely well and his lectures are very clear and to the point.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0I really enjoyed having Zach as a professor. I think he did a great job teaching the course. He is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the course material which made lectures very interesting.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0He is an enthusiastic professor who is great at engaging students in dialogue.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0He was extremely engaging and really knowledgeable about the material.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Good professor and lecturer\/discussion moderator.I would suggest getting to class on time to show he cares.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Dr. Cooper is an excellent teacher. Smart, very enthusiastic, with a clear goal of teaching students in an accessible manner. He made an effort to use our first names, and make the class informative and interactive. Very approachable and available.I am not a policy major at all, I am a disease ecologist taking the course for requirement and learned a lot in his class. Not only about insurance as a economic structure, but of the differences between U.S and alternative health insurance schemes, the general principles behind the Affordable care act. For a required class he made it as enjoyable and accessible as possible.Additionally I know there was an incident during one of the guest lectures that disappointed Dr. Cooper. Personally I was absent from class that day as I was at a fellowship meeting, however I would like to apologize for our behavior.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Pretty awesome professor who knew his materials well and taught them in an entertaining way. He could improve on his communication skills a little, providing students with weekly updates on what will happen in the course, since this course is very interactive.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Dr. Cooper is friendly, knowledgable and easy to engage with as a student. He is an excellent public speaker\/lecturer.I do think there could have been more consistent quality control on the grading of the memos- but I understand logistically that is difficult to do.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Strengths: an engaging lecturer, well-created assignmentsWeakness: despite being good at explaining concepts, explaining the math behind them is not his forte.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Great energy in the classroom - kept the lectures interesting and tried to make it as interactive as he could. Would have liked the case-study discussions to be more structured - really enjoyed the medical stents case where we were able to break off into groups and interact more with each other.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Incredibly thoughtful and bright young professor; engaging and motivated to teach; deeply passionate about his material; cares immensely about students and evidence-based approaches to important questions in health policy and health economics",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0We shouldn't have been given cases we had to pay for and then criticized for nor being able to access them. If we were expected to pay it should've been on the syllabus",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0He is a great lecturer. However, I feel that he sometimes does not communicate expectations well with the class, and is very long winded. Also, his form of class engagement should be tweaked to make the engagement useful."

   "comments": [
    "I wasn't expecting to enjoy this course as much as I did. Would definitely recommend, especially for people who may be intimidated by econ courses. It is a relevant course without all the overwhelming econ lingo.",
    "It's a great way to understand the economic context of health policy in the US. You do not have to have a background in economics as Dr. Cooper and his TAs are great at simplifying complex economic theories and principles so that you can focus on their interaction with health policy.",
    "Excellent course. I highly recommend to anyone. Very relevant to APMPH students.",
    "The class was good. It is required for health policy and is a good class to take even if you're not in policy. You learn a lot about health economics and health insurance markets. The policy memos are a bit difficult to get a hang for but a very good skill to learn. The take home final was way too long. If you already have experience in economics, this class will be frustrating and a bit easy",
    "I would summarize the course the way Zack did: the 10 (or so) most important lectures that a new secretary of HHS should hear before taking the job. After taking this course I feel much better equipped to enter into policy discussions about the PPACA as well as a variety of alternatives for which I can give pros and cons. I would recommend this course to everyone, regardless of concentration. I think that a baseline understanding of economics and policy is incredibly important not just as a student of public health, but as a voting member of society.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student, particularly those who are interested in a solid overview of the ways to finance healthcare. Between the two required policy courses, I would highly recommend this one over the 560 course taught in the fall.",
    "This is one two possible options for the policy elective and I would highly recommend taking it.",
    "A lot of work but definitely useful!",
    "This course discusses different issues of healthcare from an economics perspective. I woulddefinitely recommend this class, it is a decent amount of work but you will learn a lot",
    "Really useful, especially if you haven't had exposure to economics before.",
    "This was my first policy class, and it was really helpful. I feel like I have much more knowledge about US healthcare system and what's wrong with it and alternatives to improve it. Policy memos were also enjoyable, and strengthened my writing skills. Not a lot of work, I guess only the day before policy memo is due.",
    "good course",
    "I would recommend this course to a student. I would say it one of the more relevant courses for those wishing to enter into a domestic health policy profession. It brings to light relevant and crucial policy decisions in the context of economics and health research.",
    "If you take this course, you'll be better able to engage competently in conversation about current health policy issues. It's an interesting class, too. Highly recommended.",
