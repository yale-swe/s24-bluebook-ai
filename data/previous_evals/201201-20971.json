   "comments": [
    "There are some syllabi centered around a genre, some around an individual, and others around an idea. This seminar's syllabus falls into the third category. Sometimes this can backfire, when the class gets single-minded or repetitive. But Susan Chambers' equable manner of proceeding into and then back out of potential resolutions to the central problem of the class allows for simultaneous flexibility and focus. The class is, most simply, about the paradox of writing during the various transitions at the beginning of the 20th century, from the Georgian Dymock poets to the beginnings of modernism, and from the prewar modernism to its post-war counterpart, in the years during and after WWI. The syllabus is WILDLY varied: Eliot, The Imagists, the Georgians, trench poets, Remarque and Hemingway, a great day about writing about and not writing about the war in which we read children's lit like Winnie the Pooh as well as To the Lighthouse, Edward Thomas, Robert Frost, and even some Philip Larkin. WHAT.",
    "I would highly recommend \"Modern Pastoral.\" It is a truly excellent class that I was excited to come to each week and Professor Chambers was wonderful. If you like poetry, you should definitely take it if you can.",
    "English 905 would be recommended to students interested in the modernist\/ pastoral dichotomy evident in predominantly Anglo-American writings of the early part of the 20th century; students should be prepared to get their hands dirty by intensely studying the texts themselves but may find their understanding of the concepts and discourses involved by reading for themselves outside the assigned primary and secondary texts."

   "comments": [
    "It served as a bridge: I am acquainted with the Victorians, and also the Moderns. This class showed me one vision of how poets, in particular, went from being the former to the latter. We also spent time on pedagogy; there were only four registered students in the class, so each of us led half of two sessions, with profound help from SC outside of class. THANKS SC.",
    "This class started out as useful to my research, but this became progressively less the case as both my dissertation topic and the nature of the class itself evolved in different directions. The idea of modernist\/ pastoral discourse that drew me to the class originally became less and less present in sessions as the weeks continued, as the discussion became more invested in the individual peculiarities of particular writers, and the intertextual relationships between their ideas and their textual manifestations."
