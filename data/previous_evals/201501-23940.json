    "Amazing course. Must take, even if you are not interested in real estate.",
    "Mr. Powers is an excellent instructor skilled at leading interesting discussions. I constantly found his insights and anecdotal experiences fascinating and illuminating. This class was top-notch and a very nice change in tenor from most Yale seminars, probably because Mr. Powers speaks and teaches from industry experience. He's also genuinely interested in connecting with undergrads and helping Yalies out, which is such a cool quality. The only thing that I think was lacking in the course was a closer attention to issues of social inequity stemming from historical and present day real estate practices - at the very least, we should cover things like red lining.",
    "Absolutely MUST TAKE if you are interested in real estate and can get in!",
    "Amazing class - guest speakers are very prominent people, very open to hearing our questions and answering them openly. Great mix of academic, professional, career advice, etc. Professor is kind, knowledgeable, open-minded. The professor knows so much about the material, but can boil it down in basic terms for everyone to understand. He perfectly mediates the conversations so they don't go on for too long, but is flexible enough to allow interesting conversations to flourish. Paper topics are great.",
    "This is an excellent class that I would highly recommend. The workload is manageable, but also extremely interesting as the class explores the many dimensions of real estate. Professor Powers fluidly guides the class whilst bringing in distinguished visitors from all aspects of real estate in order to enhance class discussion.",
    "Take it if you can",
    "Absolutely take it",
    "I absolutely recommend this class if you're interested in Real Estate. You'll get a chance to speak with industry experts about the most important topics in the field right now. Professor Powers is amazing, his guest speakers are amazing, and the course readings are great.",
    "I would recommend this to someone looking for variation in their schedule or who is interested in real estate.",
    "A great course exploring real estate. A good course for a novice or someone who is interested in something like Urban Studies from the private perspective.",
    "This class is amazing. Seriously. Take it. The quality of reading, instruction, and guest speakers was incredibly high. The system of reading responses and papers was also amazing. The class didn't have an enormously high workload but the work was very rewarding and I never felt like any of the reading was superfluous.Also, Prof Powers is an amazing guy with amazingly accomplished friends who stopped by for super interesting guest lectures probably every other week or so. JUST TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to a fellow student. If someone only wanted to learn only about private equity real estate investing, they shouldn't take this class. The opportunity to thematically explore real estate is really unmatched anywhere else at Yale. I understand so much better the financial system and how real estate finance fits into that system. I had multiple moments in the class where I saw myself wanting to enter real estate finance maybe as a second career out of college, just for the range of people we met in the context of them guest speaking."
