   "comments": [
    "I would recommend taking another course if possible for intro Physics in case you have any choice. The lectures were poorly explained, and in the actual classtime Shankar was seemingly incapable of explaining things in a different way.",
    "The course is hard, harder that 181 and 261, but extremely interesting and informative. Prof. Shankar is the best professor you will ever have, take it for him if he teaches it! It is fast-paced but covers every essential component of E&M. The quantum mechanics part is also really interesting, and Shankar is an expert there, so you will learn a lot of things. Be ready to feel challenged and work on problems for a while, but be rewarded at the end...",
    "When I was reading evaluations before taking this course, I was surprised that almost everyone was complaining about the workload. In my opinion, though, the workload for this class is not greater than for other classes, and psets are usually pretty short. I would definitely recommend this class as an introductory physics course at Yale.",
    "For all the reasons above, I would not recommend this class. I might consider it if Shankar were removed, but generally, it focuses on the wrong stuff for an intro course. Also, they need to change the prereqs for this course. Shankar expects all students to be entirely competent in partial differential equations, linear algebra, and multivariable calculus (when there is a co-req of multivariable). This is just unfair. If those are truly necessary pre-reqs, then list them as such so that no one will take the course.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. The material is incredibly interesting, although if you do take it, be prepared to put in the time because some of the material is very difficult. Don't be discouraged by the difficulty, take it to learn because you will definitely learn a lot!",
    "This class is hard and rewarding. The rewarding part is strongly contingent on you being comfortable with the hard part. Professor Shankar is a good lecturer, and the material is presented simply and coherently, but there's just such a huge amount of material to wrap your head around that it gets very difficult to keep up. However, in terms of grades, because of the difficulty of the work, the professors are very willing to go over problem sets multiple times and help prepare for tests and quizzes. Although not a STEM major, I loved this class, although it nearly killed me, and am delighted with the amount of work we covered. Very tough, but worth it.",
    "Physics 201 is an ideal class for students who are interested in physics, i.e. interested enough to want to do some pretty tough problem sets. However, the availability of help in review sessions and the learning style (flipped classroom) makes the class still pretty accessible to non-majors.",
    "PHYS 201 was rough. A lot of the material is very interesting, and I think it would be worthwhile for someone who genuinely enjoys physics. However, it is also a high-pressure, high-stress class (at least in my experience), where you have to work very hard to keep up. I think you should take it if you really like physics and have an otherwise relatively light schedule (I had to lighten my schedule to accommodate for this course). It will be hard to make this class worth your while if your not ready to give it a lot of time and effort, though. I really enjoyed the E+M material (up until circuits), was content with ray optics, and vaguely enjoyed quantum stuff while also not really understanding what was going on and being pretty stressed out by it.",
    "Don't take this class if it is taught by Shankar and is a flipped class. He verbatim repeats his notes and gets annoyed when people don't understand complicated ideas that have been explained the exact same (not helpful) way three times.",
    "This course has a good foundation but needs to be improved - note that no matter what, I think it is better than 181. You learn cool stuff about E and M and quantum, and 201 is more challenging (while 181 can be really tedious if you have a background in physics\/math). Good things: The material and depth of material covered was good - challenging but doable. I liked that we got to see and understand the derivations. Video lectures\/textbook were both of good quality. In class problems were useful. Table groups were great and possibly the best strength: you got a ready to go study group and great friends - I made at least 4-6 new friends in that class. Weaknesses: Repeat of lectures. I would watch the lectures the night before and usually gain a general understanding of the material. During class time though, we'd generally receive at 50 minute lecture a little less in depth of the same thing, which was un-engaging and felt like a waste of time since I mostly understood the concepts. A 10-15 minute review of intuitive concepts (or do what Math 115 does and ask people before lecture what they find confusing and spend 10-15 minutes reviewing that) and then going straight to in class problems would be much more fun and useful. As it was, I was tempted to stop listening to the lectures altogether since I was basically getting the information in class, but I wouldn't actually understand the material as well since the 50 minute lecture was not as in-depth or well explained as the 75 min lecture. So I ended up either bored or badly taught. Also, when in class lectures lasted 50 minutes we didn't have enough time to do a significant number of the IC problems. I think this class would be better if they changed it to be basically be more like Math 115 (or set up the format to be more like a flipped classroom).",
    "Overall solid class that goes more in-depth than AP Physics C, but reinforces a wide range of fundamental concepts in physics. I would recommend this class if you are looking to strengthen your general background in physics. The class also touches on practical applications of physics, which I found very interesting. The structure of this class, as in how much of it is flipped, it still being tweaked, but as long as you go to the study hall sessions you will be fine and can learn a lot. At least this semester, the TFs were excellent.",
    "You can get a lot out of PHYS 201 if you put the work in. If you fall behind, things can get confusing really fast, so make sure you watch all of the lectures.",
    "The flipped classroom concept really only works when you actually flip the classroom. Sadly, as the semester wore on, less and less time of Phys 201 was spent on practice problems, while more and more time was spent re-doing the very same lectures that Shankar gave some 7-8 years ago, the very same lectures that you watched before coming to class, and the very same lectures that youd rather not waste your time hearing repeated to you again, when you could be doing practice problems and making sure that the concepts really are stuck in your head. I was fairly disappointed with the level of instruction I got from the classroom, if only because I wasnt learning anything new having watched the lecture beforehand. This problem really started occurring around midway through the course (I thought the first half of the course was fairly well-run), but got very bad very fast. The Psets are long and difficult, though not the worst in the world. They often reflect the in-class problems, so make sure to try to do the in-class problems you dont get to, and look at the solutions posted online after the class. The TAs are very knowledgeable and on the whole pretty great. You should really try to arrange your schedule so that you can attend the study halls; unfortunately, my schedule didnt work out that way and I felt a step behind the whole course. Shankars notes are pretty well written, and were freely distributed. I found watching the video lectures, then reviewing the notes when possible, to be the best way to go about learning the material.",
    "A tough class but absolutely worth it. I took it as a junior to fulfill my physics requirement in the bio major, and it was one of my favorite courses. You get to learn about a variety of interesting topics in depth, and the quantum theory section was one of the most rewarding course segments I've had at Yale. It tested my limits without completely overwhelming me, and both professors, as well as the TAs, were excellent. I'd really recommend it. With sufficient work it can be an incredibly positive experience."
