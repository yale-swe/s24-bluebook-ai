    "Learned about database design and the structure of systems",
    "I got a survey-level introduction to databases.",
    "Overall knowledge about database schema and programming in SQL.",
    "I learned how to query a database, some design strategies for databases, and some hardware knowledge that overlapped with 323 material.",
    "Good overview of databases from both a software and hardware perspective. SQL is perhaps 1\/3rd of the course, but many more fundamental ideas like using relational algebra to prove things, dealing with issues in concurrent\/distributed systems, and designing normalized databases are all covered. Also includes some paper reading of fundamental advanced \/ current database topics, such as crypto and various forms of columnar datastores.",
    "Learned SQL and how to work with databases",
    "Learned to use SQL and design databases. Also learned about storage structures and concurrency control.",
    "I learned a lot about SQL and how it works. The course also explained different things about operating systems and file organization that I found very helpful even in other computer science classes.",
    "I liked how this class gives a broad overview of DBs. Learning SQL is too easy for a semester long course, so most of the time we were discussing other related stuff for DBMS."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Ennan, the TA The final project The honeworks Weaknesses: 9 am is hard",
    "Poorly planned schedule--many of the lectures\/modules planned to be covered were not due to excessive time being spent on ones that came early. There was also very little programming within the course (only 1 problem set) outside the final project, which meant I did not feel that I learned as much as I could have. The knowledge was also quite backloaded.",
    "Honestly Yale shouldn't offer 437. Instead, get Abadi to offer a slightly more conventional version of 438. 423 should be scrapped, too; 422 is much more rigorous and much more useful.",
    "Perhaps more programming would have been helpful, or discussion of any sort of nonrelational database schema. Overall, though, there was a lot of good information in this course.",
    "Strengths: SQL is useful in real life, as is general knowledge of databases. Assignments were very manageable and actually helped me understand the material better. Weaknesses: part of the rubric for grading the final project was how early in the semester you started writing code for it, which is absurd (especially since we were not told this). As in you could only get full points if you started coding your final project at the beginning of the semester, which is unrealistic for most students.",
    "I think the project is a strong point for the course. We are given a lot of freedom, but that can cause some problems.I think that maybe a little more direction for the project and some mandatory meetings early on would help.",
    "Lectures are very detailed, and professor answers all questions patiently and with clarity. Course moved through query performance issues rather quickly, might have benefitted from lengthening this unit as it's a very practical topic. Would have been nice to talk about noSQL databases.",
    "The lectures were very dry, and the material was often so specific that I lost track of the big picture. The psets were not at all indicative of the level of difficulty on the exams, which was frustrating. The exams required lots of memorization. The final project was a useful way to apply the skills taught in the class. The TA was very approachable.",
    "Good overview of SQL and databases. Paper reading assignments were not particularly helpful since much of the content was too advanced. Final project is a good usage the knowledge from the class.",
    "I think the course offers great material. However, maybe if the class was a little bit more emphasized on SQL and practicing I think that would've been very helpful as I was a little lost with SQL at first.",
    "Interesting content Unengaging delivery",
    "I think the course is well taught since it is offered so many times already. One weakness is that the course materials are not very connected to currently used technology. For example, it would be cool to learn some noSQL DBs or how to deploy real world DBs."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes if you're a CS major or are interested in databases (I am not a CS major)",
    "I would recommend if you're self-motivated to learn and want to do a final project, but not if you want a course that will force you to really deeply learn about databases.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. Advice from a senior CS major: do not take any elective course taught by Silberschatz (423: Principles of Operating Systems and 437: Introduction to Databases), Fischer (427: Object-Oriented Programming), Petersen (431: Algorithmic Computer Music), Rokhlin (440: Numerical Computation), Gelernter (451: The User Interface), or Slade (458: Automated Decision Systems). These courses are a complete waste of time (although they consume very little of it) and a huge waste of a Yale education. You will literally learn nothing from these courses except that half of the Yale computer science faculty is abysmal (the other half ranges from decent to stellar). By all means, major in computer science, as it is a fascinating field and we have some great professors (Rushmeier, Spielman, Abadi, Shao, etc). But do yourself a favor and limit yourself to taking only the rigorous, well-regarded CS courses (be sure to read evaluations), even if that means a BA degree (10 courses) instead of a BS (12). Courses every CS major should take: 421: Compilers and Interpreters (Shao), 422: Operating System Design and Implementation (Shao), 438\/638: Database Systems (Abadi), and 478: Computer Graphics (Rushmeier). These electives are all practical and well-taught and will help round out your general knowledge of computer science. Together with 201, 202\/244, 223, 323, 365, and 490, all of which are required for the major, this will get you 10 credits, which completes the BA. Quite honestly, that's sufficient. A rigorous BA is worth more than a gutty BS. When you're applying to jobs, you can say you're planning to complete a BS, and then switch in your final semester (by which point you'll have already accepted a job offer), and nobody will ever know or care. If you're planning to apply to grad school you should consider 480: Directed Reading. If you need a gut that is still practical, consider 426: Building Distributed Systems (Balakrishnan). If you're feeling masochistic, consider 433: Computer Networks (Yang), but beware that it is a LOT of work. Godspeed.",
    "Fine if you want a basic understanding of databases. Assignments are straightforward and cover lecture material as well as paper readings. Only the final project takes a lot of time, everything else isn't much workload. I thought there would be more SQL but only a couple of lectures and one assignment are on SQL (and nothing after the midterm). Most of the content was actually on more high-level DB theories, protocols, design issues, etc.",
    "Absolutely do not take unless you really need a chill class to count towards computer science. Otherwise, it is so disorganized that as to not be worth anyone's time.",
    "If you have forgotten the hardware knowledge from 323 and want to learn about databases it is alright I guess. There isn't too much work besides the project and even the project isn't too much work if you don't want it to be. If you have a project that you want to do that uses a database then I would if you don't have a project and don't want to one then you probably won't learn much and isn't that great",
    "Take it if you're going to be someone who works with data (CS major or otherwise), it's a very fundamental technology and Avi is a pioneer in his field!",
    "If your goal is to learn basics of databases, this is the right course",
    "Yes, not too stressful but enough work to get a better understanding of the topic. Reasonable time commitment.",
    "If you want a solid introduction to databases, I think this is a good class. However, if you already know a lot about databases then maybe you should probably take a more advanced class.",
    "Yes this is a good class for CS majors."
