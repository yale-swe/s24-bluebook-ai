    "Awesome class. Definitely take it. It's fun to be writing fiction stories for homework instead of the usual research papers or problem sets. Hopkins is super nice and fun.",
    "Tom is a sweetheart, and your fellow students are talented in numerous ways, so this is probably worth taking. Be warned, however, that you only write two short stories and a couple of writing exercises; this is not \"English 120 for fiction.\"",
    "Yes. it's a fun class. You write two longer stories, read a LOT of your classmates' stuff, read some other stuff and discuss it all. I don't know if I believe that creative writing can be \"taught\" but I do think that atmosphere and attitude of the workshops can really help or hinder the writing and editing processes. Tom made sure that the atmosphere\/attitudes were open and honest and let us speak when we had things to say\/spoke when we didn't.",
    "If you're interested in writing fiction, you should try to get into this class. It doesn't matter if you've written 100 stories before, or if you're just starting out with fiction writing. Professor Hopkins makes this class worthwhile for all levels of writers, and you'll love all the class discussions and having your stories workshopped. I know I've improved tremendously since the beginning of the semester, and anyone who wants to work on writing will benefit greatly from taking this class. The readings are fun, the workload is well-paced and manageable overall, and as long as you don't mind getting up early in the morning once a week, this could easily be one of the highlights of your semester.",
    "This is definitely a intro course. If you have more experience writing, I might recommend a different classy. That being said, as a more experienced writer myself, it was a nice relaxed way to continue writing and getting feedback.",
    "If you were attracted to the course title, take the course. Its exactly what it sounds like. The grading isn't particularly lenient, but you can always take it credit d.",
    "I would, for an introductory course, but not if you are interested in more advanced fiction writing.",
    "If you are looking for a forum to force yourself to write, then absolutely-- you get great exposure to some interesting short stories and get good feedback in workshop. If you're looking for rigorous instruction on how to hone your craft, then that's not exactly what this class offers."
