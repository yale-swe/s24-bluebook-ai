   "comments": [
    "A lot of classes claim to be \"interdisciplinary,\" but this is the first class I've taken at Yale that actually incorporates different fields of study and tries to combine them in a meaningful, effective way. It was challenging, but I feel like I learned a lot about being a critical thinker. There was not a lot of discussion for a seminar, but I think Roemer plans to change that in the future. Great class, highly recommended.",
    "Professor Roemer is brilliant and he does a great job teaching the differet theories of equality and their economic implications. That said, this is not really a seminar. The professor just reads his lecture notes every week and there is no class discussion. It is a lot of work and quite challenging, though I found that the challenge was worth it in the end.",
    "Take this class if you are not looking for a lot of discussion, but rather want to hear the professor's opinion on the topic.",
    "Roemer is brilliant, but not the nicest person. Keep in mind that though this is titled a seminar, he lectures the whole time from pre-prepared notes.",
    "Three five-page papers, but the material can be difficult if you have no background in philosohpy",
    "No",
    "Take this course for an investigation of social equality. The class is an even blend of political philosophy and economics. It turns to political philosophy primarily to investigate the questions: is equality desirable? and equality of what (resources, well-being, etc)? Assuming one could find an answer, it then draws on intermediate micro for allocative frameworks and (very incomplete) practical proposals for a more equal society. The professor clearly knows is stuff and is perhaps the only self-identified \"Marxist\" in the Yale econ department. Overall, I'm very glad I took this course, though comfort with both intermediate micro problem sets and political philosophy papers is definitely advised.",
    "The course's content is fascinating, and Prof. Roemer is obviously a giant in the field. In general, seminars are more like lectures, but these are mostly enjoyable. Roemer remarked that he was disappointed with the lack of discussion \u0097 so I'm not sure if this stems from the members of our class or the class setup itself. If you're looking for a discussion-heavy seminar, probably look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a solid seminar to help you frame many serious ongoing political debates, I'd recommend the class strongly."
