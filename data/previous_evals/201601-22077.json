    "I would recommend this class to psychology or cognitive science majors. It's a lot of work, but it sets a great groundwork that will make other psych class readings seem easy.",
    "411 is a great class for anyone with a strong interest in neuroscience. The course is structured as a bi-weekly discussion-based seminar, and the primary work is reading 1-2 primary literature papers on a topic and discussing them during the class session. The reading list is set up as a \"greatest hits\" of systems neuroscience, so expect to have heard about many of these studies in various textbooks. You really do get a good background in the field, and Professor Chang is a great seminar leader, but you do have to spend a good amount of time reading the papers to really get anything out of this class. The course has very little in the way of assignments, except for a short weekly reading response from the textbook and a long (20 page double spaced) final paper. The paper is due relatively early in the term (this year it was the day after Spring Fling), so plan accordingly. I think a neuroscience background is fairly necessary to understand a lot of the material, though people with stronger backgrounds in cognitive or behavioral psychology could still feasibly participate if they're willing to spend more time on the textbook really getting the concepts. Also, if you've already taken neurobio, this course uses the same textbook (Kandel's Principles of Neural Science aka the best sleeping pill on the market), so you may have already done some of that reading already.",
    "This is an excellent class and I would highly recommend it. Even though it says intro in the title, you definitely need some sort of neuroscience background to follow what is going on. The workload is intellectually challenging but fairly reasonable time-wise. You will learn a lot about how neuroscience research works (in terms of areas of investigation, experimental design, etc) and how to approach reading technical research papers. It is cool to learn about neuroscience in a research papers + seminar format rather than a textbook + lecture format and it definitely gives you a richer perspective on the material.",
    "Great senior seminar option in the Psych major. Steve Chang is great, and you will learn a lot about Neuroscience. The course is made up of short weekly reading responses and a longer paper due at the end of the term. Very reasonable workload, and some interesting class discussions to boot.",
    "I would recommend this course to those interested in neuroscience or cognitive science. The assigned readings can be pretty dense but you really do get a thorough understanding of some landmark papers and the methods through which they were carried out.",
    "You read classic neuroscience papers and discuss them in class. There are 2 papers per class and some are pretty long and boring, but a lot are incredibly interesting. A solid class if you're willing to put in the work to read the papers, but not too much point if you don't like reading. You can easily get by just by looking at the figures and understanding them if you're too busy to read some of the papers. Steve Chang is also a great guy and for me he seemed pretty generous in the grading.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in neuroscience. It was cool to read these old papers that really laid the groundwork for all future research. I learned how to better read and critique these papers, and how to discuss figures and ideas with others in my class. The readings can be overwhelming sometimes, but overall this was a very rewarding course.",
    "Great science distributional with a manageable workload for anyone interested in (and with background in) neuroscience. Cognitive science majors and psychology students seeking science distributional are especially encouraged, but only if you have a background in neuroscience! The papers are tricky to read and require some real time and effort, but you have a chance to ask questions about them during discussion; you never get tested on them; and, by the end of the course, you feel truly ready to write your own contribution to the neuroscience review paper literature. Encourage taking it!",
    "How much you take from this class really depends on the work put in. About 2 scientific papers are assigned for each class, and what you really need is an overview of the goals, methods, and figures of the articles. There are very short weekly reading responses besides the term paper (on any systems neuroscience related topic) at the end of the semester. Professor Chang is helpful with anything students need assistance with and is always open to student feedback."
