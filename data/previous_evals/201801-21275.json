   "comments": [
    "STRENGTHS: I appreciated how the course moved chronologically. All lectures were very clear and informative and fun. Think, Pair, Share was usually interesting although at times a little shallow. Most of the readings were eye-opening or felt necessary. WEAKNESSES: A few readings could be excised. It often felt like we didn't need to read the cases themselves. IMPROVEMENT: I wish there were some way for lectures to trace different thematic strands more explicitly. For instance, tracing the relationship between gender and law across the 3+ centuries we studied.",
    "I think the course could benefit from one, short midterm assignment to synethesize the themes of the class.",
    "Generally good context for non-lawyers and good overview course. Occasionally hard to follow legal discussion without a legal background."

   "comments": [
    "Yes absolutely! This is an excellent survey of American legal history in which you learn about not just the history itself but about the myriad ways one can tell this history. Course readings include classics and new works, which was great. Witt is an incredibly clear and helpful lecturer.",
    "Yes, very compelling subject material. I think Witt focused in on some of the best case studies in history that were both informative and interesting.",
    "Good course if you want to know more about American Legal History, both the debates among historians about the law and how the law and the legal profession developed."
