    "I think that we need more of this type of training. More opportunities to discuss these issues and to anticipate challenges and learn from other students' experiences.",
    "It was fine...truncated and in many ways felt unprepared",
    "good",
    "This class is a waste of time for those who have research or clinical experience. It should not be mandatory to AP students.",
    "I didn't really see the point of this.",
    "We only had one day of the seminar that was supposed to happen twice, but I still didn't find it very helpful. We talk about ethics in almost every class anyway.",
    "Interesting. Generated a lot of conversation and provided new insight into ethics. I am considering this as a career option.",
    "Very interesting and essential to research\/work in the field of public health.",
    "This seminar was cut from 2 days to 1 day. I didn't get much out of it. There was barely any discussion in the smaller group I attended after the main lecture.",
    "This was a helpful refresher about the importance and considerations of ethics and professionalism.",
    "Not sure what I got out of this other than a free pizza lunch.",
    "needs to highlight the importance of HIC\/HIPAA issues in research better",
    "Really boring.",
    "I think it's an important topic, and a good introduction to ethics for students.",
    "I honestly did not get a lot out of this course. The first speaker posed some interesting normative thought questions about ethics. We also had an interesting discussion regarding gun violence in the breakout session. It seems like the course could have been better catered towards the kind of ethical dilemmas we might face in a career in public health: for folks in epi - how to properly deal with study participants; for people in policy\/management - how to deal with high cost patients, improve access at the expense of profitability, etc...perhaps if the section was split into individuals in their respective divisions and have industry leaders talk about some ethical dilemmas they have faced, and how to go about dealing with them. This would be much more practical and easier make for easier participation (smaller groups).",
    "Discussion is more helpful",
    "This was a very rudimentary course and I feel I should have been able to opt out after having had two courses in bioethics, which taught me much more than this could. Ethics is an extremely important topic, but you need to have more interesting and complicated conversations about it fore it to actually influence people's practice and not just be a nominal exercise.",
    "it was good, a little hard to sit through due to length and material but the weather was harsh on us all =)",
    "It was a pretty general course. I did like the fact that our TA was a non-public health student who had a different perspective on ethics - our TA was a medical student. I would suggest to continue recruiting individuals outside of YSPH to incorporate variety.",
    "The first half of the class was too rushed and dense with information that was not particularly relevant to our other classes. The topic for the second half of the class (gun violence as a public health issue) did not lend itself to discussion. The discussion groups were also too large.",
    "I did not gain anything from this seminar. The idea of an ethics seminar for public health practitioners is good in theory, but it still has lots of room for improvement.",
    "Useful and practical\/.",
    "great",
    "I think we need to do a longer seminar. One day was not enough on this content and ethics is a critical element of being a public health professional. Not just research ethics, but overall ethical considerations in decision-making is not something we get training on. It's important.",
    "somewhat interesting, mostly boring, but a useful course to take. I did not find the discussion to be useful at all. It turned into a debate about guns, nothing to do with ethics.",
    "This is very important, interesting material. However, to shove this material into 2 afternoons (and one in our case due to the blizzard) really diminished its relevance. Having us take the on-line Yale courses, could be done in the week prior to starting school and not during school as this was just an added burden with all the other work we have. And, this material really deserves a longer discussion. Either make it a real course, for credit - or don't even try to do it, as it just didn't do it justice to have it as a small add-on thing. As it was, this important, interesting material, was just a silly, nuisance the way it was done.However, we have too much other work to make this into a bigger, add-on course. Can you start school 1 week earlier and focus on the \"ethics\" on one week prior to other work starting?",
    "Labs required too much work. They assumed the students had a higher level of SAS experience than was the norm.",
    "This was a one time seminar. I think it would be helpful to have a course on bioethics instead.",
    "good",
    "Break-out discussion sections were the most useful, although scenarios used for practice could have been improved.",
    "Was useful in helping us understand some of the issues associated with public health research. It was unfortunate that our time was limited in these courses due to the storm.",
    "great discussion session talking about topics in ethics",
    "Great",
    "Informative",
    "I think it's a necessary component of the public health curriculum and this seems as reasonable format as any to teach ethics. I liked the breakout sessions!I think it may have been better if we had been able to have both sessions- it seems like we didn't quite get enough of the material in just one.",
    "good",
    "It felt like a formality or an item on a todo list. I did not really enhance my understanding of research ethics.",
    "having a bigger class for labs would be really helpful !",
    "We did not get to do the full series because of the weather so it was not as in depth as it could have been but that was probably because of the shorten time.",
    "Strength- Knowledge of the instructors about the topicWeakness- We had just one session, so did not help",
    "I like the fact that this course is very interactive and is organized like a discussion.Areas to improve might be adding more topics for case studies.",
    "I thought the setup was great before the snow storm forced a consolidation of the classes.",
    "This year's structure was different given there was only one session. The course was far too didactic. I would have much preferred to have the case-based discussion broken up into two parts with a lecture in between -- that way, initial thoughts would be cultivated among student groups, then we'd all learn about principles of research and justice ethics, and finally we'd return to our case-based discussions with new tools to discuss and reflect on the topic.",
    "Fantastic",
    "This course was a great introduction to research ethics. It would have been great to have two different sessions instead of lumping both sessions into one.",
    "Brought up interesting points that are useful for research\/internship work",
    "Strengths: This is an important topic that merits a special seminar, and I thought the case study on gun control that was discussed during the breakout session provided a good way for the other students and I to hash out some of the ethical issues surrounding a topic. I also found Dr. Khoshnood's talk on some of the ethical issues he has encountered in conducting his own work to be very eye-opening. Weaknesses\/Possible Improvements: While I thought it was good to have some background on research ethics, I thought the lecture portion of the seminar was a bit long. I know the seminar was shortened overall due to the storm, but I thought the time that was available would have been better spent with a brief lecture on research ethics and more discussion on the case studies. I also really enjoyed Dr. Khoshnood's talk on ethical issues he has encountered in his own work and would have enjoyed hearing from more YSPH professors!!",
    "NA",
    "Necessary yet poorly taught because of how rushed it had to be (not the instructors fault)",
    "It was compressed into one day.",
    "Great that you have this seminar. I know it usually takes 2 sessions to complete, but I believe there should be more sessions--4 to 6.I did not understand the purposes of the case studies. We had not learned much about ethics in that one hour lecture so our discussions were not that solid. I think more time should have been devoted to listening to the two instructors.",
    "maybe to have more organized discussions led by experienced TAs would make it better",
    "I think the seminar would have been more helpful if it was offered in the two sessions, as originally planned. Enjoyed the case discussion.",
    "Unfortunately because of a snow storm we were short-changed and given only one seminar. All of the information was condensed into one meeting and I really believe we were cheated out of a really important class. Ethics should not be treated as a two-day seminar. I suggest in the future the class be a month-long seminar. Other than those points, I do not think I can provide any further feedback that can be viewed as constructive except that administrators or the seminar professors be more selective in the selection of student discussion leaders. Please see my comments under TA.",
    "Informative and helpful.",
    "I am not the best judge of this course since I arrived late and left early due to scheduling conflicts. I think the content of this course is great and useful to many MPH students. The snow days interrupted the logistics of this course.",
    "The discussion was a waste of time - there were no clear guidelines and the discussion degenerated into people's personal opinions on gun-control, not about the ethics of engaging in the gun control debate",
    "A very quick overview",
    "It was fine the way it is"
