    "This course taught me how to do a literature review, write a research paper, be a skeptical scientist and appreciate the links between primates and humans.",
    "This course was my favorite of the semester, as I left it with an entirely new appreciation for the diversity of primates and the study of wild animals. Professor Fernandez-Duque's class taught me so much about the morphologies and physiologies of primates, and much of whet I learned can be applied to other taxa as well. I also have a better understanding of how field and laboratory biologists conduct research, and what my future as a biologist might look like.",
    "This was a great class that exposed me to the interesting field of primatology.",
    "I learned so much about primate diversity and ecology, a field I had never studied before. It was interesting to think about human behaviors in the context of non-human primate behaviors.",
    "How to critically analyse scientific papers, recognise primate characteristics, form scientific questions based off of data."

   "comments": [
    "One of the strengths of this course was the collaboration between the professor, the TF and the students. Each class was taught as a discussion instead of a lecture, which lent to a comfortable and open environment. Also, the meditations at the beginning of class were awesome! I think the main weakness of the course was the distribution of material and assignments. The first half of the course included a short research assignment, two quizzes and a midterm, on top of weekly or twice-weekly forms on the readings. Also, the readings were quite long and information-heavy. The second half of the course only had a few forms, a draft of the final paper and the final paper itself, and the readings were much shorter and easier to understand. I found the first half to be high-stress and the second half pretty relaxing, so keep that in mind when you're picking out your other courses.",
    "This course was great because it started with an overview of the great diversity that the therm \"primate\" encompasses, and then dove into the biological and behavioral specifics of different primate subgroups. I leave this class feeling much more knowledgeable about primates and interested in studying this group further. The professor was also great at making sure his non-STEM (or at least non-E&EB) students were able to engage with the material and apply some of the concepts we learned in their own fields. I feel that this may have kept the course from going as deeply into the biological models and other material as I would have personally liked, but I appreciated his efforts to keep his material accessible to the majority of the class, which comprised students who may have had little to no biolog background.",
    "The strength of the class is the personalized way of learning and the fact that the professor is super passionate about what he does. The combination of those two factors makes going to class very enjoyable. A small class size also facilitates learning.",
    "Strengths: engaging, interesting subject, understanding professors, varied learning methods for those who are non-science and science majors. Weaknesses: I truly enjoyed the class, and can't think of anything I didn't enjoy."

    "It's so hard to pin down whether this was a good class or not. Professor Fernandez-Duque attempts to stress intellectual curiosity and engagement with the material which is fantastic. However the result is that it's never fully clear what he wants out of the students and as such it makes for a poor class to take as a non-stem major. It isn't that the class is heavy on jargon, it isn't. It's that Eduardo expects you to think about the material the same way he does, and I could never get on his level. I haven't taken another class at Yale that was so easy yet so frustrating. I never felt out of my depth with the material and felt prepared for every exam. I felt that every exam was pretty easy, but I never got a good grade. Eventually I got so frustrated that I disengaged with the class and stopped going.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I'm not an anthropology or E&EB major, and I still enjoyed it and got a lot out of it. Professor Fernandez-Duque is very smart and I learned a lot from him, not only about biological anthropology but about science in general.",
    "I would highly recommend this course! The reading load could be a bit much for a STEM course at times, and the longer readers were sometimes the most dull, but Professor Fernandez-Duque tailored the class toward understanding concepts more than recalling and regurgitating specific details. His lectures were generally easy to understand, and he was clearly very passionate about the field. I won't lie and say that the treks toward Science Hill for a 9AM course weren't rough, but I can honestly say that this is the first course I've encountered in my time at Yale that was worth that hassle.",
    "I would really recommend this course, specially to non-science students.",
    "If you're curious about E&EB, this is a great class to take, regardless of your major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material was extremely interesting and Prof. Fernandez-Duque is a great lecturer and person. No previous knowledge on primates or ecology is necessary.",
    "Yes, it wasn't overwhelming, it was interesting, Professor Fernandez-Duque was very understanding and engaging. It was overall worth taking"
