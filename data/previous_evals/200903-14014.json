    "This class wasn't particularly good. It wasn't really bad, it just didn't impress me much. The structure was a bit muddled, the professor rambled, and it never cohered into anything comprehensible.",
    "I feel I've learned A LOT from the readings, but wish the teaching was differently structured. I thought the key points were lost and a lot was unclear.1. I was unclear how the class was going to unfold. At one point, the professor said that she planned to have a GIS lab to complement her teaching (that never happened).2. Use of time was a little funny. Two classes were canceled because the professor was not available. One class topic was skipped due to lack of time, but it felt like two class periods were devoted to seeing pictures of Cuba and Belize.3. A number of the key lessons in the course were not explicitly addressed in the powerpoint presentations. The flow of the presentations seemed more incidental than planned.That said, I did benefit overall from the course and really enjoyed many of the readings. I feel like this course plays an important role in my overall experience here.",
    "I have alot of respect for Dr. Pope. I enjoyed her course and method of lecturing. I can't stand 2 hr courses though. blah. I am walking away from this course with a greater understanding in MEDICAL GEOGRAPHY and its importance in public health. However, I really didn't care for anything else. The tradeoff for this course is there is a huge term paper at the end of the year that just goes on forever. However, her midterm and final exams are very fair and actually test your knowledge of the readings and lectures.",
    "Topics covered were always interesting, the readings were relevant, and Dr. Pope's lectures were engaging. Very comprehensive and unique class.Dr. Pope was involved with our class and was dedicated to getting us engaged about health geography, even outside the classroom.Class could potentially be improved by having a session on GIS?",
    "This course was not structured very well and the topics seemed very redundant. Also, lectures were off topic and I felt that what we read was not reflected in the syllabus nor was it discussed in class. In general, medical geography is very interesting but lectures were not very helpful. Papers assigned throughout the course felt like busy work and having a midterm, final, and final paper just seemed like busy work.",
    "Interesting readings, loved medical geography.",
    "Good and interesting class!",
    "I felt like the work load given in this course was fair, however I didn't think that a final exam was necessary after such a long final paper was already required. My main issue with the course is that I found it to be rather unorganized. Often times it was difficult to find all of the course readings required for a week. Lecture slides were also not set up on the course website in a comprehensive manner.",
    "This class could have been a little better organized into beginning with intro to geography, theories, and concept and then led into the methods used in the research and literature such as GIS and mapping. Then the course could have had each lecture emphasize a topic such as HIV, Malaria, Typhoid, etc. Also, in terms of coursework, it was a little stressful towards the end to have both a final exam and a 20 page research paper. It might have been better to have a final exam and a class presentation instead.",
    "I was very interested in the material, so I was disappointed that it wasn't taught in a clear or interesting way. I feel like the way that the course was taught got in the way of what I wanted to learn in the course.",
    "I felt that this course had an interesting subject matter. I enjoyed the discussions on the readings, and I felt that the midterm and final were fair.However, I felt that there was a lack of organization in the class. Although certain topics were outlined on the course syllabus, we rarely touched on all of the readings and often discussed tangents as opposed to the topic at hand. I felt that the majority of readings were \"dated\". In most of my classes in the school of public health, we are asked to read and analyze current research. We also highlight historical examples in public health for specific purposes. However, I felt that the majority of readings for this class were from several decades ago, and are simply not as relevant today. (For example we read several articles on the HIV\/AIDS epidemic, yet most of the articles were from 10\/15 years ago and the epidemiology of the disease has changed significantly in recent years). This left me feeling frustrated and wondering how the informationthat I was learning would make me at all competitive in the job market.I would additionally make the recommendation that the 20-page paper be due several weeks before the final paper because having them due on the same day created an unnecessary strain at the end of the semester.",
    "course materials, topics, and readings were very interesting but lectures were slow and pointless. prof pope is clearly an expert in her field but her lectures were not dynamic enough. no interesting class discussions, not challenging. she also puts students down when they participate at times.",
    "Good.Early on some of the readings were abstract although later readings were more interesting.",
    "Strengths: compelling lecturing style, interesting readings, fun and stimulating final essayWeakness: Professor Pope does not respond well to students offering opinions that differ from hers."

    "Instructor: Cynthia Pope \u00a0I wanted to like her, but she's really rather hard to like. Careless about things like keeping track of student assignments, somehow surprised that students did the reading, came to class, and completed the assignments, and difficult to have a class discussion with - seems to draw arbitrary lines around what she will and won't talk about in class, is uncomfortable with intellectual curiosity from students, etc.",
    "Instructor: Cynthia Pope \u00a0see above",
    "Instructor: Cynthia Pope \u00a0Dr. Pope has a delightful sense of humor, wealth of geography knowledge, and a genuine respect for students.",
    "Instructor: Cynthia Pope \u00a0Dr. Pope's lectures were engaging. She is flexible as a professor, which is nice. She also makes an effort to get our class engaged about health geography outside of the classroom, which is great.Could be helpful for Dr. Pope to give us more brief, one sentence definitions for themes, concepts, and frameworks used in health geography. I know that I understand what everything I've learned in the class means, but sometimes it's just helpful to be able to get it outin a very concise manner rather than having to describe it to get out a \"definition.\"",
    "Instructor: Cynthia Pope \u00a0Professor Pope is very knowledgeable in medical geography, but I felt like the lectures were steered off topic and what we read for class was hardly discussed.",
    "Instructor: Cynthia Pope \u00a0Enthusiastic instructor. Really interesting to hear about her experience in Belize and Cuba.",
    "Instructor: Cynthia Pope \u00a0The instructor was very good at giving feedback to students. However, again at times there were some organizational issues in terms of lecture slides that could be improved upon.",
    "Instructor: Cynthia Pope \u00a0Professor Pope is very bright, well traveled, and well versed in the field of medical\/health geography. She is enthusiastic about the class and about engaging students to learn and think about the material. She emphasizes what concepts to take away from the class very well. Many of the readings chosen for the course were very interesting and emphasized the topics and concepts covered in lecture.",
    "Instructor: Cynthia Pope \u00a0She was friendly and easy to get along with, but did not teach the course well and did not challenge us to write well.",
    "Instructor: Cynthia Pope \u00a0I enjoyed Professor Pope's lectures on Cuba and Belize, since these are the areas in which her research specializes. However, I felt that the lectures in general lacked focus and cohesion. Only on occasion did we stick to the subject-matter listed on the course syllabus. I also felt that some of our discussions were based on outdated public health readings.",
    "Instructor: Cynthia Pope \u00a0interesting person with a lot of experience and knowledge but not a stimulating lecturer. highly disorganised.",
    "Instructor: Cynthia Pope \u00a0Good.Sometimes the course was not well coordinated and the instructions were not very clear at times.",
    "Instructor: Cynthia Pope \u00a0Professor Pope has considerable familiarity with the material and communicates it extremely well to her students. However, she seems extremely uncomfortable with, and even antagonistic toward, students who disagree with her on any subject."

   "comments": [
    "Not worth taking. many of the readings were really interesting, but the class itself is not informative or helpful.",
    "This course brings a different perspective on public health to the table. There are some common points with epidemiology, GIS, and socio-behavioral determinants of health- but this class adds value. I learned about different types of diffusion (of ideas or disease), more about therapeutic and risky spaces, and the history of disease spread and public health approaches.",
    "I would say yes so long as you want deal with that nasty term paper at the end of theyear.",
    "Topics covered in the class were always interesting, the readings were always relevant to class discussions, Dr. Pope's lectures were interesting and engaging. We also had great class conversations. Dr. Pope is also a great professor - she is a good lecturer, is very warm and flexible with students and makes an effort to get to know them and help them become more engaged in health geography. She also makes herself very available to students when needed. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Overall, the course is interesting, yet I felt like the readings were a bit redundant and lectures were off-topic.",
    "Definitely",
    "I would recommend it. It brings a different perspective than we are used to, and I think the perspective is very valuable for all kinds of research!",
    "I would not recommend this course",
    "I would not recommend the course",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student only if they were an undergraduate and had a limited background in global health and infectious disease.",
    "interesting subject matter. easy class. professor is not great.",
    "Good course.Lengthy readings that are heavy on the social sciences. Course helps one look at diseases and their spread in a different light.Recommended",
    "The course is an overview of medical\/health geography concepts, traditions, and literature. I would recommend it, with caution, to students who know little about medical\/health geography and are not put off by Professor Pope's tendency to put down students who offer differing opinions.Strengths: compelling lecturing style, interesting readings, fun and stimulating final essayWeakness: Professor Pope does not respond well to students offering opinions that differ from hers."
