    "The open-ended nature of the class was what made it so wonderful and also so frustrating.",
    "This has been one of my favorite classes so far! The material was really interesting, and it's really exciting to be studying a field where everything is constantly being updated (as evidenced by the \"news\" portion of our class) and everything is relevant and used in contemporary policymaking. Alark was a wonderful professor, extremely responsive to students and always willing to meet and provide advice. Discussions were always lively, interesting, and even funny at times. Everyone was very engaged with the material (probably a product of the weekly reading responses).",
    "The unique content. This is the first and only place I have been exposed to systems theory.",
    "Alark created a very friendly and open atmosphere in the class for varied and interesting discussions.",
    "Class discussion and weekly response. greatly elevated understanding on class materials.",
    "Most helpful were discussions of resilience as a boundary term, of assessment frameworks for resilience, and of differing perspectives on the \"right\" way to do resilient work. Class discussion was also robust.",
    "System thinking and interdisciplinary",
    "The class discussions were extremely helpful and enlightening and great guest speakers"

   "comments": [
    "At times I wish that Alark had taken more control of the direction of discussion and kept us on a schedule.",
    "It would be helpful if the instructor interfered more often when students were being overly critical.",
    "More variation in the content. I feel the course became quite repetitive. I'd also value more perspectives on how resilience work can be applied to careers outside of academic research or working directly in the environmental sector.",
    "Class discussion: the discussion is too open, allowing some student to throw an issue without limit. Some times discussion took substantial amount of time only on semantic issues just because some friends were really good on it.",
    "I would like to focus more specifically on resilience\/vulnerability assessments, and dive into one or two (including the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework) that Alark found most compelling. It would be useful to get practice using a framework, perhaps with a community in New Haven. This would be a great way to tie our coursework to practice, and perhaps to contribute to ongoing work in the community. Also, the student-led presentations were of varying quality and usefulness. Not sure how to remedy this. Also, if Alark is serious about capping the class at a reasonable number for discussion (12?18?) he should not then allow auditors to crowd the class. It is counterproductive to the point. The participation of the world fellows, however, was amazing. Finally, it could be fun to have an option of either the end of term paper OR of a client-driven project, allowing the course to again tie into real-world projects.",
    "Far too much repetitive theory in the beginning. Case studies should be used from the start so that the students coming from all different backgrounds have points of reference to discuss. It felt often that everyone was just sort of talking to themselves, with specific examples in mind that other people didn't understand.",
    "I think a case study class might be really interesting"
