   "comments": [
    "Do not take this class if you do not have to",
    "This class quickly and efficiently covers the foundations of calculus. The problem sets usually take about an hour each week. The two midterms and final were quite straight-forward and clearly covered the material that was taught in class.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Beginnings of calculus. Would recommend her section for QR credit or just to learn basic calc yes.",
    "If you haven't taken calculus before then definitely go for it. However, being the lowest math level offered absolutely doesn't make it an easy class. Make sure you will dedicate enough time to review the topics weekly and put enough effort in your psets to better understand the topics.",
    "If you do not have to take the class, don't. Unless math is your first love.",
    "I think that Math 112 is a good introduction to calculus course. The class goes through the topics at a good pace and the coursework is average. Overall not that difficult of a course and as long as you do the problem sets and pay attention in class success is highly likely. I think this is a good class to build a foundation in calculus.",
    "I would say that this class is not to difficult, but still a pretty decent challenge. I would definitely recommend it to other people.",
    "I would recommend it if they need the math credit",
    "Yes, I had a positive experience in math 112. It is a great course to take to get started on the right foot for higher math.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student unless they were required to take it. Calculus is not overwhelmingly interesting as a subject to begin with, and the class does little to make it more enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is what you would expect from a calculus class in terms of workload and difficulty. The instructor is great!",
    "It was a good course for learning the material, although tests can be strangely confusing and difficult.",
    "I took this course because I lacked a background in Calculus and as a prospective Economics major, I would eventually need Calculus. That being said, I would recommend this course if you either A. love math but wasn't able to take calculus in high school or B. need math for a specific graduation requirement. In other words, take this course only if you have to. I found the class to be considerably fast paced and as a result I did a lot of self studying\/went to a lot of tutoring sessions. If math is your thing, then this course shouldn't be a problem, and you should find the material to be pretty straight forward. Don't think that it'll be a piece of cake however since the midterms (there are 2) and the final are considerably tough and they compose the majority of your final grade. If math isn't your thing however, don't be discouraged! You'll finish this course with a pretty solid understanding of calculus, and you'll be ready to move on to higher levels of math; however, you should expect to put in a considerable amount of effort yourself. Oh and one more thing before I forget, when the professor (Lachowska) says that she has office hours, definitely take advantage of them! I personally wish I could have gone more than what I did because she's more than willing to go through the math step by step, and if you have any fundamental questions over the concepts that you're reviewing, she will thoroughly explain the answers to your questions too. Overall, I did enjoy the course because let's face it, learning new math is cool! You'll be fine. Good luck!",
    "The course is a good overview of basic Calculus.",
    "I would say that the course is a good way to review all the introductory concepts of calculus."
