   "comments": [
    "Math 120 is a fast paced course that can be overwhelming at times. Yu-Wen was a great teacher; she put a ton of effort into preparing for class, and was alway energetic and engaging. It seems as though her section does considerably better on the exams.",
    "I would only recommend this class to someone who likes math. The only reason I am taking it is for my major. I think if a student really enjoys and understand complex mathematics, they would like this class.",
    "I recommend this course",
    "A pretty fast-paced course, but you will learn what you need to learn if you keep up with the PSETs. Professor Hsu was encouraging and very helpful, especially before exams. Do try to get into the section of your choice, though (either through the lottery or by contacting the professor and going to the first class).",
    "I really liked this course! Definitely try to take it with Yu-Wen Hsu or Marketa Halicova. I had Yu-Wen and she was awesome! Not too much work if you stay on top of things.",
    "An overview of multivariable calculus, dealing with partial derivatives, double and triple integration, and vector fields.I would recommend that anyone interested in Math 120 choose the teacher very carefully. I've heard of great experiences (I would highly recommend Professor Hsu) and awful experiences.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn multivariable calculus--by the end, you'll definitely have covered all the topics (partial derivatives, double and triple integrals, and all the theorems) but don't expect anything terribly exciting or life-changing.",
    "Yu Wen did a good job of covering a ton of material in a short amount of time. It is a difficult class but her lectures were usually understandable although often confusing by the end. Read the book\/keep up with the psets and you'll be fine. The curve is really helpful.",
    "Math 120 was a great class! As someone who is numbers-oriented and very much enjoyed AP Calc in high school, Math 120 was a perfect continuation of my math career. I would absolutely recommend it.Math 120 provides a very thorough coverage of multivariable calculus. The exams are fair (everyone knows exactly what to expect), the workload is reasonable, and the curve is not nearly as harsh as people make it out to be. Whileit is true that some students have already taken multivariable going in, I would not say that someone who hasn't (like me) is at any kind of meaningful disadvantage.I have heard from my peers, however, that the Math 120 experience in varies significantly based on the professor. Everyone in Yu-Wen's sections and Miki's sections seems to very much enjoy the class, while students in other sections have mixed reactions.",
    "If you want to learn multi-variable calculus, I would recommend this class, even if you can study on your own through textbooks or online sources. Attending this class will make your studying easier and more efficient.",
    "If you take Math 120, definitely try to take it with Yu-Wen. She is a phenomenal teacher. and she puts a lot of effort into teaching the class. She's also one of the nicest people you'll ever meet.",
    "Standard multivariable course. Everything depends on the teacher you have. If you must take this course, take it with Miki or Yu-Wen!Despite short-ish psets, because they're graded stringently for accuracy, they take much longer than needed. You get so obsessed with getting the right answer that you lose much of the math in the process and don't learn as well as you could.",
    "Math 120 was definitely not my favorite class. The lectures felt really lengthy and sometimes I had two p-sets due a week for this class. I would have rather taken the ENAS equivalent.",
    "Absolutely take this class--with Professor Hsu. She is always willing to hold office hours and work with you when the course material gets tough. Problem sets are weekly, and some will take longer than others. The material of this course gets much more difficult as time progresses, so be prepared to put a little time into the class if need be. Nevertheless, I found the topics interesting and the class rewarding.",
    "If you have Yu-Wen Hsu, TAKE THIS CLASS. She is the nicest, most chill math teacher ever. She prepares you exceptionally well for the tests and is more than willing to meet with you for office hours or just after class and she will stay there for hours if you need it. The best math teacher I have ever had--made a class that a lot of people hate, a LOT of fun!",
    "An overview of multivariable calculus. Goes at a good pace, problem sets are manageable. 2nd and Final Exams are harder than the first, but nothing too tricky.",
    "A must-take!",
    "I had already been exposed to Multivariate calc in high school (as it seemed like about 1\/3 of the class had been) and this class really helped fill the gaps and organize everything for me. Getting a good instructor is pretty important (Yu-Wen Hsu is awesome!) as the less experienced instructors sometimes fall behind, which is really bad because the last couple weeks of material are both the most difficult and the most important. Psets don't aren't too bad as long as you understand what's going on. Overall, a good couse if you get a good section.",
    "Math 120 is a course about multivariable calculus. It is basically calculus in three dimensions. It is incredibly complicated and you have to be able to conceptualize complex structures based on equations. There are problem sets at least once a week, which are doable, but sometimes long, a couple quizes, and three heavily weighted exams. I would only recommend this course to someone who loves calculus and wants to learn more about its intricacies or someone who knows he or she wants to be a physics major. This is not a course for someone who does not like math or who only needs to fulfill a QR requirement.",
    "Math 120 was definitely a difficult class. I don't think you should enter in lightly as I did. I would highly recommend starting with a tutor from the beginning of the year and religiously attending office hours. Office hours are a great way to gain better understanding of the course material at a slower pace since it is very hard to gain that understanding simply from the scheduled classes. Yu-Wen also never makes you feel stupid for asking questions and she is a great resource.",
    "Take it if you need it as a pre-req, but prepare to put in studying and work for it.",
    "Only take this class if it's necessary.",
    "Math 120 is not for the feeble minded. It is a challenging course that will keep you on your toes throughout the semester. However, you will learn a lot, granted that you haven't previously taken Multi. There were mixed opinions on this class, depending on professor as well as prior math experience. Take this course if you legitimately enjoy math or would like to complete a math credit for your major and would like to test your abilities.",
    "I would recommend Math 120 06 to a fellow student--the class is informative and interesting. I would caution other students taking the class to be prepared for an above average workload and intense personal preparation time if they have not taken multi before.",
    "No, but if you're reading these, then you probably need to take the class for your major. Find Miki. Don't take an early math class, it's torture. I stopped going, in part because I hated my teacher but also because the class was at 9am.",
    "I think that this is definitely a class worth taking for anybody who wants to take any courses in the sciences or economics, and would still recommend it for others as well. It is not extremely difficult and is probably the most useful type of math that one can learn.",
    "Take it if you want a decent intro math course. Don't expect to have your mind blown though."
