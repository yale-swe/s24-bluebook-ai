    "I have learned so much about the Chinese language and also Chinese culture through this class! It's nice to be able to speak completely in Chinese with my family and recognize words in Chinese works.",
    "How to read, speak, and write simplified Chinese better!!!!",
    "I improved my speaking, reading, and writing all pretty drastically. I also learned more about Chinese cultures. If it means anything, my mom was very impressed with my speaking when I went back home.",
    "From this class, I learned about 10 new Chinese characters every week, as well as insight into Chinese culture and grammar.",
    "I learned a lot of new vocabulary and refined my grammar. I also learned a lot about Chinese culture through the readings and developed better speaking skills through class participation and presentations.",
    "Chinese vocabulary and grammar.",
    "Much more advanced knowledge of the chinese language, especially reading and writing skills",
    "I learned more skills in reading, writing, speaking, and understanding Chinese.",
    "I have learned skills to think, converse, and write in Chinese. I have reinforced my speaking skills greatly."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: It is so engaging and you actually get to speak so much with Chan Laoshi, so the learning rate is very fast. Weaknesses: the class is very fast-paced, and I wish we did more on how to correctly write all of the characters.",
    "This course is great. The one thing I didn't like was the tingxie: at the beginning, we had words chosen for us, and then it gradually moved to us knowing all the vocab. However, I find that memorizing a paragraph for the daily quiz at the beginning of class didn't really help me study or know the words, but rather cram all the vocab. When finals came around I was studying for hours and hours 1,000 characters, most that I had seen but didn't remember. Then again, I don't really know how the teachers could teach us all the words without showing us the context in which they were placed in the book.",
    "The course is well run, and a lot of fun if you stay on top of the work. The course gives you a lot of individualized feedback on your writing and speaking. Classes are fun, and you make a lot of good friends.",
    "There are very few weaknesses to the structure of this course. Since the class meets every day, it is easy to review and retain information. While the workload is heavy, it is necessary to learn that much information.",
    "The strength would be the seminar-style class. Speaking is the best way to learn and we did a lot of that in class. Also, it was engaging which is always a plus. A weakness would probably be the constant busy-work type assignments. It definitely helped in forcing me to learn new vocabulary but it just got annoying at times haha",
    "Strengths: - Highly engaging and enjoyable course - Instructor was friendly and made the class well worth attending - Feedback on assignments was timely and comprehensive - Essays and presentations encouraged deeper understanding of the language Weaknesses: - Class sometimes got repetitive, especially when we spent an entire week on a single chapter",
    "Small class and we all had many opportunities to speak and improve our chinese skills",
    "This has been one of my favorite classes so far because of the way it is organized. The strengths of this course is that it is requires active participation so you are constantly practicing Chinese in class as well as outside of class with your assigned TA. The professor is very fast in giving feedback on assignments and the lectures are broken down so that you can process each piece of the reading,."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to engage more with the language and is fairly well versed in terms of speaking.",
    "Yes, if they are heritage and want to improve their speaking, reading, and writing. Chinese is not a joke! The program at Yale is super strict and you learn a lot from it.",
    "Yes. Your mandarin improves a lot, and it's so much fun to be with the other students and Chan laoshi.",
    "I would recommend this course because the teacher is great, the literature is interesting (even if it is a textbook), and the information retained is useful.",
    "Yes, definitely. It is one of the most engaging classes I have taken here at Yale. Although it's a lot of busy work having to memorize vocabulary, it's worth it because of how much you can learn in one semester. You also get to interact with awesome peers and the Chan laoshi was super funny--she wasn't afraid to call out people in class and make fun of them lol",
    "Yes - definitely my favorite class this semester.",
    "Yes because I think it really improved my chinese language skills and gave me opportunities to practice my speaking in a comfortable setting",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a heritage speaker like me who can speak well but struggle with reading or writing. I came into the course knowing how to write only about ten words, now I can read and write A LOT more. This course is extremely rewarding and you are surrounded by heritage speakers who share your struggles and culture. The one caveat is that there is a lot of memorizing and you get rewarded based on the work you put into it."
