    "Awesome! This was a really fun class to take, with three really nice instructors. I felt like a learned a lot, and it was extremely satisfying to learn a whole new alphabet and become comfortable in such a different language. There was a cool mix of South Asian Americans and non-Indians in the class, which I think helped the class vibe. Can't wait for L2!",
    "Yes, Hindi is an interesting language and not having to worry about work overload is a bonus.",
    "I would not hesitate for a second to tell anyone to take Hindi. The script is beautiful and the culture is extremely interesting, not to mention the teachers are great and the students in the class were very nice. I shopped seven different L1 language courses before attending Hindi, and I can definitely say that the atmosphere in Hindi class is so much more conducive to learning that the other languages taught here.",
    "It is a fun language class.",
    "It's a fun class",
    "Take Hindi! The professors are by far some of the nicest and most patient I've encountered at Yale, and the material is very well taught. It is so different from English and the Romance languages that most students have taken in high school that it is truly a workout for the brain, but this novelty also keeps it interesting. There are also lots of supports in place if you feel lost at any point. Take this if you're looking for a moderate workload, excellent teaching styles, and a new and interesting experiences.",
    "Do it.",
    "Great language to take -- the professors make you feel welcome and at home in the class and you'll get out what you put in. Standard L1 stuff -- weekly quizzes etc but probably a little less work than most L1s. But really it's a joy to be in class every day.",
    "Hindi is a good class. Fun language, fun group of people.No native track - white kids get tooled around all semester. This is probably the only thing in life that I am miserable at yet still enjoy.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It's a great way to learn Hindi, to master grammar very quickly, and to be around people who come to the language for a variety of reasons. The class is pretty relaxed, too, which I appreciate. It takes time and repetition to learn a language, and the teachers understand that.",
    "Introductory Hindi class, and I was definitely surprised at how much I have learned in only one semester. If you pay attention and put in the effort, you'll definitely be fluent."
