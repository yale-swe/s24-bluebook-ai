    "This course is the crucible of Navier-Stokes. The work in the trenches seemed never ending and the problem sets went on ad infinitum. The material is obfuscated by a yoda like presentation of the fundamentals. By the end of the violence, my understanding had undergone a revolution. Because I study fluids, this was obviously useful."
