    "Q9: I was happy to go to NRDC and talk to people there, but it seemed like we could have gained just as much by talking to one of those people for a longer time at Yale. I just didn't see the point really of spending 5 hours of travel time to sit in a conference room all day. just the same, i learned a lot, but might have learned more in a more concentrated format.",
    "Kit and Hayley did an excellent job. I really appreciated how responsive Kit was to questions.It seemed like the course was a little backloaded. I know that the field trip was scheduled for when people in the class said that they could attend, so that's no fault of Kit's but having the Moot Court and the climate negotiations during consecutive weeks was challenging. Both of those exercises were great.",
    "Class was great - well run, purposeful and very useful. My only comment was that the field trip ended up being quite similar to what we get everyday (and hence shouldn't travel for): namely, lectures in a closed room. What would have been much more interesting and exciting would be if we had gotten to meet with NRDC employees in small groups (3:1) to talk about their jobs, how they got there, what they are doing, how it is to work at NRDC. As it was, I don't think I would have chosen to go on the field trip if I had known that we were just getting lectures in a conference room (not worth the full day away from being able to do work). Still, it was nice to meet some people at NRDC and see the building.",
    "Your experience depends on your fit with the client project and your team.",
    "Field trips\/lab activities were well designed and ran smoothly. Field trips were included in this course in two ways. First, there was a field trip to NRDC. This was well organized and efficiently executed, but the content was a little disappoint. I would suggest that in future years, rather than an all day seminar with lectures and discussions for the whole class together, breaking up into groups of 3-4 and meeting one on one with NRDC staff would be better. I'm sure there's a way for this to be arranged that would take the same time commitment (or perhaps less) from NRDC staff. Perhaps students could identify NRDC staff working on projects that interest them and then spend 30 mins together. Second, I spent two weeks at the UNFCCC conference in South Africa working with my client. This was a once in a lifetime learning experience and something that is an incredibly valuable part of my graduate program. I learned so much about how international environmental laws are negotiated and implemented.",
    "This was an excellent course. It was an opportunity for students to get hands-on experience in a real world project and work closely with a client organization.",
    "I think the trip to NRDC would have been more useful if it was more interactive. Maybe we could have had small group time with the speakers to hear more about their work and career paths.",
    "Question 9: Great Field trip, well planned and very productive. Visiting the NRDC building in NYC is a great addition to the course both fun and extremely educational. Thank you!"

They were all substantive, interesting projects for great organizations that allowed us to make real, significant contributions. I was really impressed with the projects from watching everyone\u0092s presentation at the end, and want to thank Kit for doing the work to put the list together!",

    "I am a FES student and was very interested in my client's project.",
    "We had a project which involved analyzing part of a complex regulatory scheme, which was of course riddled with pitfalls. Making responsible recommendations meant looking at the whole system so that changes to parts of it could be consistent with a concept of a better-integrated whole. So this was a practical exercise in the work I was most interested in at FES.",
    "This course fits very well into my program. I have been able to use the foundation I have gained in environmental law as well as knowledge from previous work experience. I am very thankful to have the opportunity to work on projects that I feel I can both contribute to and learn a great deal from.",
    "Working with the NRDC as a client allowed me to a have a great introduction to the Rio+20 topic and advocacy initiatives. Considering that I would like my master research to be focused on the Rio conference this experience was amazing."

    "my partner was living in NYC, so i never really got to work with him in person. this was extremely challenging at times, and made for the feeling of really working alone. However, i think doing the project in groups is a good idea, and would have probably been a lot easier to deal with had my partner lived in the same state as me.",
    "The main advantage was that my group partner possessed skills I did not, so our skill set balanced well. She also provided good, critical feedback on my work products and I did the same for her. The disadvantage was that we were both new to the issue and so we had to duplicate a lot of each other\u0092s work by reading the same documents to bring ourselves up to speed.",
    "Working in a group was vey helpful.",
    "My team was dysfunctional as a group. Those of us who put the required effort in to the project had to make it work individually. Which was also a useful experience.",

    "Nice to work on these bigger projects with a team - it would be great if there was a way to ensure law students were on teams that involved law topics.",

The professor recognizes this and advises us of such possibilities up front; this is part of professional work.",
