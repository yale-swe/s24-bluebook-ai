   "comments": [
    "Challenging but very fun and interesting to increase your knowledge about birds past the level of just taking the ornithology class.",
    "Yes! If you're taking the lecture, absolutely take the lab. It's a unique to see the world's avian diversity through some truly incredible specimens and fun field trips (doughnuts provided). It tends to be a small class so you can get a lot of help from and build close relationships with Professor Prum and the wonderful TAs.",
    "I personally loved this class-- it's been my favorite at Yale so far, and certainly the class in which I've learned the most. Still, I would hesitate to recommend it. It's brutally, brutally difficult-- ESPECIALLY for those who are not already birders or graduate students. Why? The entire class consists of one assignment-- to learn every bird family in the world. There are about 150. This is NOT EASY-- every test and quiz is about distinguishing different birds, telling where they live, how they live, what they eat, how they breed... still, if you make it through, you'll have completed an amazing task. It takes a lot to truly conquer such a large slice of animal diversity. Are you up for it? Think carefully. This lab can either be a beautiful, enlightening, constantly-interesting journey into nature-- or a steel wall of a class which may prove impenetrable. One final note-- if you take this class, utilize the TAs. Both are absolutely amazing, and saved my life many, many times. Can't figure out how to distinguish a chickadee from a penduline tit? Just ask the pros. They're here for you, and honestly I've rarely found a class with better teaching assistants.",
    "Take it. You will hate it the first few weeks, as you find it absolutely impossible to remember everything you have to learn. You will feel utterly incompetent. But stick with it. This class is really, really cool, and by the end you have learned to look at things (not only birds) in a new way, so that you notice details that you never would have appreciated before.This is a fantastic course. It honestly changed the way I think, and by that I mean that it trained my brain to think in a whole new way. In addition, I now have all this knowledge about and appreciation for the diversity of life on the planet. It was really cool to be exposed to the collections of the Peabody museum and really to a whole different world that I knew very little about, going in. It is also an excellent way to get to know Professor Prum better that you would from just taking the lecture, and that is also worth it for sure! Also, looking at birds is plain old awesome. Take it take it take it!!!! It is probably more work than the lecture, though, so beware if your schedule is already overloaded. And it requires a lot of memorization, which can seem pointless if you don't approach it in a particular way. But really, it is really cool to get to look at all those birds, and it is so worth it!"
