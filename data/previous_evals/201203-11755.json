   "comments": [
    "It is a requirement so there's not much of a way around it. A large portion of the experiments are fun and interesting and you can pick all of those. Prepare to spend a LOT of time on lab reports though, upward of 4 hours a week sometimes, which in conjunction with the afternoon spent in lab, is way too much for a half-credit.",
    "It's better than 205 in that the labs are more interesting and there's no final exam. You do have to write lab reports, which is less fun, but they're not terrible once you write the first couple of them. Don't do the 2D collisions lab or the oil drop experiment, those were way more trouble than they were worth.",
    "Take this class iff you have to. The labs are a lot of fun and are generally educative, but unlike 205L you have to write lab reports, which are a MAJOR grind and can take many HOURS. As such, this course is a lot more logically graded than 205L, the labs are more enjoyable, and it is A LOT MORE WORK. The fact that you only get 1\/2 a credit adds insult to injury, but whatever. You're here because you have to.",
    "I would recommend this course, because you can have a lot of fun.",
    "Compared with 205, 206 is more about getting experience with interesting experiments and less focused on data analysis. If you found 205 frustrating or boring, don't be afraid, 206 is a lot better and more interesting.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it. Most likely if you're taking it, you have to. You'll probably enjoy it, at least compared to some other classes.",
    "I would recommend the class if you need to take a physics lab, but don't take it just for fun. It's better than 205 because the labs are more interesting, and the lab reports aren't too much work each week. Definitely do the superconductivity lab. Millikan is *incredibly* frustrating, but also kind of cool and only one lab report over two weeks. The accelerator lab is interesting and pretty simple. Don't be afraid to ask for help from the TA and others because that can make the experience much more pleasant",
    "This lab is more work that 205L but A LOT more interesting. I really enjoyed going to lab (although the write-ups were a pain), and I definitely recommend taking it.",
    "This is a not-too-painful lab. It's much better than 205: the experiments are more interesting. The expectations and grading of lab reports depends a lot on your TA, but it's unlikely to be too terrible. Not necessarily enjoyable, but entirely survivable.",
    "With the right TA and if you choose the right labs, this lab is very manageable and not too much work. The labs are also mostly very interesting and cool.",
    "PHYS 206L is way more fun, engaging and interesting than PHYS 205L. Don't let your impressions of 205L turn you off for 206L. You get to pick your own experiments and the Superconductivity lab and Particle Accelerator labs were some of the coolest experiments I've got to play around with.Be warned though that lab reports can take a long time and do not constitute a half credit at all. Data analysis and figuring out equations in the lab to answer questions will take up as much time as a full credit class, so keep that in mind when planning your workload. Of course, you decide to spend less time on these reports, but it will affect your grade and there is no final examination like in 205L.",
    "You get to pick your labs, so choose wisely. The difficulty as well as your personal interest can vary considerably from lab to lab. The lab reports are not very hard but pretty boring.",
    "Take it if you're interested in seeing physics in a laboratory setting",
    "You would be crazy not to take this course after slogging through 205. Lab reports can be time consuming, but you get to do all kinds of cool experiments. If you like physics, it's easily worth the effort.",
    "Much more interesting than 205 but slightly more work",
    "Take it if you need to. The labs are a lot of work, but it is very interesting. YOu get to choose the labs you do over the course of the semester, so you are doing what you like. The experiments are advanced and interesting. I definitely enjoyed being in the course.",
    "206 is nice. It's chill and not hard, and the experiments are interesting and manageable.",
    "This is a rigorous lab course, in which you will learn a lot but also work very hard. DEFINITELY take it with someone you know and work well with -that was crucial to my enjoyment of the labs. I highly recommend it, and it is infinitely better than 205"
