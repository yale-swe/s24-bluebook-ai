   "comments": [
    "Great way to learn a lot about taphonomy and a broad scope of fossilization methods. Also a wonderful opportunity to conduct research for a constrained period of time, with the possibility of continuing further after the semester.",
    "Take this course. You will not regret getting to hear about really cool and interesting fossils\/taphonomic phenomena, and you will not regret getting to do a paleontological project of your own. It is a lot of work to put together a decent project (it's your whole grade, too) but it is such an exciting and rewarding process that if you have the time I wholeheartedly recommend that you do it! Also, lectures are super awesome, and they're made even better by the fact that you don't have to memorize anything for a final exam or test of any sort. They're really about learning for learning's sake. Amazing. Also, take the class for Derek. He's one of the best professors at Yale.",
    "Extraordinary Glimpses of Past Life is really what the title suggests--each lecture is a glimpse into a type of preservation that reveals an extraordinary amount of detail in fossils, from color to bacteria to soft body parts. There's no homework or exams; instead you work on a lab project throughout the whole semester, which will culminate in a lab report followed by a presentation. So the work here is pretty back-heavy (i.e. working all Thanksgiving break to write up the report), but otherwise it's very low-stress throughout the whole semester. In class there's a lot of geochemistry on top of biology, so if you don't know any geochem be prepared to be either a bit confused or very bored. Honestly you'll get only as much out of the course as you want--if you don't pay attention then no consequence except lost time, but if you're interested there's lots of supplementary reading available (as well as the option to just talk to Derek and the TA outside of class). But otherwise Derek's a great teacher and mentor, on top of being one of the most famous paleontologists in the world, so if you're at all interested in paleo, invertebrates, or invertebrate paleontology, then you should definitely get a chance to learn from him.",
    "GG 355 is traditionally a small class of graduate students. This year was an exception, with half a dozen undergraduates joining the mix, but Derek was accommodating as always about the larger, more varied group of students. Be prepared to work beyond what is expected of you for a grade if you want to make the most out of this class. Derek will give you all the lecture and reading material you need to thoroughly learn about taphonomy, both experimental and observed from the study of fossils. This class may be your only chance to learn from the renowned Derek Briggs, who is as excellent a lecturer as he is kind a person. GG and EEB students should consider taking the class as long as they're serious about learning the topic.",
    "An interesting course. If you're at all interested in paleontology or think you might be, or interested in the geology behind it, take this course!",
    "You'll get a great overview of the fossilizatIon of soft-bodied organisms in this class. The course is high level, but not inaccessible to those with little background in taphonomy or paleontology in general. There are no regular homework assignments or examsjust a semester-long project. I personally loved this. I got to study a particular taphonomic problem in depth and turn in my final paper before the beginning of reading period. This was a wonderful course. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "1) Derek Briggs is amazing. Even if you are not the most interested in paleontology, Extraordinary Glimpses will expose you to the methods and motivations of studying exceptionally preserved fossils with one of the scientists who started it all. 2) Real research experience. There are no exams, no homework, only a research project which you will conduct in collaboration with G&G grad students, postdocs, and professors, which (depending on how much time you want to put in) has the potential for publication. Absolutely take G&G 355 if you are interested in conducting actual paleontological research, not just lab exercises, with a professor who wants to get to know his students and help them succeed."
