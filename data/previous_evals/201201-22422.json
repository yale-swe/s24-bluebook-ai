   "comments": [
    "The material is fascinating if you are interested in medicine. It brings together medicine and research and gets you really excited about what is happening at Yale. It allows you to really use the biological principles you've learned in other classes and applies to medicine. Biology is important, after all!",
    "This course covers useful material for med school, but you get a lot of variability because of the different professors for different blocks. Sections were optional, no work outside of class except to study for the 5 block exams. Tests consisted of 4-5 essay questions, in which you basically regurgitate as many details as you remember. There was also an option to write a 10-page paper to boost your grade by one full letter grade. Overall, glad I took the class, it wasn't too much work and I learned a lot.",
    "Cool upper-level bio class. Take if you're interested in the material and looking for a lighter load, interesting if not earth-shatteringly exciting class.",
    "It's a course with a lot of material and can be quite difficult, but the set up of the course prevents it from being overwhelming or too hard. The ability to drop a bad exam and write an optional paper make the course more reasonable in terms of grades. You cover a lot of information and learn a lot, and I found it very worth it.",
    "Yes. TAKE IT BEFORE THE MCAT!!! The only helpful course related to the human body.",
    "Biological Reaction to Injury is a fascinating course if you are planning on doing anything with medicine or biomedical research. The course is divided up such that you get a picture of many aspects of current topics in medicine for various organ systems and major diseases such as cancer. The downside of this course is that there are five different professors, and each one gives you an exam at the end of his module. They all have slightly different styles so you never know what to expect on the exams. Fortunately, they are not cumulative, and there are still opportunities to do well in the course. It's just hard to tell where you stand.",
    "This is probably the most applicable and useful biology class at Yale. It's a significant amount of work, but it's not too bad because the material isn't cumulative.",
    "Great class. A lot of physiology is covered, but in a very medical context. I highly recommendthis to any pre-med especially. Also, 5 exams instead of midterms or finals makes the material pretty manageable.",
    "Excellent class. Take it. Every instructor is brilliant. Some are better lecturers than others, but all have a lot to each.",
    "This has been my favorite MCDB course! I definitely recommend it for all premeds, because you really do learn so much about how disease functions. The material is extremely interesting, and the grading is very forgiving: you get to drop 1 and of 5 midterms, there's no cumulative final, and you can improve your grade by writing an optional (non-graded) paper or just by going to section every week. Overall, such a great class!",
    "Take this class...it's sometimes hard to figure out what they want in a test answer but the content of this class is so interesting and teaches you so much about the multitude of different ways the body can respond to injury.",
    "Almost all of the material in the class was very interesting to me (especially the last unit on cancer biology). There are 5 professors, each of whom teaches one unit. Some of the professors (Madri, Morrow, Sklar) are good, while others (Kashgarian and West) are hard to follow or not very engaging. Be prepared to fight (with lots of premeds!) against a tough curve. Cr\/D would be a good idea if you don't need another bio elective for your major (but chances are you do). The TAs often take off points for very arbitrary reasons (especially one TA in particular).",
    "Great class. I enjoyed learning about biology from a different perspective, and I appreciated the level of detail some of the professors went into. This is information you might not learn in any other class, and it's taught by rotating Pathology professors, so you get a new look at science. I'm assuming this is a class many pre-meds would be attracted to. I also enjoyed the synthesis of current research in lecture. What could be done better is structuring the different lecturer's topics so they meshed with each other - they were a bit disconnected. It wasn't too difficult, but it required keeping up with the material on a regular basis. Each of the lecturers had their own strengths and weaknesses, but all shared an enthusiasm for their topic and the desire to engage their class. I would definitely recommend this class to any MCDB major.",
    "This is a great class, especially for a pre-med biology major. There is no work besides studying, which is great, because you'll need a lot of time to study if you really want to feel prepared for the exams. It's great that there are 5 exams spread throughout the semester and they aren't cumulative, so you can focus on one section ata time. The first three lecturers were better than the last two, but you do feel a lot better about yourself if you go to the lectures. If you feel like you've taken enough biology courses to be prepared for this class, then I highly recommend you take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The class is taught by MDs, which is great because they know the basic science, but can also talk about the clinical side of the information. If you're pre-med, you should definitely take this course, but even if you aren't, you still should!!",
    "Great course to understand the body, how it works, and why things happen as they do in biology in relation to disease. Take it and you won't regret it. The tests were great but they changed the syllabus in the middle of the course which was very inconvenient. TAs were awesome along with test format.",
    "MCDB 315 is, overall, a very worthwhile class, especially for any premed MCDB majors. Among all the classes in the MCDB department, Reaction to Injury best bridges the gap between basic science knowledge and clinical practice: it draws upon what you already learned in Cell Bio and Genetics and applies it to human physiology and pathology. The course is broken down into five \u0093blocks,\u0094 each taught by a different professor: reaction to injury, the renal system, the gastrointestinal system, angiogenesis, and cancer biology. The blocks on the renal system and the GI system are useful review if you\u0092re planning to take the MCAT, and the cancer biology unit is very interesting. Each block is followed by a non-cumulative exam, which is both good and bad; it\u0092s good because it\u0092s compartmentalized and non-cumulative, but it\u0092s bad because you basically have a major exam every two and a half weeks, all semester long. There\u0092s an optional 8-10 page paper to drop your lowest exam grade or as extra credit. That said, the five lecturers vary widely in their teaching ability. The lecture content is all interesting, but some of the lecturers are exceptionally boring. There\u0092s no textbook for the class, so if you can make yourself pay attention to really boring lecturer for 75 minutes, you\u0092ll be totally fine.",
    "The material in this class is veryinteresting. If you're pre-med, you will see the biology you've been drilling in the past few years applied to human disease processes. If you're not, it's great to see how specific cellular mechanisms fit into the general scheme of disease. The work-load is fairly low: there are no extra readings or homework assignments, just five tests (you get to drop one OR write an optional 10-12 pg paper to boost your grade). The tests are a little nitpicky, so you better know the details... Luckily, all the professors post notes summarizing the material they present in class. Some notes are better than others. Overall, it's a fairly easy class, though not necessarily an easy A. (Nobody does poorly, but because there are so many pre-meds, losing a few stupid points here and there can easily put you in the B+ range.) Finally, if they haven't changed this in the OCI listing yet - this class is NOT capped.",
    "I liked this course because it was one of the only biology courses at Yale that I've taken that directly put the focus on topics with direct medical applications. I also liked the 5 test with optional paper format of this class. Some of the topics were more interesting and better taught than others. One drawback of the five professor format of the class was that the different sections of the class were disjointed. The course also has a tougher curve than some of the other courses here.",
    "This was a very enjoyable course that takes all the molecular, cellular material you've learned from before and applies to human diseases. As a pre-med, I found it particularly interesting to learn about something on the more macro level. There are 5 \"blocks\" of different material taught by 5 different professors, and there are 5 corresponding exams (with about 5 essay questions each), which seems like a lot, but on the plus side, you have less material to review and you master each block better."
