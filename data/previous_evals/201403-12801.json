    "I would very highly recommend this class to other students.",
    "I promise you will have a ton of fun in this class! Will you find heroes taking baths in bacon, women turning into flies, magical claws stealing babies, or crazy journeys to the Otherworld in any other class? I really don't think so. What I'm trying to say is: the reading is a great reason to take this class. The class itself is also worthwhile. It seems to attract quirky\/insightful people. It meets once a week, and there are two papers. Professor Gabriel is a wonderful man; you should try to have him as a professor if you can.",
    "Fairly chill, frequently delightful. The texts are not quite what you'd expect (or maybe they are, if you had a clearer idea of what old Irish sagas looked like than I did before I took this class), but they usually trigger really interesting discussions."
