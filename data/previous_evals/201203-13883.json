    "the format of the class was a little dry, could have involved more discussion, could be more student lead (maybe more homework or mini projects)I liked that we learned to do a systematic review",
    "General overview of obesity. It was an okay course.",
    "Great class. Learned a lot, and now have a paper I plan on publishing!",
    "Good broad view of the problem of obesity. Excellent opportunity to complete a potential publication.",
    "Very interesting course material, not a great deal of outside work for the course. Starting the systematic review early is a good idea.",
    "I enjoyed how the lectures covered an array of topics, and additionally incorporated speakers from outside YSPH. It was also helpful to work on the systematic review incrementally throughout the semester to gain feedback on the topic and process.",
    "Great class. Taught me how to do a systematic review. All of the work came at the end of the semester. Perhaps having us do the intro, methods, results, etc. as assignments can make it less bottom heacy. Also more class discussion would be great.",
    "The course provided students with a strong background into causes of and prevention interventions relating to obesity. Dr. Irwin's expertise and the guest lectures made for a very interesting course.",
    "Excellent overview of obesity and the current evidence on interventions. I wish there was a final lecture summarizing the main points of the course and key papers in the area.The assignment was an excellent way to create a comprehensive piece of work on the subject and contribute to the literature under the instructor's guidance.",
    "Really enjoyed this course. Coming in, I believed that this class was to be more biological, but I really appreciated learning about the how integral behavioral components are for weight loss. I really enjoyed the semester project, and after several revisions look forward to submitting my review for publication.",
    "Excellant",
    "I really enjoyed this class. It covered great topics involving the biological, social, and behavioral factors related to obesity. I also liked completing the systematic review throughout the course and the class presentations.",
    "This class was very informative, but I would enjoy more of a discussion as opposed to a lecture.",
    "I loved this course. It really expanded my interest on issues surrounding obesity. Lectures covered different aspects of the epidemic but were planned in a way that made sense. The graded components of the class were not necessarily related o lectures but Melinda was so helpful in providing individual feedback that I still felt prepared and supported."
