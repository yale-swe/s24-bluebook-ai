    "Same idea as the first lab: Dr. Nelson is so lovable and so nice! The experiment is quite interesting, because it's an actual experiment that can end up failing at the end of the semester. The class this year was even less work in the second lab, if possible.",
    "If you're premed, you need a year of bio lab, and a semester of nucleic acids (I and II) fulfills this. It's pretty decent, really chill.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student, whether or not a Biology major. Unlike most undergraduate lab, this class is not about following a cookbook and repeating experiments that have already been performed several times. Rather, it will allow you to engage in new research, and approach it with critical thinking. It will also allow you to acquire or refine fundamental laboratory skills, and it will give you the honor to use some pretty cool and unique instruments and techniques that not every undergrad at Yale gets to use!",
    "If you take the first half of this course - unless you need to take another required lab, such as biochemistry lab (though it is not half as enjoyable as this one) - take the second half. This year, it was a bit on the smaller size, but the camaraderie of the class was fantastic. Instead of a final paper, this portion of the class concludes with a ten-minute presentation on a paper of your choice, dealing with the relevant techniques learned in class.",
    "It's a good course. If you can't make it into 342L, take 343L if possible."
