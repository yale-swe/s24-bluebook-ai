    "Good",
    "This course requires a lot of investment in time, effort, attention but yields valuable skills and insights.",
    "It's a mandatory course for first-year PhD students that covers core macroeconomic theory and methods. The course provides important preparation for thecomprehensive exam in macro at the end of the year.",
    "I think the course is a serious introduction to macroeconomics. I for sure recommend it to another student.",
    "This is probably the toughest of the first term courses, but it is in my view also very interesting and rewarding. You will start out on some time series and filtering techniques before moving into consumption topics such as the permanent income hypothesis. In the second quarter, you will cover DSGE models, focusing on topics such as the Lucas model, real business cycles, or Ramsey taxation.I would recommend the course, but stress that it is more work than any other first term course.",
    "Yes, I would reccomend it.",
    "I definitely recommend this course."

    "Even though I had had some previous preparation in macroeconomics, this course has still had a lot to learn for me. I had not understood the concepts and tools of, for example, spectral analysis or hyperbolic discounting; now I can say I do.",
    "Thorough threatment of dynamic programming methods and the neoclassical framework that is at the core of macroeconomic theory.",
    "I really deepened my knowledge of macro.",
    "The course provided a very good introduction to macroeconomics and significantly deepened my understanding of value functions, DSGE models, etc. It also helped me to improve my programming skills in Matlab.",
    "As I did not have a broad exposure to this field in my past studies, it has been very useful to deepen my knowledge in macroeconomics."
