    "I would recommend the class for anyone who wants to take Korean. It is, in whole, a class which emphasizes the spoken language of Korean, and integrates writing and culture into the mix.",
    "Korean 130 01 is a wonderful class. It is a class full of fun and inspiration. I definitely recommend it to another student because the course has definitely improved my Korean and the teacher is absolutely wonderful. She was always eager to help and teach. I really enjoyed the class. If there was a class I had to repeat it would be this one.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a fellow student who is interested in improving his or her Korean.",
    "Highly recommended as a cheerful and effective learning experience.",
    "TAKE IT! If you're interested in learning Korean, taking it at Yale is a good option--according to my experience so far. I highly recommend the course. It is a fun way to practice everyday."
