   "comments": [
    "I have learned how to model diseases and interpret differential systems.",
    "This class, although challenging, is one of the most interesting math classes I've taken. You will be able to take the ideas learned in calculus and use them to understand various systems. You can get a better understanding of how things work and how you can use math to model them. It helps you arrive at an intuitive understanding of some more abstract topics in math.",
    "Learned a lot about very specific math that I do not find applicable or useful in any other context.",
    "This class was packed with an extremely large amount of mathematical techniques that are very relevant to any field of sciences, but especially biology. The class was extremely interesting, and the knowledge I gained from the class will be invaluable for upper-level science courses. My mathematical intuitions and skills were vastly improved. It was a challenging math class, but you really geta feeling for the purpose behind why we do certain things in math.",
    "This course is the first course in math that I have ever taken that has challenged me and taught me how to use math in a way that I had never thought of before. I learned how to apply math to real life situations, and how math can be useful for the biological sciences.",
    "I learned a lot about modeling (predator-prey, epidemic models, etc.) and introductory stuff to linear algebra and a couple other things. I would say that this course is not an exact equivalent to Math 115 and you learn a lot of things beyond the scope of Calc BC\/Math 115, but you do cover things like integrals and series just on a quicker and more shallow scale.",
    "Basic calculus skills, how to read and interpret scientific palers",
    "Reading biomath literature Modeling disease, sir models Modifying models Eigenvalues",
    "My calculus skills greatly improved while also learning how to understand research articles better.",
    "I developed skills in reading and interpreting scientific papers. I also learned a great deal about calculus, which was taught in a manner relating to biology, which I found very interesting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is very engaging and applicable to real-life, however the pace of the course speeds up considerably towards the end of the semester.",
    "The course was great at helping students use idea of calculus to understand systems and get an intuitive appreciation of these various mathematical ideas. However, the course did move too quickly and there were times when we approached topics like linear algebra without taking the time to understand the basics of it.",
    "This course was very difficult! As someone who took calculus in HS and actually placed into Math 120, I thought this would be a breeze. However, the course focuses on very specific, niche topics that I do not find applicable in any other context (like nullclines, taylor polynomials, etc). Problem sets and exams were also SO DIFFICULT that I struggled immensely all semester. We also had to read articles that were beyond our capabilities of understanding as students, which really just made me resent the subject entirely.",
    "The major strength of the course is the interdisciplinary nature of course at its very foundations. The course is a math course, taught by the DUS of math, catered toward science, in particular, biology students. The materialial was extremely relevant to math, and I felt like this was a great supplement to the typical MATH 115 curriculum that also served as a small introduction into applied mathematics. The only weakness of the course is that the concepts are very difficult, and it can be very hard to know how things fit together until the end, because many of the things done in the class come from different areas of math and science.",
    "This class is MUCH more interesting than it's alternative, MATH 115. You actually learn useful math and how to apply it to cool and relevant biological situations. I engaged with this course much more than I would have with another more boring math class. However, this class was EXTREMELY hard. This is supposed to be a replacement for 115, but you cover almost none of the same material. This courses basically covers all of calc 2, some of calc 3, and all of linear algebra. The pace is lighting quick and it can be very hard to keep up a lot of the time.",
    "Professor Hall was an amazing instructor and I loved the level of personal engagement you could have with him directly. I would've appreciated more help on the problem sets (maybe open a Piazza so students can ask questions or to take some time afterwards to go over difficult questions) since they were really difficult. I also think it would've been nice to have more student engagement in class, such as having students volunteer in class to present problems or try on the board how to solve certain things. Otherwise, I really enjoyed this class because it was challenging but rewarding, and Professor Hall presents things in an accessible and patient manner (also his kids are really cute).",
    "Great teacher, just the pests are extremely difficult in comparison to the test",
    "Readings were very interesting and the main reason I took the course Don't feel super prepared for math 120 however which I tried last semester and had to drop - would have liked to improve my spatial understanding of problems\/graphical understanding",
    "This course could be improved by providing students with more secondary resources\/material outside of what is taught in class. I found it very difficult to learn and master the concepts after just seeing them used once in class, and then expected to replicate and apply them further on problem sets and exams.",
    "The class does a great job of showing proper real-life usages of certain calculus concepts. However, sometimes to make sure that these applications would be discussed, the actual calculus was taught a little too quickly.",
    "There was not a tremendous amount of guidance. The course does not have a textbook, so the class notes were the only source of reference information outside of Professor Hall and the peer tutor. I also did not find the peer tutor incredibly helpful. The course also moves very quickly. The class was also very challenging because of the pace and lack of outside study material. The most helpful part of the class was Professor Hall's flexibility with his office hours, and the the tutor I was offered for the second half of the semester.",
    "Interesting material, great organized professor, material can seem obscure at times, psets tend to be too long, grading is fair",
    "This class moved very fast and covered a lot of material quickly. I think it was easier than Math 115, but a lot of the material was not familiar to me. There were also more readings than I would have liked, and more emphasis on the readings than on the material covered in class."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely, especially if you love math and biology and want to see how they relate.",
    "This was an excellent class that really teaches you how to apply math and in doing so gives you new insights into the ideas you are exploring in calculus. Take the class if you're interested in looking at topics in biology and even society as they can be understood by models, and if you're comfortable spending time on your own to really digest the material. Professor Hall is amazing, but he does move very quickly and so you will have to spend time on your own to really understand the topics you cover.",
    "Do not take this class unless you REALLY like specific, math-biology classes. I am premed and took this because I heard it would be better than just a normal math class, but this course was very difficult! As someone who took calculus in HS and actually placed into Math 120, I thought this would be a breeze. However, the course focuses on very specific, niche topics that I do not find applicable in any other context (like nullclines, taylor polynomials, etc). Problem sets and exams were also SO DIFFICULT that I struggled immensely all semester. We also had to read articles that were beyond our capabilities of understanding as students, which really just made me resent the subject entirely.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is an extremely challenging course (vastly harder than MATH 115 in my opinion), but it is definitely worth it for anyone interested in science. I am not pre-med and was worried this class would only serve pre-meds, but the class is a great fit for anyone in the sciences, not just biology or pre-med. You have to work hard to do well in this class, but John Hall will ensure that everyone succeeds.",
    "I would be cautious about recommending this course to another student. You should be aware that taking this course over 115 has benefits and pitfalls. Benefits: John Hall is a great professor, the class is at least 100x more interesting than 115, the biology papers you read are super cool and relevant (brain tumor growth, genetic toggle switches, pacemakers, etc), and you learn a lot of unique things that won't be covered in other math courses. Pitfalls: this course is at least 100x more difficult than 115. You cover all of calc 2, some calc 3, and almost all of linear algebra. The pace is ridiculously fast and it is often hard to keep on top of it. The pests are ridiculously hard, taking 8+ hours a piece and oftentimes not even learning a majority of the material covered on them until 48 hours before the due date. The paper can be frustrating to read at first, and the midterms are some of the hardest I've taken at Yale. If you're series about biology\/quantitative biology and feel extremely confident in your math abilities and like a challenge, I would say go for it. If you're just looking to complete your premed requirement take 115.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. As someone who hasn't had a historically great relationship with math, I found the subject matter of the course very interesting and Professor Hall made sure the lectures were easy to follow and was always available to answer any questions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student that's interested in biology and needs a math credit because Professor Hall is honestly amazing. However, if the student usually struggles with math, I would say to make sure to go into help often because it's really easy to fall behind since the class is so fast paced and you go from integrals to intro to linear algebra within a day. If you've taken a Calc BC equivalent the class shouldn't be too bad, but for those with less experience might have a harder time but Professor Hall makes it really nice for everyone and there isn't a lot of material that requires a lot of previous calculus background. Overall, amazing course and I would really recommend it because Professor Hall is amazing!",
    "Absolutely. One of the most fair well run classes I've taken at yale",
    "Yes I really enjoyed the material and the Professor is so dedicated and accessible. I recommend as a great alternative to math 115 if you're interested in the material",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, unless they feel like they have already mastered a good amount of calculus and feel ready and willing to use it in more complicated scenarios.",
    "I would recommend this class for students who already have a strong calculus background but are not quite ready to take a higher level course.",
    "Personally, I don't think Math 116 was the best choice for me. I struggle a great deal with math, and I needed a class with a textbook for reference. For a student who is very comfortable with calculus entering the course, it might be a better fit.",
    "This class is very interesting, but the assignments and tests are hard. John Hall is very organized and prepared however, but the material can be obscure."
