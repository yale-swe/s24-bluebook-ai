    "I would definitely recommend this to every student. It poses fundamental questions to ones existence, and is a great class to help get a better understanding of the human condition. Readings are occasionally tough, but very worthwhile.",
    "i would definitely recommend this to anyone who is willing to put in the effort and do all the readings. If you don't do the readings, you will not get anything out of the class. it's a small seminar and relies on class participation in a PRODUCTIVE (not showing off irrelevant knowledge) way",
    "A very good course for people interested in an overview of anthropological theory. I believe it is an essential class for any independent-minded student.",
    "Yes! This class should be required for anthropology majors. A background in anthropological theory with an excellent professor and a manageable work load"
