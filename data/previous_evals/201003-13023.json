    "Yes, it is a great course with the right instructor and definitely improves your conversational French.",
    "Lots of busy work, but it is necessary and you will get a lot better at speaking, reading, and writing french without a doubt. The tests are all manageable and of the exact same format so you always know what to expect (and they drop your lowest one) but the readings were all extremely dark and depressing.",
    "If you have a choice at all, don't take it with Koundi. In terms of teaching the concepts that you end up being tested on, she's terrible. Otherwise, make sure you keep up with the work and you'll be fine, but if you get behind, it's hell catching up.",
    "No if you don't like languages?",
    "If you're looking to improve your French ability, absolutely take this class.",
    "Take 140 with Madame Koundi. She's very nice, and the least intimidating of the French teachers.You read a lot of depressing stories, but the reading is generally enjoyable. There's a little less work than there is in L3. Five tests, five essays (the longest is 500 words), and a presentation.",
    "Yes, it really helps improve your speaking and reading abilities."
