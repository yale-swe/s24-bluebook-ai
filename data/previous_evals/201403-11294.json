    "This topic was about the history of composition and historical issues associated with the first and second Isaiah. I definitely recommend the course, as this particular book is one of the most influential books in the entire HB corpus.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to another student. I would describe it as a seminar wherein you can expect to read a book dealing the collection of the book of Isaiah and do some translation outside and inside the classroom. In class, the text will be translated, dealt with in terms of form and unity, its purpose and dating will be considered, etc. It is a great way to become familiar with the issues in the book as a whole as well as a way to consider smaller issues within it."
