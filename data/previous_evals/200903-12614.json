    "This course is really interesting, not that tough, just do the readings and make sure to do the reading responses, but that's not hard - they are fun. You will enjoy getting to know the other people int he seminar and seeing how the reading applies to masculinity in the real world.",
    "super fun. we engaged with all types of contemporary representations of masculinity, everything from slam poetry to rupaul to country music. prof reid is really really sweet and there is not too much work at all. not too hard.",
    "I'd recommend this class to anyone willing to question their own beliefs on masculinity and wishing to find some sort of common thread across masculinities from different time periods and cultures.",
    "This has been the best course I have taken in my 7 semesters so far at Yale. The workload is soooo manageable, and Professor Reid is very flexible. Honestly, you'll learn so much about yourself, others, and your perceptions of the world and the society in which we live--assumptions we make about one another that we don't realize we're making. And I never knew how much sexual and gender identity figures themselves into our everyday lives. Nowadays, if it's not science or math or something, we tend to dismiss it under the rug as unimportant liberal arts. But it's classes like these that can help to improve our understanding of one another. You will not regret taking this class. Trust me. I have never felt so strongly about a class before. Best. Class. Ever.",
    "Amazing class for both WGSS and anthropology students. The readings and discussions are consistently interesting."
