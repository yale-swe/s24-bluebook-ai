    "I enjoyed the rise in difficulty and eventual sense of peer critique from the professors during the second semester",
    "This class was tremendously helpful. I learned about the functionality of a space, spatial relationships in a design and about the director and the designers collaboration. Overall it was a good experience. I don't find the portrait gallery assignment valuable at all. It is not modeling real life situation and it's deceiving: a picture doesn't necessarily convey the inner essence of a person and ultimately you find yourself looking for stereotypes for every role, because this is what the assignment is asking you to do. One of the most valuable assignments throughout the year was the director and designer collaboration weeks. I firmly believe, that there could be at least another opportunity for this throughout the year. It is much more engaging for everyone when there is a common goal we can accomplish. I think visionary design could be encouraged and taught more in the class. Scenic design is not just rendering a certain architecture a certain physical space, but it's an idea.",
    "I love this course. It's such a complete thrill and honor to be in a room with Ming and Michael, AND to see the work of the first year set designers. I know I'm speaking from a bit of a place of privilege -- the second year director's don't slave over models and designs every week like the designers do, and in the second semester we're mostly there to observe and participate with our feedback, not by actually presenting projects -- BUT from that place I just want to say that I will forever value my experience in this class. I've learned so much about talking to designers -- especially designers that may not have strong dramaturgical backgrounds -- and I've been consistently blown away by the creativity of my classmates and the deep, deep knowledge of my teachers. Perhaps the only improvement I'd suggest has to do with Ming's insistence (which there are lots of good reasons for) that designers work within a certain form on certain projects BEFORE branching out from that. An example: The first critique for Guys and Dolls was a bit of a nightmare, because everyone was grappling with their first huge musical and no one really understood the classic requirements of that set. Ming wanted to see eight different versions of the Jo Mielziner set, and no one brought that in. He wanted the designers to experience putting that successful space together with their own hands -- so they could understand WHY it WORKED -- before they went a different direction. That's a totally valid form of pedagogy, and it definitely could have been made clearer to the designers beforehand, so that the first critique wasn't wasted. Ming could sometimes make it clearer that he seriously wants the designers to do THIS ONE THING in Round 1, so that Round 2 can be used for creative differences and new ideas.",
    "This class was a transformative experience for me, and I am so grateful for the opportunity to learn from Ming Cho Lee and Michael Yeargan. I will never look at a set model without thinking about what Ming might say about that model, and even if I disagree, it will always make my vision stronger."
