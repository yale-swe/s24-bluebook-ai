    "I already knew variational method and perturbation theory. So pretty much just learned scattering and 2nd quantization formalism.",
    "I developed a much better understanding of quantum mechanics in this course, particularly perturbation theory, time evolution, and scattering.",
    "Better understanding of scattering and time dependent perturbation theory.",
    "Great course! I learned a lot about the essentials of quantum mechanics that are used in research!",
    "Good understand of various approximation methods, starting with variational methods all the way to time-dependent perturbation theory! Overall, an awesome class, BUT mostly due to Prof. Harris's brilliant teaching skills.",
    "Good understand of various approximation methods, starting with variational methods all the way to time-dependent perturbation theory! Overall, an awesome class, BUT mostly due to Prof. Harris's brilliant teaching skills.",
    "I learned about the applications in QM, and developed more analytical skills like perturbative expansions.",
    "A two-fold approach to approaching problems and an intuitive understanding of generalized wave phenomena :) Also lots of great quantum mechanics.",
    "Variational method, perturbation theory, fermi's golden rule, multi-particle states, scattering, second quantization",
    "Methods of perturbation theory, scattering and second quantization.",
    "Time dependent quantum mechanics",
    "Approximation methods, Scattering, 2nd quantization",
    "Taking Quantum Mechanics II from Prof. Harris has gained me new perspectives on quantum mechanics and techniques to apply to a wider set of problems. In particular, learning about approximation methods in quantum mechanics also taught me new ways to think of the mechanism of quantum mechanics.",
    "Wave physics, specifically applied to quantum physics.",
    "Knowledge about some quantum scattering theories"

   "comments": [
    "I think it should be removed from the required first-year courses and be offered for quantum-oriented students. Not particularly useful\/necessary for some of us. It's ridiculous how much time that we spend on quantum and then how rapidly we have to fly through EM. Sakurai and Napolitano is like a third of the size of Zangwill and yet we spend 1 term on EM and 2 on QM.",
    "Strengths: The lectures were taught very well, and the homework and exams were well-aligned with each other and with the focal points of the class. Overall, this was the most well-structured and best-taught class I have had in grad school so far. Weaknesses: Every so often, we spent a lot longer on algebra than it seemed like we really needed to. I wish we could have learned more about second quantization. Some homework problems were also very algebra-heavy for seemingly no reason.",
    "Lectures were very good, but sometimes got lost in problems that were interesting, but difficult to generalize. I was somewhat disappointed that we didn't do corrections to the hydrogen atom (such as fine and hyperfine structure), but recognize that that was probably due to the hydrogen atom not being taught in the previous semester. Also, scattering was not covered in class in the depth needed to do the homework problems.",
    "If this class will be taught by Prof. Harris again in the future then there is nothing to change. It was a perfect mix of theoretical background, doing calculations and understanding the physical motivation.",
    "If this class will be taught by Prof. Harris again in the future then there is nothing to change. It was a perfect mix of theoretical background, doing calculations and understanding the physical motivation.",
    "The course was awesome, almost everything about it is a strength! But maybe it could be improved by having the same instructor teach both QM1 and QM2 so there is no overlap time and we can pick up where we left off better.",
    "The grading policy when it came to homework was counterproductive. With a 50% penalty on late homework, the policy encourages students to turn in incomplete assignments for the sake of turning them in on time instead of taking a few extra days to finish. It discourages us from completing the homework, which negatively impacts learning from the assignments.",
    "The course is overall satisfying. However more stress on second quantization will be good. Also, some algebraic details need to be thought twice before teaching.",
    "It's a great course. Great lectures and reasonable homework\/exams.",
    "This course was awesome! Jack Harris did a great job explaining concepts",
    "I think it's excellent that you take time to explain \"why\" we do things the way we do; e.g. when you explained 2nd quantization for the first time.",
    "The course is very well structured with a clear narrative of how each part of the course connects to a broader understanding and set of skills that the course aims to gain the students. There were both questions that followed from the material taught in the lecture and questions that required students to learn from external sources in the problem sets. This also made solving the problem sets a good learning experience.",
    "I loved this class. I particularly appreciated the very intuitive, graphical explanations given for many of the topics.",
    "The flow is good but the course doesnt cover enough materials"

    "The way Jack teaches QM II is very great. If you need to learn this stuff, I can't think of a better way. Jack is hands down the best instructor I've had at Yale so far and even though I don't work in a quantum sub-discipline of physics, it has been one of my favorites because it is executed so well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course (not that it matters, because we are forced to take it regardless). The course was very well-taught, and did not make a lot of assumptions about what we had seen before, which was really helpful.",
    "Yes. Well taught course that covers subjects clearly without presupposing comprehensive knowledge of quantum mechanics.",
    "Well, it is compulsory for grad students anyway.",
    "Yes, absolutely. For anyone who took an intro QM class before, either in undergrad or QM I, this will be a very interesting continuation into more interesting topics that will lead to the theoretical framework that people have developed for the Standard Model.",

    "Yes, the teacher was good.",
    "Yes! ESPECIALLY if jack Harris is teaching.",
    "This is a required course, but yes, I would. The material is great and it is taught well.",
    "Yes, especially after the semester someone finished QM1.",
    "Yes. Prof Jack Harris is the best.",
    "Yes, if you get the chance to take a class with Jack Harris, do it!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning new methods in quantum mechanics and also developing physical intuition for each method. The course also serves as an introduction to Quantum Field Theory with the subject of second quantization and its discussion of many body wave functions.",
    "Yes. Really enjoyed the topics taught in this class.",
    "Core course."
