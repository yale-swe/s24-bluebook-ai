    "I learned basic lab skills and techniques, including PCR, miniprep, cell transformation, etc.",
    "This lab class has allowed me to truly understand the lab techniques I've used in research labs in the past. I also got to learn a lot more about RNAi and how to manipulate RNA in different ways using PCR.",
    "I learned many techniques using nucleic acids such as RNA extraction, MiniPrep, Cloning, and gel analysis."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor Nelson is an amazing professor who cares about his students. He dedicates so much of his time to repeat the experiments if they fail and he makes sure that you understand all the steps of the experiment. The fact that you do an actual research project for an MCDB lab is also more interesting than just repeating the same experiments that have been done by thousands of other undergrads. Weaknesses: You don't actually get to do much benchwork, so people who have never worked in a laboratory before may not gain as much from this course.",
    "Strengths: The class is designed so that you come in to learn and finish everything while in lab. The workload was low, the TAs were helpful, and Professor Nelson is really nice and redid a lot of our failed experiments on his own time. Weaknesses: It is easy to just follow the protocol without fully understanding the reason for each step, so you have to pay attention to the mini-lectures interspersed throughout the lab period. Also, we have to write a final lab report that summarizes everything you did throughout the course, so you have to keep up with that as well.",
    "This course is so much fun! Dr. Nelson is an incredible professor who does SO MUCH for his students, making the course super approachable and enjoyable. You spend a lot of time with the folks in lab, and making every Tuesday and Thursday collaborative and engaging makes the hours go by so much faster than you'd expect. I wouldn't change a thing about this course.",
    "Dr. Nelson does a great job to make sure everyone stays on track even though science doesn't always allow for that. He is a great instructor and explains everything thoroughly!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes. I think this class is a good lab course for MCDB and is stress-free most of the time on the week-to-week basis. I also think this was really good for anyone who wants to get some foundational lab skills in genetics.",
    "Yes! This is a fantastic biology lab. You actually get to contribute to some Yale research lab, you learn a lot, and Dr. Nelson is a fantastic human being who gives a lot of his time and energy to teaching.",
    "This is a great class to learn how to work with nucleic acids in a laboratory setting. You actually work with a real project that is going on in a lab, so the experience is a small sliver of what you could expect in a lab working with these techniques."
