   "comments": [
    "Phonology is a great foundation for linguistic; it covers all the basic theories of the field. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This is a great class! It moves at the perfect pace and focuses on really making sure you learn the material. The workload is relatively light, but you cover so much ground in class that you still feel like you've accomplished a lot. Definitely a class to take if you're interested in higher-level linguistics.",
    "It's a class about the sound systems of the world's languages. This covers everything from syllable structure to stress to tone, and so on. Not a bad class; Darya is very nice and willing to answer questions. There were just problem sets, reading responses and a final, and much of it was enough like solving puzzles to be interesting.",
    "Don't take it unless you're a linguistics major. I was the only non-linguistics major in the class and it felt like it.",
    "If you're thinking about taking this class, you're probably a linguistics major. If that's the case, then you have to take it. So what I would tell you is, don't fear! You do cover a lot of material, but you will never feel stressed about the class. Dasha is also extremely approachable and knowledgable - one of the best professors at Yale.",
    "This class was pretty interesting, but the other students were really frustrating sometimes. Taking it with Kavitskaya is a good idea, and you'll learn a lot.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone - linguistics majors or not. For linguistics majors, this is a great way of viewing linguistics as a data-based, analytical study with clear-cut principles and ideas.For non-linguistics majors, this is a great introduction to phonology and a wonderful time! The class is not work-intensives, but you learn a great deal."
