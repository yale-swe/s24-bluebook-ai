    "I developed a greater knowledge of Spanish grammar. I've also become more proficient in speaking, writing, and reading in Spanish.",
    "Learned how to discuss advanced academic topics in Spanish. The class helped me speak more fluidly and with more confidence when conversing with others in Spanish.",
    "Heritage Spanish I is perhaps the best language class I've had the honor of taking. 132 emphasizes using the existing strengths of heritage learners and building upon them. We focused on grammatical lessons like verb tenses, in addition to spelling. Also instead of focusing on rote memorization like many other classes in the department, we looked at issues related to New Haven and our heritage countries.",
    "Speaking, grammar, vocabulary, listening, reading comprehension",
    "I became much more fluent in Spanish. Throughout the semester I knew vocabulary, writing skills, speaking skills, and reading skills were all improving.",
    "I gained a variety of skills throughout the course. I learned how to correct many linguistic mistakes I have been making for years.",
    "I really become more confident in my ability to speak, write, and read Spanish."

    "I love the way the class is structured with grammar topics that are important and given the appropriate amount of time (depending on how comfortable everyone already is with the topic) with interesting projects and movies sprinkled in every now and then.",
    "Overall great class, could be improved by spending more time using grammar lessons in practice instead of focusing on worksheets.",
    "The course focused on learning\/ practicing Spanish via discussion rather than memorization. It could be improved by encouraging more conversational participation.",
    "I would have liked to have more grammar assignments",
    "The strengths include the level of engagement from the material and from the professor. Also, because this class tends to be small you become really close to the rest of the class and the professor.",
    "Strengths: the professor; the seminar style class was quite nice; the worksheets and exercises were not exceedingly difficult. Weaknesses: I cannot particularly think of anything.",
    "The course had diverse assignments which really exposed the student to different aspects of the language, helping them to appreciate and effectively learn Spanish."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their Spanish and already is very comfortable with the language. I was exposed to a lot more cultural elements than I thought I would so anyone who comes from a Spanish-speaking household and who needs to review the basics should absolutely take this class.",
    "To anyone looking to fill in the gaps of their Spanish speaking skills and learn more about latin culture, I would strongly recommend taking this class.",
    "Yes! Take with Sybil! This will be such a meaningful experience. You really form bonds and relationships with your peers in ways you wouldn't expect from a normal Spanish class.",
    "Yes! Its a great and unique way to learn spanish for students that grew up with some knowledge of the language. Moreover the professor is really great",
    "Yes, especially if you're looking to improve your Spanish skills. It is worth the time.",
    "I would, because its great what more do you want fam.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for heritage speaker who really want to engage with the Spanish language in a way that goes beyond a textbook and instead immerses them in the culture of various Latino countries through different medium likes news articles, field trips, movies, etc."
