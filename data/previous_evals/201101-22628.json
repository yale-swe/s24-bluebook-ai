    "Theme and professor vary by term, so I don't really know what to say for this. Spring 2011 was \"France and the Orient\" with Professor Sanjabi, who is very nice and very knowledgeable about the subject matter. We read a wide survey of orientalist (and counter-orientalist postcolonial) literature, as well as excerpts from Said's Orientalism. Reading was interesting, occasionally a lot, but if you manage your time well it shouldn't be a problem. Class is discussion based, and depending on the size of your class, be prepared to listen and participate \u0097 our class was only seven people, and if no-one was talking it got awkward really fast. Check on theme and professor, definitely, and if you're interested, I'd say go for it.",
    "This class was more than I was expecting in terms of work. It presupposes a lot of knowledge about philosophy and history. I think the difficulty of the course will depend on the people who are in it. Overall all though, the course was rewarding and I felt like I learned a lot about the subject of the course. However, I do not feel like my french improved. If you are looking to simply fulfill a language requirement, DONT take this course.",
    "this semesters focus was on the oriental influence on french literature over the years. we covered several centuries and discussed the differences with oriental representation from century to century."
