   "comments": [
    "This course really enriched my understanding of Jewish culture in Europe. Instead of a straight history course, reading through the different philosophers, authors, artists, etc. gave a more intimate understanding of the material. Class discussions were EXCELLENT, and Professor Sorkin has a gift for making students feel heard and covering what he wants to cover at the same time.",
    "A broad overview of the history of Jewish emancipation during the 18th and 19th centuries. However, what Professor Sorkin excels at is situating these movements in their respective intellectual movements.",
    "I greatly developed my writing and reading skills, as well as my knowledge of Jewish history in Europe."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths of this course include a carefully balanced syllabus, rigorous class discussions, detailed paper feedback, really interesting material. Professor Sorkin is very available to meet with students to discuss papers. Weaknesses- not many. I think there's no reason this class needs to be in a room so big, why not put it in a round-table seminar room to facilitate more discussion?",
    "Strengths: Professor Sorkin is one of the best teachers I've had at Yale. Each lecture was carefully thought out and engaging. The class was small, just five people, and he truly cared about our opinions and discussion. He provided wonderful feedback on writing and helped review all of our papers\/ Weaknesses: none, but do be aware the reading\/writing load can be a lot.",
    "Biggest strength of the course is definitely the revision period for papers. Professor Sorkin allows students to hand in a draft of their paper, comments on it, and then gives 3 weeks to revise the paper before handing it in for a grade. It really improved my writing and kept me on top of my work!",
    "This class has no weaknesses. Professor Sorkin is incredible. The readings are all really interesting and are full books instead of excerpts. The workload is totally manageable and every paper has a submitted rough draft and final draft. The classes are dynamic. There is a lot of student contribution to the conversation and direction of the discussion.",
    "This is one of the best courses I have taken. I learned a ton about Jewish history from class and reading, and Professor Sorkin provides feedback on each essay so that I was able to greatly improve my writing.",
    "I thought the material was quite engaging, and I particularly enjoyed the class discussions. Because of this, I think it would be an improve ment if the class was a seminar rather than a lecture."

   "comments": [
    "Any student interested in the development of strands of modern Jewish thought and culture should take this class. It was very well done, and I liked the academic angle of the syllabus. Different than other classes I've taken and so nicely balanced in many ways. Exactly 10 topics, split down 5 and 5, east and west, older and newer. Just so much food for thought. Really really great.",
    "Yes, I cannot recommend this course enough. Even if the exact topic area doesn't strike you as immediately interesting, give it a try.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Sorkin is one of the best teachers here and the course is very well organized, especially if you're interested in Jewish Intellectual history\/Jewish emancipation.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I left every class feeling like I had spent the whole time thinking. And writing the papers was really fun.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course. Professor Sorkin unbelievable, I learned an incredible amount, and the workload was certainly manageable.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who has not had exposure to the thinkers and artists listed on the syllabus. Professor Sorkin is a great teacher, and anyone could learn from him. It is a fair amount of writing, however, so students should be aware of that before enrolling. Also, there is a lot of reading each week and Professor Sorkin expects everyone to have read it thoroughly: if you skip, he'll know."
