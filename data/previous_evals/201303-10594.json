   "comments": [
    "A really good course that emphasizes speaking immediately (and speaking like conversationalists instead of speaking like you're at a formal event) - at the end of the semester you'll feel like you've learned a lot but you'll also know that there's much more, and you'll actually look forward to learning all of it.",
    "If you really want to learn french its good. I definitely wouldn't take it if you haven't already taken at least 4 years of another language because some of the concepts I learned in two years in Spanish in high school, we covered in 1-2 weeks. I would not have understood what was going on without that background.",
    "A great class. Classes will meet every single day and the workload will be huge (~1-2hrs of work every weekday night), classes will be conducted entirely in French from the very beginning and there will be weekly Monday tests but it's all worth it. Within weeks your hard work will pay off and after a semester those in-class French conversations will make you feel that you really can speak the language. The professors and fellow students are very supportive. I definitely recommend this class.",
    "If you are deciding whether or not to take L1 French or not, you definitely should do it - it's the best decision I have made. Once you've made that decision, definitely take it with Ngame - he is the best professor far and away. The class is very much the type of class where you get out what you put in, but to be honest, it stops feeling like serious work a couple weeks in. It's trulyunbelievable how much French you will learn in one semester, and the full-immersion method is frustrating at first, but in the end ends up being the greatest thing. I definitely recommend this class - especially with Ngame!",
    "I would definitely recommend French 110 as long as the student is committed to learning the language. If you are looking for an easy language class, French is not for you. However, if you are looking for a challenging course that will teach you a new language quickly and affectively, then I would recommend French. You must be willing to put in the work, but if you do there will definitely be results.",
    "Great French class. You will be amazed by how much progress you can make!",
    "Be ready to learn a lot of french in a short amount of time. Keep up.",
    "It's an awesome class! I love it! I ve learnt so much and improved so much over such a short time it's incredible. But the workload is very heavy so be prepared for that. And also be prepared for the possibility that you might not get an A no matter how hard you work because the grading is pretty strict and sometimes FRench is just hard.",
    "Everyone should take L1 with Professor Ngame! He was patient and understanding, which was great both for a beginning language class and for a class that tries to cover a lot of material. The French language is beautiful (and has a lot of similarities grammatically with Spanish, which was a huge help for me), just be prepared to work everyday.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student, especially someone that has never studied a language before. The immersion method is intimidating at first, but really gets you into learning and loving the language. It is really a course that gives you a lot as long as you give a lot to the course."
