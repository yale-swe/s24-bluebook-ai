   "comments": [
    "The course is very-information heavy, but worth taking. Professor Mooseker is extremely knowledgeable about cell biology and tries to make sure that his lectures are understandable.",
    "It is harder than BIOL 101, but it is do-able. Definitely make use of the peer tutor (Ariel, he is AMAZING), piazza, and your TA. Do not rely on the slides or Professor Mooseker to adequately explain everything.",
    "BIOL 102 is easier and harder than 101 in many regards. BIOL 102 is all about membrane and cytoskeleton-related stuff and different lab techniques like fluorescence, antibodies, and microscopy. Mark Mooseker was a great teacher, although was sometimes hard to follow and was very fast in explaining some concepts and rushed through his powerpoint slides at times. He's a smart man and likes teaching, he just isn't the greatest at communicating to students who have had very little exposure to biology, as he'll casually use terms that no freshman would understand. Regardless, I loved his class and the topics he taught were really interesting. Definitely sign up for enrichment and go to peer tutoring whenever you can, trust me, it'll be worth it and help you stay up to pace in the class.",
    "I would not recommend taking BIOL 102 with Mooseker to anyone, however, it is required for many majors, so they will have to take it anyway. The course basically consists of wordy, confusing lectures, then homework and tests that are arduous and have barely anything to do with the lectures.",
    "A possibly more rigorous first experience in cell biology than might be expected, but a class certainly worth taking for the chance to learn from a truly accomplished cell biologist and be challenged to more deeply master\/understand experimental techniques crucial to advances in cell biology in recent history.",
    "Take it if you have to, but do not do it for the distributional requirements. The material is dry, the lectures are painful, and the class size is ridiculous.",
    "It's not easy to understand it... a lot of effort has to be put into it.",
    "In class I felt like the some of material covered in lecture was well beyond the scope of what an introductory college course should have been.",
    "I did not like this bio sequence. Bio 101 was much better. I would suggest having another professor teach it and certainly take it with another ta.",
    "A lot of interesting material is learned in Biology 102, but it takes a while to get it all. I'd highly recommend always doing the reading for this class if you're going to take it. I'd only recommend this class to someone strongly interested in learning more about Biology, or someone who has to take the class. It's not a gut class, and it's not necessarily a \"fun\" elective. It will take some work and it will be hard at times, but you will come out knowing a lot more than you went in with.",
    "Take the course if you have to. I had Mooseker for 102 and Koleske for 101, Mooseker's class was significantly more difficult than Koleske's. Lectures are very hard to follow and slides aren't brilliant either. Psets are pretty awful though not killer. Even so, I would say while this could have been taught much better, it was at least very enlightening into scientific techniques. I learned less about cells than I did about how we know so much about cells, which put the scientific field into a new perspective. So I guess that's good. But still not what I would call enjoyable.",
    "If you can avoid taking this class, do. It was by far the most disorganized and painful class I have taken at Yale. Difficult to understand with hard grading on the tests, it is a huge leap from 102. If you can take it with a professor other than Mooseker, it might be better, but he certainly does not make it any easier.",
    "Its a difficult class, its not similar to Bio 101 they are two different leagues.",
    "A necessary evil that in the end is worthwhile. Take it with Mark Mooseker.",
    "BIOL 102, taught by Professor Mooseker, might be challenging at first because he assumes students already know basic biology and he instead dives straight into complex concepts even in the first lecture. Although that might take some getting used to, the class is genuinely helpful in teaching students not only cellular biology but also laboratory concepts, which is super useful.",
    "Very in-depth survey of how membranes (and the things they carry and the things that are stuck in them) move in the cell. Like how proteins are secreted and how the cytoskeleton works etc. Good for people interested in bio; not good for fun or for a science credit.",
    "BIOL 102 can be a difficult course if you don't do the reading along with it. You need to keep up with the material, and always read the lecture slides. At least try to read them after the lecture if you don't have time to read them before. Reading the lecture slides several times is actually very helpful. The class is big, but divides into discussion sections. The teaching assistants are wonderful, and will answer any questions you have. I would recommend this class to another students if they like biology, are pre-med, or are just exploring the sciences. BIOL 102 is kind of an introductory course that prepares you for upper level biology classes. If you just need a science credit, take this class. If you are pre-med, take this class. If are majoring in biology, you have to take this class. The biology modules are very informative and quite fun. As long as you put in the effort to learn, you will pass the class, most likely with an A or B. It is very hard to fail a biology module. Overall, definitely take this class.",
    "BIOL 102 is an interesting, but rigorous class. The teaching staff is passionate and the resources you need to do well are at your disposal, but they do have to be actively pursued. If you are serious about Biology, this is a great course.",
    "If Professor Mooseker is teaching it, I would avoid taking the course. Not because he is a mean teacher but because his expectations are as if we've already taken multiple cellular biology courses. I felt that he made the material far more difficult than it could and should have been for an introductory biology course.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who either a) has a solid biology background or b) is willing to put in the time and effort to master the material.",
    "Honestly, if you do not have to take Bio 102 with Moosker do not. I am a prospective biology major and he made me dislike the topic. I however am going to continue doing bio with the hope that this was just one obstacle. It was a very hard and stressful class and it is very difficult to get a good grade despite how effectively you study. The problem sets are hard and although the tests are reasonable they cover so much content it is hard to focus on what is important.",
    "Very helpful in growing in new ways.",
    "This was a solid course, not life-changing but not terrible either. Mooseker was a pretty fun lecturer at times, albeit rather disorganized. Psets were challenging but didn't take too long, and on the whole I'd say I'm quite happy with what I've learned in this class.",
    "It's not an easy course based on pure memorization. The way the tests are designed will force you to know the material well enough to apply it in novel situations.",
    "I personally took it because it was required. I would not recommend it for those merely interested in science because otherwise I feel it would be discouraging for further academic pursuit.",
    "Don't get scared away by the reviews of this class. It's actually not too bad, can be interesting at times, and was never as bad as some students made it out to be. You'll be fiiiiiiine.",
    "You probably have to take it, so just do so and be ready for a steep learning curve.",
    "This course is challenging in that it requires a lot of work outside of class--in terms of organizing the material, learning the terms used in class, and reading the papers for section. Make sure to be in a section that explains the papers coherently and helps to clear up confusion about topics presented in class.",
    "To effectively navigate Professor Mooseker's slew of course material, it's necessary to keep up with reading the course lecture slides, if not ideally before lecture, then definitely after. I would recommend taking the MCDB cell biology course instead of this one, but most students taking this course are probably doing so for premed\/major requirements.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a friend if it is not required for his or her major. The class requires a lot of outside work to succeed.",
    "Great bio course for intro students of all levels. Definitely a worthwhile challenge.",
    "BIOL 102 is an in depth look into certain aspects of cell biology. The course is challenging but if you keep up with reviewing the information each week and go to the peer tutors, it is completely manageable.",
    "I think if someone else was the lecturer then the class would be much more enjoyable and reasonable to keep up with. I would not recommend the class if Mr. Mooseker is the lecturer.",
    "Good class because it is taught in the way that scientific research is actually done; e.g. by the experimental data, and then the facts. Mooseker does a great job showing how facts can be extrapolated from data, and how 'facts' themselves are really more models and are being constantly updated or proved wrong.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It is extremely hard to follow and difficult.",
    "only take this class if you need to.",
    "Overall, a pretty good course. Material is not at all easy, so don't treat it like an intro-bio course. It also moves relatively quickly, so you'll have to keep up, but the resources that are available, whether it be Prof Mooseker staying after class for a few minutes, or the TFs, or the peer tutor, will help you incredibly. Lectures were a bit hard to understand at time due to high-level language, but with the resources above, it's very manageable and may make you realize just how much more awesome bio is than you thought it was.",
    "Really difficult. But interesting",
    "The material is interesting, but it is a disorganized class and it's not taught well.",
    "BIOL 102 material was interesting, but the way it was presented was very scattered.",
    "Boring, hard and terrible but a necessary evil for med school",
    "102 is very different from 101. It is an introduction to important components of the cell like the membrane, membrane proteins, and organelles that execute protein exportation. Be prepared to do learning outside of the classroom and find a study group! If you invest time into the class you will learn a lot from it.",
    "If you have a weak background in biology, this class will be really difficult. The lectures can be hard to grasp, so you likely won't understand them if you haven't done the readings beforehand. This class has a midterm instead of the five classes, so it's important to be accountable for yourself, making sure you are keeping up with the material. I would not take this class unless you need it for your major--the material is interesting but it is not presented in an interesting fashion.",
    "This class, although interesting, was made unnecessarily difficult. I would suggest trying to take this class with a different professor, who might be better at explaining the concepts at an undergraduate level.",
    "There is a world of difference between Bio 101 and Bio 102 in terms of difficulty, but if you like biology then you will love what you learn with Bio 102 as well. It is a good course for preparing you for real science study, but the key to enjoying it is to DO THE ASSIGNED READINGS BEFORE LECTURE and to get help early if you're not understanding things. Take it with Professor Mooseker--his love for the subject shows and he is always ready to answer questions--but realize that the class is less structured than 101 and so more discretion is needed in studying. Overall, I am happy I took the course and would definitely recommend it.",
    "This class isn't awful, and I wouldn't warn against it, however if you're looking for a science credit, I would recommend taking a different class that has a different focus. This class isn't overwhelmingly hard, but the things we learn can be very technical, which may make it more difficult for some people to stay interested. In all, I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to take higher level classes, but I would recommend other classes for people who want a fun science credit.",
    "intensive cell bio in great detail. Not for the weak of spirit",
    "Yes, but you should record the lectures.",
    "Very interesting course with some difficult material. Equips you with real-world understanding of experimental methods.",
    "It was a standard bio class, that I hope proves useful as I move through other course. If you don't have a solid Bio background, I would recommend this course. That being said, a lot of new material above AP Biology was presented, so the course could be useful to those students as well.",
    "This is definitely not the most fascinating biology class I have ever taken, but you do learn a great deal about cell biology and cell membranes. I did not have a great experience with Professor Mooseker, but Professor Gardner and the TF's are extremely helpful if you need help understanding the material. Overall, it is an introductory biology course, but as long as you dedicate enough time to the material and make sure to work with friends throughout the class, you will get a lot out of it.",
    "Bio 102 taught us how to think more so than 101 did. It was about learning to understand not only the biology but also how we attain that information. Through the toolkits and research papers, Mooseker really emphasizes different experiments and methods and helps you understand the significance of it all. I recommend 102 maybe not as a class to take just for the science credit but as it's a prereq, it's fine.",
    "I would recommend if if necessary. I do not think this course can pique interest in biological fields, but it is great for expanding a previous interest, or expanding one's mind in preparation for higher biology classes.",
    "If you've taken advanced bio before, this could be for you. Also, if you are willing to take the time to review out-of-class endlessly, go to extra help sessions, agonize over unclear material, and ask questions in front of a 100+ person lecture, then this could also be for you. Otherwise, it's a challenge. If this is your first bio course--you probably should stay far, far away.",
    "You learn awesome things about cells.",
    "I really disliked this course. The lectures were impossible to keep up with and Professor Mooseker didn't explain anything clearly, not did he respond to questions in a helpful or even nice matter. To be honest I don't think I've ever had such an unpleasant teacher",
    "Overall, Biology 102 is one of those courses that you should take if it is required and you can take it with someone other than Professor Mooseker. The material is very helpful if you want to do research in a lab, but if you are not premed, a biology major, and wanting to join a lab, there is no need to acquire the level of detail taught in this course.",
    "BIO 102 is an intro bio class. Its not shockingly difficult, but it is important to understand the experiments and papers presented. All around, a pretty decent intro class.",
    "I would summarize it as an in-depth look at the basic functions of certain organelles and structural components of the cell. I would recommend it for those who are premed and for those who want a challenging science credit.",
    "This is actually a really awesome Bio class where I learned a lot. Offers much for people of varying degrees of background in Bio. Mooseker is a really great guy with an awesome sense of humor. If you are struggling, go to his reviews!! He is much more accessible in the smaller sessions and is really great at answering questions. Don't be afraid to ask clarifying questions, even in lecture.",
    "Requires a lot of thinking and work.",
    "Bio 102 is horrible. The material is fascinating, but the professor is awful. I would recommend bio 102 only so you can learn the material, however the course needs massive improvement. I would take it so you can take more biology classes and pursue the MCDB major (like I plan to do).",
    "I'm not sure that I would recommend taking BIOL 102 with Professor Moosker. It was extremely hard to understand the concepts from his lectures, as he would move through things very quickly, explain concepts in a somewhat confusing manner, and assume that everyone in the class had relevant background knowledge that in reality very few did. BIOL 102 this semester made me like cell biology far less than I thought I would, largely because of the way the class was taught and the material was presented. I don't think there's any way I would have been able to understand the material from the class without attending enrichment with Dr. Gardner, discussion and review sessions with my TF, and peer tutoring sessions with the peer tutor Ariel. I really wish that I could have enjoyed and gotten more out of the class, because the material would have been incredibly interesting if taught better.",
    "The material is really interesting, especially if you have an interest in cellular biology. Professor Mooseker is very knowledgable and accessible. One weakness of the course is it often seems a little disorganized and Mooseker can often leap over difficult concepts in lecture without addressing them in depth. It's certainly not an easy course bu the material and workload if very managable",
    "If you enjoy reading research papers and envisioning biological systems, you will enjoy this class.",
    "Even though to be honest the I was overwhelmed by the class before the class even started, the way the class organized and the helpful instructors made the class less stressful. Prof. Mooseker was very willing to help students and the enrichment session organized by Dr. Gardner was very helpful. If you keep up the pace of the class, you will do fine.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about cellular structure and processes. The material was very interesting although difficult to grasp at first. The homework forces you to use knowledge of the material and critical thinking to reason through various situations. I learned an incredible amount and was challenged the perfect amount. I also enjoyed reading the scientific papers--it will help me in my future.",
    "Bio 102 is a hard class but it is absolutely worth your time. A lot of people don't like the class because Mooseker can be difficult to understand. He uses a lot of jargon and moves quickly through the slides. This is truebut that's also the best way to learn. No one learns very well from crappy worksheets and vocab sheets; it's much better to be immersed, and that's what Mooseker gives you. Also, Mooseker is a great guy and only wants the best for all his students. You'll have to work hard but I promise, you will feel like a real scientist after taking this class. TAKE THIS CLASS!!",
    "BIOL 102 is a good course in cell biology and membrane physiology for someone looking to gain a solid foundation in these subjects. Since the course is taught at a more in depth level than an introductory class,I would recommend it for someone who wants a rigorous introduction to cell biology and membrane physiology.",
    "I would not recommend it unless you are sure you want to pursue microbiology. Not a good introductory course.",
    "I took Bio 102 as a student excited to enter the field of research and biology. These introductory modules have greatly discouraged me, not because the material is any less exciting, but rather because the professors and the structure of the course is so poorly chosen that I do not think it is worth continuing this series and putting myself through the same thing again. I would walk into class and leave extremely confused every time, not knowing what I had just learned that past hour and a half. I also knew I wasn't the only student that felt this way. Lecture was such a waste of my time because all I'd end up doing was going home and teaching myself everything using the textbook and seeking out help with peer tutors and staring at slides for hours until I understood them. I went into Yale with high expectations of the teaching quality and have walked out my first year extremely disappointed. I understand that there are courses like this to \"weed out\" certain students that are not up for the challenge. However, this course would never encourage someone not in the sciences to understand how amazing biology can be because it is so poorly taught.",
    "The foundations series is pretty good; not always that engaging, but important to moving on in the biosciences. Professor Mooseker is a great guy; he really cares about his students and takes suggestions to heart. Definitely sign up to have lunch with him, or ask him to another meal if you can't make it after class. The class is not always interesting, but try to go to lecture because it is valuable.",
    "This class is solid. The focus on methodology is annoying at first but something you will appreciate at the end of the module.",
    "I actually quite enjoyed Bio 102. You learn a great deal in a very short amount of time. By the end of the class you can read and understand professional scientific papers, have mastery over basic cell bio lab techniques, and know about a lot of the more elegant mechanisms of your cells (you actually understand what's going on too, vs being told \"memorize this we'll explain it when you are older\"). Mooseker is very passionate about the material and it shows. He has a great sense of humor. I was never bored during lecture. That said, this is a hard class that is rather specific to cells (I think it would be better suited as an upper level class rather than an intro class). However, you have a great support system (Piazza, armies of TAs, enrichment) which really help. The first two weeks especially are intimidating and confusing, but it really improves from there as you start to gain your footing. Overall, I highly recommend the class.",
    "I would summarize it as a fast-paced class that requires constant attention or else you will fall behind. It requires deep understanding of topics and the ability to be able to apply them to different situations. I would recommend it only if you're interested in going into a biology major or for premed. If you're not really interested in biology then this class may be too much or a drag for you.",
    "The material taught in BIOL 102 is truly very interesting, even for someone like me not planning to major in the sciences. However, Mooseker is not a good lecturer because he moves too fast. I would highly recommend YouTubing videos on lecture topics or even reading the book before lecture. The workload is pretty heavy and class can be a bit intimidating with all the pre-med kids. I really loved bio though!"
