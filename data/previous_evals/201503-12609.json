    "Good overview of Buddhism in China and Japan. Take if you're interested in a largely historical overview, but also addressing some aspects of modern Japanese Buddhism.",
    "Learn a lot about Buddhism and how it has moved and changed throughout Asia.",
    "I would recommend RLST 134. It was a great course, with an engaging and manageable workload.",
    "Bottom line: do not take this class unless you are VERY interested in the subject matter. It seemed geared towards a graduate level, with past experience in Buddhist studies. Was not an introductory class at all, and Professor Greene had very unrealistic expectations. This class had perhaps the most intense workload of any class like it I've taken at Yale. Really don't recommend this class unless you are fully committed to the subject matter!!"
