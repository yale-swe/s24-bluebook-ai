    "This is a class you should take if you are seriously invested in art (not necessarily sculpture) - if not, you are probably wasting everyone's time.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, but it has a very loose structure. I'm guessing it changes a lot depending on who is in the class and what they're interests are. I would only recommend it to someone who wants a place to present some work and look at the work of other grads and undergrads (it was five undergrads and seven grads). if you enjoy nothaving much direction, then this is a great class for you. if you want more structure, i would not recommend it.",
    "Shop it. You'll know from the first class how it'll be. If there are a ton of grad students, beware: they're very obnoxious.",
    "Excellent course the instructor provide us good source to information. And the critics for each project always was with the purpose to brings helpful comments about the students works.",
    "yes i would."
