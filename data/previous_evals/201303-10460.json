   "comments": [
    "The lecture is incredibly interesting, probably because the content itself (19th century french art) is very important.Unfortunately, everything else was pretty terrible. Professor Armstrong is incredibly disorganised and won't figure things out until last minute (for example, all of us had to shuffle our schedules around the THIRD week of classes and couldn't figure out a time to meet during section), a lot of things like grading and deadlines are unclear, etc.Also, my TF is super nice butshe knows nothing about Art History. When we were studying Degas' paintings in the gallery, one of her comments was about the SIGNATURE of the painting and wondering aloud if it was a fraud. This is not her fault, she is an Italian Film PhD candidate and it is the Art History Department's shortcoming that we could not find qualified TFs and had to scramble last minute. It is unfair to those in this section because we're not having the same kind of in-depth section. That said, Maria again is really really nice and she always gets the grading done ahead of time.The exams are a lot of work, and the final exam is a lot harder than the midterm. It has over 3x the material, and it seems that in the final the Professor was just trying to find some very obscure pieces that we didn't really talk about (e.g. The Republic by Daumier) to test us, which is just mean. In addition, none of us know how grading or curving works so this is an added element of stress.But take the course if you're interested in the subject! That's why I hung in there, because this stuff is invaluable!",
    "The class moves very quickly and you don't really get to look in depth at a lot of the paintings that it covers. There's just way too much material. Also Professor Armstrong is a little distracting to listen to in lectures.",
    "This is an AMAZING class to take Cr\/D\/F. There's a lot of reading and memorization necessary to do well, but very little work necessary to do okay. I went to every single lecture because they were an amazing escape to such a romantic history, and the art is absolutely amazing. Prof Armstrong is great, and being able to simply enjoy the class without worrying about grades made this a highlight of my semester. (Didn't do the readings, didn't spend time memorizing paintings, skipped a few sections, but went to all the lectures and felt like I got a lot out of it.)In terms of this particular class, Professor Armstrong emphasizes the connections and influences for major works, creating a very integrated course. The class is very well done, please take it!",
    "This is a really great course! If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in anyone from the Neoclassicists to the Romantics, to the Impressionists, and beyond, you should definitely consider taking this. This class gave me a much better understanding of a period of art that I have always been interested in. I always looked forward to going to class and just listening to Professor Armstrong and studying awesome art. The one thing that sucks is memorizing all those paintings. Like horrible terrible. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing more than standard for an art history course, so you know what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting yourself into. Also the two papers weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad at all\u00e2\u0080\u00a6kind of fun to write in my opinion! You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really go wrong with this class.",
    "I recommend this class if you are at all interested in this time period in French art. We covered amazing pieces by David, Monet, Van Gogh, etc., and it was fascinating to analyze these paintings and to learn more about them. Section for this class was really helpful, and we took a couple of trips to the Yale art gallery, which was very cool. The readingscan get kind of dense, but as long as you know the gist of them you will be fine. One warning-- there is a lot of memorization required for the midterm and especially the final; be sure to start studying artists\/works\/dates well in advance. This was my first art history class and it was very accessible and interesting-- definitely take it!",
    "I mean, the art is incredible and Prof Armstrong is brilliant. If you can get over her saying \"um\" every three words, she has a lot of smart stuff to say. The class covers a TON of stuff which makes studying for exams REALLY HARD.",
    "Take this class if you're at all interested in the subject. The material presented is incredibly interesting. You might want to take it as a Cr\/D\/F if you're not good at memorization.",
    "The lectures were always really interesting, and if you have any interest in learning about the general progression of Western art, this is one of the very most important times and places to study. Take it!",
    "I highly recommend this course whether or not you are majoring in art history. As a non-major the class taught me to think critically about painting and well as giving me different lens through which to learn about French history. Whether you have a strong interest in French history and painting or simply want to be able to be a more educated museum visitor, this class will give you the tools with which to think critically about some of the most amazing art of the 19th century.",
    "Absolutely take this class! This is probably the only class I can say that I have enjoyed every single lecture of and do not check the time. This was my first art history class, and you really cannot beat the subject matter. Not that much work, take it!"
