    "This class requires too much of its students in general. The course requires meeting with working group every week, preparing a debate response to turn in after the meeting, readings, attendance at lecture twice a week, and a final paper of 16-pages. On top of that, there are two exams in which they hand out 30 essay questions, and you have a minimal amount of time to prepare the essay questions before the exam. You're basically forced to cram. Each essay takes about 30-minutes of prep, so you basically have to dedicate an entire weekend to studying for this course. The final actually requires memorization of the first 30 from the midterm IN ADDITION to the second 30 for the final. They then choose 7 for you to answer in class. Although this course was interesting, the time that this course requires makes it very difficult to manage.",
    "This course is interesting in that it teaches about how an individual grows and develops based on environmental and genetic factors. I enjoyed lectures (which was really just the textbook since the professor wrote the textbook. I suggest going to lecture) and the material itself. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the topic.",
    "A pretty good class. The material is interesting and definitely widely applicable--I find myself citing it all the time, even when not in other Psych classes. The working groups that this class has for section are really great, and Professor Keil tries hard to make class as educational as possible, so he's good at taking feedback. Overall a solid course.",
    "Definitely. At points the class is hard work, but if you put in the effort, there is no doubt that your grade will reflect it.",
    "This was a really interesting topic that I think is essential for any psychology major. However, the structure of the course was not great. First, lectures exactly matched the textbook (which the professor wrote), down to the anecdotes. Second, I would say the exam format makes the class not worth it (which is unfortunate because I think this subject is very important). The midterm is a list of 30 essay questions, 5 of which will be asked on the midterm. The final is 30 more questions, plus the 30 from the midterm (a total of 60), out of which 7 will be asked. These are essay questions, which require rigorous preparation (you get the questions a few days before the exam). For the midterm, you have a single weekend to prepare (for us, it was President Salovey's inauguration weekend, and since there is no other way to prepare for the essays beside outlining each one, which Professor Keil told us to do, there was no way to enjoy this once in a lifetime event). Strongly consider the exam format before you take this class.",
    "This is a great psychology class. Definitely take this class if you are a psych major! You get to learn about a lot of really cool studies, and the TA's are awesome! The class really isn't that hard. Just be sure to prepare all of the questions for the midterm and final exam and you will be fine!",
    "This course is an incredible amount of work, but it is worth it. You will come out with a new appreciation for developmental psychology and children in general. Take it, even if you're not a psych major.",
    "Of course! Everyone should take it.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you're really interested in the topic. Even then, however, you have to make sure you're ok with the format of the class. For the midterm and final the professor gives you a list of essay questions (28 for midterm and then an additional 29 or 30 for the final) that you basically have to memorize answers to, and then he picks some for the test. It just amounts to a lot of last minute stressful cramming and trying to memorize things, which made me dislike the class. Other than that, lectures are fine, but sometimes felt a little unclear\/disorganized, and the textbook was fairly interesting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class both if you're interested in the specifics of child development or whether you just have a general interest in learning about how we come to understand anything at all. It's a great class to give you that kind of perspective, and the workload is manageable.Using Prof. Keil's own textbook makes the readings and lectures really work well together, and the midterm is straightforward. The working groups are great for keeping you on top of your work, both the weekly responses and the end of term paper.",
    "It's great, you learn about kids and no weekly homework (almost)",
    "Yes! Great course with a fair amount of work but worth it for the lectures and clips of cute babies\/animals.",
    "Definitely. There's a lot of reading and Professor Keil provides so many questions in advance of the tests that it sometimes feels impossible to get through, but the knowledge amassed by the end of the course is unmatched.",
    "I highly recommend this class, provided you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re genuinely interested in the material and willing to put in a good amount of work to learn it. The regular workload isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that rough, although more than other PSYC classes I had taken \u00e2\u0080\u0093 weekly assignments consist of either short debate responses or outlines for the final paper. However the class is suddenly a lot of work right before the midterm and the final, as Professor Keil gives a list of 30 or so potential essay questions that could be on the exam, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re responsible for preparing all of them. So before taking this class, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend looking at the syllabus to make sure you can free up the weekend before the midterm \u00e2\u0080\u0093 otherwise you could have a very frustrating experience. That being said,this way of doing things, while a lot of work, really ensures you learn the material. And the material \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially as presented in Professor Keil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lectures \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is fascinating, valuable not only for understanding infant and child development, but for understanding adult psychology as well. Thus while not a gut class by any means, I definitely think this class is worth it."
