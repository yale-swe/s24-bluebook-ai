    "If you liked discrete math, or thought the class was too easy, definitely take it. Challenging but worth it.",
    "When Professor Vu taught the class in Spring 2014, there were problem sets of 5 questions each due every 2 weeks, no exams, and a paper and presentation at the end (on the same topic) where you learned about and presented an area of combinatorics. Topics included expectation, Chebyshev's Inequality, and the Local Lemma. More difficult conceptually than Math 244, but office hours definitely helped with problem sets. Class had about 8-10 people in it.",
    "If you're considering being a mathematician or you like probability and combinatorics, I would recommend this course. The subject is a really great one: it focuses on the probabilistic methods that have become more and more a part of mathematics since the beginning of the 20th century. These methods are really quite beautiful; they seem to work like magic the first time you see them. Professor Vu does a great job presenting the material in a clear way, building up to each theorem with plenty of definitions and examples. From there, he works through many applications which show the power and relevance of the theorem. The material got a little dull at times: after studying the basic methods of probabilistic proof, you go on to study various other ways the technique has been sharpened in certain contexts. No doubt these are important to the theory and there are interesting applications associated with them, but the course felt at times like a \"theme and variations,\" which felt a little stale. Overall, however, the class was quite interesting, and I'm happy as a mathematician to be able to put these probabilistic methods in my \"toolbox.\"",
    "This class taught me that combinatorics is a field full of some really interesting and elegant ideas, along with a lot of really messy proofs. The material we covered was pretty cool overall--basic probabilistic proofs, the Local Lemma, concentration inequalities, etc.--but a lot of the time it was hard (for me, anyway) to appreciate the underlying sense of it beneath all of the technicalities. Van Vu presented everything well, and was always clear at the board. Problem sets were only assigned once every two weeks, which made things less stressful overall (although sometimes individual problems caused some trouble). Overall, this is a decent math course, but if you happen to find combinatorics off-putting, it will not change your mind.",
