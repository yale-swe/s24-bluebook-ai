    "A really intense language course where you will learn A LOT. I would recommend it to anyone who actually wants to learn to speak French.",
    "French 121 involves some grammar work, some reading, some writing, and a lot of practice speaking the language. Attendance and keeping up with the work are important to success.French 121 is manageable, although it might be a bit challenging at first. If you put in the time and effort, the reward will be great.Take French 121 with Professor Ngame, if possible.",
    "French 121 can be a lot of work, but if you're disciplined then it's really not that bad. The course material is interesting and your French improves so quickly.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Ngame is a great teacher and as long as you get him you will learn a lot and not be too stressed by work. You will have work, but it is definitely worth it."
