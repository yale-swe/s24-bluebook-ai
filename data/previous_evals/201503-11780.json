   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in learning about developmental economics from an academic standpoint, definitely take this class.",
    "Econ 325 is an approachable introduction to development economics. It helps students hone econometric and paper-analyzing skills and provides insight into the issues researchers in economics face when they design and critique studies and interventions.",
    "Professor Qian is incredible. This course offers an overview of the world of development economics. I would highly recommend it to any economics majors who don't suck or anyone interested in the topic who has a solid conceptual understanding of economics.",
    "Yes. Good class. Read the papers even though you don't really need to. Professor is great. Best TA ever.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is important for ANYONE (econ majors or not) to have an understanding of the economics of development, why the developing countries are STILL \"developing,\" and what can be done to help, and what shouldn't be done to help. This course was an eye-opener and provided analytic tools with which to approach these issues. The workload was tough but the grading was VERY generous."
