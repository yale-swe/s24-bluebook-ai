    "The professor did less teaching and more guiding--most of the class time was taken up with student presentations based on the readings, so often we had minimal understanding of the topics we were discussing and we would have appreciated more of an introduction from the professor. He did try to guide the discussion but did not always bring clarity to the topics and I felt that we gained a very superficial knowledge of all of it. I'm not sure if prerequisites would have helped or if a different teaching format would have helped more. But I can tell that the topics covered in this course will be essential to understand in my professional career.",
    "Readings and topics were great, although the style of lecture and material presentation could stand to vary a bit more. A field trip would be terrific, as would other events to make the class more dynamic. The NRDC presentation was fantastic and more emphasis on integrating readings and topics with current events and timely coastal issues would make this class really sparkle.",
    "- Professor did not provide adequate guidance through what was often murky and convoluted intellectual material. Clear organization of ideas was lacking.- Readings were lengthy, digressive, tedious and often outdated. The course reading material needs to be updated to more recent discussions on ocean and coastal maters (of course, keeping in mind important historical contexts), and reading that is hopefully succinct and effective.- Class time was not conducive to a dynamic learning environment. Student presentations took up most class time- student presentations were not always the most conducive to through yet targeted discussion of key material.- Guidance questions given before the start of each class were a promising start to a directed discussion, but questions were not specifically addressed during class time. These focus questions might be a good start to a more specific organizational scheme for the class."

    "The topics covered.",
    "The best thing about this course is that there is a final paper rather than a final exam, and students have a lot of flexibility to choose a paper topic that fits their interest. The course text book gives a great overview of the week's material. The guest speakers from NRDC were excellent!",
    "The discussions, when they occurred. A small class with a committed and engaged teacher, we could really dig into issues and debate topics.",
    "The flexibility of the professor to listen to student concerns and ideas, and willingness to work with student interests."

    "None.",
    "The format of class (basically 3 hours of student presentations, with minimal input from professor).",
    "The weekly reading load was a bit too much some weeks, especially when the material is dense.",
    "Mostly mentioned above but bears repeating: class could be more dynamic, with different speakers, presentation styles, and field trip like events. Connecting topics covered in class to events occurring outside of class would be valuable (just as you did with the NRDC presentation).",

    "We didn't take full advantage of the group work because most people divided the group work (presentations) up and just did their own part separately.",
    "Students gave class presentations on assigned readings at least twice during the semester. I sought to collaborate with my fellow student presenters, in hopes of designing class presentations that were both effective at communicating important material, and enjoyable. These exercises were advantageous- one often learns as much working with team mates as one does working individually."
