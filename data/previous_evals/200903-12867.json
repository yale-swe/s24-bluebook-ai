   "comments": [
    "Spanish 130 was not as bad as I expected. The fact that it is every day makes it a lot, but in all the course is not too difficult and at times enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to continue studying Spanish. It is the perfect amount of work and a very encouraging atmosphere, especially if you get to take it with Professor Cividanes. She is one of the best teachers I have had at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is challenging but not overwhelming, reviews much of L2 but builds on it with additional vocabulary and more challenging readings.",
    "It is a good reinforcement of Spanish 2.",
    "take it for the languge requirement, but it's like repeating L1 at a higher level",
    "SPAN 130 is a great class to refine the skills acquired in L1 and L2. Don't expect too much new content, but rather, a greater proficiency with the basics you have already studied.If you can, take L3 with Professor Cividanes. She was an absolute delight, and is easily the most encouraging Spanish professor I have ever had.",
    "This is the third level in the Spanish language courses here. It's pretty much more of the same. Study, do the work and you will learn. If you do not, then you will not. Its strength is that it provides you with ample venues to learn (from the teacher, from the text book, online, etc.). The main weakness is that the student needs to take it upon them self to put the work in and take advantage of these opportunities.",
    "A lot of work! Daily homework assignments that can take hours. It is a great class if you want to expand on what you learned in Spanish 110 and 120.",
    "it's pretty self-explanatory. I'd recommend it to finish the lang req and definitely with Professor Cividanes. Don't be late to class though!",
    "I would have taken the course even if I did not need it for the language requirement. It has inspired me to continue to L4 even though I am now done with the requirement."
