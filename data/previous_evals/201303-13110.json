    "I would summarize this course as a conglomerate of different topics and lecturers, with both formal lectures and paper discussion. I would highly recommend this course to graduate students interested in any aspect of bacteriology, as many of the topics covered are applicable beyond just pathogenesis. Although parasitology and virology are not mentioned at all within the class, I might also recommend this course to first year graduate students interested in those subjects because of the paper discussions; I learned a lot about critical reading from this course.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was a great introductory course that gave a broad exposure of topics in microbiology."
