    "We read a lot of twentieth-century Arabic literature.",
    "This course provided a great overview into modern arabic novels and poetry; it allowed me to better be able to analyze arabic poetry and feel much more comfortable reading land understanding lengthy novels. The literary analysis skills developed throughout the seminar were great.",
    "better awareness of traditions in Arabic literature and poetry and better reading comprehension",
    "I learned how to write about Arabic texts",
    "Ability to read Arabic literature with more understanding, and a larger knowledge of how different pieces are part of grander eras of thought and writing.",
    "I learned a lot about the Arabic poetic tradition and learned more about the Arabic literary canon.",
    "I learned how to read difficult arabic literary texts and strategies for reading in Arabic. I also gained confidence orally presenting in Arab, and I learned how to write a serious research paper in Arabic."

   "comments": [
    "Even though the readings are classics of modern Arabic literature, the actual seminar meetings could not have been worse. Professor Aziz did not provide any help in understanding the readings, and we didn't have substantive discussions either. In fact, I'm still a little confused about how we covered so little material in two hours every week. Each week, there was a required reading that everyone did, and each student would choose something else to read as well. In class, each student would give a short oral presentation summarizing the thing that they read that nobody else had read--which didn't benefit anyone. There was also very little feedback. Readings were absurdly heave for the first half of the semester until Professor Aziz realized that most people weren't doing the readings, at which point we switched to poetry and the course started to be almost no work. We also had no guidance on writing the 10-page final paper in Arabic, which was frustrating.",
    "I loved the broad overview provided to modern arabic literature\/ poetry that empowered me to further explore arabic literature and be able to understand it. At times, however, it felt as if we are trying to cover too much.",
    "Strength was definitely the poetry section! A weakness was the lack of class dialogue - most people spoke primarily to the professor and not their peers, and there was little conversation.",
    "More spoken student involvement",
    "This course does a good job selecting important and influential pieces of writing from different eras and countries. The style of weekly written responses keeps students accountable and up to date on the content.",
    "Strengths: We looked at excellent texts, I kept up my level of arabic, and I received thoughtful feedback on my writing. I feel my writing and oral expression improved this semester. The main improvements I would suggest would be having shorter texts (which Professor Aziz fixed towards the end of the semester) and having more class discussion devoted to discussing short texts, rather than presentations."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class if you are looking to improve your Arabic language skills. If you're a native speaker, this class is a good excuse to read some important Arabic literature and poetry, but you won't get much out of the seminar meetings.",
    "I don't think so. The classes dragged a bit.",
    "Yes, this is a great course that would empower you to engage with lengthy arabic novels and give you a broad overview of the schools of modern arab poetry. The workload is rather light which is nice as well.",
    "If you want to learn about modern arabic texts, yes",
    "Yes, if you are interested in Arabic Literature. The course provides an excellent opportunity to improve your arabic, which can be hard after completing the L5 level. This class provided me a strong introduction to what exists with regards to Arabic Literature."
