    "Overall a very good class that gave a great overview of all the physical sciences. I feel like I gained a lot out of the class, but sometimes I feel like I understand the details without having as clear of an understanding of the overall big picture. Perhaps it would be helpful to make this connection to the students and make it more clear what these calculations we are going through represent in the larger picture.",
    "Q2 - The class was filled with people who had little to no background knowledge, and yet Prof. Anisfeld would fly past many subjects. I attribute this to the excessive quantity of material; if he had not sought to teach so much in one semester, he could have actually taught us something. As it was, many of us learned far less than we could have. The fact that more than 50% of students consistently answered the in-class questions incorrectly should have given him more pause than it did.Prof. Anisfeld is a good person who is trying very hard, but he should either change the proposed scope of this class to one that is more academic and less applied, or strongly reconsider the quantity of material.Q9b, c - The field trip with Tom Sicama was excellent; he was extremely clear, made the material fun and engaging, and was generally knowledgeable about the forest.",
    "Question 10: The concepts are very valuable and should be understood by anyone wishing to do policy work that affects ecology.",
    "I thought this course was really hard and attempted to cover a lot of material. I thought it was too much for someone without any college level physical science classes, and with no intention of being an expert in this area! I thought it required us to understand things in a lot of detail, which I found really challenging.",
    "Q 2-4: I felt that the instructor did not provide sufficient explanations of many of the concepts that were addressed in this course. As a \"foundation\" course, there was an expectation that I could take it without prior background and still succeed. My experience was that this course was unrealistically challenging and unrealistically time consuming. It was a common occurrence that a given set of material would be covered in class, and then a different set of material or skills, which had not been covered, would be required for homework. This made completion of the homework by myself impossible on nearly every occasion. I attended an average of two multi-hour help sessions every single week, and still failed to grasp much of the material.To challenge a student is to ask them to take a set of skills, and to apply them in ways that push their conceptual boundaries, thereby forming new connections, novel findings, and intellectual growth. The out-of-class assignments were not challenging, since they required leaps that were too great for the majority of students. They were instead, just \"hard\". It was a common occurrence to have 15+\/- students at each help session, out of a class of 21+\/-. I feel that this reflects an unrealistic expectation of student time and energy, and of pedagogy. At the very least, the professor needs to be upfront with students about what will be required of them to complete the course with moderate success.The difficulty of this course is a reflection of both the material and somewhat unsuccessful pedagogical practice. Shimi is a devoted educator - he provides his students with copious time and energy, is always prepared, and was successful in covering the broad reach of \"physical sciences\". He is one of the more devoted educators that I had this term. But, he was not open to constructive criticism of his educational methods. As an educator myself, I would argue that it is imperative that one be receptive methodological changes.An educator seeks to impart knowledge and skills and to foster growth in the student; the student seeks to take in and build knowledge and skills. When a student who is actively engaged and is putting in significant time and energy fails to acquired the knowledge and skills needed to complete their studies, it is a reflection of how the information is delivered. We must ask ourselves about the quality of education - whether a cursory overview of many topics is better than in-depth training in fewer areas. When an engaged student fails to grasp the material, both the educator and the student are failing to get what they want. I was disappointed that when I addressed the professor about this issue, I was instructed to drop-out of the course if I was not able to keep up or complete the assignments. I encourage careful reflection on the course structure and the relative number of students that need large amounts of outside help to complete assignments. I do not intend to target this course for negative criticism, but feel that this form of honest critique is essential for building a more successful course and more successful pedagogy.",
    "i am responding to questions 2 and 6.this class was taught too quickly and the material was not taught with enough focus on the concepts and their applications. prof. anisfeld tried to get through far too much material. the class felt extremely haphazard, and i and many of my peers didn't know what the point of much of what we were learning was. the readings helped somewhat, but they were often tangential, and it was difficult to triangulate an understanding of how it all came together. this class is certainly not suitable for somebody who has little or no experience with science, and asking such people to take this class is a waste of their short time here. for those of us who have some experience with science and are looking to get a sense for the physical science underlying environmental questions, a much more concept-based, applied class might be more helpful. the hard science is useful, i suppose, but i can guarantee you that most of us are not coming away remembering any of it. just not what most of us are here for.",
    "Question 10: I am an MF candidate and though I enjoyed all the topics covered during the semester, some were more relevant to my particular focus than others. This is a broad course that covers many topics and I think that should be made clear to MFs.",
    "I took this course with some background in environmental science, assuming that I would learn more about how science was used in \"environmental management.\" But mostly, it was like a high school science class, more about memorizing when the glaciers formed and less about how we could use this info in future applications. For me, that meant a lot of the material was repetitive and the class was not useful. At the very least, the final should have been a take-home in which we actually could reference what we learned in class and apply it to solve real solutions. Instead, it was exactly like the midterm we had had a few weeks earlier.",
    "In general, I really enjoyed the course. My only suggestion would be to streamline the information that is provided. Given the large amount of information covered in the course it might be better absorbed if some of the most extraneous info were cut out. For example, you could spend a little less time on Connecticut geologic history in order to spend more time on later subjects. I thought that the time allotted to soils and water was appropriate, but insufficient time was allowed for the atmosphere and oceans."

    "The instructor's devotion to his students was the best part of this course. Teaching was clearly a priority for him, and it was nice to get active participation in this regard. Shimi was responsive to emails, conducted regular office hours, and provided sufficient amounts of out-of-class help hours.",

   "comments": [
    "Not much - just (as stated above) making sure that we understand the greater implications of the more detailed calculations and equations we are learning.",
    "The only way to complete the problem sets in a reasonable amount of time and without outside help was to attend the \"review sessions.\" In these sessions, students sat around making mistakes until the TAs came over to walk them through the next step. Many students joked that these sessions were \"putting the time in,\" but this puts the students who are unable to attend the sessions because of other engagements at an extreme disadvantage. If your problem sets are so hard that students have to be spoon-fed the answers by the TAs, then you should probably modify their difficulty.Note: this is not in any way a critique of the TAs; they are not paid to teach the students the material, which is what would have had to happen at the sessions in order to avoid the spoon-feeding that instead took place.",
    "In-class lectures should also include more mathematical examples, so that it is easier for us to prepare for the problem sets.",
    "The organization of the class.",
    "This class is trying to take on too much material. I think either the focus should be to essentially cover Tarbuck and those more qualitative components of physical sciences, or else just focus more intensely on say air and water as \"case studies\". We could become scientifically literate in a more complete fashion.",
    "There was so much material, and some of it seemed quite disjointed. For example, a lot of the stuff on the problem sets was not covered in lectures, classnotes, or reading materials. It was hard (if not impossible) to be able to independently bring oneself up to speed on concepts without help from the professor or TAs.",
    "See question 11 - pace and delivery.",
    "The text readings were only somewhat helpful. The Tarbuck text was pretty clear and straightforward, but the topics that were covered were the easier ones in the course that didn't require that much review. It would be helpful to have a text that adequately explained the more difficult concepts so that we could supplement our learning on our own.",
    "the pacing and the lack of conceptual connections made. extremely fast and haphazard and not really in tune with what would suit most people who take this class. i do not mean to say we need to be totally accommodated, but to tell us this is a requirement when most of us are really not going to apply the bulk of the qualitative material from this class ever again is totally ridiculous. perhaps there can be a more concept-based science class, in which the real questions and their applicability can be ramped up and the quantitative can be tuned down a bit.",
    "The rapid pace of the course made it difficult for me to retain all the information bombarding students.",
    "The lectures bounced between easy and hard, and it was clear that many students hadn't really grasped main concepts before the professor moved on. Shimi is very patient, but sometimes he has difficulty distilling major concepts down into teachable chunks. (For example, early on, someone asked a question about significant figures for which the answer was basically, \"follow rules of basic mathematical rounding,\" but instead Shimi went through a bunch of examples.)Finally, many students just went to office hours and were basically fed the answers to problem sets, disadvantaging students who couldn't attend.",
    "The course could be a little more focused. I think that it would be beneficial to spend less time on basic chemistry and more time on general concepts such as interactions between the various Earth spheres.",
    "Sometimes I thought Shimi could do a better job tying the material back to management and management decisions but overall it was a very well taught course.",
    "The course is too theoretical and has little applicability to actual management. I also felt that too many different and often unrelated topics were covered. This made the course feel episodic and learning the material difficult. I believe the concept of the class is fundamentally flawed.",
    "The course should not cover so much material. At the end, it comes down to quality vs. quantity."
