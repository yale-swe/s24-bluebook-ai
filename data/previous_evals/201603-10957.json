   "comments": [
    "I received a good overview of global affairs and the state of things in the world.",
    "This was an amazing course, particularly the first half. Emma had so much wisdom and knowledge and she brought in amazing speakers. I learned a ton about security. The second half was much less engaging but still interesting.",
    "A good introduction to the major and a good marker for whether or not students would like to continue on the topic, as it covers a wide variety of subjects.",
    "The ability to take into account so many issues when thinking about human security and development.",
    "This class gave me a small glimpse of the greater overall picture of global affairs and the reasons that nations interact with each other the way that they do. My biggest takeaway is that nothing on an international scale has a simple solution.",
    "In this class, we covered a huge variety of topics about development and security, so I learned a little bit about a lot of things. I can't say concretely which skills or topics I gained knowledge of in this course because we didn't really go into depth, but it was interesting.",
    "I began to think more critically about complex global issues. A valuable skill I learned was writing a policy memo. I had zero experience with that before this class and as a part of the final and midterm I learned to write them.",
    "I learned a lot about the Middle East..and I learned how to write a policy memo (kind of?).",
    "I learned extensively about issues plaguing the Middle East and North Africa as well as how to write policy memos.",
    "Not sure that I learned much.",
    "I learned about the world",
    "I am not sure how much \"knowledge\" i gained from the class itself but I certainly did learn to write good policy memos (two of our four papers were required to be memos on International Security and International Dev respectively.) A lot of the information (especially in the security part) was stuff I would've read about anyway, but hearing from stalwarts such as Robert Ford and Charles Hill really helped give a different perspective on many issues.",
    "The first half of the course was outstanding. I felt like I learned an enormous amount of insights into the Middle East, in particular, Brexit, and climate change.",
    "The course offers a good sampling of informational basics on a variety of current global affairs. I also feel prepared to write an effective policy memo.",
    "I learned about many of the pressing subjects that face our world. From the violence in MENA, to China, to Sub-Saharan Africa, I learned about many of the geopolitical struggles of our time. I also learned about important subjects within global affairs, such as sustainable development, cybersecurity, and peace deals. I also learned a great deal about writing policy memos and concisely expressing my opinion on international issues.",
    "I got a taste of many topics in the broad field of global affairs. The semester began with topics in international security and transitioned more to development. A key insight I walked away with was being careful not to impose the U.S. view of democracy upon other nations. While democracy and equality are important values for all nations, it might look different in different places. I also learned the difference between humanitarian and development aid.",
    "I learned a lot about the Iraq war, the middle east, and the Israel-Palestine conflict. I got some sense for the complicated nature of US middle eastern foreign policy. I leaned what the 17 UN sustainable Development goals are, though not much about them.",
    "This course allowed me to develop an insight to the realm of national security and human development. I learned so much about the situations in the Middle East and China as well as about previous US military conflicts and wars.",
    "met lots of cool people",
    "I have learned the basics of developing a policy memo and op.ed. article. Furthermore, I have learned the importance of not only the development aspect of international relations, but the security aspect as well.",
    "That these problems are much more nuanced and intricate than I had realized, I have a lot to learn, practicality and compromise is necessary in delegations, and that I'm second-guessing whether or not I want to go into this field of work.",
    "Gained insight into the general state of world affairs and how the international system of international affairs functions. We also learned how to write policy papers to address issues.",
    "My knowledge about the world has increased greatly. Happy and lucky to have taken this class.",
    "Overview of questions, concerns, and responses to issues in national security and international development.",
    "This course gave us a broad introduction to the Global Affairs major, touching on both development and international security topics. I learned how to write a policy memo, as well as a lot of information about the Iraq War and the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. There was a strong emphasis on the necessity of development for national security.",
    "The course was very helpful in developing my view on multiple complex contemporary issues. Regarding assignments, I found the policy memos particularly helpful, as they helped me condense my thoughts into concise, precise writing. Furthermore, throughout my education so far, I have learned to write essays in nicely written prose, but having to write clearly and straight to the point was a very helpful exercise.",
    "I gained both direct information and insights from current global affairs events, but also frameworks and questions for how to better understand global issues going forward.",
    "I learned to write policy memos",
    "I learned how to write a policy memo.",
    "I learned a lot about global affairs and I learned how to critically approach problem solving skills and broaden the way that I think about issues.",
    "I learned a lot about the contemporary world (and specifically about the MENA region), including major events in recent history and some of the challenges that Global Affairs specialists face in security and development.",
    "The class discussed a broad array of global affairs topics. I gained general knowledge on pertinent international issues, and learned how to write policy memos.",
    "I have gained insight into different topics and questions in foreign affairs currently as well as different theories in the field. I also gained policy writing skills through the essay assignments during the course.",
    "Gateway to Global Affairs offered me a good beginning knowledge of how international relations can be applied in different situations across the world.",
    "To think about issues of global security and global development through a critical lense.",
    "I developed, I would say, a fairly useful toolbox for evaluating national-security issues at a high level, and a moderately useful grab bag of knowledge about various topics in national security and development. Overall, as I am sure many other students either have written or will write, the national security portion of the course was considerably more coherent, and perhaps more interesting, than the development portion. In any case, the very best source for the knowledge and skills that I gained by taking this course was my Teaching Fellow, Sebastian, who taught my discussion how to write a policy memo, how to understand the deep structural and historical forces powering various policymaking quandaries, mostly in national securities, and was a genuinely very good teacher.",
    "This course provided a broad overview and introduction into the field of Global Affairs. Guest lecturers spoke on the most pressing security and development issues of the day.",
    "During Gateway to Global Affairs, I gained an insight on the subject of global affairs itself. The differences between development and security, and also key examples of cases within each.",
    "I learned a lot about the scope of the global affairs major. Though I didn't gain a very in depth understanding of a single topics, it was helpful to get an overview to see what the two tracks in the major may offer. It was also helpful to see different professors to understand their teaching styles.",
    "I gained a decent understanding of global issues, American involvement, and international relations.",
    "I developed a much more thorough knowledge of what is happening in the world around me and why these events are taking place.",
    "I learned a substantial amount about the world - particularly in relation to current Middle Eastern politics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course had a limited focus (primarily Middle East), and lacked continuity between a string of lecturers. Emma Sky didn't really teach, which disappointing.",
    "I think that having more lectures on theoretical foundations of global affairs would be helpful. Moreover, I think that not trying to cover EVERYTHING there is in global affairs, but picking just a few topics that are currently \"hot\" and discussing them would help the students understand the issues better having just one lecture on basically every topic covered in the course at times just left me more confused about it, as opposed to feeling like I have learnt something.",
    "The material was fascinating but sometimes the course was a little disorganized.",
    "Strengths: The lead professors are incredible and well versed on the topic. Weaknesses: The course was almost entirely taught by guest lecturers.",
    "Perhaps having the professors lecture a bit more themselves, but I also loved the people that came through to talk to us.",
    "The security half of the course was great. It was packed with new information every week and the material was very engaging. The latter half that was dedicated to development was disappointing. If the course tried to make an exercise or project to make development seem more relevant, I would've enjoyed the last half of the class much more than I did.",
    "I know the point of this course is that it surveys a lot of topics in little depth, but I think have a different professor lecture each week rather than each class or something of that sort would strengthen our knowledge of the particular subjects and provide some continuity that seemed lacking. The topics were all interesting and the guest lecturers were extremely qualified but in terms of overall strengths and weaknesses, I feel I could have learned more from them if the format of the class was different. Also, I think having the second half of each lecture be questions from students was detrimental to our focus, because there was so little presentation time and then it was very easy to shift our attention to something else once the lecture itself was over and people were just asking questions that didn't necessarily pertain to us. Overall, I think the strength of this course is how many topics it covers and the fact that every lecturer was an expert in their field, but I think these factors could be better reworked to make the class more engaging.",
    "I have a lot of conflicting feelings about this course. First of all, there are two extremely qualified instructors who have had really illustrious careers in their respective fields. Both Professor Sky and Dr. Karunakara had a lot of valuable insight to share, but they did not lecture much. On the other hand, I appreciated the guest lectures a lot and they made me start thinking about classes and professors that I would like to take in the future. Specifically, I think the security and diplomacy portion of the course was structured better than the development section. Professor Sky brought excellent guests and there seemed to be some sort of an underlying course structure, even though it wasn't always obvious. The development module was really interesting and also had really great guests, but each lecture seemed like a discrete occurrence rather than having the module structured so that I felt like I was learning the foundations of development and building off of that. The security section was very Middle East heavy, which is of course Professor Sky's field of expertise, but I would've liked a bit more of a survey of other regions that are really geopolitically and strategically important in modern security and diplomacy.",
    "I think the course would benefit from having a few well-defined central themes that the leading professors (Sky and Karunakara or whichever professors will lead the next iteration of the course) could spend a few minutes at the end of each class tying the guest lecture back to. This would give the course an over-arching organization that would link together the lectures that sometimes felt disjointed.",
    "This course was terribly organized. Paper dates were not set until weeks until the course and we found out the due date of the final paper and prompts the week before Thanksgiving, making it difficult to schedule flights home. The first class of the half about security was very interesting, development, not so much. Professors didn't seem to care very much or try very hard to engage the classroom. Wasted days having students pretend to be diplomats for the 1 h 15 min long lecture, days where the professor purely showed videos in class. This class was usually just a regurgitation of the readings, so it became pointless to do both the readings and class. The only interesting lecturers were Charlie Hill, Stephen Roach, and Robert Ford. The rest were poorly planned. Difficult to do well in this class considering neither lectures or readings help with the papers--which have broad prompts that are almost impossible to answer. Very dissatisfied with the professors and teaching of this course. This course persuaded me NOT to apply to Global Affairs because it was so not engaging, poorly structured, and poorly organized. Never have I felt that my professors cared less about a class.",
    "Strengths of this course include the lectures of Robert Ford, the security portion, and weekly section meetings. If it weren't for my section, I would not have enjoyed this course. It turned me away entirely from the Global Affairs major. Weaknesses were the breadth of the readings, the discontinuity between lectures, and some of the class discussions.",
    "There is really no engagement in this course. The lectures are often dry, or don't have much content in them.",
    "Strengths: 1. great lecturers, whirlwind tour of many amazing courses at Yale (the entire semester often felt like a very long, organized shopping period). I plan on taking many of the courses taught by the lecturers 2. gives a very good broad overview of the field of global affairs and how it is taught at the Jackson institute Weaknesses: 1. Lack of structure, mostly due to the dependence on guest lecturers, which can be both a strength and a flaw 2. inordinate focus on the Middle East in the International Security module (while i discount for the fact that Emma Sky has amazing experiences from Iraq, there was no mention of Latin America and Africa and just one lecture on China's economic prowess.) 3. I WROTE FOUR 1500 WORD PAPERS FOR THIS CLASS, WHY ISN'T IT A WRITING CREDIT?!?!??!??!",
    "The variety of guest lecturers provided an array of expertise and insight.",
    "The courses lectures were often disjointed, and lacked any thematic connection. The lack of continuity could often be disengaging.",
    "Strengths: professors were experts in their field, fascinating guest speakers, engaged teaching fellows Weaknesses: each lecture generally lacked a common thread unless it was the same speaker over a span of lectures, focused too much on the Middle East and not on Latin America whatsoever, too much time spent for students to ask questions rather than have small pauses for questions within the lecture.",
    "This course provided a wonderful array of speakers and topics and was a great exposure to the breadth of global affairs. The course, however, plunged us into current conversation on each of the topics instead of giving more of a background on the topics. I think providing more history and background would have helped us to understand the topics better.",
    "I loved the security portion of the course, but the development section was very poorly organised. There was no connection between each of the sections, and no discussion of the major concepts\/framework for the main ideas we were building upon. As an introductory class, this confusion led to many of us reconsidering or discarding Global Affairs as a major because we could not engage with the subject material.",
    "This class is kind of like \"story time with famous people.\" All the guest lecturers are incredibly accomplished, which is cool. The 6 lecture series by ambassador Robert Ford was phenomenal and an excellent way to learn about the middle east. Unfortunately a lot of the other one-off lectures were very disjointed and had nothing to do with each other. The development section of the course was particularly all over the place and somewhat worthless. This course explores incredibly fascinating stuff, it just does it in a weird way.",
    "It is a lecture but the sections are a good time to ask questions on the material and absorb what was talked about in the news, in lecture, in the readings and listen to what other students have to say",
    "Strengths: It covers a lot of information and the section TFs are very helpful. Weaknesses: Because of the visiting lector format, the classes do not seem very connected and without proper background knowledge or the benefit of lectures building on each other, the class can feel very jumpy.",
    "I thought that the course was structurally flawed. For the most part, it lacked coherence, making disjointed jumps from one topic to the next. it did, however, provide a good understanding of what the global affairs major has to offer (I loved hearing\/reading about Professor Sky, I'm much more interested in the major because of her) - it simply did not teach us much about global affairs.",
    "Strengths: the speakers that were brought in were always very interesting and qualified and articulate and passionate and smart. Weaknesses: No linearity, wasn't necessary to do the readings, too broad, not enough support for policy paper writing.",
    "strengths would definitely be content and readings",
    "While the course covered both the development and security aspect well, I think it would be useful to work on covering each of these fields on different regions of the world (MENA, MINT, BRICS, East Asia, SE Asia, the Global South, Eastern Europe, etc). Maybe have two weeks per area on each region with one week on security and one on humanitarian\/development aid. It would cover more ground and help contextualize the curriculum to needs in each region. It would also be great to see more women and people of color come in and speak.",
    "Strengths: my TA was dedicated and open to helping us, made us think about issues in different ways, cool lecturers. Weaknesses: Throws students into assignments without much background info, each class is standalone, not interconnected, readings did not reflect what was discussed in lecture, too many readings that weren't relevant.",
    "What I found to be one of the best parts of Gateway is often what other students criticized - the wide variety of speakers and frequency at which they changed. I thought it was valuable that the framework of this course provides students the opportunity to hear from a number of Yale's most esteemed professors as well as speakers from outside of Yale. It is a great way to discover new interests, find classes that you may want to take in the future, and hear from the people who are experts in their respective fields. Admittedly, I did gain more from the times that we heard from a particular speaker for more than one lecture (as with Ambassador Ford), but I still think that one of the strengths of this course is the great variety of lecturers. Gateway's weakness was the disconnect between the various components of the course. Section discussions often did not correspond with the readings or lectures, and some readings did not seem at all relevant to the lectures. I do not expect a course to perfectly execute all of this, but as one fellow student put it, you could get the same amount out of the course by going to lectures and doing no readings or doing the readings and going to no lectures. In this same light, the assignments were not an effective way of measuring course learning. It was entirely possible to write the midterm and final assignments only by doing individual reading and research. Similarly, it was annoying that one of our assignments was on Emma's book when we spent less than one lecture speaking about it. To me, it did not seem fair that a quarter of our semester grade was determined by an essay on a book that was not directly relevant to the course.",
    "Emma Sky is an excellent professor and brings in so many interesting lecturers in addition to her own lectures on her experiences in the Middle East. I can't say the same for Unni in that I personally had a hard time engaging in the second half of the class. The lecturers were not as engaging.",
    "This course had a lot of very interesting speakers and really helped me understand some of the world's most complex issues. However, it felt disjointed at times and it was difficult to write the midterm and final essays because the prompts were extremely broad.",
    "This course is a series of guest lectures. Some really interesting, some not. Really worth it !",
    "Strengths are that you get introduced to a lot ofthe Yale faculty that you may learn from or work with on a variety of topics. Weaknesss is that you don't get to engage with individual topics as much.",
    "Security module much more engaging than development module.",
    "I thought it was pretty good overall.",
    "Rather than going in depth into what is national security and what is international development, we had guest lecturers every week who spoke about what they do. While it was usually interesting, it often felt a bit scattered. I didn't always feel like I was building on what I learned each week. We spent each lecture hearing about a different topic rather than going in depth.",
    "The course was strong in that it did give me a good sense of what being a Global Affairs major would entail. A lot of the guest speakers were also very interesting and informative. However, because of the way the class was structured the topics felt very disjointed and somewhat loosely connected. Obviously this is a survey course, but I did not feel like it taught me as much as it could have just because it attempted to cover so many topics in such a short time.",
    "I believe that the main strength of this course was the diversity of topics it covered. Sometimes, we went over complex issues in little time, but I feel this is exactly the objective of the course; to provide students with an overview of the issues discussed in global affairs and help them decide which ones really interest them. However, at times I felt the course was overly US-centric. Although this can be understood in a class aiming to provide students with a gateway into a field of study, and therefore it can be helpful to go off of a base we understand well, global affairs, by its very nature, is \"global\". I feel the course could have benefitted from looking less at US policy towards issues and adopt a more diversified approach to issues.",
    "Strengths: I loved having so many guest speakers come in to introduce their expertise area, course offerings, and perspective. This was a fantastic overview of what Yale, Jackson School, and the global affairs career could offer young aspiring globally minded students - showcasing how they could make an impact over their careers. Improvement Areas: It would be nice to have had a consolidated list of follow-up courses or organizations, to provide students interested in learning more\/getting involved in one of the focus areas to do so over their time at Yale",
    "More structure of the class inside of random lectures on various topics",
    "The course would have been more effective had there been a more organized second section (the development-focused section). The readings were interesting enough. Ur mostly based on the western perspective. As a global course, it would be good to include eastern perspectives (particularly in the securitu unit).",
    "The lectures and sections could be more closely related.",
    "This class is very interesting and engaging when the topic is of interest, but if the topic is not interesting it is very difficult to stay engaged with it.",
    "The strength of this course is its guest lecture system (in which there are new lecturers every week or every few weeks). It could be improved by solidifying essay due dates before the end of shopping period, and maybe making final essays due later in finals week.",
    "There was a lack of continuity between guest lecturers. I think this course would have been a lot better had the professor taken the last few minutes of each class to relate the specific topics back to global affairs as a whole. The guest lecturers themselves were extremely interesting, and the Israel-Palestine conflict simulation was great too.",
    "I think that connecting the topics we study would allow for better flow during the course.",
    "The course was very engaging, and section was fantastic. Unfortunately, lectures were a little disjointed.",
    "The strength of this course as a course were that some of the individual lectures were extremely interesting, especially (at least for me) those by Robert Ford, Jolyon Howorth, Daniel Etsy, and Mushfiq Mobarak. The two main weaknesses of the course was that some of the individual lectures were boring and mediocre, and (I cannot emphasize this enough), there was little to no overarching structure or theme to this course. In future years, if the Global Affairs program wants to actually create an interesting introductory policy course, they should probably opt for a different structure altogether; ironically, the best option might be something similar to \"module\" format that was employed in years past. (I'm mostly basing this opinion on the fact that the very best part of the course, Robert Ford's series of lectures, were six classes organized around a specific theme that had broad applications within the realm of national security.) In any case, please change the structure of this course, and perhaps more strenuously vet the teaching skills of the various lecturers many of them seemed more used to graduate or professional school courses, and thus relatively unprepared to deliver a broad introductory lecture on their field of expertise to mostly undergraduates. The one other major strength of the course was the stable of Teaching Fellows, who generally seemed extremely smart, competent, and passionate about teaching their students.",
    "Strengths: - wide range of topics covered - enlightening reading assignments - work load was extremely manageable Weaknesses: - because of the breadth of material covered, the lectures were often surface-level discussions",
    "There was quite a large difference in the pacing of the course between the security and development sides. I think that it would have been more engaging had the pacing stayed consistent.",
    "Emma did a fantastic job bringing relevant speakers. The course was a buffet of scholars and practitioners with wide-ranging and interesting discussions.",
    "Strengths: It's helpful to get an overview. Weaknesses: The course seemed to go all over the place and there was no real coherent trend at some points. Improvements: Have more speakers like Robert Ford coming in for multiples lectures in a row.",
    "Being an introductory course, a wide variety of topics are discussed, which leads to a discord in lectures. In addition, the assignments consist of four papers with extremely vague prompts, which make them difficult to write.",
    "Strengths: Covers wide range of topics but still provides depth Weaknesses: Does not give a great introduction to the field, but rather an introduction to specific topics within the field; Readings were way too long and often not relevant",
    "Strength: Students have the chance to get into different topics of global affairs and talk to many excellent speakers in various fields. Weakness: The entire course is relatively disconnected from one class to another. Also, the readings are not very relevant to the class and sometimes too many to read.",
    "When the lecturers were good, the class was incredible. When they were not as engaging, it was worthless. I take full blame for this (because my interests were, of course, not exactly aligned with those of the class leaders), but there were days where I absorbed virtually no information."

    "I would recommend this course to students interested in global affairs and\/or thinking about potentially majoring in global affairs. It provides a good overview of the current state of affairs in the world, and is interesting and engaging most of the time.",
    "100% would recommend to everyone!!!!",
    "Most definitely! I think that this was a great class!",
    "I would recommend this course to a freshman who does not yet know their specific interests and is thinking of pursuing a global-affairs related major, but I would not recommend it to someone like myself who has just an average level of prior knowledge about the course topics and is taking the course out of general interest - because it was interesting but not compelling, and I often felt like I knew less than my peers even though the point of the class was to learn about those very topics. I took it as my fifth class and would suggest this to people since it wasn't very time-consuming, but I wouldn't say it's for everyone.",
    "I would most likely recommend this course to others. If you're interested in Global Affairs or really just want to take an interesting class, you should shop it. You should also make an effort to get to know the professors. In particular, Professor Sky, if she is still teaching the class, has a wealth of experience in the Middle East and has a lot of stories to share. You may find the course a bit lacking in structure or a bit Middle East-heavy in the security module, but getting a good TF will help you weave together the aspects of global affairs.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to major in global affairs and wants to get a feel for different professors in the department. It will expose you to different topics in global affairs that you may have otherwise thought you weren't interested in, so it allows your to broaden your interests.",
    "Never. Extremely poor organized. Extremely poor structured. Professors did not seem to care about the class. A huge disappointment.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The class was overwhelming and disheartening. I thought I was the only student who held these beliefs until my final section when I realized these beliefs were widely held. Essentially, the class made me feel as though majoring in Global Affairs would be a waste of 4 years.",
    "If you're looking for a low effort, low work load class, take this. We only wrote four papers all semester, and while there were a lot of readings, you didn't have to do them to get by. In fact, you probably don't even need to attend class to do well in this course. You also don't learn much. A lot of it is common sense and the rest of it is useless. While the professors are renowned and some of them taught me a lot, a large majority of them were neither renowned or able to teach much. The first half of this class, about international security, is much better than the second half, about international development. It's not to say that one is better than the other as a major, but just that in the context of this course, international development isn't taught as well.",
    "I wouldn't particularly recommend it but it seems fine as an intro course. The one-topic per day can be interesting but it can be frustrating when one cannot go in depth into any one subject",
    "While I did gain from the course in that I learnt what to do and what to not do over my time at Yale, it wasn't particularly academically challenging or intellectually stimulating. The class is enjoyable primarily because of the amazing guest lecturers. I would recommend the course as a moderate workload 4th\/5th course for prospective (but unsure) global affairs majors. If you are sure about GLBL, then take one of the more focussed classes",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I would recommend this course, especially if the lectures found a little more cohesion in their planning and thoughts.",
    "I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a tasting platter of global issues, and wants to learn writing skills as they apply to the field. It also introduces you to some of the incredible professors within the Jackson Institute, whom I hope to see again next semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but I would say that there must be a lot of self initiative to learn the background of these issues and discuss your paper with your tf. The guest speakers were very engaging and passionate about what they did.",
    "Honestly, if you are interested in any of the topics this course covers, I would recommend taking a course in one of those topics. This course is a \"survey course\" in the truest sense of the word, and you get to hear from all kinds of amazing people but you don't really learn much of anythingI still can't really tell you what development is, and I know I'm not alone in that.",
    "Yes. If you want to know more about the world around you and hear it from people who are experts in it or have lived through the situations being taught then this is a good course.",
    "If you're looking for a relatively easy class for your first semester of freshman year, this could be a good choice. However, if you're looking for a class that is representative of the global affairs major, I don't think this is. A lot of topics are brought up through many visiting lectors, some of whom are fascinating, while others... weren't. This class is okay, but not great. The workload is very manageable.",
    "If you're interested in the global affairs major and you want to see what professors\/resources it has to offer, take this class.",
    "Emma Sky is awesome.",
    "Yes, but be warned it is also very Middle Eastern focused and security oriented.",
    "Depends on whether that student is ready to hold themselves accountable to reading the lecture readings, getting help from TAs on the assignments, and how interested they are in the subject matter.",
    "Don't need to do the readings to succeed but it definitely helps. A lot of the security readings are very interesting. The economic development ones I found to be a bit dry. This is a great survey class of current affairs and a good way to test your interest in the field.",
    "You learn about many issues you must know to be a well rounded. Take it",
    "Yes because of how well it introduces you to resources around you at Yale.",
    "Only if you're very interested in both security and development tracks.",
    "Yes. Loved the course.",
    "It is a good first poli sci\/global affairs class because you're exposed to a bunch of topics, and it might give you an idea of what you'd like to focus on in the future. I didn't love it, but I don't regret taking it. We got to hear from a lot of interesting people who are working on great things, and they are all connected to the yale community. We had two policy memos, one essay on a book, and one op-ed, 1500 words each.",
    "I would not unless the student was certain that they wanted to be a Global Affairs major, just because the topics were so scattered that there wasn't a lot of concrete, focused learning. But it does give you a good sense of all the different paths you could take if you were interested in Global Affairs, so in that sense it was valuable.",
    "If you feel that you are interested in the large forces shaping our contemporary world yet you don't know specifically what about global affairs interests you, definitely take this course.",
    "Definitely! This has been my favorite course at Yale thus far - I cite this course structure to colleagues and family as a reflection of how many strong resources and opportunities we have at Yale.",
    "Only if they were interested in Global Affairs",
    "It will depend on who your instructor is. We ha da structure in which different professors would come in every week to speak about specific global issues. This was effective in that it brought a lot of different perspectives to the table, but made the class feel a bit disjointed because I feel like it took some time to get used to each professor's teaching style.",
    "If you are a freshman, I would recommend this course as a good introduction to the study of global affairs. For a sophomore interested in applying to Global Affairs, I would recommend taking a class that is less of an introduction and more relevant to the track you want to pursue, as this is truly a freshman introductory course.",
    "Yes especially if they are at all interested in the way that the world works and what is going on in the world.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who are very interested in Global Affairs. It is a lot of reading and (at least this year) the class is structured so that both midterm essays are due on the same date and both final essays are due on the same date. The final exam was due on the first day of finals period this semester, and there were no exams. The course is taught through a series of guest lectures by professors who are experts on specific aspects of Global Affairs. The class was full of people who either had an interest in Global Affairs before or who had even lived in the places we were talking about, so as a newcomer to the subject I found it a bit intimidating, but I ended up learning quite a bit.",
    "Yes, this is a good survey course with something for everyone to like. Would highly recommend to anyone considering to apply to the global affairs major.",
    "I believe this course is a good overview of the Global Affairs major and professors in the Jackson institute.",
    "Take this course if you would like to establish a beginning knowledge of international relations and its different uses in today's world.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Absolutely recommended to anyone looking to get a taste of the intricacies of the foreign world.",
    "When this course (or at least the version of it that I took; I hope for the sake of future student that it undergoes some serious adjustments before it is taught again) was at its best, it was one of the best courses I took at Yale; when it was at its worst, it was truly one of the worst. Unfortunately, the latter level of quality generally predominated over the course of the semester. I do not necessarily regret taking this course, as some of the lectures were great learning opportunities; in particular, the six class meetings taught by Robert Ford, the former U.S Ambassador to Syria, were excellent. However, the class is largely made up of mediocre lectures in which experts in various fields, many of them obscure, provide broad introductions to their topics. (Who in the name of G-d considers urban farming one of the premier areas of global development? Kale me now.) If you are a prospective Global Affairs major, maybe you should take this course (I have no idea whether or not it provides a leg up for applicants to the major), but if you are not, as I was not, then you should probably skip this course altogether and opt for more specified classes in areas that interest you.",
    "I would recommend this course for the exposure to subject matter experts.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was a good survey into the field of global affairs, and touched on a large variety of topics. Overall, the lectures were interesting and the readings were as well.",
    "Absolutely recommend. This course is unique in that it provides anparalleled access to a diverse crowd of expert presenters. Always very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this to a student only if they want a broad view of the global affairs major. Otherwise, I would suggest taking a seminar or a more focused course.",
    "Definitely! It is useful and extremely important for all students to get a basic understanding of the world.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I developed a much more thorough knowledge of what is happening in the world around me and why things are as they are. For example, I gained a completely new knowledge and understanding of the Iraq War.",
    "Yes and no. I am grateful for the information I received on the Middle East, but I probably would have been happier in a class entirely devoted to that. As a general, beginners Global Affairs class, I don't know if this would be my first recommendation for everyone (mostly because this class requires a significant devotion to either security or development). I enjoyed the class when it was interesting, but that interest level fluctuated too much for me to outright recommend this class."
