The slew of TA's did nothing to offer clarity, even when approached. The instructor literally send us a follow-up memo saying that everyone in the class did the assignment wrong. Perhaps he should re-think the way he presents assignments.",
    "Incorporation of non-architecture students into the assignments. They were so drawing\/technically specific that there was little forestry students could do to really contribute.",
