    "I developed a deeper understanding of displacement and power relations ubiquitous in Asian global cities.",
    "I learnt a great deal about intellectual curiosity and the importance of interdisciplinary study in this course. Not being a social science major, I was initially hesitant to take this course, but am now very much pleased that I did. Professor Siu and Professor Kelly were quick in establishing the premise of the class, and over the rest of the semester, I found myself surprised, humbled and inspired by the breadth of material that we covered. At times, I felt that I was in over my head and knowing next to nothing about what we were discussing, but it was extremely satisfying to find those moments of cogency where I could relate our readings to my larger academic interests."

    "I high recommend this course to fellow anthropology majors. I also think any student interested in social science should take it, because it provides a great theoretical basis for one's comprehension of the world.",
    "Yes! Do take this course if you want insight to a drastically different world-view that will most definitely challenge your perception of globalization and modernity. You may find yourself questioning it, maybe even disagreeing with it at times, but the subjects explored in class are fascinating and the evidence presented, compelling."
