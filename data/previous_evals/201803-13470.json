    "Learned multivariable calculus concepts",
    "This was a fantastic and challenging course that taught me multivariable calculus and the way of thinking\/approaching this subject\/these problems.",
    "i gained a comprehensive understanding of multidimensional calculus.",
    "I learned to a new form of calculus very different from calculus I learned form high school",
    "I learned some topics in multivariable calculus. Pretty straightforward.",
    "I learned not only multivariable calculus and the theorems of the course, but more importantly how to think critically and approach problems from different angles.",
    "Gained a higher understanding of multivariable calculus.",
    "Learned the basics of multivariable calculus and various integrals.",
    "An understanding of multivariable calculus - a more developed ability to integrate",
    "I took multivariable calculus in high school, but this course gave me a much deeper understanding of the concepts than my prior class.",
    "Knowledge of multi-var calculus",
    "This class, as its name suggests, is primarily designed to teach students how to do multivariable calculus. It also helps students to think much more deeply about math, how to derive formulas, and how to solve mathematical problems.",
    "Though I had already taken multivariable calculus in high school, I developed a much more solid understanding of the material this time. This was definitely an advantage, as I didn't have to struggle with the conceptual side as much.",
    "We learned multivariable calculus... which is good because that is what the course is called",
    "Not much",
    "A deeper understanding of advanced mathematics, and how previous classes of calculus relate to this one.",
    "I developed a lot of insight into how to approach understanding abstract mathematical concepts in both a geometrical and algebraic format. Tying the various concepts of the course cohesively is difficult, but I felt Sudesh really helped show how all the various subjects intertwined and informed each other.",
    "I was able to learn the mechanical aspects of calculation, methods of dealing with multiple variables, and the mathematical underpinnings of physics.",
    "Basic multi variable calculus",
    "Developed the ability to geometrically picture, describe, and interact with 3D shapes. Built on concepts learned from Calc BC in order to perform integral functions in higher order dimensions.",
    "The class teaches pretty standard multi-variable calculus.",
    "I learned that if one falls behind in a college math course, it is almost impossible to catch up again.",
    "Differential and integral calculus of multiple variables. (Basically, it's calculus with vectors. I'd imagine it would be particularly useful for physics students.) In terms of skills, the class feels like a very fast high school calculus course; it's not proof-based and it doesn't involve any unusual mathematical reasoning, so it's a good choice for a first-year.",
    "How to visualize 3D objects, understanding geometric interpretation of different integrals, calculating different integrals and multivariable problems",
    "It was a comprehensive introduction to multivariable calculus. The only topic not covered that I know of was the Jacobian.",
    "I gained far more confidence in my ability to solve hard problems by taking this class. I learned so much more than the time I took Multivariable Calculus in high school, and I walked out feeling much better about potentially taking more math classes in the future.",
    "Beyond the obvious computational skills for various types of integrals and derivatives, I learned why theorems like Green's, Stokes', Divergence, and the FTLI worked and how they fit together. I also improved my 3D visualization greatly."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "My one complaint is that a lot of the pset problems have unnecessarily complicated solutions to solve out that take a lot of time to work through, but they dont really contribute to your understanding of the material at all.",
    "It was a very well structured class,",
    "The course has a large wealth of resources such as practice problems that made it feel very fair.",
    "Some of the lectures in the beginning were a little slow. But I think it was pretty good.",
    "The strength of this course was Sudesh. He ensured that his students learned the theorems through lecture and group work while also very clearly explaining the mathematical proofs behind the concepts. Sudesh brought a wonderful sense of humor, kindness, and clarity of explanation that made Math 120 an amazing experience. It is certainly a tough course but a fair one too. Whether through office hours or practice problems, Sudesh gave his students every opportunity to succeed in the course. The all-or-no credit questions on exams can be particularly challenging for many students, and if these questions were to continue in the future, it would be helpful to have some more practice with True-False questions in class.",
    "Too much material",
    "Well taught and decently applied. PSETs were accurate to the difficulty of the tests and the preparation for the tests, especially sample exams, was well done.",
    "Strengths - teaching Weakness - not as engaging as it could be",
    "I enjoyed how the course covered the theory behind the applications of math we were learning. Additionally, I felt that my professor made a genuine effort to connect the concepts we were learning to one another to help us make sense of it all.",
    "It's amazing",
    "The course is very interesting but completely dependent on the professor as to how students receive the material. I think that as a whole, the pace of the class is very manageable and the assignments are much shorter than other classes. It is very well organized and several review assignments\/opportunities are provided for every exam.",
    "Weaknesses: they try to grade to a curve, so they take off huge deductions. A complaint in general is that there's a huge diversity of skill levels entering the course, from students challenging themselves to ones who are just right for the course and others who have taken it before. I received -18 points on a 20 pt question on a midterm because I made a stupid mistake early on, despite showing other work that demonstrated my understanding of the concept and I would have gotten the answer otherwise. However, they provide a LOT of resources and review sessions to give you as much practice as possible before the midterms and finals (the final is worth 40-50% of your grade). I wish this course was broken up like the calculus classes are, geared to be more applicable towards specific fields and adjusted the grading somewhat.",
    "Not taught well extremely hard",
    "A strength is that it is taught in the most efficient way possible. A weakness is that there should be just a tad bit more time (1-2 weeks) for this course.",
    "I think the strength of this course is the applicable material, approachable workload, and enormous amounts of teaching resources (Office hours, review sessions, review packets, Ximera) that give so much help to students. I think the weaknesses of this course mainly stem from the fact that so many students take it. I was fortunate to have Sudesh (who I think is a fantastic professor), but from what it sounded like many of the other TA's were not nearly as engaging and clear as Sudesh. I think this the main weakness of the course, that there is a lot of variation in the Math 120 \"experience\" depending on what teacher you have. Of course, I should note that given all the tools Sudesh gave to all Math 120 students, it seems a little ridiculous to argue that the an uninterested and\/or unclear TA makes 120 a bad or poorly constructed course. There are literally hundreds of tutorial videos on every unit that walk through various problems and explanations. The resources are there for any student who places into Math 120 to do well.",
    "A potential area of weakness of this course is that it might be difficult for students to participate in class, particularly given its size and nature of materials covered. A strength of this course is that its structure enables students to go through a lot of content in a relatively short timespan.",
    "No weaknesses. Strengths are the strong teacher and interesting material.",
    "Math 120 was a fantastic experience because of Professor Kalyanswamy. Throughout the year, I felt that I was supported in my learning through office hours, review sessions, and availability through e-mail. He gave a lot of opportunities for students to ask questions and clarify lapses in knowledge. Also, Sudesh's class organization is honestly superb. Outside of being a great lecturer, he openly welcomes questions and is willing to clarify any uncertainty. The lecture notes that he provides also structures the topics being presented; if we ever feel lost, we can always refer back to the materials provided. An undervalued part of his classes are the group works that we do in class. While part of lecture is Sudesh speaking at us, we also have the chance to apply the knowledge we learned during group work. I think working in a group, as well as just doing problems during lecture, increases retention and understanding of a topic. We can always make mistakes outside of class and we will not know how to solve the issues, but making mistakes in class allows any obscurity to be corrected immediately. The only weakness of this course was the first 1-2 weeks of lecture. For a student who has never seen multivariable before and was not used to the pacing of Yale classes, learning during math lectures and catching up was a struggle. It was hard to shift my brain to think in 3D and follow along because I was always a step behind during lecture. However, once I got into the hang of things, the class was amazing.",
    "Strengths: the course is fairly comprehensive without delving into too many thorny and conceptually uninteresting questions, homework is helpful and not too long. Weaknesses: It is mostly focused on teaching techniques so unless you are planning to use this math elsewhere, its not an exciting class.",
    "The pace is far too fast to cover all of the content successfully, and there is too much content that must be memorized in the time allotted. There is not time in the course to process information learned before moving to something else that also can't be fully processed. This course is more about rapid memorization than deep learning, and I found it deeply traumatizing.",
    "It's a good bridge between high school math and college math (as far as I can tell). On the other hand, there's no getting around the bulk of the content, and the course feels pretty packed from day one.",
    "Professor Sudesh was superb in delivering the course. His lecture notes were excellent and concise, and he delivered the lectures in an engaging and systematic manner. He consistently provided analogies to aid understanding of concepts which helped me remember things much more easily. He is approachable and friendly, always patient in responding to students' questions. There were more than enough practice problems, many of which set by Sudesh, to practice for the exams. Very very well-structured course, delivered by a committed professor who engaged students well. This results in a very engaging experience for an arguably dreaded topic! No weaknesses!",
    "This course is particularly challenging due to the amount of content it covers in one semester. This is augmented by the fact that many students in the class are first years and are not yet accustomed to the pace of semester-long courses.",
    "Strengths: Sudesh is an amazing teacher. If you are unable to understand a concept, he will break it down to its bare bones and go from ground up. If you have the opportunity to take the class with him, even if you don't think you're good at math- DO IT.",
    "Strengths: The professor, Sudesh. Weaknesses: Inconsistency between sections. Going to review sessions led by other instructors made it clear to me that if I had been placed in a different section I likely would have had a much different and more negative experience with the course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Definitely be prepared to work hard and put in the time, especially around exams, but it will definitely pay off. Dont be scared off from this class by other people! Its really very doable if you go to class, work hard on the psets, go to review\/office hours, and study hard for the exams.",
    "Yes, this class will give you a great understanding of multivariable calculus.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student",
    "The course was extremely fun and engaging throughout. But without a doubt, this is instructor dependant. I had Sudesh and he made the course as easy as it could be through his great teaching and resources. Unless you can get a section with him, the course may prove to be much less enjoyable and more difficult.",
    "Only if they have the teacher I got. Because unless a student actually likes math, it would be very hard to be motivated to do well in Math 120.",
    "I would 110% recommend this course to another student. It was the first time in my life that I have truly loved taking a math course. I enjoyed listening to every lecture, and the interactive class environment facilitated deep learning and understanding.",
    "Yes, it is a good course that gives you an idea of whether you want to pursue math.",
    "Yes. If they are interested in math and already havethe work ethic to do well",
    "Yes if they are interested in advanced science or math, or like abstraction in math.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Yes - the material is incredibly interesting and applicable to many things. By the end of the semester, you definitely think differently about math.",
    "Unless this class is necessary as a prerequisite, consider taking another class (or even math 151). Or make sure you get a professor teaching it, instead of a grad student. Sudesh Kalyanswamy was a great professor I'd say, dedicated to teaching the material if not, maybe, to getting to know you. He's funny and kind of dad-like. He would make Star Wars analogies when he could.",
    "No",
    "It depends on what you are going to do with it. Some students may have it as a requirement, and some may just want to continue from Calc 2. Shop the class, get a feel for it. If you seem that it's too much already, don't take it because it only gets harder. Sudesh was terrific; his packets organize the material for his students.",
    "I would, if the student approaches the course with the correct mindset. If the student is interested in Math and apply themselves in class (or online resources if the classes aren't well-taught) I would absolutely recommend this course. There is a lot to be gained from Math 120, and I think the topics are quite neat.",
    "It provides a good foundation for higher level STEM classes, so I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes. Great class and amazing teacher.",
    "If you're taking Math 120 with Sudesh, then it is a definite yes! There are rumors out there that 120 is a horrible class and everyone struggles to understand. Through the semester, there were one or two times where I felt those sentiments--it was only due to the pacing of college courses that I was not used to yet. It might be tough the first week if you haven't taken a course at Yale before. On the other hand, Sudesh is such a supportive professor that there will definitely be opportunities to clear any lapse in knowledge if it comes to it. I cannot speak on experiences with any other professor for 120.",
    "I would recommend this class to a STEM student who is not looking for a proof-based multivariable class. I feel that I really learned the material and I actually ended up enjoying the class more than I though I would. If you are a humanities student though, it might not be as valuable. Unless you just really want to know multi.",
    "Sudesh helped me turn around my progress through the course immensely. He is incredibly helpful and genuinely cares about facilitating student learning in a course that is not conducive to learning. If this course can be at all avoided, I'd strongly recommend not taking it. The pace of the course moves traumatically quickly.",
    "Take it and get it over with if you need to or are interested in higher-level math. If you just need the distributional credit, I'd recommend looking somewhere else; it's probably too much work for that.",
    "Yes! Especially by Sudesh. Great professor, concise notes, well-structured.",
    "Yes, but its challenging to get a strong grasp of multi without doing more practice problems in my opinion (so just the required homework isnt enough to do well).",
    "I would recommend the class to another student because it teaches you to apply your calculus knowledge to higher dimensions.",
    "Yes, especially if you have Sudesh Kalyanswamy as your instructor.",
    "Yes- before I took this class, I thought I was terrible at math and was far too scared to approach potentially taking higher level classes. This class restored my faith.",
    "I would recommend it because it's a gateway course to higher level math, economics, and statistics. To a student placed by the lottery in Sudesh's section, I would recommend it highly because he injects a sense of humor into class and is always willing to provide extra time and resources to ensure our success."
