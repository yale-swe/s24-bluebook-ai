    "You'll have about 30 minutes to an hour of homework every night, but it's definitely rewarding. I felt like I made the transition from kind of speaking Spanish to being fluent this year.",
    "I kinda took it to fulfill requirements, kinda took it because I like languages... at this point of learning spanish is was a good way to round out my knowledge of it.",
    "Continuation of concepts learned in Spanish 3",
    "A work-intensive course that will equip a student with much more confidence in Spanish. I entered the course feeling uncomfortable about speaking Spanish. By the oral final at the end, I felt confident about my capacity to carry on a conversation.",
    "Span 140 emphasizes conversational speaking and was incredibly beneficial in my development towards fluency.",
    "Spanish 140 was an excellent class! We reviewed a lot of grammar, as well as learned a number of new, more complex tenses. However, we also read a lot of interesting readings, some fiction some nonfiction, which made the class very interesting as each day was something new. In addition there were a number of different presentations which made definitely improved my speaking abilities. I really liked Spanish 140 and it truly helped me improve my reading, speaking and writing abilities."
