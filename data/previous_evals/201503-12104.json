    "I wasn't expecting to take German at all this semester but I'm so glad I took Intensive German. Herr Stern is retiring after this year, so unfortunately, Intensive German will just not be the same. This course was definitely taught in a different manner than most current language courses. The textbook is heavily grammar based and was published in 1989. However, this was definitely a pro of the course. While we didn't learn an extensive amount of vocabulary, that's definitely the easy stuff to learn in any language. The solid foundation of proper German grammar we've laid this semester is something I'll owe Herr Stern for the rest of my life. For everyone who might take this in the future without Herr Stern, just remember, dative plural = -n.",
    "A not insignificant amount of work, but consistent and manageable. Great learning opportunity, and a refreshing break from other courses.",
    "Sadly, this is Herr Stern's last term teaching this course, so any review that I could provide would not be particularly helpful to another student. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "It's a lot of work. Very grammar heavy. If you are looking for conversational German this might not be the best option. Otherwise Herr Stern knows what he's teaching and the class is fairly enjoyable if you put the right amount of effort and time to it. One advice that Herr Stern always gives, \"Treat the class like two course credits and not one big fat course.\" If you manage to look at the course with this perspective you should be fine. If not, things might be a bit rough here and there but you will survive. i definitely had some rough weeks. And to be honest most people do treat it like a big fat course and we survive.",
    "In German 125, you learn German, you do it at a fast pace, and you enjoy it. It is a fair amount of work, but nothing too difficult, and you can easily see your progress. Overall, it is an very fun, rewarding experience. However, it is really defined by Professor Stern and his approach, so without him, it will be totally different. He is truly an incredible professor."
