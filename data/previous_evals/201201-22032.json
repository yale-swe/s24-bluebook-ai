    "A mixed bag overall. The professor is a great guy, the lectures were average, the homework was surprisingly difficult, and the sections were quite good.",
    "BENG 100 provides an excellent basis for those hoping to major in BME but also a non-specific enough scientific presentation for those looking to take the class as a non-science major looking for a science class without pre-reqs. Professor Saltzman is great at addressing both types of learners and no matter what, the class is incredibly interesting and I'd recommend it to everyone.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! THIS CLASS IS A MUST TAKE! I absolutely enjoyed this course, it was my favorite class this semester. The format of the class is perfect, a midterm, a research paper, and problem sets. The no final plus really allows you todelve into your paper and really explore your friends topics as well. The problem sets are pleasant, although at times challenging. I had to go see the TA in order to complete most of them, but I felt like I learned so much! THIS IS A MUST TAKE AT YALE FOR THOSE WHO AREN'T VERY SCIENCE DRIVEN\u0096\u0096or to the science driven who want to learn more about this wonderful field!",
    "This course presents an overview of biomedical engineering. The course does not involve too much work, but might be very frustrating to someone who does not have some basic knowledge of biology. Thus, I would definitely recommend this class for freshmen interested in sciences or non-science majors who already know elementary principles of genetics.",
    "This is a good introduction to the field of biomedical engineering, or a good science credit for an upperclassmen. Be warned, though--it's not a gut class. There's real science involved, which can be a nice change but also makes it more difficult. The problem sets can be annoyingly vague and unrelated to lectures, but there's also no final exam, just a paper.",
    "Great class! I would definitely recommend it. Perfect if you are looking to see whether you're interested in biomedical engineering, or just have an interest in medicine in general.",
    "This is a really nice class for both majors and non-majors. It doesn't have a final, and is very relaxed, but it's also engaging and interesting. There is a good amount of work (ie not that much, but what there is is thought provoking).",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in the material, whether or not they plan on majoring in BME. It's not too challenging but gives you access to experienced biomedical engineers and opens up your knowledge of the field.",
    "Read the book, attend lecture, and make an effort to understand what is going on. If you do these things, the class will be good to you.",
    "Take it as a freshman if you're interested in BME - not worth it if you're going for a Sc credit. In general, though, the course was interesting and not too much work. Saltzman is great.",
    "This is actually a fun class. The sections are low key and you get to work with some cool technology. As a non-science major, I found this class challenging at times, but for the most part it was very accessible. Professor Saltzman is the man.",
    "A pretty decent survey course for underclassmen interested in BME or upperclassmen who need a science credit. Not a ton of work either: one midterm, weekly problem sets, and a final paper. That being said, the problem sets are pretty frustrating because they are completely unrelated to what you talk about in lecture.",
    "Whether you are a science major or a non-science major you can gain tremendously from this class. Professor Saltzman knows how and does cater to everyone in the class.",
    "This is a fun class, with not a lot of work. It's interesting and easy up until the final paper, which can be about almost anything you would choose to write about.",
    "Excellent intro course to BME. Prof Saltzman is a big deal. Sections are labs (without lab reports) that cover cool things like ultrasound\/ MRI machines and p-sets are very manageable. Interesting guest lecturers. Final paper is on a topic of your choosing and Prof Saltzman gives great feedback and help along the way. Since lectures cover almost only the interesting stuff from his book, you are more or less expected to cover the boring\/dense BME knowledge on your own, which can be a struggle before the midterm - but that is pretty much the only weakness of the course I can think of. Overall very enjoyable. Great option for non science majors who want to fulfill the Sc req and actually learn interesting things about BME.",
    "I might not suggest this class to another person based only on the assignments. They are not especially difficult, but sometimes the class has not been prepared to answer the questions. And this can be especially terrifying on the day of the midterm.",
    "It's a great survey course for anyone unsure of his or her interest in BME or anyone who just wants a basic understanding of the science behind our advancements in medical technology. Professor Saltzman is really enthusiastic about the class, and super supportive. Assignments will take some work since many of the problems have nothing to do with the lectures, but otherwise it's a fairly low-pressure class."
