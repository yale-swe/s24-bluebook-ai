    "You sit in a seminar room, facing the ex-President of Mexico. He calls one of you up to the podium. You give a presentation. He critiques a few parts, tests you to make sure you actually understood the paper you presented. Most likely, your presentation is really just a summary of the paper because you don't have any outside information to bring in as a critique. You sit down. Repeat.",
    "Great class. It's awesome to take a class with Zedillo. The amount of reading is insane, but it is interesting. The discussions are good and youleave the class feeling like you konw a lot more about globalization.",
    "The material is good and Zedillo is very interesting. However, I never felt like it all came together into a class. Everyone in the class just talks to say something, and you end up sitting here for two hours just listening to that.",
    "Zedillo clearly is not used to teaching undergrads and the workload is nothing short of excessive. Be prepared to receive virtually no concrete guidelines on the midterm and final paper, and to receive virtually no feedback throughout the term. Take this class Cr\/D if you can, but ultimately I think it's worth taking--Zedillo is a great figure to learn from."
