    "A fascinating survey of current topics in education, their real-life effects on American children, and why we should care. Each week you'll study a different topic, its theoretical background, and the empirical evidence as to whether or not that topic really works. The topics are all relevant and vary widely, from No Child Left Behind to privatization of education to merit pay systems and onward. There's also a few weeks spent on empiricism, teaching you to properly interpret study results.It's a fantastic class with a moderate workload. There are weeks with a LOT of reading, but the written assignments (a three-page paper, a five-page proposal, a three-page memo, and an accompanying eight-page paper) aren't too bad and in some cases are even - gasp! - kind of fun. Ben and Matt were fantastic teachers and knew what they were talking about, and I'm only sorry Ben won't be around next year so they can tag-team it again.If this is offered a second time, I absolutely recommend it if you have any interest in education at all. It was one of the most interesting and rewarding classes I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "Absolutely. This class has nothing to do with my major, but covers a topic absolutely essential to today's society. Matt and Ben did an excellent job showing us the relevance of this class, and motivated us to contribute to education reform in our own small ways.",
    "Only take this course if you don't know anything about education.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in education. I don't think you should take this class just for fun if you have no other reason because a lot of the people in it are those who are pursuing a career in education.",
    "I would strongly recommend taking this class if you are interested in education policy. Some of the stuff is a bit basic if you have background in education policy, so make sure you look at the syllabus to see that it won't be too repetitive. The readings were generally very interesting. If this class is taught again it will have at least one different instructor (this year it had Ben Lindy and Matt Matera) so itmay be very different. The best thing about the class was the professors; they cared about the class and the students more than the vast majority of Yale professors I have encountered.",
    "Absolutely! This class was one of my favorite classes at Yale. It was really interesting and engaging. I had no background in the education debate and found it very accessible. The class did a good job combining academic research and personal stories.",
    "Great survey course of current issues in education reform. Excellent structure and framework throughout the course. Definitely good to take if interested in education reform but not very informed about it.",
    "Examination of the factors affecting America's educational system.",
    "Excellent course that focuses on understanding education through empirical studies. A fair amount of work but work that is always useful in understanding the material.",
    "I enjoyed this class, but for odd reasons. First of all, Ben and Matt are FANTASTIC. The class itself was a bit more lackluster, perhaps because it was taught sort of like a high school class. But the readings were great. Overall, I guess I'd say you should take it if you care about ed policy, but NOT if you've taken other classes on the subject (particularly Prof. Starr's class). The assignments were cool in theory, but graded by rubric (pay VERY close attention to the rubric) and the project proposal was a hassle.",
    "If a similar course is offered, or if a course is taught by Matt or Ben in future, I highly recommend it. The American Education crisis is obviously a complex and controversial issue in the US, but you likely will not get a true sense of all of the various compounding factors to the issue until you take a course like this. The readings were fascinating and discussions were riveting.If Ben and Matt teach courses in the future (most likely Matt, since Ben is graduating) definitely consider taking the course. Matt is such a thoughtful and brilliant instructor with a sense ofhumor a great ability to give counter arguments and push you on your positions on various issues.",
    "If the student is strongly interested in education policy and comes into the class with somewhat of a background, I would recommend this class. For those who don't want to bother with all the empirical details or have no particular interest in the subject matter, I'm not sure if the course is captivating enough on its own.",
    "This class is probably the best intro you could ask for in terms of education issues. You will learn about basic lawsuits and policy reports that really matter."
