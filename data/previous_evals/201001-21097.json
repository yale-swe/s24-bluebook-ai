   "comments": [
    "It's an excellent intro to learning about cancer biology, and if you want to get an introduction to the subject and learn a lot about current topics in cancer research, it's a very good class. If someone was thinking of taking the class, I would probably say that they should, since I thought the class was useful.",
    "Yup. Its a good course and I have learned a lot that I will likely use in my research.",
    "Very good course for learning about cancer biology. Most of the time, very interesting lectures and the final paper is useful for learning more about a topic of interest. I would definitely recommend this class to someone interested in cancer biology.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, especially to those interested in cancer.",
    "Yes I would recommen this course because it is a great course to learn both basic and clinical research of cancer. In addition, recitation also helps keep up with current findings.",
    "I would summarize Path 650 as an overview of general cancer biology with a particular eye to educating PhD students on the diagnosis and drug treatment of cancer.",
    "The parts where you get to look at actual cancers extracted from people is cool, and also learning about the various types of cancer and what people are trying to do about it. However, most of the ideas expressed in the second half of the course will sound a lot like a rehash of already-presented ideas.",
    "Fairly narrow scope but an excellent course for those interested in cancer.",
    "A course designed to introduce the major principles involved in cancer research and how they are intertwined in day-to-day research. I would highly recommend the course since it was such a well-run and informative course.",
    "I would most definitely recommend the course to a fellow student, and have already done so. I feel the information covered in the class will significantly enhance my understanding of cancer and general molecular medicine.",
    "Overview of many cancer biology topics. Yes I would recommend the course to those interested in cancer bio.",
    "Yes i would recommend Path 650 to a student interested in cancer biology.",
    "Pathology 650 provides the opportunity for students to learn about both molecular mechanisms and general pathology of cancer. Early lectures include laboratory and histology components where the student has the opportunity to assess and even handle preserved cancer specimens from donors. Small group sessions also provide the opportunity of reading and presenting important and relevant journal articles in the field."

   "comments": [
    "Asit turns out, the class probably won't help my research much, since I don't do much cancer work. However I think the extra knowledge not only of cancer bio but also cell bio and related fields has really helped me expand my knowledge of biology in general and made it much easier for me to pick up new information in my field.",
    "I must admit that doing the research paper at the end of the course has made me understand a lot more about cancer.",
    "The course not only increases my interest in cancer rearch but also helped me decide which specific research I would become interest.",
    "Though I had studied some of the material previously, I still found the course very useful and learned many things that will help in future research and clinical work.",
    "This course greatly deepened my knowledge and contributed greatly to my research. I hope to incorporate a lot of ideas I learned in the course into my research. It also helped solidify my belief that cancer research is what I would like to make my career, at least to begin with.",
    "This course was somewhat of an \"elective\" course as it did not pertain exactly to my most current field of research. However, cancer biology is something that I am interested in and would like to pursue eventually. Thus, it was a beneficial course due to the subject matter and the recitation presentation helped me to develop my presentation and scientific journal reading\/analysis skills .",
    "This course has emphasized the importance and broad nature of cancer research, inspiring me to look into pursuing it further in my own research."
