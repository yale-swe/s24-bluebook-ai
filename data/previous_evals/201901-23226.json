    "This course gives a good intro to cryptography but provides more depth than the 200 level option. The course covers some number theory that can be hard to follow if you dont work a bit outside of class.",
    "Basic tenets of cryptography and commonly used cryptographic systems. Basic number theory necessary to understand some cryptography.",

    "The course covers a lot of material. Some of which seems irrelevant to the rest of the course. That being said, we covered a lot of interesting topics.",
    "Material presented in a clear manner. Class encouraged participation and engaging with material.",
    "The course covers interesting material, but the first few lectures covered a lot of common-sense material and I think could be replaced with more focus on the underlying math and protocols.",
    "The course was very interesting and the lectures tied in well with the assignments. Sometimes grading seemed a tad strict but other than that the course was one of my favourites I've taken at Yale!",
    "The class has good structure and the assignments are pretty interesting. I think lectures could be a little more engaging with examples. I would have likes some more high level context whenever talking about each subject rather than diving into details right away at times."

   "comments": [
    "Yes but know what you are getting in for. The material is very interesting but you will only enjoy this course and be successful if you actively engage with the material. If you disengage, lectures will drag and you will begin to fall behind. If you are willing to engage with the material, this is a great course.",
    "Good intro to cryptography course. Minimal number theory covered, so no previous experience required. No proofs, class is more focused on concepts and ideas than the underlying implementation details.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're ok with a course that moves at a relatively slow pace and doesn't require a lot of mathematical sophistication, but explores interesting concepts. Weekly problem sets that require some thought, but aren't hugely time-consuming.",
    "I would definitely recommend this. Professor Fischer is very passionate and knowledgeable about the topic. He is also very understanding and fair when assigning homework.",
    "If you find cryptography interesting, then I would take it. The lectures will be very boring if you don't find the material interesting to start with. It isn't a ton of work, but you will leave the class with a pretty solid introduction to cryptography. It does not require a lot of number theory, so you shouldn't shy away if you are trying to avoid math. It has 8 homework assignments and two exams. Professor Fischer is really nice, and he knows the field very well."
