    "The course was a great insight into development and evolution of feathers. For a student working on the evolution of birds from their dinosaur ancestors, it was definitively a great opportunity to expand my knowledge regarding the soft parts of these animals, generally not preserved in the fossil record, exception made for few sites in the World.",

   "comments": [
    "The course is definitively strong and broad in terms of topics covered in class.I would have liked to have a more practical perspective, maybe adding a couple of labs to see ontogenetic and developmental series of feathers in extant birds. Overall, an amazing seminar",
    "This course did a good job covering some of the major themes in feather biology. It also utilized and compared older and more recent literature, which provided a good historical context for discussions. The background information provided by the professor was also helpful, though at times too long. More group discussion would have been good."

    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. But given it's highly specific nature, I would only recommend it to someone with a deep interest in birds and feathers."
