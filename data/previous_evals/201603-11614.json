   "comments": [
    "I learned the basics of speaking Russian. I also experienced exposure to some Russian culture.",
    "I developed lots of skills and have acquired a basic understanding of Russian.",
    "I learned how to read Cyrillic script, introductory vocabulary and grammar, and how to talk about myself in the Russian language. I also learned some really fun cultural nuances of the Russian language and culture thanks to Professor Titus!",
    "I learned a lot of the elementary vocabulary and grammar skills for Russian.",
    "Russian L1 was honestly probably the most fun class I have taken at Yale. I looked forwarded to showing up every morning at 9:25. I feel like we learned a lot in just one semester, as we already know four of the five cases, the past, present, and future for a number of verbs, the meaning of 'aspect,' and a great deal of vocabulary.",
    "A introductory framework for learning the Russian language as well as fundamental reading, writing, and speaking skills.",
    "I learned so much! It's an intro language course, so you learn what you expect (and more): foods, numbers, colors, clothing, basic conversation starters. But also so much grammar! Present and past tense along with several other cases (there are 6 cases in Russian and I think we learned 4 or 5 of them in this first semester). Perfective and imperfective verbs! I'd say it was more grammar heavy than vocab heavy, but I'm assuming we will learn more vocab in the future.",
    "I learned how to form basic sentences in Russian. I learned a bit about Russian culture.",
    "Inevitably, we learned a huge amount as beginning students in Russian. Vocabulary, grammar, and applicable Russian cultural topics were covered throughout the semester. No one could walk away from this course without feeling like they had gained a huge life skill in only the course of one semester."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is difficult because Russian is a difficult language but the teacher and TA do a lot to make it interesting and to help the students.",
    "The strengths were that the course was very organized and you knew what to expect.",
    "I appreciated how the course was very conversation based, and I liked the layout with homework due every day as a refresher of material learned in class. I thought a major strength of the class was how we spent class time working through oral and written exercises and how memorization of basic things like vocab lists was expected to be completed on one's own time.",
    "The book is very strong. I don't like that we take the exams online.",
    "I do not have any weaknesses for this course. I loved that we had Professor Titus three times a week and Ms. Corke two times a week, as this gave us the chance to learn from a native speaker as well as from an American who learned Russian. I loved the nightly homework that never took to long and kept us practicing every day. I loved the listening, speaking, as well as writing components of the course. In addition, I liked how fun Professor Titus made learning a language.",
    "The fact that this course meets everyday and is taught in a seminar style is a huge help. The tremendous outside resources that are provided by the instructors, tutors, and department are also a huge help. Encouraging involvement in such activities might be beneficial for many students. The review materials such as worksheets that are provided by the inductor are very helpful.",
    "Julia was great at teaching the grammar in a clear way. That said, she expected us to learn most of the vocabulary on our own, which resulted basically in us not learning that much vocab because it wasn't tested as much as grammar. However, I'm not too worried about that, because I know we'll learn more in the future. I think the biggest weakness of the course might be pronunciation. I felt like we really didn't spend much time on learning how to correctly pronounce words with a Russian accent. Many people had rather atrocious pronunciations. Overall, though, great language class. Also, I didn't appreciate that she didn't tell us we would be taught by a TA for 2\/5 days of the week until the LAST DAY of shopping period. How come this wasn't mentioned at the beginning? I ended up not minding it, but note to future students: Julia only teaches 3\/5 days of the week, and a TA for the other two!",
    "Strength: demanding in a way that makes you learn the material if engaged. Weakness: We didn't speak Russian nearly enough in class. Graded on things consonant assimilation and accents when we rarely reinforced these topics in class.",
    "The course followed the structure of the textbook and the syllabus. The consistency and reliability was very helpful. I particularly liked the professor's unique use of online quizzes and tests. I now am able to type in Russian very quickly and that is a skill that many professors forget is really important for learning any language in this decade. I have no suggestions for improvement. Maybe more sections could be offered because clearly it is a popular class to take at Yale."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend it because Russian is an interesting, fun, awesome, and useful language.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning the Russian language. Professor Titus is a wonderful instructor who makes class engaging and interesting, often offering cultural insights and personal experiences.",
    "Absolutely take this class! Julia Titus is amazing and it's a great language!",
    "If you are interested in learning Russian, I would definitely recommend this course to you! The classes are fun and engaging, the workload is manageable, and you truly feel like you are making real progress. Although it is an incredibly challenging language, after just one semester I feel like I have made a significant dent in it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, but with a disclaimer that it is very difficult. I enjoyed working with the instructors and students, but the material requires constant practice and drilling. With that in mind, it is a very rewarding class and I have enjoyed it very much.",
    "Yes! Languages in general are so much fun for me, and I kind of just took this as a fun class since I'd already done my language requirement. You learn about another culture, and it's a really great feeling to come away with a definitive skill that you can use. It is really well taught and definitely not easy but not too stressful the way they do the grading, which I really appreciate because it still forces you to learn a lot. Take it! However, I didn't appreciate that she didn't tell us we would be taught by a TA for 2\/5 days of the week until the LAST DAY of shopping period. How come this wasn't mentioned at the beginning? I ended up not minding it, but note to future students: Julia only teaches 3\/5 days of the week, and a TA for the other two!",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course. However, I hope that students can spend more time in class speaking and practicing accents and consonant assimilation and the like.",
    "Yes. I would warn students that any language study is very immersive and time consuming but that Prof. Titus is amazing at making it a fun experience -despite the intensity."
