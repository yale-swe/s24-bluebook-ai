   "comments": [
    "I would recommend ENGL 120 to another student. I think it is a great course for exploring writing other than strict academic essay writing while still improving your overall writing skills. The readings are interesting and relevant.",
    "I definitely recommend taking this class! Even if you've never had any experience in creative nonfiction writing, it is a really good introduction into the material and into getting comfortable with writing about yourself. Palmer connects with the class really positively, offers great feedback, and always makes sure that what is discussed in class about the readings is understood by everybody. The workload is definitely manageable. Readings vary in length and essays are due periodically but it feels rewarding and moves quickly if you enjoy the material!",
    "I would recommend English 120 for a student who has a lot of interesting experiences and someone who enjoys writing about such experiences (or ones that he or she is able to make up). I had a great time in the class because I was pretty good at writing non-fiction in an engaging way so if someone had the interest in taking a closer look at some of their experiences and writing about them, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "English 120 is a nice introduction to the modern essay, like not the literary\/historical analysis kind. It's fun for students who want to write fun, accessible prose and who'd rather do five essays interspersed throughout the term than a few big essays during midterms & finals. A student deciding whether to take this course should check out the reading list and the due dates, making sure the latter don't overlap ickily with his\/her other midterms and assignments.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 120 to any student in any discipline who would like to improve their skills as a writer. This class will leave you better than you came in.",
    "Without a doubt, English 120 was my favorite class that I have ever taken. The readings were interesting, the teacher was great, and I learned a lot. Regardless of major, it is an incredibly helpful class to take. Alternating between writing an essay and editing one every week can be time consuming, but it's worth the investment. I would highly recommend this class to everyone. A+",
    "This class was definitely a good introduction to personal and nonfiction writing. I would suggest this class to students who are interested in creative nonfiction, and who are willing to have their writing critiqued.",
    "Yes. It is a great course that teaches you how to express yourself and how to read others' essays effectively. Prof. Rampell is a great instructor. His comments are very helpful and he makes very detailed in-line comments."
