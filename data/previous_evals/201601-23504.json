   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed the material and the topics we went over. I feel like I got a great deal out of the course despite the instructor. Definitely helps with reading and understanding different types of studies.",
    "The course provides a nice follow-up to Epidemiology 1 (taught in the fall). I feel like I have a better understanding of how to read\/dissect scientific articles as well as of different epidemiological principles. I overall enjoyed the course, however sometimes the lectures were lengthy and presented lots of materials at once. It would have been easier to follow the course, if there was less material or if it was presented more concisely.",
    "Strengths: Fatma really does want us to learn and puts a lot of obvious effort into the class. She also handled what I would consider to be a very disrespectful class of students with a lot of elegance and class (some students complained to the dean about her class without even talking to her first and raising concerns with her, and continued to complain about every aspect of the class the entire semester, and never thanked her for all the ways she really tried to cater the class to some really destructive criticism) Weaknesses: None. She is a great professor. I think Epi II is less straight-forward than Epi I and just requires more personal investment. Fatma cant do that for us, but she did everything she could to be accessible, make exams low stress by providing a lot of time to do them, and provide support through office hours and study materials. Honestly, even though students conveyed the idea that the class is rather impossible to a lot of people on campus I dont think the evidence supports those claims. The average on the first midterm was a B and the second midterm was an A, so clearly Fatma is getting things across to the class on average.",
    "It is a fantastic advanced-epi class. Discussions allow students to make sure they understand all the notions from lectures. Homeworks are too long and given too late though.",
    "A lot of information. The slides could have been summarized better. I do believe that I learned something, though.",
    "Change a instructor, please.",
    "Extremely useful core class",
    "I feel MUCH more confident about my ability to critically analyze and interpret epidemiological studies and findings. Furthermore, this course gave me a very solid understanding of the practical application of topics like confounding, multivariable analysis, power calculations, study design, etc. This course will also make you notably more confident in your ability to read and decipher the literature in a methodical way.",
    "I thought this course was pretty bad. While the subject matter was clearly important, it was conveyed in such an unhelpful manner that it totally turned me off to epidemiology.",
    "This course provides students with the comprehensive to read, analyze, and critique articles and basic epi topics, but should be better integrated as courses with AAMIE and Biostats 2 regarding topics they all share to better coordinate teaching these to students overall. This course was very difficult this semester given teaching style as well as content. Probably hardest course and material I will take in my time at YSPH, definitely struggled with it.",
    "The required weekly homeworks that are pass not pass are excellent for pushing you to understand the material, but also not penalizing you for not understanding all the concepts immediately. The course material is difficult and goes pretty fast. I would recommend dispersing a little bit more of the material from the beginning of the second semester to the end of the first semester, and moving a few of the concepts from Exam 3 to be in included in Exam 2. Lastly the piece on Molecular Epi has references a lot of expected base biology knowledge, for those without a biology background i would encourage a little more of a biology primer to catch up those students.",
    "TA is very good and I learnt most of the things from TA but not from regular classes.",
    "Nice balance between lectures and practice.",
    "The content is important but the professor was the major weakness.",
    "Too much material attempted to be covered with the expectation we are to master all of it. With the huge amount of topics covered, they are \"taught\" so quickly, which is not a good approach. I would focus on a smaller number of topics and go in-depth, rather than trying to cover every epidemiological topic, technique, and skill. There is very little engagement in the classroom setting. There will be 133 slides and the Prof will just read off them, with occasional clicker questions to engage the class. I felt like most of my learning occurred independently from the classroom.",
    "I feel like I learned a ton in this class and I understand that many of the concepts are extremely hard to teach. I appreciated the class slides because they helped me review all the concepts out of class.",
    "This class gave me a very good foundation for future epi classwork and research",
    "I really enjoyed this class. The material is very interesting and greatly important for any MPH student. Strengths: Material, homeworks, sections Weaknesses: Use of microphone in class",
    "It is very thorough and comprehensive.",
    "The course got off to a rough start a bit, and I think the students were too quick to harshly criticize Dr. Shebl for her teaching style. Dr. Shebl has a wealth of knowledge, and Epi II is the course that packed in the most amount of knowledge into the 12 week semester. This class has provided me the skills to critically evaluate the current literature, and understand the best practices when it will come my time to conduct research.",
    "Great material, everyone in YSPH in epidemiology (CDE and EMD) should be required to take this course. However, the material in this course and Biostatistics and AAMIE should be discussed amongst the instructors and the curriculum should be reformatted because it felt like we were wasting a class because there was so much overlap. However over all this class was still very difficult. Why is there so much overlap and we still find it hard?? Our foundation was not built right.",
    "This is one of the two worst courses I have taken at Yale. It is remarkable to see a course of such poor quality at YSPH. Strengths of the course are that it really guides students to learn how to critically read the literature. Its weaknesses are that that the lectures are pointless. The slides made no sense. I would recommend completely remaking the slides to be much more engaging and interactive. I would also recommend a different instructor.",
    "Strengths: you learn important skills to excel as an epidemiologist; homework really helps solidify class material; good lecture slides Weaknesses: not enough actual examples to convey concepts. Lectures hard to follow in class",
    "The course seemed like it aimed to be challenging for the sake of being challenging rather than because the material itself was very difficult. The teacher this year was also new, so there were many kinks in that respect as well. The sections seemed pointless because we went in a circle and went over the answer to the homework (which could simply be posted online) instead of going through the concepts with which we had difficulties.",
    "The course was an excellent continuation to Epi I. Overall, the assignments were very long and difficult, however, the tests were fair.",
    "Strengths- the powerpoints are very useful (if a bit long), and my TA was very helpful at breaking everything down to make it easier to understand. Areas for improvement- I feel like the instructor tried very hard to cram absolutely everything into classes, which made it difficult to follow along and stay engaged. It might be more helpful to pick several key points that she think would be beneficial to go over whole-group, and leave the extensive examples to homework reading (and maybe test us on it to hold us accountable to reading it).",
    "Very helpful in interpreting epidemiological studies and analysis methods.",
    "Very difficult and frustrating but I learned so so much in this course and am glad I took it.",
    "This class was objectively terrible. Professor Shebl was a useless instructor and never changed her teaching style throughout the course despite the fact that every student was struggling and had indicated to her and others that the course was awful. The exams were fair, although the final was much more difficult than anticipated. The homeworks were always too long and the questions were far too vague.",
    "Although I did not find the lectures from this course particularly helpful, I did learn a lot from the course itself. After taking Epi I and II, I feel like I have a strong foundation in epidemiology.",
    "The organization of this course needs to be entirely re-vamped and the workload re-assessed to focus on the most important take-home knowledge. Too much material was fit in to a single term, not all of which was a mandatory topic for all students to cover (e.g. genetics- there is a course specifically dedicated to this for interested students). As a subsequent course to Epi 1, the structure should remain more similar to Epi 1 for the sake of continuity.",
    "Challenging but one of the most rewarding classes I have taken at Yale. The material itself was not easy, but necessary to shape our public health practice. I believe all MPH students should be required to take it, as it is that important for our work, especially when it comes to reading scientific literature in public health."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl wasn't very clear on almost all of the topics. She was always rushing in class, skipping over slides and stuff. The worst was when a student would ask for clarification, she would just repeat the same thing over louder and louder until the student just gave up asking. She's a bit mean at times too, and her comments regarding tests and student progress aren't very encouraging. I believe she really tried her best but I don't know that teaching an introductory course is her thing. She's not very good at breaking down points and her lecture slides felt disjointed for some reason. The slides definitely got better as the semester progressed but something was off. She also likes to sit in on discussion sessions and interrupt, call out students for their questions etc. Very intimidating...",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0I really enjoyed having Fatma Shebl as a professor. She is very concerned about students' ability to learn in her class and she seems to go above and beyond the role of other professors at YSPH. Although I ultimately enjoyed her class, sometimes it was difficult to follow along. This may have been due to the complexity of the topics, however I feel like the material could have been presented a little more clearly. I think this will develop as Professor Shebl continues to teach this course. It is very apparent that she wants the class to be successful.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Strengths: Fatma really does want us to learn and puts a lot of obvious effort into the class. She also handled what I would consider to be a very disrespectful class of students with a lot of elegance and class (some students complained to the dean about her class without even talking to her first and raising concerns with her, and continued to complain about every aspect of the class the entire semester, and never thanked her for all the ways she really tried to cater the class to some really destructive criticism) Weaknesses: None.

Honestly, even though students conveyed the idea that the class is rather impossible to a lot of people on campus I dont think the evidence supports those claims. The average on the first midterm was a B and the second midterm was an A, so clearly Fatma is getting things across to the class on average.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Professor Shebl knows how to conduct a lecture and have students understand the difficult concepts of epidemiology. I felt like it was easy to go talk to her and I personally really appreciated that she would come to discussion sections to make sure that the concepts were understood.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0There is not a doubt in my mind that Dr. Shebl's intentions are good, but the execution was poor. Dr. Shebl work run over the allotted time and had class start 40 minutes early on two different occasions (and then continued to run over the allotted time, regardless). This was not respectful to my time as a student. It became extremely difficult to balance other course work with the commitment this course demanded. After the first exam, Dr. Shebl gave out an evaluation where it was determined that her office hours did not accommodate the majority of students. However, she did not change her office hours until months later, but the point in which the majority of students were struggling and \"deep in the hole.\"",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Professor Shebl tried very hard to make it a good course. However, things didn't turn out for me and most of the student. It's nothing personal. But I can't stand a professor with strong accent. Every time I listen to her, after 10 mins I drift away. Well, that might be my personal factor. But she didn't finish the content in one lecture a single time. If the content really need more time to explain, maybe the course should have more lecture. Right now it's just a lot of self-study. Sometimes I didn't understand what the professor said, I asked her. She explained it in the exact same language. It didn't help.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0I thought that Professor Shebl performed well under the pressures of this course. She was not treated fairly at the beginning of the semester by the students, so she went out of her way to incorporate their comments into the structure of the course. The lectures erred on the side of long, which was great for the sake of clarity, but many people had other commitments after class, which made it difficult to stay after class most days.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Very knowledgable and willing to answer questions in class and in office hours. Overall, fantastic. My only complaint is that lectures frequently wen overtime, so a bit of trimming of material may be necessary.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0While I believe the professor had good intentions, the way she instructed absolutely did NOT work for me. Her slides were all text, which was not an effective way to display the information. She always rushed through the material, and overall did not seem very open to discussion. I think her teaching style has a lot of room for improvement. It felt like she was impatient with us when we were confused.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0One-on-one, Fatma seems kind and nice. Her persona as a lecturer in Winslow comes off as harsh to many, and very brute and strong, but this may be a cultural and communication barrier that other students perceive. Could improve her lecture style a bit - by incorporating more current and interesting research topics across spectrums of SBS, EMD, etc. Slide information could be better communicated and more succinct - I would suggest connecting with other professors such as Mayur who instructs AAMIE in a way that provides content in a more digestable way to students. It's a lot of information, but setting expectations at the beginning of the semester for student roles (reading lectures before, doing readings, etc) and expectations before the start of the semester could be helpful.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Fatma genuinely cares about her students and our learning. The course is jampacked with content and it requires being very attentive to everything she says in order to follow along. She is always open to answering questions even in the middle of lecture to make sure we understand the concept. The fact that she goes over so much material makes it difficult for her to stick to the time requirement. But after her class I can confidently say I have learned so much. Her class and discussion section frequently supplemented what i wasn't receiving in biostats and added additional context for AAMiE.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0I am sure that Professor Shebl knows a lot in this area. However, it would be great if the slides are more organized (different sizes of fonts and consistent format. And it would also be nice if the professor could have a better control of the lecture time instead of prolonging the class to cover all materials designed to be discussed.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Fatma was very well meaning but carelessly thoughtless of students. I do not believe any of this was malicious - I think it upset her that this was the case- but her methods of instruction and coordination of class and exam details often were disrespectful. Guidelines for exams were never clear and for working so hard on something I felt this made it impossible to succeed. She needs help in learning how to keep a class structured and organized and how to deal with curveballs. Extending classes is not appropriate - she should have found a different way to deal with this when issues arose. Overall I think she's a very kind well meaning person who struggled at our expense to run the course.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Wonderful instructor. She is dedicated to her students and to the class and once you get to know her at her office hours you quickly realize how she is a wonderful professor.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Professor Shebl knows her material. There's no questioning that, but I feel that she does not present the material in the best manner. When students ask for clarification on topics, it feels as if she just repeats what she said rather than work around what did not make sense to begin with.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0I think this was a particularly difficult class and semester for everyone. Our needs and expectations from the professor were not met and the professor had expectations from us that were a bit unrealistic. The teaching style of the course was difficult to embrace and I often felt like going to class was not particularly helpful. This created a fairly tense and hostile learning environment and many people just \"shut down\".",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0She was very receptive to feedback. However, lectures almost always went over or were rushed at the end.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl is very approachable and a great instructor. She clearly explains the material. Strengths: Patience with material, always willing to help Weaknesses: Use of microphone in class",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0She was confident, and was good at explaining difficult concepts.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl is a wonderful instructor. This is evident by her time and again being so accessible to students, and you can truly tell that she wants everyone to succeed.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Accent a little difficult to understand. Fantastic slides and fantastic reading choices.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0I am saddened to have to give such a poor evaluation of Dr. Shebl. But her lectures were not good. Her explanations of the material made very little sense. She was also remarkably rude at times. It is very clear to me that having Dr. Shebl teach this course was a very poor decision on the part of the department. However, she did show a willingness to adapt and change her style.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0She cared about the class and the students, which definitely showed. With that said, the lectures were difficult to follow, she often seemed frazzled, and rather than trying to teach a concept differently if I didn't understand it, she just repeated what she originally said.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Professor Shebl was very kind and caring, but she was new to teaching Epi II. Her teaching style was not that conductive to my learning. She was often accusatory about not doing the homeworks and about not doing well on the tests. I always have difficulty understanding why some professors to this because it seems to me that when students don't do well on an exam, it is because they weren't taught the information well enough. Nonetheless, when I met with Professor Shebl one on one, she was always very kind and warm.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Although the beginning of the course started out with some challenges, Fatma definitely incorporated our feedback on the course and resolved many of the issues. It was evident that Fatma cared about her students and wanted us to succeed. Overall a wonderful professor who I would feel comfortable going to for advice and help with with the coursework or other matters.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Strengths- clearly cares very deeply about students doing well and understanding the materials, and is very amenable to feedback. My main suggestions for improvement were addressed and corrected by the end of the course, like not trying to scare students into spending time on homework by warning that they might fail, and avoiding the clicker questions that required reading through a large paragraph and thinking super quickly. Again, my big suggestion is to whittle down the concepts that we go over in lecture to make sure that we fully understand the main points.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Great lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0A little difficult to understand during lecture but very helpful during office hours.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Professor Shebl was a terrible professor who gradually became slightly better throughout the semester--but not by much. She is not a good lecturer, she is a terrible explainer and she is just a generally intimidating, condescending individual.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Professor Shebl put a strong effort into teaching us. Her lectures were not particularly helpful, but she was an enthusiastic professor who was dedicated to teaching us epidemiology.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0The class very much appreciated Professor Shebl's willingness to obtain feedback from students, unfortunately, much of the feedback was not implemented until very late in the term. Students have very full schedules so moving lecture time up 40 minutes or having the course go over the allotted time is not fair to those students who wish to attend all lectures but have courses or other commitments right before and\/or after the Epi timeslot (important to note that not all students are in BISII, while others use the time slot in between BISII and EpiII for other meetings in LEPH- therefore changing the time midway through the term does not work).",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Prof. Shebl was one of the better professors I have ever had the opportunity to work with. She was willing to spend time outside the classroom explaining the material even beyond her scheduled office hour times. Not only that she she cared a lot about her students. She was willing to work with us, was open to feedback, and customize the course to help us learn."

    "This is a good course to get more familiar with epidemiology and related paper. However, it requires active input to learn much from it.",
    "Everyone should take this class. It may be one of the most challenging classes I have taken here, but by far I have learned more in this class than any other course in graduate school. It's 100% worth the work and time.",
    "This is one of those courses I'm glad I took because I learned a lot, but I definitely did not enjoy taking at the time. I half-taught myself from the slides rather than the lectures as the teaching style, pace, and tone of lecture was not conducive to learning the material. The class was poorly paced, often not finishing the material or spending too little time on the concepts that were most important. However, I will say I feel that I learned a lot, especially since I enjoy epi as a subject, and feel more knowledgeable about topics that I will use in a summer internship and beyond.",
    "I am not sure if I would recommend it to another student. I think many changes to the class have to be made before I would confidently tell someone to take it.",
    "A good foundation course with fair tests and homework. You will learn how to thoroughly read an epi journal article.",
    "Excellent class. You will work hard and it will teach you to think like an epidemiologist.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. This course is heavy and takes up a lot of your time but well worth it. I can now say that I understand the basics of Epidemiology when I graduate.",
    "Yes, I think everyone within YSPH should take Epi II. It's so essential to be able to critically analyze and evaluate peer reviewed literature as these findings build the basis of the decisions that are made in public health practice.",
    "It needs to be reformatted with the current curriculum, because it is not cutting it in its current setup. After those changes, I would recommend anyone who is in epidemiology (CDE and EMD) be required to take this course in order to better understand the fundamentals of epidemiology. The course itself is hard, but worth it.",
    "This course is of remarkably poor quality. You are far better off reading a book on the subject on your own. Taking one of the courses available online would probably lead you to learn much more and in a much more enjoyable manner.",
    "It's required because the material is fundamental to being an epidemiologist. It's hard work, but it's important.",
    "You definitely learn a lot, but I wouldn't take it unless I absolutely needed to. I think Epi I teaches you the basics you need to know for public health purposes, and Epi II just engaged with that material further. Not necessary unless it is a requirement.",
    "I would probably recommend that a student take AAMIE or Biostats before this class, since lots of the same topics are covered.",
    "Epidemiology is a core curriculum of public health. Recommend to take it early to lay a foundation for thesis and future research.",

    "This class is terrible. But also mandatory. So if you have to take it, good luck! I hope you get a good teaching fellow. Avoid Renee Mehra at all costs.",
