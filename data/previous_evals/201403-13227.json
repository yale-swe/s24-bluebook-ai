   "comments": [
    "I learnt a lot about Haiti and it turned out to be my favorite class. The seminar is structured differently which brought a nice difference to my scheduled lectures. Highly recommend!",
    "Yes! This was an awesome class and I would highly recommend it. It was a very interesting topic and almost every class was engaging. The course, overall, was very rewarding.",
    "Great course to learn a lot of Haiti from different perspectives.",
    "One of the best seminars. Professor Geballe is very good at teaching. You need no prior knowledge about Haiti. The material we cover is vast and a lot, but every piece of it is really interesting if you care about Haiti. Youll also learn a lot of important skills like leading the discussion, doing a presentation, and building a research paper.",
    "This course taught a really in-depth overview of Haitian culture in relation to its development as a nation. The readings, while plentiful, gave a great base for the in-class discussion, but did not restrict conversation. This seminar does vary year to year because it depends heavily on the students and how much they are willing to engage in discussion and facilitate idea flow, but you can be sure to gain in both your skills in articulating your thoughts and in your knowledge of Haiti.",
    "This is a discussion-based course that examines issues of sustainable development in modern-day Haiti from a variety of angles. Each class covers a different topic or lens - public health, NGOs, natural disaster, literature, history, etc. - and each student is responsible for leading one class. Over the course of the semester, the class examines sustainable development in Haiti in great breadth, but limited depth. The professor facilitates the class and selects the reading, but class time is largely student-directed. This leads for compelling and dynamic group discussions, but also means that the participants in our conversations are seldom experts on the topics at hand. As a result, although you can certainly get away without doing much of the reading, if you don't engage with the assigned texts, you'll be limited in how much you get out of the course. The end-of-term research paper is challenging but a great way to engage with a topic you're most interested in at a deeper, more meaningful level. I would recommend this course to students interested in sustainable development, even if they don't have a particular interest in Haiti or the Caribbean. The course does a good job of illuminating the thorniness of seemingly helpful international humanitarian aid, NGOs, etc., and although you don't leave with any comprehensive answers on how best to approach sustainable development, you learn about some of the questions most worth asking.",
    "An interesting introduction to a complicated topic. A lively class that helps give you a more holistic perspective on Haiti. It really is specifically about Haiti as a case study, so don't take it if you're not interested in the nation. The professor is fun and very responsive, and the discussions are fairly productive, expanding one's perspective on the issue though rarely forcing one to question their whole opinion\/change their mind.",
    "I would recommend the course to other students, although I would tell them that I found some of the readings superfluous and that I had reservations about some aspects of the course.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this class. I think that its a great way to look at Haitian history and many of the subtopics of sustainable development. This class touches briefly on many different subjects, instead of developing an overall grasp or a deep understanding within a single subtopic. It is not economically focused. Definitely take it. Great freshman seminar.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to another student. This class covers so many aspects of Haitian life that it is much more than an environmental studies class. Professor Geballe is wonderful, and the small class allowed me to learn a lot from my fellow students as well as gain confidence in a seminar setting. It was not an unreasonable amount of work, and the research paper allowed for personal direction and great freedom to focus on my specific interests. It was a great way to knock out a writing credit!"
