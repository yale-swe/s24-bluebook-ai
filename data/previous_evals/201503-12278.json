    "Byzantine art is a pretty straight forward survey of Middle Byzantine churches and manuscripts. Take it if you're interested in the period, or want to study a lot of images of Mary and the Christ child! It's also a great way to school yourself in Christian iconography!",
    "Very enjoyable despite the work load",
    "It is an excellent introduction to Byzantine art. You will look at beautiful artworks from 850 to 13th century from Constantinople, Greece, Sicily and Venice. It is a pleasure to sit in the lectures, but it is a demanding course. I would highly recommend this course for students interested in byzantine art who are ready to work very regularly for this course. It was a wonderful course!",
    "An intense course covering what a student interested in Byzantium needs to know. It provides you with the basic skills one needs to approach Byzantine art while offering insightful approaches through select articles of renowned Byzantine scholars. Would definitely recommend the course."
