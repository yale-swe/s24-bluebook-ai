    "Take it! Great teacher, great course.",
    "So glad I don't have to type this out in Spanish haha. Anyhow, SPAN 130 was good. Moved really slow in the beginning with a review of preterite\/imperfect; at the end it moved really fast but it's definitely still do-able. 5 days a week is obviously a drag tho, so make sure you pick based on professors.",
    "Spanish 130 is Grammar review, quite elementary in the beginning but will be more sophisticated\/complicated towards the end.",
    "I would strongly recommend the SPAN 130 class. I've thoroughly enjoyed it and plan on continuing more Spanish classes during my remaining semesters at Yale.",
    "Worth the experience",
    "I would recommend this class because it went through many important basics that are necessary to know despite the fact that they can be very confusing.",
    "Spanish 130 is an introduction to intermediate level Spanish that helps students improve their speaking, reading, and listening skills. I would recommend this class. It does not have an overwhelming amount of work, although you get work every day. As long as you keep up with the work, you will learn a lot and feel more confident in your Spanish language abilities at the end of the class.",
    "This course is helpful to increase your spanish comprehension and speaking skills."
