   "comments": [
    "It looks at the role of both genetics and environment in final phenotypes. I would definitely recommend it because I really enjoyed it and the material is really interesting.",
    "Potentially fascinating material, but the lectures were a little dry. Prof Kim-Cohen is one of the nicest professors you'll meet, she is just a little soft-spoken and not very dynamic. Since the class is mainly a lecture (albeit a small one, about 30 students in the class), it would be more riveting with a change in the teaching style.",
    "Good class. You get what you expect, and you learn a lot. I found myself using what I learned in the course in other classes (Psych and Anthropology classes) as well as in everyday conversation. The first third of the class, when you learn about the vocab of genetics and etc, was very slow. But, the application of the first third onto the later thirds was much better. Professor Kim-Cohen is fabulous, certainly a professor I would recommend studying under as a Psych major. Overall, good class.",
    "The material is really interesting, and you learn to get a very different conception of what the media typically makes you believe about nature\/nurture. The readings and lectures bring you to some pretty cool conclusions. Discussions could have been led a little better, but I still really enjoyed the class.",
    "This is a great course for anyone interested in pursuing psychology as a major or just looking to dabble a bit in the field. Very informative and applicable to real life.",
    "I would totally recommend nature, nurture to another student. It was my favorite class this semester. Gave me a whole new perspective on psychology in general, and genetics research and heritability statistics more specifically.I feel like I've learned to be a more critical consumer of empirical research. More thoughtful.It's a great class- if you're not lazy, take it.",
    "You will investigate the issues that come with studying nature and nurture influences on a variety of topics. The class could be titled something like \"Beyond Nature and Nurture in HB\" because things get very complicated very quickly.",
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in the material, or just need a basic psyc class, but it's a little boring, and the professor isn't the best lecturer.",
    "Take it if you are interested in the genetic basis of behavior and in exploring issues surrounding behavioral genetics, including ethical and moral issues.Good class.",
    "Great class that changes the way you think about behavioral genetics. Relatively easy tests and it's not hard to do well in the class. Would definitely recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student who is at all interested in genetics or psychology.",
    "I would recommend it as a \"basic\" psych course, but it's definitely not one of the most interesting classes I've taken.",
    "This subject material of this class is very interesting, and the reading\/workload is not heavy. However, you still learn a lot of new material that are very up to date.",
    "summary - Not really an answer to the age old debate, but rather several interesting reasons for which there may never be an answer.Recommend - yes",
    "Recommended if you are interested in gaining a better understanding of the interplay between genes and environment - the class basically teaches you how the development of a human being is not nearly as simple as one might believe it to be and moves you far from the assumption that genes are equivalent to human blueprints."
