   "comments": [
    "This is a good continuation of CHNS110. The material does get much harder this semester, the dialogues and narratives are longer, and there is much more material to memorize.",
    "Chinese 120 is the second semester of entry level Chinese. I found a little easier than the first semester, and more enjoyable because it is incredible to look back on how much your Chinese has improved in just a year.",
    "If you are interested in improving your chinese and you are willing to commit the effort, this is an amazing program.",
    "I would recommend CHNS 120 for anyone who is willing to put in the work. If you're not willing to put in the work, you don't get much out of it and you mess up the flow of the class. The class is excellent, and I think if you're looking for a challenging, useful, and amazing language learning experience, you should continue Chinese at least to an intermediate level!",
    "This course puts a great deal of emphasis on the speaking portion of the language with constant daily speaking in a classroom setting and heavy emphasis on learning pinyin rather than characters.",
    "Terrible teachers good content.",
    "Basically the same format as L1, but with longer presentations and a little more difficult grammar. Still just as good of a class.",
    "This is a very intense and work-heavy course but if you've already taken CHNS 110 then you know exactly what to expect.",
    "Chinese 120\/L2 is essentially the same course as L1 with slightly different grading but mostly the same structure. The teachers are all great and you learn lots of material in a pretty short time. By the end of the year, if someone dropped you in the middle of China, you could probably communicate and survive fairly easily.",
    "This is a great class and very well organized. I love all the teachers.",
    "Lots of work, but you make a lot of progress. Great class with caring teachers.",
    "A great class that should definitely be taken!",
    "I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "Chinese was my most challenging course this semester, and probable my lowest grade, but I absolutely loved it and plan to take it for as many terms as I possibly can!"
