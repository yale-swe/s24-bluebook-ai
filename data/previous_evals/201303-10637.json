    "This course is a solid course. You read a lot of interesting primary sources, and if you have a good group, it's great. If you are familiar with American history though, there is not much that will be new, just more in depth.",
    "I really, really loved this course. To start, I liked the syllabus' focus on primary sources (unusual for Yale history seminars!), and I found the readings to be fascinating. Professor Cohrs' insights on them were consistently brilliant, and he was a wonderful (and occasionally very funny) section leader, as well as a kind professor. Highly recommend, especially for students of U.S. foreign policy.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're at all interested in the way the United States has functioned with the world. The readings weren't overburdening. The papers were normal for a seminar. Definitely take it!",
    "Interesting material \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it's probably something everybody should know about. I've taken just one other American history classes at Yale though, and I feel like I would have gotten more out of the course with a better understanding of the events of each period that affected foreign policy.",
    "This seminar is largely a survey course of American history, but through the lens of international history. Even if you have taken other American history courses, I would highly recommend taking this seminar. Professor Cohrs is fantastic and I would highly recommend taking any course he offers!",
    "I really enjoyed this class. The reading could be a bit dense at times, but was usually interesting and provided good material for the seminar. The only problem with the course was the lack of context; it would be a great help if each historical period is given some background before jumping into ideological issues. Cohrs is a very helpful instructor who takes his job seriously and does it well. He's helpful with drafts and paper topics but expects serious work in return. Throughout the year he was a good arbiter for the class but I really would think it productive if he took more of a stance and fostered more of a debate in seminar rather than comments that build on one another. Take this class if you have an interest in US foreign policy and are willing to look at the ideological history behind it. Take notes on everything you read, it will help in class and when writing papers."
