    "Watch MIT open course ware. Lecture should be optional, but some material which is not listed on the syllabus (especially the applications) are covered in class so you need to go. Alternates between painstakingly slow and way too fast, the latter especially at the end of the semester when everything related to eigen-values is covered in a couple weeks.",
    "This class was the bane of my existence. I kid you not. I read these reviews before shopping period, saw Yael was bad, and thought \"she can't be that bad\". DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HER. She is a terrible, confusing lecturer, her homeworks don't correlate with topics covered in class, and she covered one application the entire semester, and it was on the last day. Take this with Schultheiss, or prepare for a semester of hell.",
    "Many people warned me about taking this class with professor Kfir, because they did not like the way she taught the course last semester. Nevertheless, I really liked the class. I feel like she read last semester's evaluation and did her best to improve the course. Therefore, I think she's a better option than the other professor, who doesn't even have a classesv2 portal. We have weekly psets (I did not spend more than 5h\/week max. on them). TAKE IT!!",
    "The class is moderately challenging, and never having taken any classes in linear algebra I found the concepts to be somewhat more difficult to grasp than any calculus classes I have taken. However, I do feel that I learned a lot and that I could apply it to the world. I would recommend it, but I would not say that it's the highlight of the Yale math experience; I don't know how the other Linear Algebra classes are run, but Yael is not the best teacher. She has a problem connecting with students, and sometimes she goes through the material too quickly with too few examples. On the other hand, the homework was very manageable and helped a lot to reinforce the material. I wish that she had been a better teacher, but I think it's a worthwhile course if you have any interest in expanding your math background.",
    "Most people don't have a choice - linear algebra is a prereq for many majors. I would recommend it to people who are in math-oriented majors and are thinking about grad school but are not required to take it for their undergrad majors.",
    "Try to get the other class if you can, Yael's not a great teacher. But she's fair and the tests aren't terrible, so if there are no other sections this one's fine.",
    "Don't take this class unless you need it for your major. It is completely boring and the teaching is very subpar. The math is useful for later science and math classes, but that's only if you're an engineering or math major. Overall the class is very boring and you could take much more interesting classes at Yale.",
    "Overall a poorly taught class. The lectures simply focused on deriving a bunch of formulas and theorems, which is all well and good, but completely skipped out on explaining the material conceptually. There was no discussion on what the implications of theorems and equations were, no tying together of the information we learned, and no explanation for the significance of the math presented to us. Also, there were probably 3-4 \"applications\" presented all semester. The class was basically a less intense version of 225, not an applied math class. The math department should really look into revamping this curriculum. If you have to take it, you have to take it. The material is not very difficult, so that's not really the issue; it can often be pretty interesting. It's more that it's just a terribly taught class.",
    "It is important math to know. The lecture is not informative. Recoomend signing up for a tutor and watch Strang's MIT Lectures which are free online.",
    "Taking this class was the biggest mistake of my freshman year. Avoid at all costs if taught by Kfir. Was time consuming and difficult to get a good grade in. The midterm was the easiest test i took at Yale this year, and i got my worst grade ofthe year thanks to terrifyingly poor grading. I took the class credit D as a precaution, and was glad i did. In spite of this apparent rigor, this class covered far less material than the other sections. The online lectures by Strang, who wrote the book, are an excellent alternative to the actual lectures, which saw attendance drop by two thirds by the time i stopped going after spring break.",
    "So please take the time and really read the reviews on specifically her and this class. I took this class because I didn't want to take the other section because it met on Fridays. Literally, the worst decision in my short Yale career. Yael is the worst teacher I have ever encountered. I really strongly suggest you do not take her course. Now, I read the bad reviews for her class, but figured that some students are just bad at math and love to complain and blame the teacher, but this isn't true with Yael. She is the worst teacher I've had in my academic career. I've never met anyone that cares less about her class. Problem sets were on the longer end and many involved proofs. This is great if you're taking 225, but 222 is known for being an easy course in the math department. It's literally supposed to be just doing processes and being done. Linear algebra is genuinely interesting and not too difficult, but when you put in proofs in a class that isn't supposed to have proofs its frustrating. Between the two sections, there is absolutely no correlation. The other class is by far easier and definitely worth taking. Yael's problem sets take anywhere from 3-4 hours. Not bad. But towards the end, I stopped turning them in because I simply didn't know how to even approach the problem. Her office hours were on the day problem sets were due. Problem sets were due at 4 and her office hours were at 2. It makes it pretty difficult to get help. Honestly, just don't take the course. Worst decision ever.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. You learn Linear Algebra and you begin to appreciate the subject. The professor and the textbook are both great!",
    "If you have to take linear algebra, you have to take linear algebra. Unfortunately yale's course offerings here aren't great. You'll be okay if you use the book and watch the strang MIT lectures online... I kind of regret going to 9am lecture, and I'm one of those people that always goes to lecture.",
    "Yes, but be cautious. This class is not for everyone, and you should be prepared to spend a lot of time on your own learning new material.",
    "A hard class with a lot of work. Be prepared to consult many outside sources to complete the courseload",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE!!! You will learn the material better, get a better grade, and spend less time if you take a different class. Take Math 222 with Peter Schultheiss or anyone besides Yael Algom Kfir.Yael does not teach. She writes proofs on the board without explaining the proofs or the terms she uses. She then gets mad at us when we do not learn the material that she never taught us.Yael DOES NOT COVER THE NESSARY MATERIAL. Yael spent most of the class covering some of the material from 3 chapters of the textbook then she tried to teach 2 chapters in the two weeks before the final. We missed important material, 3\/8 of the text were never covered. I am now reteaching myself the material we went through too quickly, and teaching myself the applications we skipped because other classes assume I know them because I took liner algebra.YOU WILL HAVE A LOW GRADE. On the midterm the class average was in the 50s. At least a third of the class dropped out. Many of us lost 20 points out of 100 because one of our answers was written in the wrong form. Yael has many unusual rules like that. Yael has refused to tell us our final grade until a month after the evaluations are due. It might be because she doesn\u0092t want us to give bad evaluations because of our low grades or because she plans to adjust the class average based on our evaluations, I don\u0092t know.A word of warning do not be late to any tests. IF YOU ARE LATE TO A TEST YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO TAKE THE TEST AND SO WILL AUTOMATICALY FAIL THE TEST.You will need a lot of time to take this course. The material is not hard, in fact it is relatively easy compared to multivariable calc or differential equations. The problem is the lecture does not teach you the material but you still have to go to find out what she will be covering. Then you have to learn the material on your own, and do the weekly Pset. The workload would be very manageable if you were able to learn the material at lecture.Psets are only graded and returned if you bug the professor for weeks, and then they are often returned hours before, or after, the test that covers the same material, so it is next to impossible to know if you understand the material. The same is true of review questions for midterms or finals.If you do take the course watch the MIT open course lecture by our textbook author, they are so much beter than the lecture. Go to the TA section because the TA is a good teacher.Please don\u0092t make the same mistake I did, don\u0092t take this class.",
    "I think that this class was not too much work and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn some linear algebra. However, the section I took with Yael did not cover much applications and there were too many proofs done in class as opposed to application as the course advertises.Overall, the class is not too much work: there are weekly problem sets that take about 5-6 hrs each, one midterm and a final. It's definitely an easier class than MATH120.",
    "If you are looking to take Linear Algebra with Applications, do not take this class. If you don't like math theory or proof-based courses, avoid Yael at all costs. She teches the course in an entirely proof-based manner, sometimes spending a class at a time on one or two incomprehensible proofs while not following the textbook at all. Yael jumps from topic to topic, and ends up rushing the course at the end trying to squeeze things in. You will not cover the same material as the other 222 class, and they should not be listed as the same course. I cannot recommend this class to anyone; all knowledge that I left it with was either self-taught or gained from TA sessions.",
    "As a math class I really enjoyed this course, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone unless they're looking to major in a math-related field. Interesting course though.",
    "The course was interesting and the topics relevant to a wide variety of science and engineering courses. It serves as a prereq for many majors and I would recommend the course to anyone who needs it as a prereq or simply enjoys taking mathematics courses."
