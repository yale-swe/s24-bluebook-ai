   "comments": [
    "The Content of the class is very pertinent and engaging. As for the amount of work the class requires one to do; its just like anything else at Yale, it is what you make it. Flink seems to know who does the reading and who doesn't. If you can get into this extremely competitive seminar (130 or so interviewed, he took 22) TAKE IT!",
    "Yes. Everyone at Yale should take this class.",
    "This a fantastic class. Stanley Flink organizes interesting sessions and greases the wheels with mesmerizing stories from his own experiences in journalism. While the focus of the class is generally narrow in scope, what you realize by the end of the semester is that you have an excellent sense of the media world - its past, present, and future. The readings, including his own book, are very applicable and help to illuminate discussions in class. Flink experimented this year with a system where half of the class each week would hold their discussion in an online blog (the electronic group), while the other half of the class would discuss them in the traditional way in class itself (the Socratic group). This provided fascinating insight on the world's new means of communication and unveiled some surprising results when evaluated at the end of the term. There could be tweaks to this system, but theaim is good. Overall the work assignments are extremely reasonable, but Flink does expect you to treat the two ten-pagers (which basically make up all of the work) with great care. A truly great seminar with a professor who really cares about his students.",
    "Take it. Best course ever. Ridiculous stories from Flink. He has had the most absurd experiences during his life.",
    "If you take this class, you won't mind how little work there is. And you'll enjoy many of Professor Flink's stories. But the class isn't really a gut, since you do have to do the work that is assigned, and you're not guaranteed a great grade. Worse than that, though, the class is very frustrating, since you have to do readings and then aren't given a chance to discuss them. Flink spends up to an hour or an hour and a half of each seminar talking, telling stories, and he lets 25 students into the class, so you really never get a chance to discuss what is actually interesting material. The word that most described my experience in this class is \"frustrating.\"",
    "I recommend Ethics and the Media; it is an entertaining seminar and broaches a subject almost untouched at Yale. Professor Flink is always ready with a tale or two and they're always enthralling.",
    "Definitely. Great course. Great stories. Professor Flink is awesome.",
    "Yes! If you can get it, it's storytime with Stanley Flink, and requires very little work.",
    "Take this class if you can get in. The reading's fair, papers aren't bad, and it's really story time with Stanley! Professor Flink's stlories are what makes this class so awesome and you can learn a lot from his copious experience in the field.",
    "This class is really just Stanley Flink's storytime and book-reading - it doesn't even go into the new media or social media at all, which just makes the course seem very outdated. His stories are entertaining, yes, but ultimately, this class let me down.",
    "Take it for sure, he is old and a little old school in his thinking but also an amazing and caring professor. The reading is very light, and the discussions varied. A great class overall.",
    "Absolutely. The course material can get somewhat repetitive in considering the proper role for the media in the American democratic system, but the readings aren't very long and mostly pretty good. The reason it is a must take is because Professor Flink is one of the coolest dudes ever and he has a wealth of incredibly interesting and mind blowing stories that make going to class fun.",
    "Take it if you get the opportunity. Flink is the best teacher I've ever had and I can't say enough about this class. He tells some incredible stories and the material you learn is valuable. There's also not much work at all-- very manageable readings and a couple medium-length papers. I highly recommend this class. This is the type of class you will remember several years down the road when you look back on your time at Yale."
