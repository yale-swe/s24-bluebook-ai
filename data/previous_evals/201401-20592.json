    "Lots of work but a lot of fun.",
    "An amazing course where you really learn to speak and write French. Take it with Mme Koizim and it'll be one of your fondest memories of Yale.",
    "+ Mme Koizim is a legend. If she is teaching it it doesnt matter, just take it.",
    "French 140 is a great course in terms of the grammar and books you read--the readings are all pretty depressing (Diversite is pretty much all sad stories about women) but if your teacher is good it will definitely be worth it. There is a lot of homework, especially if you're in Madame Koizim's class. But I highly recommend this class, because my French has improved a lot as a result. The presentation I prepared, where I looked through materials in French, made me feel much more proficient in the language and made me feel like all the work was paying off.",
    "It is a good progression from L3.",
    "French 140, especially Mme Koizim's section, was my favorite experience with French in my 7 years of language study. There are few courses so carefully crafted to help students transition into fluency, and the class really does delve deeply into French language and culture. The workload can get heavy at times, but it's always thus when learning a new language. I thought that two hours per night on French was very reasonable, considering my interest in the language. Mme Koizim worked hard to make sure that everyone did well and understood the material. Take this course if you have a decent amount of experience with French, and want to work most on your reading and speaking skills.",
    "If you want to learn French, absolutely.",
    "French 140 provides a good balance between reinforcing grammar introduced in 130 and introducing more complex concepts. The texts are longer, and you get to discuss and write about them analytically\u2014 not just for comprehension. Madame Koizim is wonderful\u2014 SO invested in her students, and how they are doing inside and outside the classroom. Her enthusiasm makes a class that meets 5 days a week stay interesting. It's worth taking her class just to get to know her. It is a fair bit of work, especially toward the end of the term as nightly readings get longer."
