   "comments": [
    "History is a fantastic major. The History senior thesis was assuredly worthwhile!",
    "Choose a topic that you will find interesting as you will dive in deep.",
    "Only if you're a history major.",
    "N\/A",
    "You write a senior essay of some 45 pages!",
    "If you don't have a topic that interests you (and lends itself well to a thesis) going into senior year, it can be very frustrating and hard at the beginning. But, once you get into the swing of things, it can be very rewarding. I found it a worthwhile experience.",
    "It is difficult to recommend or not recommend as it is a requirement of the major. If you start your research and writing early you will have very enjoyable, valuable, and rewarding experience. The History Department is considering changing the structure of the course in the next year or so, so it may be different by the time you take it. I rated the workload as \"greater\" because that is what I chose to do and I felt it was well worth it. I imagine one could get by with a lot less effort if that is what you choose.",
    "The senior essay distinguishes the history major from other majors, in my opinion. The two-semester requirement is daunting and the project itself immensely challenging; however, I felt I learned and grew more from the senior essay than from any other academic endeavor at Yale. Start writing by February 1 at the latest! Also, form a study group with peers who can hear your ideas and read your drafts. Their feedback and empathy will get you through the process. Lastly, meet with your advisor as much as you can. If your advisor does not know much about your topic, contact another faculty member--at Yale or another university--who does. His\/her secondary-source recommendations might prove invaluable.",
    "Seriously, pick a topic that you like and work on it throughout the year!!!",
    "Year-long, independent research project. You write an essay based on new research, interpretation, etc. The chance to learn a lot about something you never knew about, become the expert on something you care about, and a whole lot more.",
    "Yes, I would recommend writing senior thesis to every History major.",
    "You have to take it.",
    "Yes, I think it is a perfect was to put to use the writing and research skill history majors learn. It allows them to use these skills towards a topic of their choosing, typically one they are passionate about. It is a great experience.",
    "One of the most academically fulfilling experiences",
    "An incredible experience. Probably one of my best at Yale.",
    "Absolutely, great academic experience to close out your time at Yale.",
    "It's required for the major - so you have to do it!",
    "Really, really sucks. I imagine it can be made interesting and life-affirming if done correctly, but life at Yale really does not allow people who would glean such an experience to have sufficient time for research and writing. It will be hell in pretty much any case. Prepare for anxiety dreams and grey hairs.",
    "The only reason you would be reading this is if you are a prospective history major, wondering whether it is worth majoring in history, given the year-long senior essay. Writing from the other side, the answer is a resounding YES: the year-long essay is THE REASON to major in history."
