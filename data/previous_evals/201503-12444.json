    "I mainly took genetics for the lab, but I was happy with the lecture. Its interesting without being too difficult, and Gendron is great. I liked the quiz\/paper format because (a) if we are going to have a section I would much rather have it during class time and (b) I found it less stressful than having midterms. Plus, you get to read cool papers. The only caveat is that, having taken Bio 103 and Cell Bio already, I found a lot of the material to be repetitive. Im not entirely sure if I would take it again knowing this, though I would still consider it. But if you havent taken cell bio and dont plan to, definitely take genetics!",
    "YES! I loved this class and its a core! Read a paper to discuss every two weeks and take a quiz every two weeks (not tough to study for). Just that and a final - light load for a core MCDB.",
    "Would recommend this class to anyone in need of a light-load biology course. Genetics is absolutely fascinating and you should take this class to have a chill intro to Genetics fundamentals!",
    "Well-taught and interesting. Every other week you have a paper discussion and quiz during the normal lecture time (instead of a separate section) which I liked. I took this as an E&EB major having not taken any MCDB classes since intro bio, and I found it a little challenging but not terrible. The professors are both good and since it was a small section this year, there was a lot of discussion within lecture, which was nice.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to every MCDB major.",
    "A bad class. If you need an MCDB core class I would recommend something else. The material was overall not as overwhelming as Mol or Cell and was actually very manageable, but the logistics of this class are absolutely terrible. 25% of your grade is a subjective evaluation of your participation in section, which is ridiculous (and no you don't get a perfect grade just for showing up). 50% of your grade is based off biweekly multiple choice quizzes which are okay but are kind of tricky\/poorly-worded. The final is fair but is nothing like the quizzes. The class is curved to a B+ average but there are only 20 kids in the class. Overall you just have to do well on the quizzes and the final and be the section a-hole I guess. This class would just be so much better with better logistics because Dellaporta and Gendron are actually very nice, intelligent, and pretty good lecturers.",
    "Take it if you're looking for an intermediate bio course that's pretty well-taught, not an insane amount of work (like immuno, physio, and cell bio). Gendron is really great. You will need to read the papers and study for the quizzes. Also, I recommend doing the problem sets even though they're optional. Will help with the final exam.",
    "Average MCDB course with a doable tempo: a paper discussion and lecture quiz every other Tuesday. If you find Genetics a complete bore, though, I definitely suggest another bio course since the way this course is taught probably won't change your mind about the topic.",
    "Genetics (MCDB 202) should be taken by intended biology majors, and even for those who are biology majors, may prove difficult. The class covers a wide range of material and requires knowledge and application--theoretical and concrete--of the topics covered in class. The final exam, since it covered a large amount of material, was challenging. I would recommend the course only to those for whom it is required for their major.",
    "I would recommend it if you need a light MCDB course. This course is less work than other MCDB courses. but not the most enjoyable.",
    "would definitely recommend, was one of my favorite courses at Yale and was not too difficult, but definitely pushed my thinking",
    "I would recommend this class. Both of the professors are engaging, and the material is pretty interesting.",
    "! A very basic take on genetics that you will have received if you took BIOL 103. Both instructors and all TA's are hardworking and friendly, and the class is small with a good amount of discussion. Very easy and probably not a lot of new material.",
    "Solid course. Not particularly difficult to do well in if you read the book and study the slides. Can be a bit slow, as the material is very similar to that of BIO 103. But overall a good MCDB core course, especially if you are interested in genetics or the future of medicine!",
    "This class was a thorough introduction to genetics. The module structure was nice and keeps you on top of the material. It would be helpful if more of an emphasis was placed on the problem sets and a section with the TFs to help with the problems might also be beneficial because I usually found the quizzes difficult even when I felt like I really understood the material well. I would recommend it if you're willing to stay on top of lots of weekly work and studying and are comfortable with genetics-style problems, which can be hard to get used to.",
    "The course was very similar to BIOL 103, but slightly more in depth. The teaching styles of the two professors were very different, but the lecture was small enough to allow interesting conversations and answering of questions. Discussion sections and quizzes were every other Tuesday so you didn't have to meet outside of the regularly scheduled class time which was really great. The course mostly rides on how well you do on the quizzes so not only do you need to know the concepts but also how to apply those concepts to problems and various scenarios. If you really like genetics, I would recommend this class. Otherwise it's an ok class but (in my opinion) not the best MCDB course I've taken so far."
