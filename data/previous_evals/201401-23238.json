   "comments": [
    "Excellent take on the big novels and theorists of the novel in the Russian case.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "The course is helpful in preparing for comprehensive exams. For that reason, I would recommend it. However, I would caution another student that the course is far more work than any other in the department, and that they will most likely struggle the entire semester to keep up with deadlines and secondary readings.",
    "Great class. Before taking it, though, one should familiarize oneself with the novels themselves. The bulk of the reading is literary theory.",
    "I would recommend the course. Students should know that they need to be strategic and selective when doing the readings. Impossible to do them all thoroughly and completely.",
    "You will read A LOT of secondary material. This is probably not the course for you if you want to read Tolstoy and Dostoevsky for the first time. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, so long as they understand that it is much more about learning how to read secondary material that focuses on overstudied primary sources.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in Russian literature (as long as they had some prior knowledge). The course is hard -- it is more work than many other seminars -- but we read some amazing literature and gain a more detailed understanding of an incredibly important period in Russian literature.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a student. I would warn of the heavy workload, however, and only take the course if there is enough time in their schedule."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "This course did contribute to my research, in that novel theory is an integral part of pre-dissertation research. Additionally, Professor Brunson is obviously very knowledgeable of the expectations of scholars in the field, and she passes these expectations along to her students.",
    "The seminar greatly contributed to exam preparation.",
    "Helped me understand how to better craft and write a research paper for graduate school which will be extremely helpful going forward even if the topic is not exactly the same as what I plan for the dissertation.",
    "In this course we read a great deal of classic and contemporary critics on Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, a field that is arguably the backbone of the Slavic discipline. This definitely increased by knowledge of the profession, as well as potential dissertation work, because all Russian literary scholarship is somewhat rooted in many of those classic texts.",
    "This course was very helpful for my own interests and research, and I learned a great deal more about the professional aspects of an academic career in literature.",
    "This is material that is essential to our discipline, and I feel that my knowledge has been irreparably enriched by this experience."
