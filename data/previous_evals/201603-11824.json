   "comments": [
    "Reading level Greek with heavy glossing. Some analysis skills.",
    "I learned a lot of Greek grammar and my ability to read Greek improved substantially.",
    "This class greatly improved my reading ability in ancient Greek, both in terms of speed and comprehension. It also provided a helpful introduction to the Greek historiographic tradition.",
    "My skill in Greek expanded greatly, especially in vocabulary and syntax. I feel very prepared for the next level of Greek.",
    "I learned how to work my way through large amounts of Greek texts and develop a general sense of what it is saying. I also learned how to take down smaller sentences and reduce them to their grammatical parts.",
    "I think my Greek improved a lot in this class. While I think I still have a long way to go in developing my vocabulary, this class has given me the confidence to approach a greek text with a measure of confidence. Especially through some of the more difficult sight reading exercises, we learned how to do our best to make sense of a passage quickly even when we didn't have notes or any other aids really. Finally, I feel really good about identifying the grammatical structures we encounter. I don't have to go diving through Hansen and Quinn for every structure.",
    "This course greatly increased my knowledge of Greek Grammar as well as reading abilities. The two chosen authors (Herodotus and Lucian) had different dialects and styles, which allowed for versatility in reading ability by the end."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was hard and challenging, but ultimately good for me. I wish that I had the opportunity to do more thorough work. I do not think that I improved in sight reading and feel very poorly about my skills in this regard.",
    "This course required a lot of engagement in order to do well and the regular quizzes and questions asked in class were essential in ensuring that I learned the material well. It gave me a really good foundation in Greek grammar and I'm looking forward to exercising it in future classes. The final was slightly too long.",
    "The class was very well organized, and I felt that the quizzes and exams were always fair indicators of our progress. As far as the weaknesses, the pace of the course could perhaps be accelerated.",
    "I wish there had been more work with grammar. Most necessary grammar was covered in L1 and L2, but there were some difficult constructions, like conditionals, that I wish we had drilled harder. The weekend worksheets were alright at doing that, but I wish there had been a more uniform way of learning those grammatical elements.",
    "I don't think that there was anything that the teacher could have done to improve the class. I wish the students were more enthusiastic and cohesive for it being a seminar, but that ultimately isn't something that can be changed externally. The strengths of the class were that it met frequently and had a good mix of review and new material, which we were expected to cover both in and outside of class in about equal proportions.",
    "I think the balance between reading and grammar\/vocab is about right for this level of Greek. We got refreshers on topics as needed, but for the most part we learned in the text, and I think that's what we needed after the grueling grammar instruction of the first year of Greek. I thought the workload was never too demanding, and the selections of readings were really fun. It made it a lot easier to work harder dissecting a passage when I was interested in finding out what it said. Not sure exactly how best to improve the class, nothing really to compare it to. Maybe we could have gone more quickly in the beginning; I think if we were forced to we could have sped up sooner.",
    "This course was excellent in balancing readings with grammar, as well as critical thinking about the texts. It was the perfect level for L3 and as a result I feel very prepared for L4."

   "comments": [
    "I definitely recommend doing Greek. It's a pleasure. This class you get to do some of the serious stuff (Herodotus) and some the weird stuff (Lucian). It's a riot.",
    "If you want to get a really good foundation in Greek you should definitely take this course. Your reading ability will get much better and you will have achieved a lot by the end of semester.",
    "Yes, I would strongly recommend this class to anyone interested in improving their ability to read ancient Greek.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, and the teacher in particular, as a way to strengthen one's Ancient Greek and get exposed to some really delightful literature.",
    "Ultimately, I would. Greek is a challenging language, but it is worth it and it developed a unique analytical skill set, which was exhibited in this class.",
    "If you've taken the Greek leading up, you should definitely take this course. Starting to actually read pages of original Greek makes the labor of the previous semesters feel worth it. If anything it's significantly less of a time commitment than the previous two segments, and the average day is much less stressful and more interesting in class.",
    "I would absolutely encourage all L2 Greek students to continue on with this course."
