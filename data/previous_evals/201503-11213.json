    "Broad study of the meaning of wilderness, history of wilderness, politics of wilderness. Lots of reading, but they are (usually) interesting. Michelle is an awesome teacher",
    "AMST 258 is a great course for anyone interested in a general survey of all American experiences in nature. As a non-amst major, I would say definitely know what you are getting into. Read the syllabus carefully and know that it is not a bunch of Emerson, Leopold, and Thoreau, but the readings are very interesting. I would recommend the course!",
    "An awesome class with a field trip where attendance counts for 15% of your grade. It's a different grad student as professor each year but definitely shop it.",
    "if you can get in, TAKE IT!!!! You will learn so much and come out of this class with a greater understanding of American Studies & environment politics, but also SO.MUCH.MORE. You will discuss race and gender and you will try every day to understand where is the wilderness only to understand in the end that you may never find it but also it is inside of you. You'll go camping and have class dinners and you might visit lesbian vegetarian restaurants. If you're not woke don't take this class though because you won't fully appreciate the diversity therein.",
    "Absolutely! It's dependent on who the professor is--for me, and many other people in the class, Michelle was the reason we loved it so much. It might be hard to get into if you're not American Studies (or Environmental Studies) but shop it anyway! Amazing experience. I'd never taken a course about the wilderness before, nor am I a particularly outdoorsy person, but I still loved the readings. You also get to go on a field trip to an island that Yale owns (classic) and camp with the class. It's an experience unlike any other at Yale.",
    "AA Obviously take it if you can get in. The assignments are a field trip to an island, a nature journal and a paper on anything you want. One of the most fun classes at Yale and you'll actually bond with your classmates and make some friends. A lot depends on the teacher you get, it's an AMST grad student each year, so feel it out the first day. You'll learn a lot if you do the readings, but seminars could become AMST circle-jerks where everyone echoes the same opinions over and over.",
    "Take it!!!! Your class will grow very close, and you will emerge with a wealth of new knowledge, wisdom, friends and a beautiful way of looking at life. Take it!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend AMST 258 to a fellow student -- it will expand your horizons and push you intellectually. It will also cause you to completely reformulate your relationship with the wild.",
    "Take this definitely if you can get in, and if you like whoever the teacher is (each section is taught by a different grad student every semester). Michelle was amazing!!! Very popular class, so priority is given to AMST and EVST upperclassmen. This class covers our theoretical and historical models for engaging with the idea of wilderness (and defining what wilderness means). For example, we examined wilderness preservation history in the US, through the lens of race, gender, queerness, Native American legacies, and others. Very interesting readings. And there are field trips!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Of course, your experience will be shaped by the professor and that changes every year, but the way the class is set up is really awesome and if you can take it you should.",
    "AMST 258 is a unique course. Because of the way the class is structured (class trip\/dinner\/outings) you become really close with your classmates and your professor. The concept of 'wilderness' is also v important to the history of American thought, and this class approaches it from a bunch of useful and interesting perspectives. In the end, it ends up being a little too broad to feel like a full-on comprehension; instead, you emerge beginning to think about the concepts (of wilderness, nature, space, place, etc.)"
