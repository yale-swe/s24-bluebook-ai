    "This is a truly awful course. The labs are designed so that you can't finish before it gets dark outside. The entirety of one lab is spent flipping coins and recording heads or tails. Well before your 50th flip, you will begin to disbelieve that you are in college and are supposed to be learning physics from this exercise. The instructors (not the TAs) are the least helpful instructors I have encountered in my four years at Yale. Instructors are meant to teach students the material and answer their questions, rather than rudely refusing to give them the time of day. Also, this class has extremely nitpicky, arbitrary grading. The lab practical is horrific. The tasks are designed to be unfinishable as well and far beyond the level of difficulty of the entire semester. Physics lab should take a lesson from orgo lab, which was short, fun(!), edifying, and which people generally love. Have you ever heard of anyone loving physics lab? (Rhetorical question)",
    "You probably have to take it but it isn;t bad. It helps reinforce the concepts learned in lecture. The reports are not bad, but it can be a bit unclear what is expected in them at first.",
    "Yes lots of work but a good class",
    "It's a pretty standard-seeming physics lab. The experiments don't take forever, it's 3 hours max in the lab session, and the reports are limited to one page. Be wary of the reports and lab notes though -- while there's not a lot of space to write, you're expected to answer a lot of questions and do calculations in your lab notebook, often times after lab has ended (different from some other lab courses). So watch out for that. Down the stretch, it got pretty annoying to have to do a million error combinations for every measurement we made, but overall the course isn't the worst.",
    "While it may be true that lab write-ups are only a page, you spend so much time working on your lab notebook and fitting all the important information into that one page that it's really a cosmically ironic tease intended to lure you into the notion that lab reports won't take hours, days, or years off of your life.",
    "Yes. This lab would be fun to take whether you're a science person or not!",
    "This course kind of sucks, but it sucks a lot less than other lab courses at Yale. No one who takes this class actually wants to learn anything, as we all do it for premed, and it was cute that the instructors tried to emphasize medical applications of the things we were learning. Also, nice that the lab reports were only a page long - even though they're still just typing up your notes from class (a waste of time). What bothered me was the quizzes (too hard) and the fact that they often weren't on concepts we had covered in physics lecture yet. The practical was unnecessarily rough, and has made me really stress about my grade. My TA was wonderful, but I've heard terrible things from people in other sections. Don't take it unless you have to, and if you have to, be aware that with the way it's graded, a bad TA can really screw you over.",
    "Assuming you're taking it because you have to. It's not that bad.",
    "There were things I liked and disliked in this class-- I would say most students in the class are there to fulfill a requirement.",
    "I would recommend taking it if you have to, but I would not recommend it as a just for fun class.",
    "Relatively painless and sometimes even interesting lab. Yes, mechanics is pain, and experiments will not always work the way they should. Nevertheless, among the drudgery of explaining middle school-level physics, you will learn some actually important skills (namely, how to effectively collect and analyze data while minimizing sources of statistical and systematic error).",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It complements PHYS 170 perfectly in my opinion, since it covers some of the more fundamental physics concepts that 170 seems to skim over or not really cover, while 170 covers more interesting applications that might not be seen in a typical introductory physics class. My TA was amazing and the workload was very manageable. I could see how the class could not be nearly as enjoyable if the TA is bad - the main issue would be with lab notebook grading. However, my experience in the class was great! Only slight negative is the length of lab (usually ended around 4pm, so around 2.5 hours), but this is the case with all labs and I didn't feel like my time was being wasted.",
    "It's a pretty easy lab, the reports are a page and super chill. The TFs are really helpful, so you won't ever feel stressed (which can happen in other labs). Also, your grade doesn't depend on how close you can get to the theoretical value for things, which is nice.",
    "Every week you do a lab on a major concept in intro physics. Most weeks these correspond more or less with what you would be doing in PHYS 170 or 180. The labs themselves are pretty straight-forward in theory but take a long time. The weekly quizzes are short and simple. And the grading on lab notebooks is pretty harsh in my opinion. The lab practical was impossible. I would take it if you have to.",
    "Don't take it on a Friday because it is pretty boring and just takes it out of you.",
    "If you don't have to take a physics lab, there is zero reason to take this class. Go take something else.If you do have to take a physics lab and are deciding between 165 and 205: 165 is relatively straightforward and basic physics (I took Physics 180). The concepts are not hard but don't expect that to mean that this will be an easy class and an easy A. You will have to work and put in a couple of hours each weel",
    "The key is to be as thorough as possible in the lab reports. If you are, you will get high grades. Don;t write anything in the lab report during the actual lab, just take down the data and write up the report later, that way it will be neat, thorough, and organized. the more you write in the reports, the higher grade you will get in the class.",
    "This lab is great to take if you need a physics lab. It's not that much work and you get the credits you need.",
    "Physics 165L complements the things taught in Physics 180. I feel like I was able to get more out of Physics 180 because I took the lab as well. If you enjoy physics, and want to get more out of 180, this is a good way to do it. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who doesn't really like physics, because the labs are long and you really have to like what you're doing, but if you like physics then go for it.",
    "Take it if you have to take a physics lab. Experiments are fun but final practical exam is awful.",
    "very very tedious labwriting the lab notebook was the most important partmake sure to always write insights for each lab",
    "Pretty typical lab course. Most of the work is done in the lab.",
    "Useful course to take. I would recommend it.",
    "A necessary evil if you are pre-med. Your experience will vary based on whether or not you get a good TA. Make sure you are detailed on your lab reports.",
    "Phys 165L should be more than 0.5 credits, like all the other labs at Yale. Lab is 3 hours, you have a one page write-up every week after lab, and a final exam. The final exam is really tough. It basically asks you to integrate all the material from each lab into analyzing a new experiment. It's a pretty chill lab every week though. Gen Chem Lab< Physics Lab< Orgo Lab",
    "Good physics lab course. Lab reports are just a summary of lab notes and procedure (1 page). It was not stressful but still ensured that you knew hat you did in lab and why",
    "This course was straight-up tedious. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking this course, then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably because you have to. I will say that it helped me solidify some concepts, especially the way that fluid dynamics was explained. But the lab handouts were convoluted, and you really had to search for the things that they wanted to be addressed in the lab notebook\/report. There are weekly quizzes (there were maybe two times when there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a quiz) and weekly lab reports. Make sure you address everything they ask for.",
    "This is a good lab to take along with PHYS 180, it helped me a lot in understanding concepts that are harder to conceptualize, like torque and fluids. Lab writeups were tedious though.",
    "If you have to take, yes take it. It is not bad and experiments are pretty interesting. It matches pretty well with 170 with only one or two labs that cover material not in 170. The quizzes are not bad and write-ups either. The final practical is very hard however.",
    "Lots of premed students, so the labs are slightly geared toward medical applications. The change to only page summaries of the lab makes it much easier for students which is nice considering it's only half a credit.",
    "Only if you need it to graduate or for pre-med.",
    "Weekly short, simple multiple choice quizzes on the lab handout for that week's lab to make sure you read it in advance. Then you do the lab, write up the lab notes, and write a one page summary of the lab. Writing up the notes often took me a few hours, but besides that it was fine.",
    "Yup. Not mind-blowing on content but nice to see some concepts in the lab. Error propagation is definitely a pain but nice to know.",
    "Take the class if you need to. Otherwise, stay far way. This class will be an average class for you at best.",
    "It sucks, but it's not a terrible amount of work. Study for the quizzes.",
    "I'm a junior, and this was the only lab I've ever taken at Yale where I was actually finding myself not dreading walking up science hill. Most of the time, I was actually looking forward to it. I think this really depends on your TA though.The weekly lab reports took me some time only because I saved the lab journal writing for after the actual lab. the stuff you do is pretty interestng",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "Great Introductory Physics Lab. Lab reports are short and don't take that much time.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "I thought this was overall one of the best lab's I have taken. The labs were very straightforward and very well written so they were easy to understand. The only problem was that there was no rubric for the lab write-ups so I lost a lot of points on things I didn't know I need to include. This wouldn't have been a problem if I got each lab back before I wrote the next but I got 5 back at once... all with the same points taken off. But other than that flaw I would definitely recommend the course- low stress compared to other labs I have taken",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend it. You're probably taking it because you have to, but it's not bad at all.",
    "PHYS 165L. If you're bad at physics and bad at lab work\/designing experiments, this is the right choice for you. If you don't fall into that category though, I highly suggest you try 205, much less busy work I hear.",
    "Obviously you have to take it if you're even looking. In terms of pre-med, it was way better than gen chem or orgo lab.",
    "Phys 165 is a difficult lab course but not in terms of workload, just concepts. The practical is hard but the lab reports are very manageable.",
    "If you have to take, you have to take it. I can honestly say this lab ruined every Friday..",
    "Be prepared for a difficult lab final - don't expect it to really test your experimental abilities, but rather your ability to derive equations and APPLY physics on the spot. Pick TAs well - some are stricter than others. Not a tough workload on a weekly basis, however.",
    "Yeah take it if you need to. Not an extraordinarily interesting course if you don't need to take it, but if you're pre-med or whatever and need the class, don't dread it! It's not bad at all, and there's not a ton of work.",
    "I think it is the least painful of all the science labs. If you're taking this as a pre-med requirement, its not horrible.",
    "The lab is your introduction to basic physics concepts. To me, it was not that interesting at all. On a spectrum, I would say it was more tolerable than Gen Chem lab, but less tolerable than orgo lab. Make sure you read the lab handouts carefully before turning in your notes - it is very easy to lose points from omitting something that they are specifically looking for you to include. It may not be obvious at first, but the lab notes are where most of your points for the week come from. In other words, focus on the lab notes rather than the lab report.Also, the final practical was extremely difficult. For the entirety of the course, you work with a partner, but you are completely independent on the final.",
    "take it - lab notes are super important. take time to write good, detailed lab notes. quizzes before each lab are easy ways to get points.lab practical is absolutely brutal - so much harder than all of the labs we do throughout the semester. no way to really prepare for it either besides studying old lab notes...",
    "Overall, a very organized lab. It does not really have a lot of overlap with 170 and was clearly designed for 180. However, it's well taught so it's not a huge deal. Lab reports are only 1 page long, but take a deceptively long time to finish. They require thorough calculations and analysis to receive full credit. Also, beware of the quizzes that are multiple choice, but pretty difficult sometimes. Overall though, it's a pretty good course for a lab.",
    "It's not too bad if you have to take it, the instructors make it as painless as possible while providing good physics background. It is however a very tedious lab, but that's probably true of most intro physics labs...",
    "Easy, dull, and frustrating. Experiments are simple and pretty short, and there isn't much work outside of lab. However, the experiments are not interesting, and the grading often seems arbitrary and the standards unclear. Take if you have to.",
    "One of the more painless introductory science labs at Yale. The labs themselves were pretty straightforward, and the lab reports were pretty manageable.",
    "PHYS 165L experience is very dependent on the TA - Luyao Jiang was amazing. If he TAs again, take it with him.",
    "Great intro physics course. Definitely reccomend.",
    "Definitely would recommend taking this if you need a science credit. The instructors are kind, the TA's helpful, and it isn't unpleasantly time crunched like most chem labs are.",
    "It is better than gen chem lab, but the final definitely tests your knowledge, so pay attention and don't rely on your partner too heavily or it will catch up to you.",
    "This isn't a course I'd recommend for fun - the experiments and lab reports, though mercifully short, can nevertheless be very tedious. However, it is a good supplement to the Phys 180 lecture. I found that at least a few of the labs made the lecture content significantly easier to understand. Also, if you just need a physics lab for pre-med, this is a relatively painless way to fill that requirement.",
    "Not the worst lab ever, but pretty painful. Weekly 1-page lab reports, fairly simple quizzes, and a very challenging practical. As always, it depends on who your TA is. Prash is fantastic. This lab is really boring though and makes you do tons of annoying error calculations.",
    "Physics 165L is a standard introductory physics lab. The experiments are not really interesting or enjoyable though. The weekly lab write-ups are kind of tedious even though only one page of summary is required. If you don't have a a good physics background, the labs can be confusing.I would recommend this to anyone who is required to take a physics lab.",
    "I had to take it. Not as bad as gen chem lab.",
    "Terrible lab. Just awful. Take for pre-med. But it's really no fun and not very informative.",
    "Good lab class that's only three hours long. Lab reports are short, thiugh demanding in detail. I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this lab. It is a good introduction to physics concepts, and the instructors have done their best to make it user friendly. There is not a lot of stressing out about little details and it is a nice, casual way to learn some really interesting stuff. Great lab!",
    "The final is terrible, but the lab itself is decent.",
    "Take this is you have an interest in statistics and some physics or if you need a physics lab credit.",
    "You are probably taking this course because you have to and aren't really that interested in physics or physics lab. Despite that, this lab was okay in my book.",
    "It's basically 3 hours of stress a week, compacted in a single visit. The out of class work is minimal and it does reinforce the concepts taught in lecture",
    "Yes! Very doable and rewarding but low-stress lab.",
    "its certainly not a bad or a very challenging course - very feasible. much better than gen chem lab, but then again, anything in this world is better than gen chem lab",
    "I thought Phys 165 was a basic training in lab equipment, lab practice, and fundamental concepts in physics. But I think the most rewarding part of Phys 165 was that it forced me to think (analyze and model) on my feet. I would recommended it for that reason.",
    "Lab reports take a long time and the experiments are extremely boring. Only take if you have to.",
    "Take it if needed, but it's a lot of work for 0.5 credits.",
    "You're probably only taking this because you have to. Some of the labs are sort of interesting, but most are not. Worst thing about the class is the practical exam, which I found to be very difficult even though I made perfect scores on all quizzes and ~53\/55 on each lab report.",
    "Physics lab, you'll take it if you have to.",
    "Yes. The class is definitely helpful in understanding physics. Do take it with the lecture - they go along very well.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to expose yourself to the most basic lab environment. It can tend to be a nit picky at times, but it will teach you the basics of lab while at the same time providing real life-life examples of what you learn in your physics lecture.",
    "Take it because you probably need to. Otherwise, take it if you enjoy doing simple, fun experiments with physics...but expect a lot of writing in lab!",
    "A decent intro lab; you do a variety of (sometimes pretty neat) experiments, and learn a bit about the process of experimentation along the way. Weekly lab reports are tedious, though.",
    "This lab is a lot of work. The labs can be tedious and the write ups\/lab notes take up a lot of time if you want to do well. However, this physics lab really helped reinforce concepts so I'd recommend it if you are going to be taking physics.",
    "PHYS 165L is a great course to take along with PHYS 170 in that it gives you a context for the material being discussed in lecture. It is vital to read the procedures beforehand to be prepared for the quizzes and experiments, and it is vital to examine all your work carefully as you go along.",
    "Very hands on and allows you to see the physics components",
    "It's intro physics lab. You get exactly what you think you're gonna get. The lab reports each week never seemed to get any easier, but that's just a part of the course.",
    "It's not the worst lab, but only take it if you have too. More work than a half-credit course should be, but not the ridiculousness of some half-credit labs at Yale. It's basically all busy work, there's very little learning involved.",
    "Well, if you have to take it as a requirement, then you don't really have a choice, do you?",
    "You probably need to take this for major\/premed. Meets once a week and you write a 1 pagelab report. Thus workload outside of class is very manageable. Practical at end of the term can be tricky. Also weekly short quizzes - which are pretty easy. Lab is also a little shorter than most of the chem\/bio labs which is nice. Some of the labs can be tedious\/boring. Can be frustrating when experiments don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work properly but I guess that mimics real life.",
    "Really a lot of boring work for a half credit. Only take this if you have to",
    "A solid introductory physics lab. I thought lab taught me physics better than my lecture course physics 170.",
    "I would recommend PHYS 165L toanother student if they are either interested in the practical aspects of physics or have to take the class as a requirement. I strongly suggest that the student takes the corresponding physics lecture class because it seems that a lot of the material learned in class is relevant to the lab.",
    "PHYS 165L is a basic intro physics lab course. Just stay on top of the lab reports, and you'll be fine.",
    "Standard physics lab-- the grading on the reports can be rough, but once you learn how to do them they become easier (like orgo lab).",
    "Its a dreadfully tedious class, BUT with AMAZING staff. I would advise taking it if you ned a physics lab requirement, because, honestly, this is how physics labs are meant to be taught.",
    "You probably have to take it. It's hard to make experimental physics fun, and it's not. Standard experiments like springs and bouncy balls and a lot of use of Logger Pro. Not completely miserable but not very fun. Difficult practical at the end of the year, hard to walk out of it not feeling like you failed. A one page report every week, try to get an easy TA. You know they are trying really hard to make it bearable so it's appreciated, it could be hell of a lot worse.",
    "Obviously all of the work they have put in to improve the course has been working, this lab was actually an enjoyable and worthwhile experience, something that can't be said about lab courses in other departments... the workload is extremely manageable and structured in a way to get the maximum value out of it",
    "Yes, you probably have to take it.",
    "I'm guessing this course is required, so just take it. The lab reports aren't that bad, and lab can be fun on rare occasions. Be prepared to teach yourself most of the material covered, as it is not taught in PHYS 170.",
    "Physics 165L is a fun intro physics lab that is quite challenging and a lot of work. I would only recommend this lab if the student needs to take it for premed or for his\/ her major.",
    "Physics 165 L is a nice mechanics lab to take that is in sync with the course PHYS180.",
    "It was required for me.",
    "Take it only if required",
    "It's intro physics lab, plain and simple. If you're a premed, you've gotta take it, if you're an engineer, you've got to take it. Not the sort of course one takes for fun - if you're good at physics, or god forbid actually ENJOY physics, take an upper level lab and save yourself a boring afternoon a week.",
    "It's a good course, although if you're reading this, you probably have to take it anyway",
    "I would recommend this class because I gained a lot from it without a lot of unnecessary work like a lot of lab classes require.",
    "I would really only take this course if it was necessary. All Yale lab courses are a lot of work and time invested for little reward. While I appreciate that the instructorsin this course constantly look for feedback and try to make this a good course, this course was continuously extremely frustrating and always left me in a negative mood. The fact that all writing had to be in the lab notes meant that every session was at least 10 pages of notes, which is beyond what one should have to be writing while simultaneously doing an experiment (more than every other lab course I have taken). I wish that the reports were taken into account as much as the notes were in grading each report. I did think that this course helped me understand physics concepts though.",
    "The labs are not terribly interesting but you will learn basic physics concepts. I would only take it if it were required.",
    "They've done a lot to make this lab more enjoyable and manageable, and it's definitely worked. Lab only takes three hours MAX and lab reports can only be one page long, so they're really not trying to take up all your time! It's really jsut a chance to see physics in action, which makes learning physics (in class) much more fun",
    "Indifferent.",
    "This is a good lab to learn basic lab skills and fill the requirements for Mechanical engineering. A possible downside (if you are looking to explore) is that most of the labs are quite intuitive with their results , and that the next level up in the labs might push the limits of what you're learning in the concurrent physics class (PHYS 180).",
    "Take this course if you have to, if not, don't. It was helpful in pointing out basic physics concepts, but the method used to understand them was a little convoluted and frustrating especially using LoggerPro.",
    "Take if you must, and if you must you're probably pre-med. The labs themselves aren't too difficult, but if something goes wrong with the equipment or your results are completely off, be prepared for a lot of head-scratching and confusion and extra time spent past the 4:30pm time limit. The labs don't correlate exactly with the class so it can get confusing at times. The practical is hell, absolutely terrible, but if everyone thought that then hopefully the curve will be generous. Overall, you can tell that the class has been overhauled and that the instructors truly care about how the lab is for everyone and how to improve, and it's great that the lab reports became only one page long. However, the physics concepts can get confusing so hope for a TA who will take the time to explain everything and prepare yourself for the practical.",
    "Not a bad course. Actually 0.5 credits worth of work--not highly demanding like some labs. Just make sure you figure out what your TA wants in reports and go over your labs briefly before the final. You'll be fine",
    "Required.",
    "Take this lab if you need to, don't take a higher lab level if possible. This lab was a relief for me after general chemistry lab, which by the end of the year has lab reports that take 10 hours.",
    "basic physics lab, much easier than 205, take it if you need to",
    "It was basically providing you with physical examples of the laws of nature studied in an intro physics class. I wouldn't recommend the class to anyone unless it was necessary for them to take it."
