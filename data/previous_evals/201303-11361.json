   "comments": [
    "TAKE IT! IT'S AWESOME!",
    "Definitely take this class if you wish to broaden your understanding of World War II. If you're not interested in being lectured to foran hour and then discussing for the rest of class, don't take the class. If you can do that and participate in discussion afterwards, you will enjoy the course and probably do well.",
    "Take it. It's not too much work and you learn everything basic that you need to know about WWII in Europe",
    "Great class. Really interesting material, engaging and thoughtful professor, and you learn a lot. I really enjoyed the structure of 50 minutes of lecture then 25 of discussion, which makes the class seem like a larger seminar. Not too much work- readings are rather short and interesting and you have lots of freedom with the assignments (film review, test, term paper).",
    "Yes, definitely take it. Hist 202 is a great history couse that touches on an oddly rather unknown area of European History. Regular attendance, short quiz, 2 page film review and a final paper. Brilliant course with a very manageable work load.",
    "Though the content is interesting, the professor can be a bit disorganized which I found detracted from the lectures. But on the plus side, there is only a paper, film review, and a final quiz (which is very specific). Overall, I'm not sure that I'd recommend it to a friend because I personally found the lectures a little dry.",
    "THe effects of wwii on Europe, with themes of occupation, resistance, and collaboration.",
    "Great survey of the wartime experiences of each country in Europe during WWII.",
    "While the subject matter of the course is fascinating, the class was unorganized\u00e2\u0080\u0094 lacking even a coherent schedule\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and lectures consisted of Professor Maragkou merely reading her notes and were incredibly dull. If you are looking for a good WWII class, take Total War.",
    "Sometimes a little repetitive, but good class on an interesting subject.",
    "Nazis are mean.",
    "History 243 02 covers every occupied territory in WWII looking at what the experience was like as a civilian in that country. I would highly recommend this course as a way to better understand current political realities and European culture and legacy. It is a fascinating look into history.",
    "Don't take it if you already have a good background in WWII.",
    "Its an interesting course, that doesn't overwhelm. But you need a good attention span.",
    "I would recommend it, but I hear that it will not be offered again. Great class for students with a European background or WWII family history. It was a nice break from the typical USA-centered humanities courses taught in college."
