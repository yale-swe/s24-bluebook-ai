   "comments": [
    "You learn about the Holocaust through more of a German perspective, rather than the usual Holocaust survivor's, Jew's, or third party onlooker\/researcher's perspective. It's a look through the perspective of Germans who came after the Nazis. You also explore the question of guilt: who should feel it, how much, and for what reason.",
    "This is an amazing class for Freshman who are interested in history and how we look at history through the lens of the Holocaust.",
    "This course deals with fascinating topics such as the Holocaust, tragedies, and memory in history. You learn how to do history through taking the class. The writing assignments are challenging, but you learn a lot through them.",
    "Fantastic course!!! It is quite a lot of reading and a lot of work, but totally worth it. I actually looked forward to going to class and talk about the readings, which were incredibly interesting. Professor Allen is great and super helpful. I would 100% recommend taking this class!",
    "HIst 045 is a fantastic freshman seminar and a great way to learn about a new side of the Holocaust. The curriculum takes you through traditional parts, but also covers the aspect of its affects on German culture. The readings can sometimes be devastating, but they are always interesting and they are definitely manageable. Professor Allen is a tough professor, but she cares about every student and really makes sure that the whole class is getting something out of the course. There is no doubt that other students would enjoy being in a class taught by her.",
    "In this course we learn what it means to learn history and be a historian by learning the history of the Holocaust.It sounds strange but that's really the great thing about this course. Readings that challenge each other show us that history is not one-way,for instance. I would recommend this! I took it as a writing credit, even though there are only 3 papers, so if anyone is looking for a WR but does not want to take english this is a great option!",
    "definitely take it!",
    "Interesting course but not sure that I would recommend it. Know that although it's a history course, it really delves into all aspects of the Holocaust; historical but also psychological and philosophical. Some readings are interesting but others get a bit dull. Pretty large reading courseload. However, some class discussions are quite interesting and Professor Allen puts a lot of time and effort into her students.",
    "Do the readings and speak in class and there is no way you do poorly in the class. The books, except for the one by Arendt, are incredible. They make you ask questions that are sometimes forgotten when we discuss the Holocaust. It is a great course that you will enjoy."
