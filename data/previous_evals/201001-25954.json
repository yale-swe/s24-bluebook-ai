    "It is a delight to read a lot of Chekhov in Russian. The film side of this class isn't as exciting (or as emphasized) as the process of simply reading Chekhov, which is a very worthwhile thing to do. Rita Lipson is a wonderful teacher, and it was a pleasure to have a blend of native Russian speakers and Russian-learners in the class. A highly recommended and intimate course!",
    "Great course. Relatively large amount of work for an L5 language, considering the fact that you have to watch the films in addition to reading Chekhov's short stories. But very manageable, and all the material is very interesting and it makes you think on a different level. Strongly recommend.",
    "A good class, but very different for native and non-native speakers. For a non-native speaker, it is manageable, since Prof. Lipson does a lot to make sure you understand what she is saying in class. Just watch out for the longer readings towards the end of the course. For a native speaker, taking the class for the sake of talking about literature, it can be a bit slow, since it's difficult to express complex ideas when so much focus is put on making sure everyone understands the language. Overall, the class is not that much work - weekly reading responses, 5-page midterm, 10-page final, a 30-min in-class presentation. It's interesting material, Prof. Lipson is an understanding professor... Hopefully next year she will allow more room for open in-class discussion."
