   "comments": [
    "This class is a lot of work, but it's worth it if you want to continue to study french at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it, yes. Although definitely do all your homework, because everyone else in this class is legit",
    "It's a good way to review AP French grammar and to learn a lot of new vocabulary. The class will definitely improve your writing and reading abilities, and your speaking abilities as well. That said, it requires a lot of work to get a lot out of it.",
    "This course is exactly like French 150 just with different stories, movies, and grammar concepts. I think it is a good way to improve all aspects of your French - written, spoken, and listening. I would recommend this class because I found it helpful and fun.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's the final semester of French grammar, and after taking it I finally feel like I have a hold on it. It is a fair amount of work, though, so you should only take it if you are really motivated to improve.",
    "151 is a great course to take if you want to improve your French before going on to French literature and other higher level courses. I highly recommend it to anyone who's willing to put in the work.",
    "Def take it with Francoise Schneider. She is the best.",
    "Fantastic! Curriculum was great, and the professor (mme Schneider) was amazing.",
    "if you don't take it with madame schneider, don't take it. the other professors just don't compare. that said, it's a really good class and your french will improve a lot. the more work you put in, the more you will improve. the main focus is vocabulary and grammar by reading short stories and novels, as well as watching movies. the work load isn't heavy mainly because it's well distributed. you have four tests and five essays spread out. the essays are around 800 words each. theres also two oral presentations which are one-on-one with your professor, and not very intimidating.",
    "Great preparation for immersion",
    "French 151 is a continuation of 150, featuring much the same level of work. You will continue to watch French films, read French novels and short stories, write short French essays, and perform two interviews during the semester. If you are looking to improve your French performance I recommend this class, since that is exactly what the class will do."
