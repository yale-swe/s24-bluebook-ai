    "The project I worked on pertained to CRISPR\/Cas9 technology and optimizing an inducible system. As such, the rotation matter was shifted away from cancer epigenetics, Dr. Yan's field, and more towards biotechnology. Although I gained much insight into molecular cloning, I felt that the experience failed to give me an adequate representation of what it would be like researching cancer epigenetics. Due to the disparity between the rotation project and any potential primary projects in the lab, I was unable to get a grasp on what it would be like working closely with Dr. Yan on an epigenetics-based project.",
    "The rotation is certainly very important for me because it gave me a chance to get to know the environment of a lab and its PI. Before I finally pick up a lab and join it, I can have a brief impression on it. It makes it less possible that I will pick up a lab that I dislike."
