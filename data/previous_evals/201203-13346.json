   "comments": [
    "yes, i would recommend it to another student",
    "Yes - great intro related to issues surrounding the EU. Highly recommended. Didn't know much before going in, but that wasn't the norm for this class...most students have lived in or are from Europe. Cameron is one of the leading scholars in his field so it's really cool to get to hear his insights.",
    "You should take this class if you can get in! I really enjoyed it, although it can be a bit dense at times. The EU is a very complicated entity, but taking this course will certainly help you understand it much better. There is a heavy reading load, but you don't really have to do all of it.",
    "It's an overview of the developments in the European Union as it has developed since its inception in 1957. It's a little dry, but very interesting.",
    "You learn everything about the EU, just at the right level of detail for this kind of class, and you write a paper about what you're interested in. Cameron knows his stuff and really want to stimulate a good convo.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. Professor Cameron is really nice and inspiring. It is a class with a nice work-load an with interesting readings for about 60% of the time. The most interesting part of the course was to evaluate current events through the lenses of the issues that we were discussing, and it gives you an opportunity to remain up to date on the things that are happening in the EU.",
    "Interesting course - worth taking :)",
    "Excellent course but I wish certain students had not talked when they hadn't done the reading about when Tony Blair came to Yale or about their knowledge from other political science courses (seriously, if you haven't done the reading be quiet; I don't want to hear about your vast knowledge of the European Union).",
    "The European Union explored most aspects of contemporary political science on the strange quasi-polity thing that is the EU. Incredibly interesting field when it comes to national sovereignty, nationalism, neoliberal politics, far right groups, postmaterialist values, monetary policy, etc etc. Basically, a thrill ride through all the policies and movements that make up the EU. Prof. Cameron is fantastic--he's willing to meet with you as often as you like to discuss paper topics or just current events, and he's always there, rooting for you. A wonderful professor! I highly recommend this course!!",
    "Take this class if you are interested in the politics of the European Union. Easier class to take if you have a background on the EU. Not too much work, and Professor Cameron is very available for his students. Can be a little dry though, so do not take if you don't find the subject matter interesting."
