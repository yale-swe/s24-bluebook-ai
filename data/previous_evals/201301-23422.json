    "This was hands down the best and most formative educational experience I have ever had. I loved every minute of it, had so much fun on the field trip and after, learned an enormous amount, and was exposed to whole new range of issues and career options that I am eager to consider to study. Karen Seto is AMAZING. She is demanding, but incredible fun. The trip was the biggest adventure of my life! If you get in, do not think twice.I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it is possible to overstate how much I learned and how hugely I expect this experience to shape my future. Getting in to EVST 346 is winning the lottery \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the mega jackpot!I will be forever grateful for this incredible opportunity! This class, I repeat, is PHENOMENAL!",
    "Absolutely! If you have the chance to take this, don't miss the opportunity! You'll become really invested in your project, make connections with classmates, get field work experience, and learn a ton. It is not an easy course in terms of workload though, so do be prepared for that ahead of time!",
    "The trip of a lifetime, and a great academic experience as well; the chance to really form relationships with awesome professors (and peers); don't expect to get really rigorous disciplinary grounding or strict training in specific research methods, but that doesn't really matter because THIS CLASS IS SO FREAKING INCREDIBLE.",
    "EVST 346 is an amazing class and opportunity. You read a lot of academic papers on the topic, and then get to see the theories and observations from these papers on the ground in China and India. The professors are amazing, as are your fellow students, and it is by far the best (and my favorite) class that I've taken at Yale.",
    "Regardless of the ability to travel, this is a class worth taking. Karen Seto and Angel Hsu collapse a wide array of topics into comprehensible lectures and fieldwork. Rarely have I had teachers who care so much about student welfare and output. This would be an especially good class for urbanists looking for international coursework, and environmentalists looking for a varied look at urban growth and processes. Students are co-creators of the curriculum, itinerary, and research projects. This course would be especially good if you already possess current research interests and some knowledge of urban areas in China and\/or India, and even better if you want to pursue senior thesis research.",
    "Karen is the best professor you will have, so take the course. Still, the course is an enormous amount of work, especially with social media. Angel, who co-teaches it, worked a lot for this class. However, she was much less cognizant of student workload than Karen. If I saw Angel was teaching this class again, I would not take the course. She needs more experience and likely should not be teaching an undergraduate course. The course wanted \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeliverables,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the course definitely wanted you to put all your energy and time to get those deliverables.Great experience, ok class.",
    "This course is an incredible experience that imparts real knowledge (#fieldwork). The lectures were extremely interested as Karen is at the forefront of the field. However,I would caution to balance your schedule if you take this class because it takes up a fair amount of time, but is definitely worth it.",
    "Take it if you can get in. The classroom experience is just alright, but the trip was incredible and definitely changed my worldview. Best educational experience of my life.",
    "If this class is being offered, do everything you possibly can to take it.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE IT.",
    "Once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity. I would highly recommend this class if it is offered in the future (definitely should be) and if you are lucky enough to be accepted. I learned so much about these two important countries, the futures of cities and the environment, made life-long friends, formed great relationships with two incredible professors, had an eye-opening travel + field-research experience, and learned so much about myself and what I want to do in the future."
