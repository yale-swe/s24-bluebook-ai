    "Readings in Himalayan Buddhism is a course on the adaptation and development of traditions along Himalayan border regions. There is intense questioning about what defines the \"Himalaya\" as well as about what defines a politico-cultural center versus a border, and there is a good deal of theoretically rich ethnographic material explored and discussed. Research projects of the student's own devising are developed throughout the semester with Andy's help.",
    "Yes, this is a great course. This is not an intro course but if you have taken previous courses on topic, I reccomend you take it."

    "The ethnographic material deals with the cultures I am interested in in my work, and the theoretical frameworks and issues raised were very useful in thinking about those cultures. I'm quite sure I will return to several of the readings in my work going forward, and my project has helped frame my interests for future dissertation work."
