   "comments": [
    "I learned how to interpret epidemiological data and use PSPP\/SPSS to evaluate raw data.",
    "Statistical methods and terms for describing epidemiology research, as well as different research methods that can be used for different ends.",
    "Best course I have ever taken at Yale! I learned a lot about epidemiology and data science, and how to interpret epidemiological data.",
    "I learned how to use SPSS, an important statistical package. I learned a lot about epidemiology, including tons of vocabulary and relevant statistical analyses.",
    "Assorted statistics. Using SPSS. Vocabulary to help you read scientific papers.",
    "Epidemiology & Public Health taught me about the research methods of epidemiological study and also made me a consumer of this research. The final project provided a great opportunity to integrate our knowledge about concepts in the course in a personalized project about a topic of interest.",
    "Great overview of public health and epi concepts.",
    "It was a good attempt at teaching SPSS. Good basis of epidemiological terms and types of studies conducted.",
    "I learned a lot about the statistical analyses and research design involved in epidemiologic research, as well as how to use SPSS and how to think critically about public health research design and results.",
    "I learned a lot about how the field of epidemiology works--how rates and numbers are calculated and interpreted, as well as how to use SPSS.",
    "I learned a wide variety of skills including data\/statistical analysis of epidemeology studies, public health concepts, policy brief writing skills, and grant proposal creating skills.",
    "HLTH 240 gave students exposure to basic epidemiological research skills, and helped us understand, review literature and design our own research.",
    "How to approach reading papers and journals using epidemiological knowledge and terms",
    "Statistical methods",
    "Epidemiology and Public Health allowed me to develop statistical and analytical skills for the fields of epidemiology and public health. I learned about how diseases spread and how to surveillance is practiced and used to understand the spread of disease. I also learned about different types of research study designs, what makes a good study, and how to evaluate study designs. In addition, I learned how to apply my new knowledge and statistical skills in working on the homework and my group's grant presentation.",
    "For those with a strong background in statistics or economics (speaking to GA majors here for a research design credit), the class is a fun expedition to apply those intuitions of endogeneity to health-related grant proposals. Marney makes it fun; the final project makes it real.",
    "It was a nice introduction to Epi.",
    "SPSS, a whole new language in the health field, experiment construction and design",
    "We learned the basics of epidemiology and public health, including important terminology, concepts, and statistical techniques.",
    "I learned a lot about study designs and statistical methods used in epidemiology and public health, as well as a very solid introduction into epidemiology as a field and the types of questions that epidemiologists ask. The material I learned in the course matched well with my expectation of the course based on the syllabus and initial course description. I think the skills and knowledge from the class will be very useful for me going forward into public health\/global health as a field.",
    "Basic epidemiological concepts Ability to read and evaluate a public health research study (journal article, etc.) Ability to think critically about different epidemiological approaches",
    "I acquired the language and statistical knowledge necessary to better understand studies related to public health. I had no background in the subject and found it immensely rewarding. The course provides you with the right mindset to analyze and comprehend epidemiological studies. It's a cool class!",
    "Very useful skills for future research and life in general. Skills in SPSS, designing research studies, identifying confounders and understanding terminology in epidemiological studies",
    "Through this course, I learned the basics of research study design specifically in the field of public health, but the principles are applicable to other kinds of research as well. I also learned some basic statistical principles that I did not know coming into the course.",
    "Very qualitative and applicable skills that I will definitely be using this summer and in the future with public health jobs! Thank you!",
    "This a fun class for an overview of epidemiological concepts. There's some (very) basic stats, work with SPSS, and fun class discussion and engagement with basic concepts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed instructor and textbook. However, I really disliked case days because they were very unstructured and often in a group setting people get ahead or behind one another and its hard to feel like you understand everything when people are pushing you to go forward. While I also understand some things about statistical tests, I feel like my understanding is very surface level and I wish we had more clear guidelines and keys as to how to run every test...like a consolidated list or something!",
    "The cases on Thursdays were fun, and provided a lot of practice, however it felt as if we did not learn as much as we could over the course of a semester.",
    "Strengths - Amazing professor and TAs. Well organized, thoughtful curriculum. Lesson plan makes sense and flows logically. Weaknesses - Breezes through statistical knowledge. Would make an SPSS-based statistics course a mandatory requirement.",
    "This course was not as engaging as I'd hoped. The expectations were somewhat unclear, so I wasn't sure what information from the lectures were critical to remember, and what was superfluous. The case studies required more guidance, in my opinion.",
    "Marney is a good profesor, but the class is not great. There are a lot of interesting applications of the material but she picked very boring ones. The final project was very interesting, and I wish our case studies had been more like that. Strengths are that Marney is enthusiastic and cares about her students and it has very small workload.",
    "The days in which we did case studies were interesting and engaging and the projects also presented a great opportunity to apply concepts from the lectures and case studies. The lectures, however, were sometimes a little hard to follow. In future iterations of the course, it might be interesting to integrate the lectures and cases to enhance the learning experience.",
    "A great class; fascinating material, clear expectations, fair grading, cases every week.",
    "There should be a Statistics requirement for the course. I did not have a Stats background and struggled tremendously with the SPSS program. Professor White basically introduced the concept but did not lead us through it and there was a lot of confusion and it was VERY easy to fall behind, which many people did.",
    "I think a strength of this course was Professor White's teaching style and the fact that we learned how to use SPSS. I also liked that we emphasized how to think critically about results and how to analyze significance\/meaningfulness of results really useful skills. However, I think time was wasted during the group work days, and I felt that there was some disconnect between what was taught in lecture\/on psets and what was testing during exams, especially on the take-home final.",
    "I thought the course was very flexible and designed to be low stress which I really liked. I wished that the lectures had gone slower and been more thorough in making sure we really understood a concept before moving on.",
    "Strengths include the collaborative nature of case study work and the meaningful problem sets and assignments and support learning. One area of improvement could be a slightly larger focus on public policy.",
    "The class is very broad, which is both a strength and a weakness. Because of the varied background\/experiences of students, we didn't go too in-depth about statistical approaches or tests. Cases on thursday could be more focused or more cohesive.",
    "Strengths--great interaction. Professor White and the teaching fellows made Epidemiology a highly interactive and welcoming course. The assessments were varied and fair, which I appreciated. Weaknesses--the lectures. I find it disappointing that it took a professor over half-way through the semester to realize that posting slides was actually helpful. Not posting the lectures was severely detrimental to my learning through a large portion of the course and most other students had this same sentiment. I hope that future students taking this course will not have to suffer the way that we did because it was absolutely unnecessary not to post the slides, particularly with the speed that Professor White lectured.",
    "An amazing course, for everyone from beginners to public health and people more experienced in the field. The variety between lectures and group work really helped keep students engaged. The homework assignments and in-class lab work never felt like busy work, but were super helpful in absorbing the material and really processing it. The material itself is so fascinating and incredibly relevant (even for people who might not think its their cup of tea at first), and Professor White and the TAs are a large part of what make this class so amazing.",
    "I thought it could be boring at times but we learned about topics that you aren't typically taught in other classes.",
    "This course was a fantastic way to gain a deeper understanding of the fields of epidemiology and public health, specifically how to apply statistical and analytical knowledge in a practical way. I thought the case studies were a helpful way to further develop my skills while also practicing collaborative learning. The group presentation project was also a great way to demonstrate how much we learned during the course. Professor White and the teaching fellows, Addie and Steve, were also awesome to learn from and work with during class. They were helpful, caring, and intelligent. Although it wasn't a problem for me because I previously had taken a statistics course, I think that one of the only weaknesses was the lack of detailed SPSS work.",
    "It would have been useful to spend a little more time going over the stats in class.",
    "I think statistics should be a pre-requistie for this class. I had taken stats but it would have been hard without that background. I also think making stats a pre-req would give the class the opportunity to go more in depth with analysis. More explanations of how to use SPSS would have been very helpful (maybe add a section devoted to learning SPSS?) The class was engaging overall and I felt like I had actual skills especially after the final product. As a global health fellow, I will use what I learned to do my research next summer.",
    "Professor White was absolutely fantastic. I loved everything about this course and wouldn't change anything.",
    "I thought the course was excellent overall and have few complaints. The material was relevant, direct, and specific and the assignments were generally fair. Professor White was insightful, approachable, and eager to help students. My only complaint would have been that lecture was fast paced and it was usually very difficult to keep up with what was being said while scrambling to also jot down the information on the slides. Thankfully, Professor White later made the lecture slides available to us--which made it much more rewarding\/doable to engage with her during lecture while not worrying about missing anything.",
    "This course had fantastic potential and Professor White is amazing, however, I believe that statistics should have been a prerequisite. Also, many of the case studies weren't finished in class, and I believe that doing them together as a class or having one tutorial day and then a case study day would be much more helpful. Also, while I respect that the final does a good job asking to demonstrate what we learned in class, the amount expected to be done throughout the final was a little absurd, and it was misleading to say that one didnt need to study for the exam.",
    "biggest strength of the course is the availability of the prof and the TA's. they are kind and very helpful. the exams are fair and the p-sets are manageable, the course is well organized and enjoyable.",
    "Strength: the lectures! The engaging nature of the lectures are what made me take this class.",
    "The course is well-organized with one lecture and one case study day each week, making it easy to learn concepts and then apply them. Lessons and assignments built well upon each other. Overall, I saw very few weaknesses of the course. More feedback on assignments and tests would have been appreciated. At times it was difficult to determine how well I was understanding the course material simply from receiving grades back on Canvas with little feedback from TFs.",
    "The class has a large emphasis on student interaction and engagement, which is refreshing for a lecture. The class could use some restructuring with respect to the statistics; statistics should either be more fully taught or scrapped, because the middle-ground I think has left some students very confused about the statistics involved."

   "comments": [
    "Dr. White is a great instructor and having this understanding of health statistics is important to be a critical consumer of data.",
    "Best class I have ever taken at Yale. I was always engaged and learned so much.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in the content, regardless of whether you're a global health scholar. Professor White is really great, super quirky and engaging. Having cases every Thursday breaks up the monotony of constant lectures. The homework and midterms were very doable. A nice low key class where you learn some very interesting and potentially useful things.",
    "Yes, I would. It was worth the occasional dud lecture because the topic was so interesting.",
    "I would if you are looking for an easy class that teaches useful skills. Good for second semester senior. As a freshman, I regretted taking it instead of something that would fill distributional requirements or major requirements.",
    "I would recommend this class if students want to learn about the statistical and research methods that underlie epidemiology. Instead of learning about epidemiology, this class focuses on how to study epidemiology.",
    "Definitely take it! Marney is great and it's low key but still interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course ONLY IF you have taken Statistics before and if you have a strong desire to learn more about epidemiological studies.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to learn how to interpret and think critically about public health data and results. It is also a good chance to become familiar with epidemiologic statistical analysis techniques and SPSS in a relatively relaxed setting. However, expect to put in the time to do the problem sets and to prepare for examinations, and the final take-home was more difficult than anticipated (compared to previous examinations).",
    "Wouldn't take it again. Use of SPSS was not thorough enough for a beginner to feel comfortable with. Overall not a very exciting course. Marney is very nice and super approachable, but almost all of the data is catered to her interests (food aversions\/ eating disorders) If I had known the class would have been so specifically focused on food aversions I would have taken a different public health course. The material wasn't very interesting (to me personally) and not very enlightening of other public health issues.",
    "Marney is great and the class is well designed, with lecture once a week and a case day the other class period, which breaks things up nicely. If you are interested in the subject and possibly want to go into public health\/take MPH classes, this seems like it is a good intro. There is a little more QR skill involved than anticipated, but nothing unreasonable.",
    "Yes, I would. This class has helped me understand how to interpret public health \/ epidemiology studies and how to analyze\/test data. These are skills that will help me immensely in the future.",
    "Yes, it's a good introduction to epidemiology. though it isn't too in-depth, it can be challenging, and you get out of the class what you put in.",
    "I would recommend this course for students who are interested in public health. Yet, for beginners, you will definitely need to keep up with all the readings!",
    "Great introduction to epidemiology! Very interactive and engaging course. Professor White and the teaching fellows are incredible",
    "YES! Take this course! Super fascinating lectures, Thursday labs add variety, Professor White is hilarious and the TAs are so helpful and understanding.",
    "This class was not as interesting as I expected it to be, and was a significant workload at times. You do learn skills that you are aren't taught in other classes which I found to be worthwhile, and Marney cares about her students way more than most professors at Yale which makes you want to engage more with the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The course gives an in-depth and practical look at the application of statistics to the fields of epidemiology and public health. Its hands-on and collaborative approach to learning was also a great change of pace from the typical lecture. I also think the approach provided a better way to learn. The material was great and the instructors were fantastic, so I would recommend the class to anyone interested in global health, public health, epidemiology, medicine, or statistics.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in global health or application of statistics to public health issues and solutions.",
    "Absolutely fantastic research design course. An opportunity for the economist to step toward science. Everyone deserves a professor with Marney's charm.",
    "Highly recommended. If you don't get in the first time, do try again and you'll get preference. Most of the students in the class (~20-25 at a time) are in the global health scholars program, and they are very invested in learning the course content, and this creates a positive and engaged atmosphere in the class. Professor Marney White is wonderful.",
    "Yes although only if you have taken stats!",
    "Absolutely take this course, Professor White was hilarious and intelligent and clearly cared about student well-being, a rarity among Yale professors. Take any class she teaches!",
    "Yes; I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone interested in public health\/epidemiology. It will give you a solid grounding in the actual practical skills necessary to carry out research questions or design studies for public health questions. Even if one isn't interested in actually doing research, the content of the class is important for understanding papers and other people's public health work. The statistical methods that are part of the course are also very application-driven; you learn how to use basic statistical software for common needs that may arise in typical research studies, without having to really know any of the math, coding, or probability that may go into it. Useful for non-public health data analysis as well! (Also, Professor White is fantastic; she's accessible, energetic, and very knowledgeable. She tailors the course to facilitate student learning and understands that Yale students are also human. She does her best to not create undue stress while also fostering learning--and I would say she completely succeeds in this).",
    "Definitely take this class if you're at all interested in how public health affects our daily lives! The statistical skills I've gained help a lot with understanding public health issues you read about in journal articles and in mass media. Super relevant, and Professor White is fun and engaging. Class was a great mixture of lecture and learning through doing.",
    "This class is great. I had no background in the subject prior to taking the course and I felt like this was a great way to expose myself to the field. Prof. White is superb and the course is interesting and well organized and fair. 10\/10 would recommend. I took it just to fulfill my global affairs research design requirement and ended up loving it!",
    "Yes! Dr. White is an incredible teacher and has so much wisdom to impart on her students.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student at all interested in public or global health research. It is also a great way to fulfill the research design credit requirement for the Global Affairs major. Professor White's lectures are engaging, and the case study practices each Thursday help develop technical and analytical skills. No background in statistics is required, and I was fine without it, but many students had previous experience with statistics. Professor White is great and clearly cares about each student, making a point to learn names, keep in contact, encourage self-care inside and outside the classroom, and much more.",
    "A niche skill set but very applicable and necessary if you are interested in public health careers! However...this class doesn't require Stats experience but as someone who had none, I felt very at a disadvantage and wish that someone had warned me of this! Some stats concepts are assumed to be intuitive but I struggled with them.",
    "This is a fun class if you think you may be interested in epidemiology. Professor White makes the class extremely engaging, in a way that is rewarding for a Yale class."
