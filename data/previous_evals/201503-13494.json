   "comments": [
    "Strengths: - important and really interesting material - professor is awesome - material will help immensely with future coursework and any work in the area of public health Weaknesses: - having class once a week was not so great. Should be twice a week and for less time - grading was a little messed up our year due to a prior incident the year before",
    "I found this class incredibly helpful and interesting. The hard skills which are imbued into it are excellent (Markov models, Excel, decision trees), but moreover, I felt that the class gave me a lens with which I could view problems. Dr Paltiel is also an amazing instructor and helpful for learning the material.",
    "This class is a good introduction to cost-effectiveness analysis. A lot of hands-on problems that we can try out. But it is also a simplification of problems you might encounter in clinical research.",
    "Cost effectiveness analysis is fundamental for public health practice. The way the course evaluate the uncertainty and probability fascinates me.",
    "strength: dr paltiel. he has so much experience\/knowledge\/stories and is very personable. Content is also fabulous-- variety of math, policy, etc. very useful content. cons: quiz format, quiz spacing, went incredibly slow in the beginning on basic topics and then sped up really fast in the middle.",
    "very good. useful course.",
    "great lecturer. in class quizzes did not work because having a timed assessment to make these calculations was not realistic. having scheduled TA sessions per week would have been helpful to go over practice problems or review examples from class. having excels sheet available to follow along in class was very important having video and audio was great so we can review calculation steps in class having a concise handout on calculations steps for incremental cost analysis calculation would be helpful",
    "Great introduction to operation research",
    "Great course, only negative would be the structure of the quizzes and how they interrupted the flow of the class. I imagine this will be remedied in the future.",
    "I really like the opportunity to watch class videos online, which helped me a lot for the preparation to the tests.",
    "I know I would have liked\/ benefitted from this course if I had had more time to digest the material. Paltiel knows that this semester was structured poorly and went to great lengths to fix it as much as he could. I learned good skills and have a great understanding of cost effectiveness analyses, but I think I would have been more seasoned or skilled in the practice of it given a different testing structure.",
    "The class gets very difficult when teaching the Excel part of the class. I wish there was a better way to teach that. I also wish he would have showed less of his personal case and complicated subjects and more of how we could apply it to new problems\/organizational problems.",
    "Great course. I learned a lot of important things that I wouldn't get in any other class. Highly recommend it for everyone, especially people who are not policy\/management",
    "I thought the professor was fantastic. He was engaging and it was quite obvious he put a lot of work into the course.",
    "It is the most wonderful class i took this year. Very helpful and enlighten.",
    "The course was completed disrupted by the new form of exams taken. I wish I could take this course again as I feel like I would greatly benefit from a different structure.",
    "Strengths: professor is great and homework is very helpful! Weaknesses: the in-class quizzes and exams were not conducive for truly testing our knowledge. Additionally, a major driver for me to take the class was to improve my excel skills, which I was told from previous students was very possible in the class due to the nature of the take-home exams. However, as the format was changed this year, it was not relevant to learn the course material using excel as I was required to do it by hand on the quizzes. I am in strong support of re-introducing take-home exams to let students apply skills to larger magnitude problems and let us mull over the material to truly engage with the inherent difficulties of assessing the value of a life.",
    "Weaknesses: test structure, time of day the class was held, grading scheme Strengths: very engaging instructor, important topic to understand",
    "It was great! The grading scheme definitely messed with the flow of the class this semester.",
    "Interesting subject matter, but as David was well aware, the grading scheme had significant issues. Returning to a take home exam system next year so that students have more time to think about the questions should fix those problems. The case studies were helpful, but sometimes class spent too much time reviewing them. It would have been helpful to review the case studies, but also see a slightly different example in class so that we get a better idea of the slightly different ways the information can be presented. Later in the class, the sessions in excel could get confusing quickly. Slides documenting what the different steps accomplish would be helpful. More examples of how these principles are applied in published literature would also add to the class.",
    "One thing you might consider is still assigning the in depth mid-term and final and allowing people to work in groups of 2 or 3 if you are worried about cheating. This way, we would have gotten exposure to the problems that previous courses were exposed to which are probably more similar to real-world situations. Never am I going to do a cost-effective analysis by hand, and I didn't learn how to do a cost-effective analysis using software. If you did this, you could give quizzes like you gave this year (perhaps 2) in addition to the take home assignments to test individual knowledge of concepts. One of them could be during finals week as to not cut in to class time, and the other could be mid-semester. If I were you, I wouldn't rule out going back to your old way of teaching though. This seemed to be effective, and from discussions with others, they really seemed to think that they got a lot out of these examinations. You should not feel guilty for getting people in trouble for cheating. The rules are explicitly stated, and if people want to cheat, then they do run a risk of being caught. Because of what they did and you feeling guilty about the consequences they had to face, the entire class of 50 plus students learned very little this semester. Our learning has suffered because of those individuals and this simply is not fair. You should not penalize our learning based on the actions of former students. Also, your grading distribution should be made clear at the start of the semester. This is the only course I have taken in which getting a 90 or above is not considered honors. No other course I have taken at YSPH uses a grade distribution to calculate honors. I am not saying that no other course does this, but if the instructor does do this, it is extremely rare. Additionally, I don't think it's fair that people who got a 92 in the course vs people who got a 70 in the course got the same grade. There should be a distinction between high pass and pass.",
    "Great course, I really liked the homework. I wish we could have taken the test at home rather than in-class. There is not enough time for the test and a regular course session in a class that meets once per week",
    "Strengths: Application of material to the real-world Weakness: More difficult for those without an intuitive understanding of the material. It would would be great to have more practice problems.",
    "Great class! Really cool blend of theory and practical examples from Paltiel's own work.",
    "This course provides a systematic and logical approach to making health care decisions. The homeworks are well-designed and help a lot to understand the methods taught in class. I would think more leverage should be placed on homeworks in order to encourage students fully involve in the homeworks. For some important topics, much too less class time is spent on them. For example, the spreadsheet manipulation of MCMC. So I would think two class meetings per week might be better to cover all the interesting topics.",
    "I think that the professor is already aware of the limitation of the course in the way that it was taught this year-- having in class tests did not feel like I was getting challenged to think and really grapple with the problems. I would have greatly preferred a harder take home testing system.",
    "This was a great class. I wish the instructor were less difficult to engage with outside of class, but TA office hours were sufficiency to pass the class and lecturers were excellent.",
    "I think that this is one of the best\/most valuable courses that I have taken at YSPH. I understand that this year was a bit of an experiment with the grading scheme but I think the course material was very interesting regardless of the issues with grading. I thought that the first exam was a little unfair and didn't necessarily capture my mastery of the material. I thought that the remaining two exams were more fair. If we continue with the quiz structure, I think it is important to make the quizzes shorter in length. They currently felt like midterms rather than 3 smaller quizzes. Having lecture right before the quiz is also ineffective because most students are not listening to lecture. If quizzes are one problem for 30 minutes, then lecture could happen right after the quiz with new material. The timing of the quizzes should also be improved so that they are more spread out.",
    "You learn a lot in the class. STRENGTHS - The homework cases, though laborious, were really helpful - The structure of the class is really well done. Making us do homeworks beforehand and then going through it in class makes us better prepared - I like how the cases were essentially pass or fail WEAKNESSES - Quizzes (but this was addressed) - Would it be better to separate the class into 2? Have a lecture portion with David and then have a TA led section to go over the homework?",
    "I think that weve all established the non-ideal exam situation of this semester, so I wont go into that too much. I really enjoyed the content of the class for the first half of the semester, and felt like I was getting a lot out of it. The exams were nicely spread out and the cases were gone over for the most part during class up until the mid point of the semester. I felt like after the mid point, possibly due to the timing of exam 3, things seemed more disjointed and class time seemed diminished (from exams and from time spent talking about how the class could be improved). I imagine that in other years the momentum from the first part carries through. Re: people cheatingI honestly dont think that courses should be changed in order to prevent cheating. Its absurd that the format needed to be changed to prevent people from cheating. We are in graduate school, and if people are going to cheat, then they probably shouldnt be here. The rest of usthe vast majorityshouldnt receive a lesser education because of them.",
    "EXCELLENT COURSE! THE BEST QUANTITATIVE CLASS I'VE TAKEN AT YALE!",
    "Good course which introduces several tools to do cost-effectiveness analyses.",
    "Very interesting and fundamental course to understand costeffectiveness analysis. I would recommend this course to other students definitely.",
    "strengths: sufficient depth of very important topics covered how to improve: I didn't like that the homework assignments were based on material to be covered in the next lecture--assignments that should take 1 hours at the most ended up taking 2-3 hours because I would have to go through the process of learning the material myself",
    "This course was very very interesting. I took it for the regulatory affairs track and because I am a policy concentrator. The course was among the most difficult classes I have ever taken but Jinyi was an excellent TA and deserves a lot of credit, and Dr. Paltiel was very amenable to student feedback, for which I am very grateful.",
    "Great material, digestible. Actually applicable and relevant information.",
    "Strengths: passionate professor who is very knowledgable and incredibly inspiring Weakness: the structure of the course (in class quizzes did not work)",
    "I know that this year was a trial year for the in-class quizzes, so it will be modified, but I definitely think that I took a lot less away from the course than I could have in the second half of the course because of the way that class was very excel based but then the quiz would not be. I also feel like the first half of the class we had a lot of discussion about the homework problems which was helpful where the second half of the course we didn't spend a lot of time on the cases, so things seemed less connected. A lot of class time was spent discussing issues that the class had which I thought was unfortunate.",
    "I loved this course. The content offered tactical skills that could be relevant to our professional trajectories. Cases and lecture material stimulated the brain; I used some complex problem solving skills not done in other courses. Although the grading scheme (quizzes) became somewhat of an issue for the course, I thought it did the best given the circumstances. I do wish that we had optional section (separate from office hours) that offered more structured practice problem sets; similar to what HPM 586 does. I learned so much from this course regardless, and hope to take similar courses next semester.",
    "Strengths: The instructor, his passion for the topic, and the case studies he uses in class. Not grading the weekly cases is also brilliant. I found myself devoting almost 8 hours a week to the homework because I loved the topic, not because I was afraid of failing the course.",
    "Strengths: Professor Paltiel and the material. See below on Professor Paltiel, but he makes the class. The material is well thought-out. the problem sets guide students through the concepts, allowing us to work through the material incrementally and teach it to ourselves. Weaknesses: the evolving course structure. It was depressing that we needed to navigate the new course set-up because Yale students couldn't handle take-home exams. I've been in other programs and classes at Yale and elsewhere, and take-home exams are common. It's frustrating that students had to ruin this. It felt like we spent an inordinate amount of time talking about evaluations or taking the evaluations, and it bogged down the material. I was surprised so many people CARED about the grades and the structure rather than getting a chance to learn the material. It was also a challenge handling the wide variety of backgrounds and experience levels in the class. The course and professor handled it as well as could be expected. For my (selfish) purposes, it would have been great if there was a 20 person seminar \"Advanced Topics in Decision Making and Cost-Effectiveness...\" Where we could sink our teeth into these issues, and try our hand at raw analyses.",
    "I took this course as one of my precious electives and was really let down by how much I actually got out of it.",
    "I truly enjoyed going to class - not just because of the material, but also because the professor was always so entertaining, engaging, and enthusiastic. I've never had a professor who has cared so much about having his students' input in order to improve the course. As the professor acknowledged, I didn't like the testing\/exam structure. And I felt like the case studies could have been a little more challenging. I liked how they weren't graded. And I still don't understand why we couldn't ask the TA's for help with the case studies until after we had already turned it in. I didn't like how the course was only once a week and was for 2 hours with no break. It would be nice if in the future we could meet twice a week for 75 minutes or so. It was also great how Prof. Paltiel provided us with so many resources for learning the course material. Though, more practice problems for the quizzes would have been nice.",
    "The strengths were that lectures\/topics were very interesting and it was a class that I wanted to attend every week. The homework assignments were challenging but fun and enjoyable, I liked having homework graded as pass\/fail based on effort. If the instructor decides to keep in-class exams, then I would suggest giving more time to complete them or making them shorter.",
    "Great class- great examples and learned skills I will likely use in future.",
    "Fantastic course. The quiz structure was challenging, but professor was very responsive to student feedback. Strengths: reviewing homework problems during class time Weakness: sometimes topics seemed tangential\/off-topic",
    "strengths: lecture is engaging; most of the cases are challenging but do-able weaknesses: we spent too much time discussing things of 'an administrative nature' and missed opportunities for learning; because of past students' compromised academic integrity we were not allowed take-home exams, which would be the appropriate way to work through the second half of the course; grading scheme that it was invented during the last week of the course ways to improve: have 1 case every week; improve the quality of the readings (the legibility); allow for some take home examinations; have a transparent grading scheme that is communicated clearly in the syllabus",
    "Loved this course, the professor is fantastic, he routinely uses humor and real life situations to convey relevant information. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning how to apply cost effective analysis and decision making. The course was modified to reflect student feedback, and I understood the overall goals was to have us learn the material. I would suggest that office hours be moved from the end of the week (Friday) to after the weekend (Mon-Wed) because most of the time I didn't look at the homework that was due until the weekend, and by then any questions I had could not be addressed in TA office hours. I do note that the professor and TAs were highly responsive to email, and willing to meet at other times, however, to accommodate this, but setting up a special meeting for a homework clarification seemed to be overkill.",
    "I really enjoyed the course. I was a big fan of the case assignments before each lecture - the class was so much more engaging and interesting, and i gained so much more when I came in having struggled a little bit with the material by myself first. While the quizzes threw of the professor and therefore the course, I think the course was still really important and helpful - I would love to take another course with Professor Paltiel!",
    "I like having the opportunity to try out the material before covering subject matter in class, I feel this really gives folks the opportunity to digest the material.",
    "helpful! strength - practical and well taught; weakness - i would've liked to learn more, but it didn't seem to take advantage of our entire class time very well. it could've also been more challenging.",
    "Very amazing class. Learned a lot about efficient analysis, where to start, and where to take it. VIDEO RECORDING IS A GREAT +! I forgot something? Something is unclear in lecture? JUST WATCH IT AND GET IT!",
    "This course is very well-organized and very applicable to all fields in public health. It provides new tools to looking at policy issues and was very fun in indeed. I did not see any major weaknesses.",
    "A very interesting and useful course with great applications.",
    "I really enjoyed this course, especially since I had no prior knowledge on this topic. However, the timed in-class quizzes were difficult and may not have been the most effective way to test us on the material. My main concern is that since a lot of emphasis was placed on preparing for quizzes, we had less practice in applying the techniques\/conducting the analyses in excel.",
    "This is one of the best, most organized courses I have taken at Yale. Each week we were assigned readings, which correlated exactly to the homework problems, and explained VERY clearly how to perform the homework problems. Then, the lectures went over the homework and correlated extremely well with both the lectures and homework. Lastly, the quizzes were EXACTLY like the homework--we were even given practice quizzes in advance. The organization of this class was VERY tight, streamlined, easy to understand, and objective based so that each week we acquired a new tool to add to our skill set. The grading was extremely fair in that it perfectly reflected what we did in class and for homework. There were never any surprises. I feel like this course had very clear goals regarding what skills I was to learn during the semester, and was perfectly designed to help me acquire those skills.",
    "Learning was a pleasurable experience owing to the faculty , assistants and course material was comprehensive with sufficient supplementary readings.",
    "Great"

    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Dr. Paltiel is among the strongest professors YSPH has to offer. His confidence makes learning the material so much better. Although I struggled through the course he lifted my spirits and encouraged me to push through.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0David does a great job as a teacher. Very rare at the university level to find someone who cares so much about you actually LEARNING. Loved that he uses the board for decision trees. Weakness - I really wish you would have just given us quiz 4 as a take home.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0FANTASTIC instructor. Incredibly engaging even at 4:30 pm in the afternoon.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0I appreciate that he was generally very honest and open with us and receptive to feedback. He is an engaging lecturer as well.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0What an amazing professor. He engages the students, and creates such a fun lecture environment that truly fosters effective learning. There are none quite like him, and I'm appreciative to have learned from him.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Strength: His humor and vast knowledge of the subject. He can answer any question posed to him and he is really resourceful. Probably my favorite instructor of the semester. He truly deserved the applause he received at the end of the course. Weakness: The instructor's sensitivity to student feedback is too much... to the point that it affects the quality of his class. We could have used the time he spent apologizing to the class for the evaluation methods to learn more! Weakness: Although it's not such a big problem, I think it's noteworthy. Dr. Paltiel gets so excited about the subject that he doesn't let students finish their thoughts when they are participating in class. Many students perceive this as him being rude and it negatively impacts their ability to ask questions in class.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Professor Paltiel is great. His passion for the material is infectious, and his sense of humor lightens the subject nicely. He does a good job of interacting with the students, even in a large classroom. He clearly cares about the students' perspective, and is responsive to feedback. He sometimes may have been a little too responsive to some vocal students regarding difficulty and length of quizes (which further limited our lecture time).",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0He is a great, engaging instructor. He created an environment in which we were comfortable asking questions about the material. Although he is flexible, he doesn't respond well to criticism but gets really defensive. The grading system that he created didn't seem fair. He admitted that the exams were not suited to fair evaluations but lumped those with low grades with those with grades in the 90s. I lost the large majority of my points on ONE question on ONE exam because because although I answered the question correctly, he wanted three reasons for something but without indicating he wanted three and with the short timeframe, I only put one. This cost me enough points to drop a grade level to a high pass and put me in the category with those that failed some of their exams. I don't understand how that is fair. I would have loved to discuss it with him but he shot down another student in class when she tried to bring it up so I know it would have been a futile effort. He really disappointed us in that aspect.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0AMAZING - I wish all my professors were like Prof. Paltiel!!! So hilarious, so brilliant, such a fantastic teacher!! I loved how he made the material in class relevant to the public health world beyond academia. That's actually been among my biggest frustrations with YSPH - the curriculum\/professors seem very focused on research and preparing their students for the same. But Prof. Paltiel is different (though it could also be that the nature of this course lends itself more to careers outside of academia).",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Dr. Paltiel is a great lecturer and keeps the class engaged. I like that he uses examples of his own work.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Dr. Paltiel is incredibly sensitive to students' needs.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Absolutely my favorite professor at Yale and arguably in my higher education. He is engaging, attentive to student needs, and hilarious. He makes very dense topics understandable and relatable to students.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0David is an engaging lecturer and does a good job at explaining concepts in an understandable way. His biggest weakness is his lack of self-awareness. He spent a lot of time apologizing to the class and asking for how things could be improved\/remedied. He acted as if he had our best interests in mind, yet overall he seemed to fail to actually improve any of the negative situations that arose during the course of the semester.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Awesome. Keep up the humor and frank feedback components, he's the best and most involved professor I've taken a class with at Yale.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Very thoughtful and funny professor. He was really invested in making sure we had a good grasp of the materials and was very sensitive to how his teaching and testing affected us.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Great instructor, makes course material exciting and accessible to those who are not naturally inclined to thinking in this way.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0strength- hilarious, engaging, and well-organized; weakness - class time not used to its fullest",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0One of the best professors I have ever had in my life. Very helpful. Very insightful. Very friendly and open. A perfect example of what a professor should be like. Learned a lot from his teaching style and instruction. VIDEO RECORDING IS A GREAT +! I forgot something? Something is unclear in lecture? JUST WATCH IT AND GET IT!",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Professor Paltiel is one of the most engaging and caring professors I have ever had. He is enthusiastic about the material and it was a joy to sit in class. He is a skilled professor and was able to effectively and clearly communicate the material.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Professor Paltiel is amazing, and he never failed to make class interesting, fun, and worthwhile.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0The instructor is very knowledgeable about the course material, and very engaging.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Awesome!",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Dr Paltiel is one of the best instructors I have ever had, period. He is passionate about the topics and methods, he is a VERY engaging lecturer, and he sincerely cares about the students and the teaching process. Each week he would receive feedback from the students and try to update content, methods, style accordingly. He was extremely adaptive and responsive. Unfortunately, I did feel very bad for him because I thought the course was perfectly organized and I really enjoyed the \"4 Quiz\/No Final\" system and thought it was very fair (maybe even TOO generous); however, there were still people who complained about the grading system and the material, which I did not understand at all. Dr Paltiel provided just about the most comprehensive and cohesive set of lectures and learning materials I've ever seen (this includes my experiences in undergrad, medical school, and residency), provided great answer keys to all homework and practice quizzes, and then gave us in-class quizzes which were almost exactly like the above materials. There were no surprises at all. I don't see what people could possibly complain about, other than they maybe just wished they had had a higher grade--which is ridiculous and unrealistic. Dr Paltiel was amazing, but it's impossible to please everyone, though he went way out of his way to try to do so. I just wish he taught more of my classes.",
