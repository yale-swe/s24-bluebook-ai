    "Write 15-page papers for 3 of the 5 labs and do a presentation at the end of the year for one lab. This should be a writing credit, you will learn better writing skills here than any other writing requirement Yale makes you take. Fight for it, MechE majors! We don't have course space and time for some philosophy bull...writing can be sceintific, and needs to be that way for us!!!!",
    "Lab sections are pretty fun, lectures are about the same as mat sci. Pretty low workload: three lab reports written with a partner over the whole semester. Can definitely be taken even as a 5.5th credit.",
    "The class itself isn't too much work, if you don't let it pile up to the end. Most people come in with a solid foundation in materials science (having taken MENG 280) but don't let that deter you from taking the class! You learn a lot and the TA's are always willing to help you out.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you are really interested in materials science. It is an interesting course once you get into the labs, but the report writing is condensed into a too short period of time, especially given the revisions you are expected to make.",
    "Basically this is a class that teaches you how to write fifteen page lab reports. The work load is not heavy but you have to be responsible and keep track of it, otherwise you'll end up writing three fifteen page lab reports at the end of the semester. You don't need to know material science before hand because he goes over everything you need to know in class. If you're ABET you have to take it anyway, so take it early, it'll help you in your future classes. Even if you're not ABET, the class teaches you have to effectively write research papers and do scientific presentations. Compared to other mechanical engineering classes, pretty light. Definitely recommend.",
    "A course that is very interesting, but it can be a little tricky to follow the grading rubric and the necessary format of the lab reports. It taught me a lot about material properties and how to manipulate them through first hand experience which was very valuable. I do recommend this class but be ready to spend a lot of time on writing and rewriting reports.",
    "Yeah sure, I would recommend this course. The lab work is often interesting and cool, and in the scheme of MENG courses or lab courses, this one is not that much work. If you've taken MENG 285: Intro Materials Science, the lectures will be almost entirely review. I ended up skipping quite a few but never fell behind. Just keep in mind, though, that all the work for this course is concentrated in three weeks of frantic lab reports. Three weeks, three lab reports, tons of data crunching, 45 pages of writing. Sure, you get to write the reports with a partner, but still, it's a lot for those three weeks.",
    "It's a lot of work and all of the work is frustrating. You do learn some interesting things, especially after you've studied them in 285. But it is too much of a headache for half a credit and you never really know what's going on in class.",
    "The lab reports (3x15 page of 1.5spacing) could be pretty tedious but for a lab, I actually really enjoyed this class.",
    "MENG 286L is the laboratory for materials science. Every week there are either lectures, which are boring if you have taken the prerequisites, or lab sessions. The TAs for the lab sessions are great. The only work for the course is three reports, which take a lot of time to prepare, and a presentation. Pretty much all of the work is concentrated after spring break, and there is a lot of feedback, but none about grades. I thought this was a good course overall, definitely preferable to a general physics lab and probably more practical.",
    "I was petrified of doing labs at college, but this was by far the best one I could have imagined! The TA's actually care about their subject material, Prof. Schroers is at the cutting edge of the subject and they all help to make the labs interesting and fun! You get feedback on your lab reports and learn how to present your results properly given the context."
