    "A truly life-changing experience in terms of studying literature and understanding humans as narrative beings.Great selection of readings and very well constructed syllabus, alternatively good and bad lectures.Mrs Fradinger does a unique (yeah, there is no other word) in running her section, and that also is a great experience to have.Work load is very manageable.",
    "The course was well-structured and the texts selected for the syllabus created a very cohesive whole that helped us examine the different forms of narrative. I would say some of the lectures were not up to par though. The lecture on writing papers (given after we had already submitted our first paper) seemed to instill more questions in us rather than satisfy or readily improve our writing. Also, it is a little difficult to gain a substantial interpretation of a text when the course is team-taught: each professor seems to interpret the text slightly differently, and while this could be a good thing, often it led to slightly confused discussion sections. Yet, it was helpful when lecturers explicitly introduced broad topics\/issues that could be dealt with in section.Moira was one of the good professors out of the team of Litr 120 professors. She carried discussion section well and her lectures were pretty much to the point. However, (and this might be more a problem with our section than with her) I felt that our section became a bit too excessive. We were having extra sections (on Beyond the Pleasure Principle by Freud -- so on pretty dense material) starting at 10 at night, extra work concerning peer-editing on papers, etc. We had a section dinner at her house, which was very sweet of her to do, but lasted about 5 hours and continued past 12:00am on a Sunday night. Of course, I'm not sure if this was our section, but it often seemed that being in this section forced us to put more work into this class because of the expectations put on us. In short, Moira was a great lecturer and professor, but did seem to pick her favorites and forget that we have lives outside of the Litr 120 section.",
    "Yes--but only if Moira Fradinger is teaching it and you can get into her section or, if you must for another reason, if you are planning to major in literature. In other cases: FRESHMEN PLANNING TO MAJOR IN LITERATURE - wait until sophomore (or junior) year, and take it with Moira (class will be much, much, much more rewarding if you do); NON-LITERATURE MAJORS (especially thoselooking for a writing credit) - Moira will make you work, and will give you as much feedback for papers as any English class, but you have three papers (rather than six), you get to read things like Sherlock Holmes and Fairy Tales, and midterm season has films rather than reading, which is a godsend.",
    "Your experience will probably vary depending on whose section you're placed into, but nonetheless, it's a great course. Meets twice a week, one day is a big lecture, the other day is a smaller section with a PROFESSOR, not a TA. Explores different types of narratives and how they progress. Much more interesting than it sounds. Three papers--5, 7, 10 pages, not bad at all. They'll write themselves and you'll have no problem meeting the word counts if you have productive sections.",
    "This is a pretty disorganized class. The lectures range from exasperating to very boring to good, and the sections often become opportunities for people to repeat what the teacher is saying in different ways. Be prepared to face a lot of deconstructionism in the teaching of the course. I learnt a lot less about narrative per se than I imagined I would.",
    "Yes. It's a requirement for the lit major but I'd also recommend it for non-majors.",
    "If you're a lit major, you're stuck. Try to get into a good section, otherwise yorue dooooomed."
