    "A very good introductory course to the world of research in Quantum information and computation.I would recommend it because it is simply enriching.",
    "This course is an introductory one to a student majored in quantum information, it covers almost every hot spot in the current research. I strongly recommend it to every fellow student, because in addition to some basic ideas of what's happening in the field, it also includes some techniques of kicking a problem in a theorist's way.",
    "Of course yes, especially to students who are interested in quantum information theories.",
    "PHYS601 is a wonderful overview of the theory of quantum computing. If you want to spend a lot of time and energy understanding the theory, go for it. You won't spend much time talking about experimental procedures. You will cover many topics, and there's only so much depth you can explore in each in the time that you have."

    "I have done a little research in this field in the past, and this has opened new windows for me to try out related topics in the field.",
    "The course is directly related to my research and helps me a lot.",
    "This course cannot be more important, regarding my research.",
    "I took this class thinking that it would prepare me for my summer research in a quantum computing lab. Truthfully, I learned a lot in the class that isn't directly pertinent to my research in the lab. But it is useful context."
