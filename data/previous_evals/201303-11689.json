    "This was a wonderful course to take, David Evans and Marie-Louise Timmermans are delightful professors, and the class is extremely relevant and insightful. As a non-science major, I came in to the class excited to learn about the topics covered, while also wary about how I would fare in a class like this. I learned a lot about VERY interesting, current, and relevant topics that I probably wouldn't have learned anywhere else\/on my own. Not only that, but it was really awesome to have weekly lectures from the environmental studies\/geology departments, which I would have otherwise probably never explored. This course was particularly great as a first-semester in college experience because working through really scientific, jargon-filled papers has given me the confidence to attack these kinds of papers with confidence, even if I'm not an authority on the topic. I find myself constantly looking for the original sources when reading a news article, and constantly questioning the validity of arguments that claim to have scientific backing. I have learned that science is not a static field, and that it is as exciting and ever-changing as the social sciences. I am extremely happy I got the opportunity to take this class.",
    "Loved this class. It's an excellent introduction to a variety of topics related to environmental studies and geology. Each week we had a guest presentation on subjects ranging from plate tectonics to geo-engineering in Bangladesh. Dave Evans and Mary-Louise are awesome professors too.",
    "Geology and Geophysics 010 01 is a relatively relaxed course, and it can be as much or as little as you want. While there is a low time and work commitment, the resources provided for you by the professors and guest lecturers are astonishing. It is an eye-opening, thoughtful course that I highly recommend. As a pre-Environmental Science Major, I recommend this to those in the sciences, but also those who are not. It is a comprehensive, easy to understand view of the climate that I think all people should have. I also learned how to extract important information and conclusions from scientific papers - an invaluable skill.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for students who are looking for a general introduction to EVST and who are eager to improve their scientific writing skills.",
    "This is a very interesting class regardless of your past experience with science. The discussion in class is very accommodating to students with all levels of science experience. I would recommend this class if you are interested in this area but don't want to focus too much on one aspect of it.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student with even a vague interest in the environment and energy, and Earth's place in the universe. The workload was very manageable and the professors were terrific. I feel as though I've learned how to glean current information regarding the earth's climate from primary sources as opposed to media interpretations, which I think is really valuable.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to a fellow student. it is probably the best intro class to things like earth science, environmental studies, and environmental engineering because it covers SO MUCH and it covers really cool, specific things like exoplanets and marine plankton fossils! It is also really good for meeting other professors if you're looking for labs or classes to take. The work load is light, but you still manage to get good at reading dense scientific papers. My favorite class of the semester by far!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone with an interest in the environment or the history of the earth. This class covers one topic a week where you review and analyze a few scientific summaries or research papers, receive a lecture from one of the leaders in the field, and then get to discuss your take on the papers and lecture. The topics are all very interesting and if one week doesn't really interest you then the next week probably will.",
    "I would recommend this class because the professors are awesome and there isn't a lot of homework, nor are there any tests. There are guest lecturers every week on various topics, making the class even more interesting."
