   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class to those who are committed to learning Chinese and have the time to commit. It's not a huge workload, but there are a lot of vocabulary words to learn. The book this semester goes over a lot more sensitive issues (in China), like government corruption, the discrimination of rural farmers, and the hukou system. It was a lot more interesting than the lessons last semester.",
    "More Chinese, fewer classes, more vocab. If you've done Chinese before, the drill is very similar and adaptable. Lots of writing. if you want improvement, be willing to put in the effort. Recommended for students with good baseline skills in all four language skills.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it. This is an advanced class that is essentially a reading-and-discussion based overview of modern Chinese issues. The readings are pretty challenging, and there is a lot of homework, essay writing, presentations, and long, hard exams. However, these things are good for your language skills. This year I was one of the few non-heritage students taking this class, and although it can be hard taking the class with a bunch of native speakers, its actually the best environment to improve your Chinese. Su laoshi is an epic professor with many whimsical and fascinating tales, with a very serious academic approach to writing. Get to know him and learn from him to get the most out of his classes.",
    "This class was a lot more organized and structured than 163 last semester, and it helped that there were only five people in the class, so everyone had the opportunity to participate a lot. Professor Su kept the class entertainingwith his funny\/interesting stories. One thing I didn't like was that the dictation and presentation were always on the same day, so I would spend a lot of time the night before preparing for them and usually wasn't able to do as well on the dictation as I had hoped since I spent so much time preparing for the presentation. Also, the tests were excessively long and always had one fill-in-the-blank section that used vocabulary that we had never learned in class, which was annoying. Besides that, I generally enjoyed the class, and Professor Su is just a really dynamic teacher.",
    "Yes! There are 9 chapters in the textbook and each chapter averages ~100 new vocabulary terms so this course will definitely boost your Chinese vocabulary. The textbook centers around problems China has been experiencing - government corruption, environmental pollution, significant rural\/urban income gap, etc. - so it will keep you up-to-date on Chinese current events."
