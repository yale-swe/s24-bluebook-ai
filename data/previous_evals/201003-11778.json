    "If Pilar is teaching, take it! I'm sure that the class is great in any case, but I know certainly that taking the class with Pilar will guarantee a memorable, wonderful, educational experience.",
    "Span 145 is great! The beginning is mostly review of L3 but soon the pace picks up and within the semester you learn basically all the grammar there is to know. Also you get to read many short stories, watch films, have class discussions and read a short novel. If you put the work into it you will learn a lot - a very rewarding experience. Maria Pilar Asensio is awesome - she makes classes fun, varied and time flies by. Definitely my favorite class this semester!",
    "Yes. The course strengthens oral speaking skills.",
    "The great thing about this course is that there are fewer students (8 versus 15) than in either Spanish 3 or 4.",
    "I am really glad I took this course. I suspect I am better at speaking Spanish now than I would be at the end of a normal L3 and L4 track. Pilar is great, and she makes the time pass pretty quickly. I didn't have time to do anything beyond the required amount of work, but the people who did a little extra studying on the side really benefited from it. Make sure you keep on top of the homework."
