    "I very fast approach to learning to blow glass scientifically. Difficult, but fun.",
    "If you value your time for the research, don't take this course. But if you appreciate the handcraft of glassblowing. Go ahead to enjoy this old-fashion art. I took this course just for fun.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is fun and interesting as well as challenging. The only bad thing is that you will probably accidentally burn yourself a few times. But burns heal. Appreciation of glassblowing is forever. Making the projects is fun, hanging out in the glass shop with Daryl is fun. You appreciate everything in your lab so much more, and it's a very important and all to frequently overlooked skill to understand for a career in chemistry or biology.",
    "Chemistry 565 is an excellent class, as much because of the wonderful Darryl Smith as the interesting subject matter.",
    "If you have time and are willing to get up early, take this class. You learn to work with glass!",
    "essential skills of any scientist.... simply a must take kind of course",
    "I would recommend this course if you took an interest in glass blowing from a scientific perspective."
