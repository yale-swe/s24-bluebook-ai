    "You have to take this, so...take it?",
    "This class meets once a month to \"keep you on track\" with your senior essay. It doesn't really do that though because its usually just people talking about their \"plans\" for their project. The meeting with the head of the writing center is helpful however.",
    "Meets a few times during the semester. More than anything, it is a way to ensure that you'll get stuff done as you approach the deadline of your Senior Thesis. I personally found it more rewarding since my other classes provided research material for my Senior Thesis. It is not a rigorous class. You have to submit a bibliographic essay in October and 15 pages (of whatever material\/information\/research you have done) in December. The amount of work done depends on how organized and committed you are. You can easily go through the semester without doing much work, but what's the point of that? Take the class to give you a structured environment to get stuff done.",
    "This course has added little to the process of researching and writing my senior essay. All structure, feedback, and ideas have been contributed by my advisor. The American Studies department needs to decide whether this course should be a structured, robust contribution to the senior essay (which I'm not sure is possible given how different everyone's projects are), or whether people would be better off using this time on their own.",
    "If you're doing an essay, you don't have a choice. It's really not a big deal, and the deadlines help you keep on course.",
    "It was really nice that this was not a weekly class and gave us the freedom to work on our project on our own, but I wish there was more direction provided, and instruction in how to thinkabout a senior thesis: time management, how to think about dividing chapters, what sort of mix of primary\/secondary sources, etc.",
    "I would summarize it as a class that has given me some deadlines and ideas through brainstorming, but that I don't feel has been extremely helpful.",
    "This class is a great opportunity to be inspired by other people's projects and network amongst other American Studies majors. I would recommend it to future majors.",
    "Take it because you'll get credit while researching and working on your thesis or project. Tisha is a great person to talk to about that stuff, and she'll be able to point you in the direction of lots of helpful resources. But whenever the seminar actually meets it's more or less a waste of time."
