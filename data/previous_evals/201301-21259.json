    "One of the most useful classes. Would definitely recommend it to other students.",

    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student, as not only is the material beautiful, but the exercises were often quite fulfilling. Granted, the hints were sometimes excessive, but on the whole I quite enjoyed doing problem sets each week.",
    "This is a very demanding course. If we really want to improve your mathematical skills, then the course is important and recommended. If you are not willing to work hard - forget it."
