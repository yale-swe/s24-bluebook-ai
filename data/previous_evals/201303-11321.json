    "This is a standard fiction workshop. Every week, you read short stories and answer writing exercises. Class time is devoted to workshops: critical discussions of your classmates' stories. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in writing short stories. I was really happy with the feedback I got from my fellow students and I thought that even in a short period of time, I could trace improvement in my writing. It's a fun class to take!",
    "This is a great class to take whatever level of writing you're at. There are actually a lot of senior english majors\/experienced writers in this class, but there are also a few beginners (like me) just getting their bearings. I took this class credit\/D and wish I hadn't because I could have gotten so much more out of this class and would probably be prouder of the work I'd produced if I'd put in the time and effort of knowing I'd be graded.",
    "This course was special because of the people around the table and the professor who brought them there. Over a semester, you're tasked to produce weekly exercises, to read assigned stories, and to write a total of three stories (one can be a major revision).This is a course for the itching writer, the cowardly and the brave, the poet looking for a new form, the restless, the scientist, the adventurer, the collector of love stories, the curious and whoever seeks the solace of writing fiction.",
    "Excellent introduction to fiction writing. Structured as many writing courses at Yale. At the end of the day, writing courses depend on how much you click with the professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend Engl 245 to another student. It's a truly fantastic course.",
    "Yes, all hesitant writers need Colleen in their lives.",
    "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible to offer a recommendation for or against ENGL 245 based on our experience this semester. I think it is fairly unlikely that Colleen Kinder will teach this class again, and Leslie Woodard, of course, alas, will never teach it again. If you want to write fiction and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much experience, 245 is a good place to start. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard good things about Emily Barton (Hopkins). Colleen is sharp, insightful, inspiringly committed to getting her students to care about their own writing and getting them to continue to write; she has a warm, youthful presence. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend her in general as an instructor, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more on her home turf with travel writingrather than fiction."
