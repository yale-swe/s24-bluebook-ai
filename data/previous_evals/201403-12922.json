   "comments": [
    "It was a low load class that didn't require much work besides weekly online homework assignments and tests. I would recommend this to someone hesitant about taking German.",
    "It's a good intro level language, but you cannot get behind or you will be swamped.",
    "This class was really great! You start by building up basic German vocabulary and pick up new grammatical structures one by one at a reasonable pace. The culture and activities are also really interesting to learn about. A great way to throw yourself into the language in a fun and meaningful way.",
    "Definitely take German! The course load is not too heavy and you absorb most of the material in class. Annika is an amazing professor and was always super helpful.",
    "A good introduction to the basics of german grammar and culture, providing a solid foundation for further learning. I would recommend this class. It both includes necessary grammar as well as vocabulary for preparing for higher level learning, but also being able to speak and listen at a rudimentary level.",
    "It is a rewarding class if you keep up with the work. The homework is regular and doable, though if you get behind there will be a lot of catch up. It amazed me how much I learned in just a semester!"
