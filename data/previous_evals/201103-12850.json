    "A lot of new vocabulary - expect mini quizzes each day. Homework takes a good 30 minutes or longer, even for a heritage speaker.I would recommend CHNS 132 only to someone who is willing to take on the workload.",
    "Take the class if you want to improve your Chinese and learn great key phrases in intermediate Chinese. Make sure you have the time to do daily homework and memorize about 15 words a day, consecutively and cumulatively. The class isn't difficult, however, and the hardest part for me was the grammar construction. This class differs from 122 in that you focus more on grammar and less on character strokes and memorization of character writing. Focus is more on reading and sentence construction. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "take it. if you're serious about learning chinese, you'll love this class. totally worth the work when you realize how much you've learned.",
    "Basically be prepared for an extremely intense, difficult class where a lot of the learning you do can only be accomplished through repetition and memorization. I know that's the case with all language classes, but this class takes it to another level. Don't take this class if you don't have a lot of time to devote to it on a regular basis (...daily quizzes 10%, two homeworks a week 15%). But you'll see your Chinese improve in terms of reading and writing. Watch out for the exams 50%--your first test grade will probably be your highest.",
    "I think that Chinese 132 is an overall okay class. The teachers aren't great, the grading is annoying (especially compared to L1 and L2) and the way it's structured makes it hard if you don't already speak well. I didn't think L1 and L2 were hard, but I definitely hit a wall 2\/3 of the way through L3.",
    "Yes! I recommend this class to any heritage speakers (i.e. you took some Chinese school before college, you speak at home) because I found it to be at the perfect level. I know already how to speak conversationally, but the grammar and vocab I learned really boosted my Chinese skills and moved at the right pace for me. Also, I made lots of friends since it's a small class with people you can easily connect to.",
    "Definitely take it if you're from a heritage background. If you're not, try to get in, you'll learn so much more than from white people chinese!!!",
    "Overall, the workload is significantly greater than that of L1 and L2 but the class is just as significant and helpful in mastering Chinese. Make no mistake, the tests are hard and you are expected to memorize and incorporate very advanced sentence structures. Rumor has it that this class gets more advanced than L5 for regular kids.The teachers are great and extremely helpful. As long as you set aside an hour or hour and half each day for this class, it shouldn't be too hard to succeed.",
    "Chinese 132 is an intensive language class for native speakers who are serious about improving their grasp of the language. Be prepared for daily homework and an A you have to work for. The class moves quickly--you'll learn a lot in a short amount of time. This fast pace also means you need to be organized and an effective time manager.",
    "I would definitely suggest this class if you're seriously interested in learning Chinese. I came into this class able to understand Chinese pretty well but essentially illiterate, but feel like I've left with a much better overall grasp on the language. It helps that you have quizzes everyday (which can become a bit of a pain but I think it was worth it in the end) - it helps you learn quite a few vocabulary words. Xu Laoshi and Xiao Laoshi are really understanding and helpful if you reach out to them. It was really a LOT of work, but this class was one of my favorite classes of the semester.",
    "Chinese 132 was perfect for me. My speaking and listening comprehension were very good, but I knew few characters and couldn't write at all. This class really filled in the gaps in my knowledge. If you dedicate a chunk of time each day for the quizzes and homework, and stay diligent throughout the semester, you will do well.",
    "Yes, but make sure your Chinese skills are up to par.",
    "Yes. Xu laoshi is awesome, but the other teacher Xiao laoshi needs some more experience and more English understanding. But definitely take it with Xu laoshi- she's funny and nice and frantic. I learned a lot.",
    "It's required if you choose Chinese to fulfill your language requirement. It's a lot harder than L1 and L2, since the material is focused more on learning formal\/written vocabulary. However, it's still pretty easy to get through, and I'd take it to fulfill my language requirement."
