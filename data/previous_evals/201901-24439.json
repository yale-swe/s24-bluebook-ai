    "Pace couldve been slightly faster. But its a senior seminar, so its fine.",
    "Very understanding professor and willing to work at the pace of any one in the class. Good review in first half of semester. Could be improved by spending more time on latter half of material and more clear lecture format. Though Prof. Igami clearly cared about his students, sometimes the lectures were not as straightforward as they could have been. Lectures could be improved by more clear instruction, rather than just working through the steps in class.",
    "Grading and evaluations could be clearer. So could expectations.",
    "I think that more time spent on applications of econometric skills would be more effective, especially since I felt like I learned a lot in the last few weeks just from studying the papers."
