   "comments": [
    "Our class only had 6 people, so it was impossible to hide and easy to ask questions. The movies were long and not that helpful, but the conversation partners were a great way to practice Spanish in a low stakes situation.",
    "Strengths: I really appreciated the variety of learning resources in the curriculum, from the online homework quizzes to the movies. In the classroom, I really benefited from the partner exercises and the level of attention\/dedication that the professor gave to each student. I also found the textbook to be really comprehensive and useful. Weaknesses: Homework load was a bit tedious at times. I also hoped we could spend more time discussing the readings\/movies during class because I did not always understand them clearly when I read them by myself.",
    "Strengths: does a good job of teaching grammar Weaknesses: some of the homework is repetitive and feels like busy work"

   "comments": [
    "This class had a lot of work that sometimes felt a little bit tedious. But if you're committed to improving Spanish grammar, I would really recommend it.",
    "I'd 100% recommend this course, especially to non-native Spanish learners looking to improve their writing skills. I felt that this course was a good fit for me since I had previously studied Spanish in high school, so it was not only a great review of grammar concepts that I was already somewhat familiar with, but also an opportunity to study it more in greater depth. Additionally, the engaging professor and wide variety of resources heavily influenced my impression.",
    "Definitely, take it with Professor Seymour, she is the greatest!",
    "Lots of busy work. If you take it, take it credit\/D. Seymour is an excellent professor.",
    "Yes, it's good for building a strong grammatical foundation"
