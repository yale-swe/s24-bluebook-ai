   "comments": [
    "A multifaceted perspective on a very complicated phenomenon. You read fascinating studies and have even better discussions. You learn how to connect studies and results to real-life phenomena.",
    "You'll learn all of the important theories concerning intergroup relations, bias, prejudice, and discrimination. You prepare a few readings each week for class, and one week out of the semester, you and a partner present on the readings. You're the class leader on the week's given topic. Midterm paper and final paper all revolve around the project. You basically design a study that focuses on prejudice, and you write that up.",
    "I learned a lot about the psychological processes of prejudice. I also learned about ways to combat prejudice, which made me more hopeful than I had been about the state of race relations.",
    "I learned a lot about social psychological approaches to prejudice, racial discrimination, and more.",
    "I developed my ability to empathize with people and see where they are coming from. I developed self restraint and the freedom to ask questions of the ones who were always questioning things.",
    "How to approach the world as it becomes increasingly polarized and divided politically and as we continue to challenge systemic biases against people based on race, gender, ses, sexuality, gender expression, etc",
    "This class brought to light a lot of new ways to think about discrimination and prejudice and how people can rationalize it and fight against it. From a psychological perspective, it was fascinating to see the different ways that groups behave and how that can affect things like politics."

   "comments": [
    "The format was PERFECT. I learned so much from the material as well as from my classmates and professor. Amazing!",
    "Strengths: learning the theories around prejudice. Professor Richeson knows her stuff! She is a baller in the social psychology field. Weaknesses: two hour seminar goes by really slowly, and when the semester is drawing to an end, you become less engaged.",
    "I liked the format of us all talking about the articles every day, and connecting it to real life experiences. It was helpful to have time I'm class to talk about our real world projects in class.",
    "I love the format of the class which is led by students giving presentations on the readings with plenty of time for discussion. I think it lends itself well to meeting once per week, and professor Richeson does a great job of mediating discussion.",
    "I thought the readings were really interesting, but at some points discussion did not really relate to assigned articles and studies we read. But, I will say that I think the discussion format was really informative, talking about the findings and how they applied to our lives or informed the ways we thought about our social surroundings.",
    "The course can be developed to encompass other points of view which might not necessarily be a reflection of the demographics gathered in the room at any given time. More kindness and compassion should be injected into discourse. Classes should end on a hopeful note about the possibility of some change or understanding.",
    "Incredible class. Very engaging, keep up with exciting and thought-provoking research and literature.",
    "We talked about so many theories which made the course feel very comprehensive. However, I must admit that I would have preferred more professor led discussion, rather than having students teach in each class meeting."

   "comments": [
    "100% yes! Everyone at Yale should take this course. The material is so important and the delivery is superb",
    "Wonderful course. Great overview of the relevant social psychology literature and the emphasis on future research is inspiring.",
    "Yes. Take it for Professor Richeson and the cool topics you'll learn about regarding intergrouo relations\/bias\/prejudice.",
    "This class is a wonderful opportunity to learn about a really interesting and important element of psychology. Definitely a great class to take!!",
    "1. This course encourages you to think critically about the mechanism that create, reinforce, and dismantle prejudice. Rather than rely on feeling, the course encourages relying on fact. Beyond that, the material shows one how we are all implicated in the mechanisms that foster our own or others' oppression. 2. Professor Richeson emphasizes the importance of empirical proof, while also acknowledging the intangibility of certain things. 3. It is a brilliant class and she is a brilliant professor. 4. Professor Richeson breathes life into the material and encourages you to get excited about class each week. She is very clearly invested in the content, but she is just as invested in the students.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any and every student at Yale. Prejudice takes an incredible number of forms, some very noticeable and some hardly noticeable at all. Getting together each week to discuss the origins and manifestations of prejudice gave me such a stronger understanding of the way people function in groups and the ways we can work to dismantle systems of prejudice that are incredibly relevant to todays society.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course! It was very enlightening and engaging, and Professor Richeson is brilliant! She really engages with her students and values their input, also realizes that we have lives outside of the classroom and appreciates that too.",
    "I would but encourage them to take it with a grain of salt. The discussions were not always the most easy to digest or contribute fully to.",
    "Fantastic class. Prof Richeson is so cool and will push the way you think and approach the world. It will also equip you with a new understanding of people and how to approach conversations with people different from yourself. Great class. Definitely take it. Engages incredibly well with the world we are living in.",
    "This class is so wonderful and Professor Richeson is a delight! You will be challenged to really assess your own worldviews and the way you interact with others, but it is totally worth it."
