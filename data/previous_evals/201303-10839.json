   "comments": [
    "I had never taken a class on Latin America before, but having prior knowledge isn't necessary in order to enjoy Prof. Joseph's seminar. It focuses on the Cold War period, but you learn the history of each country we study as part of the class. It took a little while for things to ramp up, but by the time we got to the Nicaraguan case study (arguably the best and most in-depth discussions we had), it became more interesting because you can draw parallels between the various countries. Professor Joseph really couldn't be nicer. Grading is 1\/3 journal (to go with weekly readings), 1\/3 class participation, and 1\/3 final paper -- very manageable.",
    "Would definitely recommend. It's incredible. You get a stellar crash course in Latin American history and a good alternative of Cold War history that completely disrupts the neo-conservative viewpoints of most historians, as championed by John Gaddis. The work done for the course is pretty extensive; lots of reading, a journal due in early November that's about 20 pages long, and a final research paper of similar length. But it's all worth it - I have no regrets.",
    "This is a good class. The subject matter is really interesting and Joseph is a great professor. He lines up really great films to watch and every week is an interesting discussion on a new period in Latin American history. Really helps you to understand the time period and the influences in Latin America from the late 60s all the way up to the present.",
    "Take it. This class should probably be renamed \"20th century history of Latin America.\" Incredible course, wonderful materials (especially the movies), great discussion. Information that every student should have that is continually ignored by US history courses.",
    "Tremendous seminar. Maybe the best class I've taken at Yale. If you can get in, you would be a fool not to take it.",
    "committed professor, very interesting syllabus, great movies. I think the course moves a bit too quickly and it can be hard to get your bearings each week as you move to a new country. but very worthwhile.",
    "This class is, as the course title suggests, a study of various Latin American revolutions in the 20th century. We focused much more on Nicaragua than any of the other counties and I feel like I really got to know the Sandinista reign very well. I'd recommend it to other students who are interested in how recent conflicts of the 20th century have affected current day affairs or Latin America. It's a good amount of reading assigned every week but only a 15-20 page journal that if you keep up with throughout the semester, is fine, and a 15-20 page final paper to decide your grade. A lot of the people in the class had very relevant ties to Latin America and I found it somewhat intimidating at the beginning during class discussions, but prior knowledge of Latin America really is not necessary to the course, so take it if you're interested!",
    "A fantastic class and a wonderful complement to Gaddis' Cold War class (they're nothing alike, but anyone who has taken Gaddis would be a fool to not get this perspective). The readings are interesting, the class dynamic is strong, Professor Joseph is kind and knowledgeable, and the workload is manageable. Take it if you get in -- you won't regret it.",
    "Realize that there is a LOT of reading but if you're into the topic it's doable.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Not only is Gil Joseph one of the best and kindest professors at Yale, but you will learn an incredible amount about revolution in Cold War Latin America. TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. The work load is very manageable and the class readings and weekly movies are fantastic. TAKE IT.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this class. Make sure that you actually do the journal as the semester progresses instead of all at the due date because it will be a much more fulfilling experience.",
    "Great class, great professor, great people and great discussions",
    "Yes, if you are interested in a heavily oriented political history of a more contemporary Latin America, then take it. Professor Joseph is very knowledgable and a fantastic resource, so getting to spend a semester with him is a real treat.",
    "Professor Joseph is a great, approachable instructor. He carefully crafts the syllabus and class discussion and incorporates interesting films into the coursework as well. The assignments are rewarding and fair (a class presentation, a journal for the first half of the semester, and a final essay).",
    "Good seminar, especially if looking for rest of the world. Interesting material."
