   "comments": [
    "This is a great class if you want a relatively easy 5th course, but where you will actually learn some interesting things and want to attend the lectures instead of just skipping them! He makes it fascinating and makes you want to be there, so I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "Intro archaeology course. You learn about the methods in archaeology and some famous findings. Its interesting and not a heavy workload.",
    "I would recommend Hoaxes to a student who is prepared to actually have to work because this class is not a gut! The material is interesting and the work is very limited, but the tests and paper are not graded easily. The professor is cool though and the subject matter is enjoyable most of the time.",
    "This was a GREAT course that covered a very interesting variety of topics and case studies. This course was an eye-opener to some of the most pertinent and pressing topics of our current times. It is an incredibly fun and energetic course that I recommend to every student!",
    "highly recommend the dude is awesome very little work interesting topics",
    "This class is really fun, and is a great learning experience. Even if you aren't going to major in archaeology or anthropology, you should definitely consider this class.",
    "It's a nice, relaxing course with not too much work. You learn about some interesting stuff, and your mind becomes pretty open to the impossible.",
    "Yes b\/c Honeychurch is the man.",
    "Good class and very interesting--makes you more cautious about the way facts, esp. about archaeology, is presented!",
    "I would recommend it to a student who is interested in archaeology. Honeychurch is entertaining so he makes the subject matter more interesting, but sometimes the class was a little unorganized.",
    "Yes, take it.",
    "I would really recommend this class if you want a class in your schedule that isn't as high stress, and one that you actually want to go to.",
    "Real-life indiana jones",
    "This course is incredibly interesting and engaging.",
    "It's interesting and the professor makes it fun!",
    "It is not a gut class but not a hard class. I would take it to fill a spot in your schedule.",
    "You spend alot of time on a few specific hoaxes, but a good portion of the class is also dedicated to learning about how professional, responsible archeology works.",
    "This is a pretty good survey of basic archaeology, incorporating pseudo-archaeological theories along with more technical aspects of excavation. It's a fun and interesting class; homework is minimal. The professor is very engaging, and there are a good amount of hands-on activities. I would recommend taking the class if you want something fun and easy to fill your schedule.",
    "I would recommend this class to students that are interested in the subject, however, it is not a comprehensive archaeology course.",
    "The Hoaxes are interesting in the class, but not enough time is spent on them. The other archaeological material is generally boring, unless you're interested in learning about the topic.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone looking for an interesting and entertaining course. Professor Honeychurch is incredibly entertaining and very helpful. I loved every lecture and always looked forward to them.",
    "very good informative class",
    "YES! Take it! great fun, fairly easy if you just go to class, and prof. Honeychurch is probably the most entertaining lecturers I have had.",
    "Absolutely take it - fascinating material, great professor, doable workload.",
    "I would highly recommend this course because of the great teaching of Professor Honeychurch. It is also a very interesting topic that I never knew existed.",
    "He gives you all of the terms that will be on the midterm and final. Unfortunately, you actually have to be in class to get a lot of the answers to the terms. Tests are fair and paper is simple. Professor is fun to watch.",
    "awesomeness. definitely take this class",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. If you're looking for an easy class that isn't painfully boring, take this! Professor Honeychurch is awesome, never a dull moment during lecture. The class covers a lot of info about archaeology, not just hoaxes. Overall, a fairly easy class, very entertaining, no section, interesting information.",
    "It's an easy gut class and not very challenging, but still a lot of fun.",
    "I thought that this would be a great gut class but the papers weren't graded as easily as I had hoped and the midterm and final covered A LOT of material, none of which I really found too interesting",
    "A class with major potential that doesn't deliver. There are some interesting things, of course, but not nearly enough to make this class really worthwhile.",
    "Hoaxes is awesome. Honeychurch is insane, but a lot of fun. The material is relatively interesting, and you actually learn something in the class if you go to lectures. It's definitely worth taking.",
    "Hoaxes is very simple and straightforward. Two exams, one small essay, a few easy homework assignments. I found all of the IDs for the exams on wikipedia so it really wasn't necessary to go to lecture. The topics of the course are a little scattered and random so at times it seems unnecessary and boring, but if you're looking for an easy class with very little work, this class is perfect.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any other student who has any interest in archaeology at all.",
    "Highly reocommend for a lighter course.",
    "The class provides an interesting look into the basic study of archaeology and fantastical arguments within the field. I recommend the class if you are interested at all the history in general. Also, professor Honeychurch is excellent, and lectures are interesting to attend.",
    "Exciting and entertaining. You will learn so much and still love going to class, Professor Honeychurch is amazing.",
    "Sure",
    "it was a fun class. prof. Honeychurch is an excellent lecturer and highly amusing. the class isn't difficult, neither the subject material nor the work load. you don't need to do the reading really, but the are very helpful and give you a better understanding of the material.",
    "Not an actual gut, so don't expect to breeze through.",
    "Hoaxes is a fun class. I was rarely bored in class because Professor Honeychurch is funny, engaging, and energetic. The class is about hoaxes in archaeology with some basic archaeological terms and techniques. Take this class if you are looking for a VERY low stress and low workload fun class.",
    "Yes, it is a great, fun class!",
    "Take this class. You actually learn a lot, and it was very interesting. Also not much work. Take this class.",
    "There is very little work during the semester, just be aware that the grade is essentially broken into 3 very crucial parts: the midterm, the paper and the final. Start memorizing the terms Honeychurch gives you early. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone intrigued by the subject.",
    "It was great, I would recommend it.",
    "Sure take it. Supposedly a gut but that doesn't mean you shouldn't take it seriously. Go to class and you'll do fine.",
    "I would recommend this course, if you have a spare credit and want to learn about some fun material. Not a course that takes itself too seriously.",
    "The topics you go over are pretty interesting. Work load isn't bad at all, I would recommend if your looking for a filler class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The workload is very limited, the class is interesting and Professor Honeychurch is awesome!! Part of your grade is also based on your presence at field trips, which are very interesting as well!",
    "a fun& low-maintenance class to take. take this!",
    "didn't go to a single lecture or do any of the reading and got an a on both exams",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. There was very little work and the reading is totally optional if you go to lecture, which you totally should because Honeychurch is so fun to listen to. I shopped this class with no intention of taking it and was hooked by Honeychurch's awesomeness.",
    "Great class! Definitely reccomend it! Take it, there is hardly any work, and you can do really well in the class.",
    "DOPE.",
    "I would recommend the class as an easy credit.",
    "Great Hoaxes in Archaeology is a really fun class. I found the material interesting and you will never get bored with Professor Honeychurch. He is always really hilarious and engaging. The class is more like an introductory archaeology with a focus on hoaxes than the title might suggest. The workload is pretty minimal. If you show up to class and take notes you should be fine on the exams and the paper is easy.",
    "Its harder then you think",
    "Highly recommended, great professor, interesting class and not a burden in any way.",
    "Yes, it's a fun class and you probably won't learn about this stuff in other classes. It's worth it just to see Professor Honeychurch lecture. This will seem like a joke class at times (you take field trips to museums and write papers about what you learned) but the midterm is actually pretty tough and the papers are kind of harshly. It's one of those classes at Yale where it's pretty easy to get a B but not as easy as you'd think to get an A. But overall it's fun and interesting, and I would recommend it.",
    "Take this class. It's fun, although that's mainly because of Prod Honeychurch's energy. It's a lot more about archaeology than the course's title suggests so if you have no interest at all about archaeology, then that could potentially be a problem. If you're at all interested, it's really a fun class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Honeychurch is hands down the coolest professor you can find at Yale. Funny, witty, charming and an overallcool guy. The workload is doable and the material is interesting, I've busted out knowledge gained in this class numerous times already, like when we were talking about the Olmec heads at the Peabody and I could give some history of hoaxes and pseudo-archaeology dealing with them. It was cool.",
    "Anthropology 172 is a way to learn the methods behind archaeology and how an archaeologist's findings are interpreted in culture today and years ago. This class made the plain truth more outstanding than the imaginative fantastical hoaxes.",
    "ANTH 172 is a great lecture course (purely lecture--no sections!) with a very light workload that I still got a lot out of. It's fun whether you're interested in archaeology or not, and the professor is hilarious. I would recommend it!",
    "Really fun class. Not that much of a time investment. Lots of fun.",
    "Good fun class to take. Take it for a grade and don't worry so much about the reading. It also helps to get the notes",
    "I would definitely recommend it for anybody interested in archaeology, or anybody who's interested in the history of humanity.",
    "Interesting topic, a good class to take just for fun or if you need the credit. Don't take credit\/d\/fail, because it is easy enough to pass without a ton of effort.",
    "This class is really just an introduction to archaeology course. Lectures were easy to sit through because Prof. Honeychurch kept them entertaining, but the material was not always that interesting. Workload is light- a few short assignments, a midterm, and a final covering only the second half of the course.",
    "Hoaxes and Fantasies teaches you about the methods, goals, and history of archaeology as well as about its hoaxes. It's not a difficult class and has only a few assignments. It's definitely a fun class to take and I would recommend taking it!",
    "A great large lecture. Prof. Honeychurch almost acts his lectures out, he is that engaging. Not all about hoaxes--actually just an introduction to archaeology, but the courseload is VERY manageable.",
    "I would highly suggest this class for anyone that is interested in archaeology or if you want to take a fun interesting class."
