    "This course has less required work than others, but that is in part because the instructor makes himself available to help guide work in relation to individual interest. Dr. Draghi helps guide students through Yale's extensive resources and is exceptionally available outside of course hours to help identify and explore additional resources from the Beinecke, BAC, or YUAG's vast collections or to recommend further related readings.",
    "I loved the field trips. As someone completely unfamiliar with Connecticut and New Haven, the field trips were very beneficial because they showed me a) which cultural centers are available in the local area (museums and art galleries), b) treasures that I had no idea existed at Yale or anywhere so close to me, and c) objects that perfectly tie into the archetypal themes of the course.",

His classes are fascinating with in-depth knowledge on the subject of archetypes and the environment.Sometimes I felt we were being taught by an alchemist, who gives enough information to incite curiosity and it is up to the student to search for more knowledge on the subject of interest.I also enjoyed the books of Joseph Campbell as well as the field trips to Yale museums and libraries."

His classes are fascinating with in-depth knowledge on the subject of archetypes and the environment.I recommend that students request assigned readings related to the subjects to be discussed weekly in order to be better equiped or prepared to engage in class discussions and gain more knowledge throughout the course."
