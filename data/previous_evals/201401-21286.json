    "Easy science credit: do some dense reading for every class and turn in a reading summary, two 10-page papers on two of twenty possible topics. Can get very dry because Bercovici never knows when to stop his own presentation to allow for actual discussion, but he's a very likable guy.",
    "I recommend it if you need a science credit or if you're interested in the topic.",
    "It is a good introduction to many areas of geology and other sciences.",
    "I would recommend Origins of Everything because it is a great seminar. It would be especially good for people needing a science credit. The material throughout the course was incredibly interesting and professor Bercovici was really nice and laid-back.",
    "Absolutely! This class was fun, interesting, and had a manageable workload."
