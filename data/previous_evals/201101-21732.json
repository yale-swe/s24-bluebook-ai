    "Definitely. An independent study gives the freedom to do some extraordinary work, and Fabian was a fantastic adviser.",
    "If you are a history major with an interest that lies outside existing courses and has done work before with a professor who is open to the idea, consider a tutorial your junior year. The structure of a tutorial depends very heavily on the your expectations and those of your professor. Unlike even a small seminar, you and your professor may have a generally ad hoc approach to meetings and assignment schedules. A tutorial is a \"super-seminar,\" and it can grow bigger in work load than anticipated. Treat is as the centerpiece of your semester. It may prepare you well for future independent research, such as that of the senior essay. A tutorial can certainly teach a history major how to be self-motivated, engineer well-organized research and writing, and deal with the ever-present ambiguities of history."
