    "Yes!",
    "Yes, it was great. The discussions could be facilitated a bit better, maybe with some guiding questions provided before the reading is assigned to prime students for the following class' discussion. Loved that we read Sen's book. I wish more time could have been spent with the lab work, it was very cool to learn how to create social mobility tables and poverty curve together in class, and together interpret their meanings.",
    "Murray Leibbrant is an incredible teacher and an academic. I feel very lucky to have met him and learning from him."
