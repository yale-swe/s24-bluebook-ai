    "This course was fantastic and the professor was extremely knowledgable, friendly, and accessible to students. Thank you for a wonderful and very applicable educational experience!",
    "This is an excellent class and I highly recommend it and Professor Reuning-Scherer to all FES students. However, it is most certainly not an easy class.",
    "With regard to questions 12& 13, I felt that the course material was confusing when presented in class. The pace was very fast and I often had to spend a lot of time outside class teaching myself material that we had covered. That said, the times I met with JRS in person to receive extra help, his instruction was extraordinarily clear and helpful. I'm not sure why the difference between the two media - in class vs. one-on-one - but it was frustrating that I had trouble keeping up in class.",
    "Question 4 - - This course went way too fast; the instructor even spoke so fast I could barely understand him at times. I would recommend cutting the amount of introductory material down in order to go over concepts more clearly and slowly.",
    "Statistics is the pits,but JRS makes it sweet.",
    "this was a great class!!",
    "Reuning-Scherer's is a great guy. His lectures are one of a kind. Constantly cracking jokes + amazingly upbeat all of the time. The amount of energy he brings to class every day is truly amazing.All that being said, I don't really learn a lot from getting lectured in statistics. I really think stats is something you learn by doing, and the homework assignments, take-home mid-terms, and group project were all aided my learning much more than the class time itself. I can't really knock Reuning-Scherer because I can't think of a better way to teach the class (large stats classes just aren't very useful in my opinion). Class is very entertaining, just don't know how useful it is. I started to skip class frequently towards the end of the semester and just devote that work to the homeworks + projects. Found it to be a more productive use of my time.Reuning-Scherer is extremely helpful + nice outside of class. I was really impressed with how available he was during the group projects...he spent hours hanging out in CSSSI just helping all of us out.",
    "I felt that we moved very quickly through the material. It was a good introduction to statistics, but I am not sure that I could apply the knowledge that I learned.",
    "Jonathan is awesome. He makes a daunting topic fun. My only negative feedback is about statistics itself... just not a topic I consider fun. But Jonathan makes lemonade from lemons!",
    "Great support from TA Yitian",
    "Jonathan was a very skilled instructor - the content of the class was organized and planned very thoroughly. The HW assignments and final project provided good practice for the subject material.",
    "The professor in this course is great, with a good sense of humor, and a clear demonstration of terms.",
    "Professor Reuning-Sherer is fantastic. I really appreciated the take home exams and final project; it make the class far more accessible to someone who isn't math savvy.",

    "Please see below.",
    "Some material was presented too slowly (earlier on in the class) but other areas were to quick (probability, GLM, etc...). Would be better if more time were spent reviewing probability and modeling (multiple linear regression, GLM, etc...) since that is more likely what we will be using the course knowledge for. Also, less time on the mathematical underpinnings of the models and more time on how they work and actually using them."

He uses examples that make statistics come to life. The assignments provide excellent hands-on practice with statistics, as did the final project. I now feel like I have a much better grasp on the practical use of statistics than after having taken stats in my undergrad.",

    "I thought it was very well done and have no suggestions for improvement. Though I wouldn't have minded using SPSS or R instead of Minitab, as they seem to be more common in many professional settings.",
    "The use of MINITAB throughout the semester is testimony that we now have programs that can do math for us. However, I think it would be helpful if we were required to do calculations either by hand or with a graphing calculator; actually going through the process is, for me, a good means of learning the significance of each step of the equations.",
    "I wish we would've had readings to supplement class. The class moved too quickly to be able to absorb everything and the class notes didn't always make sense in review.",
    "None",
    "The pace. Too fast!",
    "I found it really frustrating that the professor blasted through the math behind all the statistics so fast that there was no way we could understand or follow. It was kind of comical. What resulted was that I didn't understand the math behind the concepts, and I almost think the professor designed it so I couldn't. But the math isn't hard - - it's mostly just algebra - - so I wish he had either slowed down enough to teach it to us for real or just skipped it entirely.",
    "It would be nice to sometimes relate things to the bigger picture more often so I would have known how different things related to one another.",
    "The notes provided to the class are great, but they are a little dense for moving through during a class period. I got the most out of working through problems in class.",
    "For students who have no math background, it would be very helpful to have guidance above and beyond what the TAs are assigned to provide help for. I struggled a lot with the content and would have benefited from guidance and support, or referrals to someone who could help me.",
    "N\/A",
    "Didn't find lectures very useful but I think this relates more to the subject (stats) than the professor. Can't think of a better way to run lectures.",
    "It would have been helpful to have 1 stats book assigned to refer to.",
    "not sure",
    "The PDF lecture notes were sometimes difficult to follow, as JDRS moves around them quickly. But I did appreciate having half a semester's notes in advance. A shorter text would have been nice, as the textbook was so long it was too time-consuming to read, but it would have been nice to have had some other type of shorter text summary to read for further comprehension. The textbook seemed to have a lot of extraneous information that was not covered in the class, and didn't focus enough on the key concepts we learned.The second midterm needs to be earlier, because it ended up falling in the last week of class when we all had final exams, final projects, and final papers due, but we also had a final stats project, so we essentially ended up with two final stats projects (the project and the midterm) to add to all of our other work in the last two weeks of the term, which was too much of a workload. It would have been better had this second midterm been a week or two earlier, and we only had the final project to contend with during the final rush of the term.",
    "Perhaps a couple example problems immediately following each class with answers and explanations, for additional practice - in addition to the graded HW.Aside from class material -- 1130-1245 is not the time for a class! There are so many activities going on during lunch that it conflicts with the class.",
    "I think that the probability section of the course should be slowed down. Also it seemed that the problem sets in this section didn't reflect what we had gone over during class so I was lost when trying to do the homework.",
    "The grading criteria of TA.",
    "It makes a little too fast. I really enjoyed the class where we worked out the regression together with our laptops. I think doing this more often in the class would be useful.",
    "Too much information in just 2 classes per week",
    "I think the project should be assigned halfway through the semester, so people don't leave it till the end and then make a mad dash for the airport (like I did)!",
    "Lectures - professor talks really fast. The material isn't that enaging, so it helps to use the clickers for quizzes or integrate practice problems into the lecture session to facilitate learning.",
    "everything is great",
    "Once-weekly homework assignments were only moderately helpful. Perhaps weekly group TA sessions and\/or more and shorter HW assignments would have been helpful.",
    "Honestly, I didn't need a textbook for the course. I bought one at the beginning as per the advice of the professor, but the notes were far more useful than the textbook.",
    "the pace of the lectures. maybe it should be broken down on two semester so topics can be explained more in depth",
    "I felt that the material was covered too quickly in this course. Professor Reuning-Scherer had helpful, interactive review sessions before the midterm and final but I would have benefited from more regular overviews of what we had already learned and how it related to new material. Because statistics is a field in which more complicated techniques build upon foundations, it would have definitely helped my learning to have more regular reviews of where we had been and where we were going with the material.",
    "The last part of the course seemed a bit rushed. I think it would be nice to have an outline of each analysis and the steps (sort of a summary of the notes, including the details in the flow chart at the end).",

    "Yes.",
    "Yes, but I wish I could have just focused more on learning rather than submitting the homework sets. Because I do not have a strong math background, I would have loved to learn the concepts and internalize the statistical procedures. Sometimes the fast nature of the course lent itself to 'repeating' what was taught in class without understanding the underlying concepts well. I would have personally done better with less homework assignments and more time to focus on doing readings and understanding the concepts.",

    "i hope to have a better command of some of the more complex methods",
    "I am honestly disappointed that I do not feel like I have a better grasp of statistics after taking this course. This is partly my own fault since I definitely would have gotten more out of this course had I kept up with the reading. Professor Reuning-Scherer allowed us flexibility in choosing what text to buy but it would have been very useful to have chapters identified that would be relevant for each week's material. Also, as said above, I felt like there was a bit too much material covered a bit too quickly in this course and I would have benefited from more regular reviews of previous material.",

I think this is 1) because we were able to choose our own groups 2) because we were able to choose our own projects and 3) because we worked independently (other than for a client) which is how most of my other group work has been.",

Also,although I found it hard to do so, it would be very helpful to complete each assignment over the weekend and attend Professor Reuning-Scherer's help sessions that take place before each assignment is due. That way you can verify what you do understand and ask questions about areas that are confusing.",
