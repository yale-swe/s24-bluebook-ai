   "comments": [
    "A solid background in the methods of optimization, which is applicable to basically every STEM field.",
    "This is an excellent intro to optimisation techniques, which has uses in virtually every field including economics and finance.",
    "A variety of optimization techniques were used. It was nice to see them in action.",
    "I learned about convex optimization and different techniques to solve optimization problems.",
    "This class provides a really useful theoretical framework for optimization problems and clarified concepts that have only been touched on by other classes. After taking it, I feel prepared to venture more into the application side of optimization.",
    "Learned fundamental techniques for machine learning",
    "I gained a basic understanding of current methods used for optimization, and their theoretical foundations. I gained some skills in implementing certain algorithms, and got to explore the literature on a topic of interest to me.",
    "I learned a great deal both about the theoretical underpinnings of (convex) optimization and about the difficulties of actually formulating and solving optimization problems in a 'real' setting. I also solidified some weak spots in my linear algebra \/ matrix calculus.",
    "This was the most formative, challenging, and interesting class I've taken at Yale. It made me love the theoretical side of electrical engineering and excited to start my PhD in a similar field. The mathematical skills and insights I learned are invaluable",
    "I learned the theory behind many optimization techniques, which was quite interesting.",
    "Various methods for convex optimization and how to prove they work, ranging from methods that work on nice differentiable problems to more complex ones. Primal dual characterization as a way of understanding optimization, which was very helpful. Some non-convex \/ global optimization methods as well."

   "question_id": "YC403",

   "comments": [
    "The course structure is great - weekly problem sets for 50% of the grade and a final project for the other 50%. Sekhar is a great lecturer and a funny guy, and is more than willing to help you with any questions you have.",
    "Great professor with great teaching style. Project at the end is very open so you can pursue any subject related to optimisation which was great.",
    "We certainly cover a lot. Sometimes we go too fast, but overall I think it was a good course.",
    "Strengths: Thorough instruction of fundamental theory Weaknesses: Absence of coding instruction, which proved necessary for the final project",
    "The only real weakness I can think of for this course is that I wish there had been more problem sets\/more grades in general. 50% of our grade was 8 problem sets, which made each one pretty high stakes. The strengths are that Sekhar is an awesome lecturer\/human and puts a lot of thought into the way the class is structured.",
    "The class should take more deviations from the textbook used for the majority other curriculum.",
    "We were able to get through a lot of material in a short time. I would have preferred less emphasis on theory and proofs and more emphasis on actually implementing the algorithms.",
    "Strengths: Great professor, very interesting material, balance of theoretical + applied material (final project) Weaknesses: The course moves quite quickly and makes it difficult to fully solidify all the material that is covered. Obviously, there's a tradeoff between speed and how much material you can cover, so I'm not sure this can really be remedied (in a one-semester course). Improvements: There's the speed-quantity issue I mentioned above, but I'm not sure there's a perfect solution, so I can't think of any big improvements.",
    "Change. Nothing. It's fast-paced but it has to be since it covers so much",
    "Strength is that Sekhar is fantastic, very knowledgeable, and engaging. Weakness is that some of the problem sets did not unite the theory with application very well.",
    "I enjoyed that the class was taught in a theoretical and proof-based manner, but I found myself struggling a little more when it came to the final project because the hard part is often defining the right measure to optimize instead of simply running the algorithm on it. Perhaps some more conceptual grounding in the types of things you might want to optimize (e.g. squared residuals for linear regression) would help give a better sense of how to define problems, and what techniques are frequently used to solve which problems.",
    "More prereqs. Math 120 and the intro linear algebra classes don't go over enough material to prepare for this class. The class should probably be split into two courses (like the Stanford course) so we can go slower"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, especially if optimization is useful for your desired field of study. Sekhar is a great lecturer and the course is designed well - although the material is difficult, the problem sets are workable and you can pretty much study whatever you want for the final project.",
    "This depends on your background. Linear algebra is key.",
    "This class is tough, but Sekhar is amazing. The grade is 50% HW, 50% final project (NO EXAMS), and you get a lot of leeway to pick a final project that interests you. However, the content can be difficult to understand at times, and the homework problems are very challenging. However, Sekhar and the TA's are very accessible, and if you go in for office hours they are very helpful. Overall, I learned a lot and got to apply this knowledge to a project that I enjoyed.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially if you have a field\/project in mind to which you'd like to apply optimization techniques. The course is 50% problem sets, and 50% a final project, so if you don't think the final project would be up your alley, I would maybe find another course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it offers knowledge and skills that are very important.",
    "~Would recommend if you have a specific interest in the material, otherwise, be careful. The course moves quite quickly and it's easy to feel overwhelmed but the material you cover is really really interesting and the final project at the end is a great opportunity to apply some of the things you've learned. Sekhar's a great professor and is extremely willing to help, as was the TA for this semester, Xinyang.",
    "Sekhar is a wonderful instructor, and invested in the success of his students. He is particularly helpful during office hours, and a nice person in general.",
    "If you're a math-inclined EE student, take this course. Sekhar is amazing and the stuff you'll learn is really cool. Problem sets are hard but doable. This is a solid, challenging, and fun EE elective",
    "Yes, take it with Sekhar. A great course for people from a wide variety of backgrounds and also very interesting.",
    "Took this course as an EECS major interested in machine learning & AI, and I've definitely found it helpful in terms of developing an idea of the kinds of basic techniques one can use to optimize a learning metric. That said, because it's so broadly targeted at a range of disciplines, the course focuses mostly just on mathematical basis of generally applicable convex optimization techniques, so don't expect to learn as much about the context in which you're interested in applying these techniques - that will probably come from the papers you read yourself for the 50% final project, or any consultations you have with Prof. Sekhar. Problem sets are strictly graded but otherwise reasonable if you're already familiar with linear algebra and vector calculus. Thankfully they peter out towards the end of the semester, giving you more time to work on the final project.",
    "Wasn't a fan. The class goes extremely quickly and if you're confused at the beginning, it only gets worse from there. Math 120 and 222 definitely aren't enough preparation, and half the class will be grad students who know the math like the back of their hands, so it gets really intimidating. Sekhar's sense of humor can be pretty mean, especially if you're already intimidated, and if you ask a \"dumb\" question he'll always make a joke out of it, which means if you're confused you'll probably stay confused since you're too scared to ask anything. To get through this course you basically have to stop caring, get used to not understanding anything, and try and figure out what you can on your own."
