   "comments": [
    "\"Acting Globally\" provides an introduction to issues such as poverty alleviation, development aid, globalization, and international trade. The syllabus surveys a wide range of opinions, ensuring that you are not unfairly biased towards neither skepticism nor optimism regarding globalization and development interventions. The first two essays were not incredibly interesting to write, as we were constrained to writing entirely about the source essays. The final research paper and following presentation, however, were an exciting challenge and will prove to be interesting for anyone willing to put in the time and effort. This is also one of the only classes I've taken so far which had an element of public speaking preparation, which is very welcomed.",
    "The biggest thing I took away from this class was how to write with better clarity and organization. I certainly needed help getting the ideas in my mind down into written words with the same coherence those ideas seemed to have in my mind. It was also a new experience for me to talk out my essays and go through a strategic drafting process; I am usually pretty shy about discussing my essays, so this class was helpful in showing me just how beneficial it is to talk about my argument or evidence before trying to create an essay.",
    "I learned how to be a better writer and about the challenges and opportunities of globalization.",
    "Writing: I learned how to express my ideas more concisely and elegantly. I also learned about some of my bad writing habits: for example, I tend to repeat myself, especially when I write first drafts. My work in this class helped me to not only notice these habits but also correct them. There is still more work to be done, but I am confident that the work done in this class will enable me to continue growing as a writer. Acting globally: I learned more about the bottom-up approach to aid, which I had often heard about from those criticizing top-down aid. I had always wondered why bottom-up aid wasn't being utilized if it was such a good idea. Now, I know that it actually is utilized, and that although it has its flaws, it seems to truly be the best method of aid we have thus far. I also learned about the incremental nature of change, global or otherwise. Despite a great amount of work being done, little improvement may happen; in fact, harm may accidentally occur! But, this observation is no reason to give up. Rather, this observation serves to remind me of the harsh reality of aid interventions, as well as better equip me to handle such interventions. In general, this course helped me to grow as a writer and a thinker. My though processes have been expanded both on a global scale and on a more local, interpersonal scale. I'm excited to take more writing classes, as well as to continue practicing the thought patterns I've learned in this course!"

   "comments": [
    "For a contemporary addition to the syllabus, it would've been nice to have an essay pertaining to the Effective Altruism movement.",
    "One of the strengths of this course was having a topic to work with that promoted meaningful discussions and genuine engagement with the course. \"Acting Globally\" brought together a nice mixture of ideas that were of interest to our class and allowed for each of us, all with very different academic backgrounds, to bring something interesting into the class.",
    "The course was very front-loaded. The course was generally very fast paced in the beginning of the semester both with readings and with essays. However, the course became much slower toward the end of the semester. This can actually help depending on people's schedules for exams in other classes. This front-loaded course structure certainly helped me a lot.",
    "Overall this class was great. The main problem was that we didn't receive grades throughout the term. The only grade we saw was for the first essay.",
    "Strengths: - Improves writing skills greatly - Utilizes course textbook very well to supplement in-class teaching - Feedback is very informative, especially on rough drafts and during office hours Weaknesses: - It would have been fun to have more discussions - It would have been nice to have one more essay, just to really sharpen our writing skills, though I'd understand if a lack of time prevented this - Would have liked to have read even more papers on globalization"

    "The readings should all be very interesting to anyone with an interest in global affairs and\/or development. This class is, in effect, an EP&E seminar, with some added emphasis on English academic writing styles. I'd recommend this class predominantly to people interested in EP&E or Global Affairs, but, of course, also to anyone interested in improving their reading and writing abilities.",
    "I would certainly recommend this section of English 114. The topic allows for so many interesting ideas to be brought in from across disciplines. From a writing standpoint, it was a really helpful way for me to learn how to refine my ideas into a strong and clear argument. The style of writing and skills that I have learned from this class, I feel, will be useful even for someone in a field that is very different from global affairs\/political science and English. Even if you thought you would never want to or need to take an English course, this one is certainly worthwhile.",
    "Yes, absolutely. This course was a great help not only for my writing ability but also its subject matter was incredibly interesting and informative. It was definitely a lot of work but very worthwhile.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The readings are fascinating and you truly have the freedom to write and present on topics you are passionate about. I learned both practical communication skills and gained a lot of new insights and changed my thinking on globalization.",
    "I would recommend this course",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It really opened my eyes to the challenges of foreign aid and made me a better writer.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who was (1) interested in global affairs, (2) interested in becoming a better writer, or (3) both (1) and (2). I think that this course does its job very well."
