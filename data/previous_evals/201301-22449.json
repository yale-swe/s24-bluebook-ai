   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this class, but I would only recommend it to EE majors and APHY majors. This class is a good amount of work (due to the lab component) and assumes a solid understanding of circuits.",
    "EE203 was a standard circuits course that covered circuit analysis using tools such as Laplace and Fourier transforms. The class was a little bit on the heavier side in terms of the course load. There were weekly homeworks AND labs. The lab reports took more time than I would have wanted to spend. The midterm and final were both pretty straightforward. This meant that the curves were pretty steep in both of these and making a small mistake in either one of them could easily lead to one being below average.Reed is an enthusiastic lecturer and totally made it worth waking up early to attend lectures.",
    "This is a good class. The lab is really fun and the teaching is good. The TAs are also enthusiastic and very helpful with any problems you might have.",
    "Take it",
    "The class is fine. Mark Reed is a good lecturer, but the material isn't particularly intersting. It's mostly a recap of what you learn in EE201 plus Fourier series and transforms. The material always felt straightforward and the tests were easy. The lab is really annoying, be warned",
    "Solid class. Straightforward material, but I learnt a lot from the lab. Take it. I had taken EENG 310 and diff eq before, so a lot of the laplace, fourier and control theory overlapped with other classes.",
    "Pretty easy class in general.",
    "If you are reading this then you are probably an Electrical engineering major and so have to take this course no matter what I say, but be on your toes for this class. There is a large disconnect between the lab and the lecture. They cover different materiel and the lab is poorly explained. The text book used is terrible and our professor confirms that its answer key (which the TA's used to grade the problem sets) is often wrong. We also had to deal with TA's that honestly didn't want to help, they wanted to spend the absolute minimum time talking to or helping undergrads.",
    "This course covers \"how to represent a circuit as a system in the frequency domain, and determine how it will affect a signal\". If you are in EE, you need to take it--take care of the homework, devote a lot of time to the labs, and don't worry about the exams."
