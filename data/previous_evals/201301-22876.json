   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it. It's a good introduction to reading a lot of political theory that has played a tremendous role in western thought. I feel like of the three Directed Studies sections I definitely got the most of and learned the most from this one.",
    "I would recommend this class - definitely worth it and you get a deep understanding\/appreciation of each work. Professor El Amine is also very upfront and helpful. She never feeds you BS, which is something I can appreciate.",
    "Second semester H&P is worth taking--it's worth your time and worth your pain. The first semester was too focused on the historians themselves since a lot of them were closer to being storytellers than theorists. If you can work with a professor you like or are comfortable with, I would definately stick with it and take this course.",
    "We go over and summarize the arguments of various political theorists and then discuss the various strengths and weaknesses of them. I would definitely recommend this class because it provides a solid foundation and really interesting tools to think about political affairs both in the past and modern day.",
    "If you have decided to continue DS, take hope: history and politics spring term is almost universally acknowledged to be far more interesting and engaging than H&P fall term. The thinkers are more approachable and you will probably find the material easier to read. Be aware that there is still a lot of reading though. Loubna did a good job leading section and was thorough in her treatment of the texts. She managed to strike a good balance between explication of the text and discussion about the merits of thinkers' arguments and their broader significance, which is rare. Overall, a worthwhile and enriching course that will get you thinking about and questioning your political principles.",
    "A fast-paced overview of political thought, this course provided a general look at some of the most important political ideas throughout history. This course is perfect for anyone who wants a broad understanding of the most influential political writings.",
    "The second semester of DS: Historical and Political Thought is different from the first semester in that the focus is now almost entirely on political theory, not on history. In my mind, the course syllabus can be divided roughly into two sections. The first section, with writers like Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, traces ideas of the social contract and the proper relationship between the government and the governed. The second section, with writers like Marx, Emerson, and Arendt, focuses more on the identity and role of the individual in a society. Within that rough structure, the biggest highlight of this semester is the introduction of more modern texts as the syllabus moves into the 19th and 20th centuries. As you read texts about modern events and even about the United States, the course seems to assume a greater relevance than, perhaps, you found the earlier readings of the first semester of Historical and Political Thought to have. It is because of this increasing modern relevance that I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Additionally, the writings about the role and identity of the individual in society arouse thoughts and reflections within the individual reader on a very personal level."
