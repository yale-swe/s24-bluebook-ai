    "super boring lectures, section's okay, books are mad interestingif you're kind of curious about (early) nietzsche, and you don't think you'll read his books outside of school, this class is good. not too much work, and even if lectures were dull, at least it's chill.workload:-go to lecture twice a week (no attendance, though...)-go to section once a week (not that bad, actually)-three papers (spaced throughout semester; 1700 words, or about 7 pages, per paper; all the same format\/length; choice of 3-4 prompts)grading seemed pretty nice, but that might depend on your t.a.",
    "Definitely take the course.",
    "A deep study of Nietzsche. Best to have something of a philosophy background before you take it.",
    "I recommend it. Shop it and see if you like the first lecture... if you do, then you should probz take the class. The essays aren't very long (1700 words each, 3 total)",
    "If you know the history of philosophy (DSers!) and you're interested at all in nietzsche, take this class. Professor Harries is incredible. Be prepared to work a lot on your essays though -- nietzsche is notoriously hard to understand on the first go.Section was weak this past semester but the lectures made it worth it.enjoy!",
    "Scale of 1-10, 10.",
    "A wonderful course on interesting material.",
    "A lecture course where you have a rare opportunity to hear one of the great philosophy scholars. I recommend it!",
    "Phil 207 is a great class to learn about Nietzsche's philosophy, and also be exposed to a unique way of thinking that will radically challenge your worldview. Professor Harries goes very in-depth into the text, which teaches students how to closely examine text and understand what an author is saying. However, you might get frustrated because: a) Professor Harries' lectures sometimes are not coherent and ramble (he reads off of and adds to lecture notes; he provides these electronically though), b) we do not cover that much material. As it is, you focus on only some of Nietzsche's works; but this will be enough to understand the core of Nietzsche's thinking and how to read his writing. Also, section is a great time to ask questions and learn more about the material.You need to put a lot of work into this to get a lot of out it. But if you do, and if you apply the material to your own life, I believe you will walk away as a person with a (slightly) changed perspective on life."
