    "If your Chinese is already at a pretty high level and you want to learn more about contemporary Chinese literature, then this is the class for you.",
    "It was interesting to listen to Professor Su's stories about his life experience and personal stories about the authors that we read (who are his friends). Good Chinese class for advanced students to really familiarize yourself with the language.",
    "I would recommend it if you are a) a heritage student or b) are willing to work on it if you are not. I would recommend it credit\/D to someone just wanting to take a Chinese class to keep up their Chinese skills.",
    "It depends what your goals are. It's a really fun class, and Su Laoshi is great. If you are really interested in Literary Chinese, then you'll get a lot out of this class. The material is fun and interesting, and class is usually pretty entertaining. Su Laoshi likes to tell a lot of stories about himself, and they're usually fun to hear. If you really want to improve your speaking, it's not the greatest place to do it. It's a pretty big class, and a lot of the time is devoted to listening to listening to him talk. Maybe consider taking his other class (160 - which is usually smaller) or the film class. Overall, fun and interesting. So if you just want to familiarize yourself with some important Chinese literature and keep up your Chinese, this is a good class to take.",
    "yes. good class to take for studying chinese.",
    "Yes, I will definitely recommend it.",
    "I would certainly recommend this as an enjoyable class that can help develop reading and writing abilities. The spoken component is less significant - don't expect the class to significantly improve your conversational Chinese. However, Su Laoshi and TAs are readily available for those committed to improve their speaking ability.",
    "I would highly recommend it. The only problem is if the student wants to learn to speak better. This is not a speaking course, so that is the only drawback."
