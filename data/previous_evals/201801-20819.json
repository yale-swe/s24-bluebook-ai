    "The class is extremely well-taught. I learnt so much from this class: how central banks work in the US, how the Fed conducts monetary policy, and what makes a good central bank.",
    "Banks are too complicated",
    "I learned so much about the processes of Central Banks and all they do for our economy.",
    "The concepts and ins and outs of central banking. In the end very educational.",
    "I gained a very solid foundation of understanding in how central banks are structured and what functions they serve, as well as justifications for why they serve such functions.",
    "You learn about the history and practice of central banking",
    "knowledge about Central Banks",
    "Learned about the history and various functions (payment systems, lender of last resort, supervision\/regulation, monetary policy) of central banks. Interesting material.",
    "In taking this course, I learned a lot with respect to central banking in the United States, and how these institutions function. While in the course, I was able to learn new ways in which the central bank is involved in every day life, both in normal times and in crisis. In addition, I was able to have a much better understanding of macroeconomic policy, and the way in which the central bank can be a tremendous influence on our economy.",
    "Learned a lot about central banks and the Fed's operations, historical context for the creation of central banks, and how central banks weight economic considerations today. A great course.",
    "An excellent dive into the functions of central banks and how monetary policy is implemented."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: Plenty of fun readings, the class is well-structure and the professor is an expert. Weakness: no weakness.",
    "The strengths are the amount of information you will get and the ability to learn very deeply about a specific topic",
    "The class is extremely boring. Topics could not be duller. If you're trying to learn something \"cool\", this ain't it. Also grad students at a different level than I was so in class I was often lost. Not to mention it was almost impossible to pay attention when the slides are filled with complex graphs and different acronyms and terminologies you aren't used to.",
    "The course was well structured and Professor English is extremely knowledgeable. I can't think of any flaws in the course.",
    "Lectures are really interesting, workload is manageable, and English gives very detailed feedback. Student presentations are dull though",
    "a lot of good info",
    "Central Banking was a really well-designed course. The balance of papers, presentations, and tests was perfect. I really enjoyed when Professor English would describe current events and would have preferred even more of that. Also, while I got a lot out of preparing my own presentation, I didn't retain much information listening to other students' presentations.",
    "Good material but sometimes felt like alphabet soup. Lots of different acronyms for various programs\/committees and what they do... History and supervision\/regulation stuff was kind of boring. Wish English spent more time on current events and ongoing things rather than things that happened a century ago.",
    "I think that this course does a very good job in explaining the purpose and function of central banks, both in the United States and (at times) abroad. In addition, the guest speakers, all of whom have served pivotal roles in their respective positions in the financial industry, added great personal insights into the functions of these institutions. Therefore, the course is a wealth of knowledge with respect to central banking. The course does not have much to improve upon, since I felt that the assignments and classroom exercises were well balanced, and overall I felt prepared to take the final exam.",
    "A very good course that isn't very intensive. Not really sure it can be improved upon since it's already very good."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! This is my favorite class at Yale. The class has only two papers, one final and one presentation - but plenty of readings. I spent more than 20 hours doing the readings - only because I am truly interested in this subject. Some readings are easier - they explain concepts and use examples. Some readings are extremely hard - they use math models and solve complicated math equations. But I finished all my readings and enjoyed them so much. I might be biased in my view - but I think everybody should know how central bank works, what is high-powered money etc. We had four speakers this semester and they are experts in this field - Just like the professor William English himself is.",
    "if you are REALLY interested in working in finance\/banking. Like, REALLY.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn about how the Fed monitors the economy and what the Fed Funds rate really is, take this course.",
    "No. It was boring as ever and dull. Unless you're really interested in Central Banking don't take it. All the grad kids are well versed and good at it and if you have no background youll feel overwhelmed. Also impossible to pay attention to class.",
    "Yes, it's a fun senior seminar and Professor English is excellent. You learn a lot about how the Fed works from someone who knows it inside and out.",
    "Amazing class, light workload, but amazing content. English is a real gem of a professor. You learn about central banking from a real central banker",
    "yes but for econ majors",
    "Yes! Professor English is fantastic -- his lectures are legitimately fun to listen to.",
    "If you're interested in learning about central banking then this class offers a good introduction. I think I had too high of expectations for this class initially though that were not met.",
    "While the course is an upper-level economics course, I think that any Economics student who is interested in central banking should at least check it out. Prof. English is very interesting, and even though the first couple of lectures can be boring as they are introductory, they can be informative. The overall structure of the course lends itself from not being mired in one topic for too long, so if you want a nice, in-depth look into how these institutions function, it is certainly worth it.",
    "This class is extremely good as an introduction to central banking. You learn about central bank's objectives and the considerations they weigh, as well as the context behind their founding."
