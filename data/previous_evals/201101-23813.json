    "This is a good class. It's a play a week, and sometimes the plays can be quite difficult, but Angela is very helpful. I would recommend it to another student. That said, don't expect it to be a great help in improving your grammar\/etc., because, aside from help on a final paper, there is little grammatical instruction and most of the plays are in dialect.",
    "Intensive seminar.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Capodivacca is an excellent teacher, and the material is really interesting. You'll enjoy writing the term paper, and the weekly readings and responses are definitely manageable."
