   "comments": [
    "guest lectures' topics were interesting.",
    "Overall I thought it was a nice overview of measurement issues as it relates to a wide range of epi topics.Strengths: breadth of content, wide range of guest lecturers, exams and project presented a nice opportunity to apply conceptsWeaknesses: wide range of quality of the guest lecturers. Given my training as a physician, a lot of the health topics (e.g. cardiovascular health) were overly simplistic. Also the instructions for the final group project were very vague (and actually the requirements were only clear after we were midway through the presentations).I think the course would be much stronger and more useful if the projects were individual (not group) and the presentations were spread out over a month- rather than having more guest lectures. I am not clear why this course was a requirement of my degree program- I did not find it very useful or as strong as the other courses I have taken.",
    "Great background overview of measurement issues for different health topics. Some of it overlapped with guest speakers' content from other courses, so it was a bit of a repeat. However, Dr. Ma is a fantastic professor and I thoroughly appreciate her extreme willingness to meet with students and get to know all of us.",
    "I enjoyed the lectures, especially the guest lectures. The assignments were a bit tedious and all very similar. I do not feel like the overall goals of the final project were made clear when it was first assigned.",
    "I did learn a lot in Measurement Issues, however, I wish we had more group projects, or interactive learning, instead of having to listen to someone lecture for 2 hours straight.",
    "Measurement issues were addressed in almost every topic we had in Epi II, because we had weekly homeworks for Epi II for further discussions. And therefore, for people in CDE, I think this course was a duplicate from Epi II, and this might be an elective course instead of a requirement.",
    "This course delved into the important issues surrounding how to measure exposures, outcomes, and confounders in epi research. It made me think about issues I had never considered before, and I'm now more confident that I'll be able to do high-quality epi research myself in the future.",
    "I think a lot of the material can seem like a repetition from other classes. But this course does a good job of really going into depth into some common epi variables so that you are aware of the issues that are associated with these variables in research. It's not very demanding, but I think you get a lot out of it.",
    "It was very repetitive of concepts I was learning in other classes. The midterm and final were essentially the same exam. I honestly would have rather taken another elective.",
    "The course covers a number of very important issues in the measurement of exposures and outcomes.",
    "The overall structure and organization was great- the first half of the semester was focused on measurement issues of various exposures, followed by measurement issues of various outcomes. The final group project was the best part of the class- not only did it allow us to integrate all concepts from the course to design an entire epidemiological study on a topic of our own interests, it also gave us a chance to hear about our fellow students' projects\/presentations, and I sincerely found that every single topic was so unique and interesting. Instead of having a final exam, I think it would have been preferable to have the final group project\/presentations as the last assignment of the course, and to just have more small homework assignments throughout the semester.",
    "This class is a great accompaniment to the rest of the CDE curriculum. Many of the concepts are repeated, but it solidifies the material from other classes rather than feeling redundant. Each topic is taught by a different lecturer who is an expert in the field and boils down the suggestions for addressing key measurement issues. The homework assignments and project were also interesting and straight forward.",
    "This is a very good course. Its main strengths are that it covers the measurement issues of the most common measures in chronic disease epidemiology and that adds and reinforce what is taught in epidemiology 1 and 2 regarding measurement error and other topics.",
    "Very good course.",
    "Overall, the course was good for anyone without a lot of background in epi. Explored a wide range of interesting topics.",
    "Sometimes I forgot this was a class. It only meets once a week and did not have homework often. We had interesting lectures, both from Prof. Ma and guest lecturers, but I don't think I strengthened my analytic skills for critiquing public health research. I also didn't feel like doing the readings was necessary for class, but they were helpful for the homeworks and exams.",
    "I feel like everything we learned in this course could have been summed up in one extra lecture in Epi II.",
    "Strengths: help students to apply knowledge learned from other coursesWeaknesses: No new knowledge learned and a little be boring",
    "Overall, good class covering the major exposure and outcome variables in chronic disease research. Favorite part were the group project because we were able to apply class material to designing a study - and the breadth of topics made the presentations interesting. The group projects could be structured a little bit more - although there was a diversity of topics, it sometimes became repetitive.Also enjoyed the occasional guest lecturer - great way to get to know other professors and their research interests.",
    "Strengths: emphasised the details of epi 2 that Prof dubrow did not go over. It made me appreciate epi a lot more.Weaknesses: A lot of overlap, but I think this is inevitable."

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "This is a very broad (survey) course of measurement issues in epidemiology. Content delivered by a series of guest lectures and the course requirements are a take home midterm, take home final exam, a group project, and a couple of very easy homeworks. The work load is minimal (to non-existent some weeks) but the approach is helpful for other epi courses.",
    "Recommend, but just understand that some of the topics may overlap with previous coursework.",
    "The guest lecturers are interesting. However, much of the content is covered in other courses (particularly in Epi II). I would not recommend it to someone who is already taking Epi II and other CDE courses and is not required to take this course.",
    "I suggest this course to be an elective course in the next year.",
    "The topics covered in this class weren't covered in any other class I took at YSPH, and I think it was really important for me to gain the skills that I gained from this class. I appreciated the opportunity to critique the ways that these things were measured in real studies and think about how I will do this in the future.",
    "This course is exactly the what it sounds like. It looks at the measurement issues in important variables that commonly occur in epi studies. It can sometimes be a little dry, but the lectures cover very practical material, and you come out learning a lot.",
    "I will strongly recommend it.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it but it's required for CDE.",
    "I would recommend this course because it highlights the very important issues relating to measurement in Epi studies.",
    "Great and highly recommend! If you plan to become an epidemiologist, go into research, or just want to understand how to read journals with a more critical eye, this course is essential. I learned so much and am so glad that CDE students are required to take this BEFORE starting our summer internships",
    "I would recommend this class to other CDE students. The structure of the class is a good way to get to know different professors from across campus, as well.",
    "I would recommend it. It is a really good course for those interested in expanding and reinforcing what is being taught in epidemiology courses.",
    "The course taught me much knowledge about how to deconstruct papers and think critically about epidemiological concepts. Very good course!",
    "Very easy course, interesting guest lectures, very smart and funny professor",
    "If you have to take it, don't worry because it's not that much work at all but it's not the most exciting thing you'll do in your life. If it's not required, maybe take something that would be harder but more worthwhile.",
    "not recommend",
    "I would recommend it only if the student is an epi major, as this builds upon epi 2 knowledge significantly. The content makes a student more aware of thedesign of an epi study, which I think a lot of classes do not emphasise on. I have no doubt that the knowledge gleaned from this class will be of practical use in future."
