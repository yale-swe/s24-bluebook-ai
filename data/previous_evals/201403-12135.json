    "An amazing course that delves into the depth of the Peloponnesian War through ancient sources as well as thought prof. Kagan's books.",
    "Donald Kagan is the man. If you're even *remotely* interested in Ancient Greek history, and if Kagan is teaching again, you seriously need to take advantage of the opportunity.",
    "Very cool class on an important piece of history and on the historical method itself. Long live the humanities, the humanities are dead!",
    "Take it. Not even a question. This is one of the greatest, if not the best course I've taken at Yale. You will have to work hard, and can't skimp on reading Thucydides, but it is well worth it to learn from Kagan. The material is applicable to anyone interested in foreign policy today and the foundations of our democratic principles, not just Ancient Greek history. If he teaches it next year, I repeat: take it!!",
    "Take any course you can with Donald Kagan. He's brilliant, caring, and very funny to boot. Also, Thucydides is incredible. Classicist Victor Davis Hanson says it best in his introduction to our edition: \"The Peloponnesian War turns out to be no dry chronicle of abstract cause and effect. No, it is above all an intense, riveting, and timeless story of strong and weak men, of heroes and scoundrels and innocents too, all caught in the fateful circumstances of rebellion, plague, and war that always strip away the veneer of culture and show us for what we really are.\"",
    "Yes. I recommend it.",
    "Great course, Kagan is a wonderful professor and I'm so glad I had the opportunity to take a seminar with him. Not sure if he will teach this again, but if he does, jump at the chance.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale. I went in with no background in the Classics, but had a truly wonderful time!",
    "This class is incredible and unlike any history class I've taken before. It is a lot of work, but absolutely worth it. Professor Kagan is amazing and this class is a one of a kind experience.",
    "This is the best course I've taken at Yale. It beats Grand Strategy hands-down, and it even surpasses McChrystal's Leadership Seminar. This course will be of interest to aspiring historians, psychologists, political scientists, and anyone else generally interested in the ways that human nature and leadership affect the course of human events. I recommend this course without reservation.",
    "Take it if you can. This class is hands down the best class at Yale I've taken. An excellent seminar experience in every way, and I would not change a single thing about it. Professor Kagan is a most excellent historian and teacher.",
    "This course is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to examine a paradigmatic war under the mentorship of the world's expert in the subject. The syllabus is extremely reading-heavy, you'll probably find yourself wanting to do the majority of the work out of curiosity and a desire to be a good participant in discussion with Professor Kagan. Word to the wise - you don't have to buy all of the books. You can read the ancient source material through iBooks or Perseus.com, and Professor Kagan's texts are available through Yale eBrary. This isn't to say that you shouldn't have a copy of Thucydides and Prof. Kagan's history in class, but if you're on a book-buying budget it's good to be aware of that. I thought the final exam was tough but fair - make sure throughout the course that you are really giving 'full shrift' to the non-Thucydides authors. Other than that, expect to have fun! Professor Kagan is a hoot and really cares about what students think."
