   "comments": [
    "Chinese 110 is a very strong language program. The class meets every day for 50 minutes and each student meets for a one-on-one TA session for 30 minutes every week. We cover a lot of grammer and vocab in this class but the emphasis is definitely on tones and speaking rather than writing characters. There are 4 Chinese 110 teachers and they rotate classes every week so ever student is taught by every teacher. While we learned a lot, it took a huge amount of time. Every night I had several hours of homework, including studying for our daily quizzes. Overall I would highly recommend this course. While it was a lot of work, all of it was worthwhile. In addition, I found the grading to be very fair. If you put in the work, which granted was difficult, you were likely to do well. The teachers are all very approachable and present the concepts very clearly. One thing that I think could improve the course is a better textbook. The one we used was not bad, but it did not thoroughly explain all the grammar concepts it used. The teachers covered these thoroughly in class, but it would have been nice to have them all in the book.",
    "Chinese 110 is a lot of daily work, but it pays off when you realize that at the end of the semester, you know tons of Chinese. I highly recommend this course.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Take this course if you want to learn Chinese, but make sure you are COMMITTED to spend a large part of EVERY day of your semester working for it. You literally have to be on top of everything every waking moment if you want to do well. Quizzes every day. If there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a quiz, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a chapter test. Or an oral exam. You memorize 6 characters per day, and about 20 new words in pinyin\/character daily.",
    "It's a ton of work, but it's an incredible experience! If you want to learn Chinese, and have a ton of fun with your section, take it!",
    "If you're looking to learn Chinese or just for a language class this class is a smooth introduction and you get every resource possible to succeed. By the end of the semester you feel as if you could communicate with someone on basic terms very well.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking for a solid introductionto Chinese. Beware that you will have to take L2 after L1. The class starts out slow but gradually accelerates. Make sure you are prepared for those daily quizzes.",
    "This class is incredible. The teachers work as a fabulous team and you may not find a sweeter group of people at Yale. Learning Chinese is a challenge, but it was one I found myself facing and succeeding against. It is a lot of daily work, but for me it was a great break from my other time-consuming science classes. As a junior starting a new language for fun, it was great to meet new people in my class, and as a general trend I saw that there was a good mix of class years in each section. If you really want to learn Chinese and learn it well, take this class.",
    "This class is difficult and isn't for someone who doesn't want to put in a solid couple hours of work every night. However, the teachers are really exceptional and the class is really well structured,so the class flies by everyday. I really enjoyed the humor and laid back attitude of the class.",
    "I would recommend this class. Although the daily quizzes and strictly graded homework force you to study every day, the teachers are excellent and from what I've heard from other sections, most people get to be pretty close with the people in their section. The language isn't particularly difficult, but you must put in the time to master the characters, tones, and vocabulary.",
    "This class will teach you Chinese. The material is rigorous, but the instruction is so methodical and well-organized that it is easy to do well in the course as long as you do the work. Additionally, the teachers have found a way to make the material fun and engaging, to the point that it is easy for sections to become close friends through language instruction."
