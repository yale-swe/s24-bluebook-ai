   "comments": [
    "Take it if you don't want to deal with the terrible grade curve of 120. but have some familiarity with lin algebra.",
    "The class is good. The professor explains the material very well.",
    "I think maths depends a lot on the instructor, so if Apoorva is still teaching it next semester\/year, then take it.",
    "A nice combination of the core material of linear algebra and multivariable. Can be a little confusing in class but once you understand the material, easy to follow.",
    "Recommend if you are not a math person",
    "Great math course! Apoorva is a great teacher, extremely helpful! The problem sets can be long and challenging, but Apoorva is always more than willing to help during office hours. The midterm and final are not too bad and similar to the practices.",
    "Great course if you are certain that you are going to take ONLY economics. If anybody is even thinking that they might do Economics&Mathematics, do NOT take this course.",
    "Definitely take it.",
    "if you take it i suggest you watch videos online to learn the material",
    "I would summarize Math 118 as math for intended majors of economics. This does not mean that it is a class for students who do not intend to take math further. Overall, I recommend this course if you are planning to study economics and even if you are not, it is a great course.",
    "sure for econ. not too hard.",
    "Don't do it with Apoorva.",
    "It's a good class, but not easy. I still recommend it though, because I think these are basic mathematical concepts that really everyone should know, and they're applicable to Econ as well.",
    "Math 118 is a great class if you're looking for an understanding of linear algebra and multivariable calc, at least with Prof. Khare. He's great at explaining the material and always there when you need him.",
    "Amazing course, Apoorva is a great instructor, if you'll be an econ major, definitely take this course."
