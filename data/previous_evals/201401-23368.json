   "comments": [
    "Take this course. The material isn't too difficult, but it is interesting. The guest speakers are a nice touch to the class too. You'll learn a fair bit about violence without having to put in an enormous amount of work. Prof. Lee is also extremely nice and willing to discuss topics further with you if you ask.",
    "Good 5th class",
    "-definitely recommended to other students, especially if interested in public health\/violence prevention",
    "Great professor and the class is not too much load. The grading is also not too harsh and you learn about violence without even feeling like you have put in too much effort. Yet by the end of the semester you realize how your view on violence and it's perpetrators has changed dramatically. I recommend it highly.",
    "Take this course if you are broadly interested in issues of violence! Very interdisciplinary, and this course will make you think and analyze issues of violence in ways you never have before - I learned so much!",
    "I have such conflicting feelings about this class because if it was a lecture course I would have called it one of the best I've taken. But it's not a lecture course, it is a seminar. Which usually means some discussion among the students on different topics. But the only time you could speak in class was to ask a question. So most class I just kind of sat there and listened and sometimes took notes. It didn't help that most classes had guest lecturers. Who were great and were experts in there field but just I couldn't get past the lack of discussion. On the other hand Professor Lee is a nice grader and there's only three papers to be handed in and you can kind of choose any topic you want. So the class is doable. Its just should be restructured as a lecture course.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in approaching violence from a public-health perspective. The class is great in that it examines violence from many different disciplines. It's also nice to get to write papers on topics of choice, and the grading is reasonable. Also some amazing guest speakers. However, for a seminar, do not expect many great discussions.",
    "This was probably my favorite class so far at Yale. The workload is very manageable, and the class itself and most of the readings are really interesting. It really changed the way I look at violence, and I think it's a class that no one would regret taking. Bandy is a great lecturer and couldn't be more accommodating to her students, and the interdisciplinary way she looks at violence makes it a great class for people interested in a wide variety of topics. Definitely take it.",
    "If you are passionate about studying violence and violence prevention, you must take this class!",
    "A course on violence that, each week, integrates a different discipline (psychology, sociology, political science, law and so on) to understand a very complex phenomenon. In this sense of tieing together diverse ideas, the course is hugely ambitious and can often fall short of providing a comprehensive framework to make sense of violence. Professors and professionals from other disciplines come almost every week to lecture and share some of their ideas, and these help broaden the course's perspective. It can be great if you love interdisciplinary topics, but I often felt like I was only scratching the surface of a enormous phenomenon and had trouble integrating ideas.",
    "Take this class.",
    "Take this class - it is accessible to any major and you will most likely find out how your field of interest fits into the study of violence. Keep an open mind during discussions; some topics are sensitive and others will challenge some popular ideas. Workload is not heavy - focus on the readings because they are genuinely interesting and are drawn from a variety of disciplines."
