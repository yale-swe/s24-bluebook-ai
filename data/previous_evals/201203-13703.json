    "Professor Anisfeld is a very organized professor who clearly puts a lot of time into teaching this course. I was impressed by his dedication to teaching and to working with students outside of class to make sure material was well understood.",
    "Overall this was a really excellent class.One suggestion: At times the formulas that we would need for homework assignments were hard to find in the printed notes. Some way of highlighting them better might be useful--perhaps a common form of presentation, or just making them larger on the slide. In addition, at times not all the variables in the formula were explained in class--it would be helpful if a definition of each variable were included with some detail in the slide.Otherwise, great class and wonderful explanations.",
    "This course was challenging for people like me, with no prior background. I really had to try hard to get my mind back into a science-oriented mode. It hadn't happened since high school. But that's part of the reason why I came to FES, and this course accomplished exactly what I was hoping it would. Overall I'm very happy with the course.",
    "This course should be mandatory for all students.",
    "Shimi is awesome. But he tries to cover a LOT. Not too much, but I would've gotten completely lost if I hadn't recently taken several related science undergrad classes.",

    "I really liked that participation was encouraged and was facilitated through the clickers.Also the approach of using class response questions to solidify and test our knowledge was very helpful.I also appreciated the chance to explore a topic of interest to me through the paper summary. This enabled me to look into a subject that I felt I needed to understand for other courses but that couldn't be covered in depth in this course.",
    "I thought the readings posted on ClassesV2 were very helpful (except that they trailed off towards the end of the semester).",
    "We went over a range of topics, all of which I am sure will be built upon in more specialized classes.",
    "Shimi is a very good teacher; he has very high standards, but the course is very rewarding if you put the time and effort in to learn the material. I felt like I learned a lot in this course!!",
    "Shimi's lecture style is great, very engaging and clearly thought out. Shimi is the most accessible and responsive professor I have had at FES. He clearly cares a great deal about teaching, and it shows, he's excellent.I also really like his sense of humor.",
    "Material was interesting. Well-organized.",
    "-Shimi being open to questions during class-TAs helpful during office hours-Work and tests felt very reasonable and asked reasonable questions of students, but were still challenging",
    "Really useful and valuable information. Shimi is the best part of the course - he is clearly interested and dedicated and one of the best professors at FES.",
    "Shimi is awesome during office hours. He's pushed me and everyone, but was helpful and nice while doing it.",
    "The breadth of material. Felt like a good review.",
    "The course material flowed smoothly from concept to concept and the overall delivery was done in a way that maintained interest. Use of the 'clicker' during class was a big plus that helped keep students engaged.",
    "Professor Anisfeld was very responsive to questions asked by students in class. I really liked that he posed several questions during every session that we answered on the spot using clickers. This not only kept students engaged but was a very effective way for Professor Anisfeld and for students themselves to gauge how well they were understanding the new material. I also thought the class response questions due 24 hours after each class and the article summary were very effective and useful teaching devices.",

   "comments": [
    "I worry about retention -- all problem sets are focused on quantitative calculations that I expect not to remember to be able to do in a few months after the course is over. Given that this is an intro class, more focus should be on core *concepts* rather than applying various formulas and conversion factors.",
    "Please see above re: clarity of formulas in notes.",
    "I think we would have benefited from discussing the readings in class a bit more. For example, once or twice during the semester we could discuss in class a journal article or research paper that was assigned in the days before. The written summary was useful, but this could be another good way to get experience understanding research.",
    "I felt like this course was structured with the idea that all (or most) of the students would go to office hours most weeks to get help on the problem sets--I feel like they weren't really designed so that we could do them on our own. I appreciate that one of the TAs or Shimi was always available to help, but I wasn't a big fan of this format. If problem sets are going to be difficult (even if they are easier than past years!) it almost seems like the course would benefit from having a weekly section.",
    "Staying on top of class response questions was challenging. Too much going on, when you combine class responses with problem sets, exams, etc. And I feel like too much grading weight was placed on class responses vis a vis the other things that took much more work (like problem sets).",
    "-Thought it would have been interesting to have clicker questions answered by students who had answered correctly - corrected, if necessary, by Shimi",
    "Nothing.",
    "I feel that the course covers too much material. I would have preferred to cover water, atmosphere and soil topics only, and perhaps leave an introduction to energy and climate change to another course entirely.",
    "Sometimes I found problem set questions to be worded in a way that could be interpreted in more ways than one... which would lead to more than one correct answer.",
    "In a survey course like this I think it is good - to the extent possible - I think it is good for professors to try to not overemphasize their area of specialization. It was a bit frustrating to have all roads lead back to pKa\u00c2\u00b4s but I will admit that the repetition was good at helping me retain the material.",
    "I would have liked even more discussion of the practical applicability of the course concepts and exercises in how they may be useful in solving problems.In a couple of cases, some key skills were never fully developed in the lectures, but needed in the problem sets (e.g. chemistry). This was very frustrating.",
    "I honestly felt that there was too much material covered in this course in terms of how many different topics were covered. On a couple of different occasions I found myself getting frustrated that because there was such a breadth of material covered in this course, we were not able to go into as much depth as I would have liked. In my mind, the whole value of studying science is understanding how and why things work the way that they do. It is very difficult to teach a \"survey\" science course that touches on so many different topics in such a short period of time. Since I understand this course to be the only basic science class for science and non-science students alike, I would advocated for it being offered as a two part course. Half of the topics could be covered in the fall and half in the spring, both in greater detail. That way not only would students feel like they had a more technical (rather than quite basic) understanding of the material but they could also choose which topics were most relevant to their professional interest and therefore only take one or take both of the two courses.",
