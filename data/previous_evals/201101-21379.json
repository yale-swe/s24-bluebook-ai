    "This course was helpful as a general basis for generating a method for building sociological arguments. As such, it was essential for formulating my dissertation\/research.",
    "The course absolutely helped with familiarizing myself with research agendas although I wish there was more on ethnographic methods. It also helped with analyses of journal articles in the field of sociology. However, I do feel that it leaned too heavily on a positivist approach and didnt offer equal attention to other approaches in the field.",
    "I got a much better sense of mainstream qualitative research in sociology, and in particular the research expectations of ASR and ASJ. This is helpful to me as I start working on my second year paper."
