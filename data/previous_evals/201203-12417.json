   "comments": [
    "This was a really great class, and you don't have to come in knowing anything about Asia or American lit. There's a wide variety of material stretching from the nineteenth century to \"Blade Runner,\" but even in the more difficult bits Prof. Williams keeps it interesting. Williams himself is great--very laid back and open to everyone's comments, but he doesn't hesitate to guide the discussion when it needs guiding. (Also, he's in a band called Faded Paper Figures and their songs have been on Grey's Anatomy!)",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The subject is very interesting, and is made even more so by Professor Williams, who is engaging, funny, and extremely knowledgeable about all the course material. The course load is manageable as well.",
    "English 299 specifically focuses on the trend in U.S. literature of viewing Asia as \"techn\u00c3\u00aa\" from the mid 19th century to the present day, and if you are interested in Asia or the U.S., this course will have something to offer you. The final paper at the end is a bit long, and this was my first experience writing a paper that went over 20 pages, but because of the two assignments that precede it, it was not an insurmountable challenge, and I feel so accomplished now that it is completed. If it catches your interest at all, you should DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE. Professor Williams is a fantastic teacher, a *ridiculously* knowledgeable scholar, an awesome musician, and a really great guy.",
    "In terms of the course materials, I believe every Asian-American, Asian or American students would be fascinated. One will start reflecting on issues related to racism, cultural differences and so on.",
    "Exploration of the cultural relationship between east and west. I was exposed to ideas that I never would have been otherwise.",
    "This is a fascinating course that is probably one of the most eclectic I've taken at Yale. Drawing on history, media, cultural, and literary studies, we looked at ways the West has imagined East Asia in film, literature, poetry, and even corporate culture. This is not simply a history or writing course, but one that creates a very interesting narrative that crosses disciplines. Highly recommended.",
    "Definitely, for anyone interested in East Asian culture and the meeting of East and West, this is a must take course.",
    "I will definitely recommend this course.This course unfolds different perspectives about cross-cultural encounter between America and East Asia, in a most unexpected and interesting way. It covers texts from lively biographical stories to the 70s and 80s science fictions, including writings by novelists, architect, spiritual guru, theorist, poet, and so on. My classmates are all very fun and friendly, and the professor is the best part of this course: humorous, energetic and helpful. Just a side note: he has a band in California, and earns loyalty from it.",
    "If you are interested in Japan, from its history to its influence on American culture and literature, then definitely take this class. If you are looking for a fun writing credit with a great professor, then take this class.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE IT. This course is great if you're interested in East Asian studies, film studies, American studies, or if you just need a writing credit. The professor's amazing--hilarious, knowledgeable, great speaker, and a chill BAMF. Not only were the texts we read\/watched interesting and relevant, but discussing them in a small seminar setting with such a great professor made this class really enjoyable. I looked forward to the readings and to coming to class discussions. Not bad of a workload throughout the semester, but the final paper (~25 pages) was stressful, especially given the shorter reading period. However, the professor gave out extensions to anyone who felt they didn't have enough time, and he's a pretty lenient grader. How much I enjoyed this course far outweighed the stress of the final paper anyways. TAKE IT--this was one of my favorite courses at Yale so far.",
    "I would recommend this class if you wanna gain more perspective on the different cross cultural exchanges that happened during the Gilded Ages",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you're interested in the course material and want to take a multi-disciplinary english class that is fun and doesn't overwhelm you with busy work. Definitely take it!"
