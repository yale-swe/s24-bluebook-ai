   "comments": [
    "Got a great introductory look into inorganic chemistry -- made me want to learn more!",
    "I learned a lot related to the theory of inorganic chemistry, a field to which I had not previously been exposed. I also felt that my knowledge of general chemistry a class I skipped to take freshman organic was tangentially solidified. I learned how to apply concepts to solve problems and to elucidate mechanisms of catalysis and so on (that part I particularly enjoyed). I also generally gained a greater appreciation for inorganic chemistry as a field with applications in medicine, industry, and so on. This was a valuable supplement to the textbook knowledge I was learning.",
    "Knowledge of inorganic chemistry\/skill of applying the knowledge to problem solving",
    "In taking this course, I was confronted with lots of entirely new material in a fast-paced manner. It was often challenging to become comfortable with the material, but the problem sets, studying, and talking to Nilay or Dave helped to bring things into focus considerably. This course required constant extension of the material in solving new problems, which was very rewarding.",
    "I learned how to approach questions more theoretically using fact-based knowledge I was taught in class.",
    "I learned a lot of cool Inorganic Chemistry stuff.",
    "Learned about reactions of transition metals and catalysis, ET, bonding of TM complexes, molecular symmetry, and different models of bonding.",
    "This course teaches the basic of inorganic chemistry. It starts with general Chemistry, but quickly moves into Transition metal bonding, reactions and catalysis.",
    "Before I took this class, I was pretty convinced that inorganic chemistry was magic. More than eight valence electrons? Elements below the third row? Sounds like some kind of voodoo to me. Now, I feel I have a much better understanding of the general principles that govern transition metal chemistry (the 18-electron rule, oxidation state, electron-donating and withdrawing ligands, etc), and I can apply them to model catalytic cycles. There are still moments of utter befuddlement ([Cu(NH3)3]2+ is a 21-electron complex? What is this wizardry?) but mostly I have a good intuition for what is going on. I also learned a lot about how chemistry research is conducted specifically about the people who conduct it. :)",
    "I learned a lot about general Inorganic Chemistry through this course. It was a great, but challenging, survey course.",
    "This course was an overview of inorganic chemistry, discussing transition metal chemistry, reactions, catalysts, electron transfer, and I'm sure I'm missing more. Furthermore, this class really solidified other, more basic chemical knowledge, such as orbitals, molecular orbital theory, hybridization, etc, which will go a long way no matter what type of chemistry is being studied."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Workload was fair yet effective. Would have liked maybe to have spent more time on the orbital theory portion.",
    "This is a strong course because it is small in size and the teaching staff felt very accessible. This is not necessarily a weakness, per se, but having some demonstrations in class would be super cool if the instructor could manage it.",
    "The class was very well-organized and well-taught (among the most well-taught I've had at Yale). The pacing was reasonable, and both the instructor and TA were very accessible\/helpful. The material seemed relevant to the real world, and was also intellectually stimulating. However, sometimes I felt like I had some knowledge gaps, and would have appreciated additional resources to fill them in (the book wasn't always great). I did that by googling, but it would also be nice to have received some instructor-approved resources to get additional information.",
    "I really liked this course. The lectures were very organized and engaging. As odd as it sounds, I liked the problem sets a lot. They were tough, but in completing them I was really able to get a sense of the material. I've always liked learning through problem-solving best. Also, Nilay and Dave were an awesome duo. I don't have any real complaints.",
    "The strengths of this class are that mostly everything you need to know is taught at some point, somewhere. The weaknesses of the course are that there gets to be a lot of information that is sometimes covered quite breezily, so it is difficult to know what to focus on and what not to.",
    "Nilay is a teaching god.",
    "The class could really use a better textbook. Nilay is a great lecturer but the textbook doesn't really follow the class so if you were confused about something in lecture it can be hard to get clarification without going to office hours. The class was great otherwise, I learned a lot and while the psets were challenging they really helped with my understanding of the material.",
    "The only criticism I have is I wish there was more review for test.",
    "Strengths: lectures were very clear and very interesting, Nilay is an engaging, kind, and knowledgeable professor, and Dave was a very helpful TA. Improvement: it might be nice to have practice tests.",
    "This course is very good. Nilay's is a great lecturer who is engaging and always ready with a story. He takes the time to develop a relationship with the class and makes himself readily available. The workload is average for an introductory chemistry course, a problem set every week and 3 midterms. My only suggestion for this course would be that Nilay's improve his handwriting. It's mostly legible though!",
    "Honestly, the biggest strengths of the course were Nilay and Dave. Having a wonderful professor and teaching fellow can make all the difference. They were dedicated, good at explaining concepts, and were willing to spend a lot of time with me. Before I took this class, I didn't particularly like inorganic chemistry as a subject. I'm pretty sure that if it weren't for the two of them, I would have come out feeling the same way. Also, the course was exceedingly well-organized Nilay created a detailed outline for the entire semester, which made the material easy to follow. The problem sets were challenging and definitely helped me understand the material. Finally, I appreciated the stories he told in class - they helped to humanize the chemistry profession, and provided a welcome break when he could sense that our attention was starting to wane. I really cant think of too many weaknesses. Some of the questions on the problem sets and exams were slightly unfair, but I suspect that the effect on my grade was fairly negligible. There were a few topics that needed a little bit more explaining in class, (square planar vs. tetrahedral geometry, for example). It would be helpful to have practice exams, but Nilay already said that our exams will serve as practice for next years students. I think thats about it. To be exceedingly nitpicky, Nilay sometimes stands in front of the board after hes done writing on it, which makes things a little harder to follow.",
    "Strengths: Course made to fit the students. If they struggled with a particular unit, the teacher would slow down and make sure they understood the material. Problem sets were challenging but reflected course material well. Exams were fair. Discussion sections were excellent. Weakenesses: Teacher's handwriting sometimes unreadable\/unfollowable.",
    "It was very well taught, and I didn't really have to go into the book to clarify anything in class. Nilay and Dave were very helpful to answer and gaps in my understanding. One major weakness I felt was that the tempo of the class was just a bit too high, notetaking-wise. Perhaps it's just that my handwriting is slow, but I often fell behind and struggled to catch up, which posed a problem when Nilay was ahead explaining something, and I was behind copying down notes from the board."

   "comments": [
    "Required for the chem major but certainly worth your time. An interesting survey of inorganic chemistry that will help you decide whether or not that's a field in chemistry you're interested in. Nilay is very accessible and helpful and cares a lot about his students.",
    "I would highly recommend this class, especially if Nilay is teaching it again in the future. Obviously it is required for the chemistry major, but I think it would be enjoyable for anyone with the sufficient background and interest. A wonderful old-school lecture course, overall.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, especially if it's taught be Nilay. As a non-chemistry major (though with a strong science background), this class was completely reasonable. Nilay also makes himself very accessible to students, and Dave (if you have the fortune to get him) is an excellent TA. As long as you do the work and use the resources in this class, you'll learn a lot and be successful. (Also, donuts. You get those sometimes.)",
    "This class is great. It provides a good survey of several topics in Inorganic chemistry in an organized, thorough manner. Nilay is a great lecturer and his problem sets and tests are really well done. These assessments are tough, but they are interesting and they teach you a lot. Overall, this class was one of the most well put together, satisfying classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in chemistry and willing to apply higher level knowledge to the course matter. Doing well will require significant understanding of concepts and ability to rationalize different observations with appropriate justification.",
    "1000%. Especially if Nilay is teaching. His priority is the students and you can definitely tell. He will drop anything to talk to you and make sure you understand the material. Best teacher I've had at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class if a student is interested in the material. Most students taking the class were chemistry majors but you wouldn't have to be to do well in it. It's interesting, not my favorite topic in chemistry but I enjoyed it.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who's interested in chemistry.",
    "This course is amazing! Nilay is a great professor who really cares about his students. Lectures were very interesting. Reactions of transition metals and transition metal catalysis were especially exciting topics.",
    "Take this if you're interested in Inorganic chemistry. Nilay is a great professor to learn from!",
    "yes! If you need it, take it with nilay!",
    "Nilay has turned inorganic chemistry into a cohesive narrative. He starts with the fundamentals of general chemistry (valence bond theory, etc.) and quickly moves on to more advanced models (crystal field theory, molecular orbital theory, etc.) that are up to the task of modeling transition metal complexes. At the end of the course, you apply all of the stuff youve learned to understand the mechanism of a catalytic cycle. In the process, you will gain a good intuition for transition metal chemistry, and youll actually understand the organometallics that seemed like voodoo in organic chemistry (such as the Heck\/Suzuki reactions). The best part of this class, however, is Nilay himself. He is a brilliant scientist, an excellent lecture, and the most down-to-earth and humble professor Ive ever had. Despite his numerous accomplishments, he insists that you call him by his first name, and always wants to hear how youre doing outside of the classroom. Also, Dave was also an incredible and dedicated TF (probably the best Ive had at Yale), and I hope youre lucky enough to have him too. They made a wonderful team, and Id probably take pretty much any class if the two of them taught it.",
    "Probably not as enjoyable as orgo, but still a solid class to take. I think this is a good intro course to the harder chem classes, especially for those who are considering the chemistry major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, however I would caution them to have a good basic chemistry background prior to entering this course.",
    "It's a must take for chemistry majors, not just because it's a requirement, but because inorganic chemistry is very much involved in other types of chemistry."
