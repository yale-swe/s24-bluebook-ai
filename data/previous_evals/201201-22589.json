    "It is a great course to take for students who want to continue studying Japanese. It is an intensive language course so there is going to be a consistent workload that might be more than other classes. But in order to learn a language, it is necessary to put in the time and effort so it makes sense. I definitely recommend taking this course. My class had only 6people so I got to know them really well and it made the the class fun.",
    "Take the second semester of Yonnensei. Both semesters are incredible, but in the Spring you learn so much and your Japanese grows so fast. This semester is intense. There is more homework, more reading, and your speaking abilities are challenged. But the results are incredible. In this semester, you focus more on reading about social issues and recent history (and how that relates to current topics in Japanese society), and time and time again I have had long and amazing conversations with Japanese people outside of class on these topics. My Japanese became better in almost every way. Most importantly, you become so much better at reading; you emerge being able to pretty comfortable read newspapers, articles, and literature (you finish the semester with the first half of Kitchen by Yoshimoto Banana!!) Iu made mo naku, Murata sensei to Seto sensei ga sugoku tanoshii, yasashii sensei de, kono jugyou ha totemo yuuyou dake dewanaku, fukaku omoshirokatta keiken desu yo.",
    "I learned new vocabulary and grammar taking this course, but I wish there had been more emphasis on speech, especially in class. We read a lot of essays that were focused on ideas we probably couldn't talk extensively about even in English so bringing in more relevant issues or having debates, etc could help students feel their speaking, which is one of the most important things for a student of this level, is getting better.",
    "Take it if you took 156. It's a good continuation to maintain your Japanese. It would be nice if there was more speaking practice but for now this is the best option. Your reading ability and speed will increase drastically over the year."
