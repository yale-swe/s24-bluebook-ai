    "I mean, I guess you sort of have to. But if youdo the class, it's just three times the work of any other Yale class: you do a full production (which is WAYYYY more work than any other class at Yale), then you write a massive and deeply confusing paper (is it a production history? is it a rehearsal report? is it a literary essay? I still don't know), then you also have to take a class once a week, for which you have to see productions and write another (seemingly unrelated) paper. But hey, the people are great.",
    "There's not a lot of choice here - as a major, you are obligated to complete the course, and there's nothing about it that would necessarily deter a prospective Theater Studies student from choosing the major. Just don't expect an overemphasis on the practical and straightforward. The experience is more culminating and holistic than the simple mounting of a chosen play.",
    "You have to take it if you're doing a senior project that's not through a production seminar. It's silly and kind of a waste of time most weeks, but the design presentations are very helpful. The post-mortems would be helpful if there were any sort of audience to hear the advice, but as it is they serve no purpose -- it does other seniors no good to hear how your project went since they're already in the thick of or done with theirs. Juniors are the ones that need to hear it, and the publicity is terrible so they don't come to hear the advice, so it does nothing.",
    "The Senior Project in Theater Studies is the culmination of your theatrical experience at Yale. The class itself provides a supportive backbone -- a kind of weekly check-in -- to make sure that the show and subsequently the paper are on track. The class can feel a bit like busywork at times, but I was definitely thankful to have the support system."
