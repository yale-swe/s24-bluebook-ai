    "One of the best courses at Yale! Professor Zucker presents the material in a manner that anyone, and everyone can understand. Even if you don't understand it in class (because you just had lunch, and your eyes just won't stay open), you can understand what's going on when you read the lecture notes. Zucker is a master at using examples familiar to everyone in order to explain complex mathematical concepts.However, just because the material is easy to understand, does not mean that the material is trivial. You will be exposed to a view of vision that very few people in the world have. In fact, after the end of this class, you will be part of that minority in this world which looks at vision from a bottom-up approach, rather than from the top-down.",
    "Make sure you're mathematically strong going in (math 120 at least); the math gets very hairy, although Zucker sort of outlines the major concepts. By contrast, the coding is a piece of cake (can you write a for-loop? That's really all you need). 5 easy 5-hour problem sets. Easy midterm. Can't speak for the final since I haven't taken it yet.Zucker is brilliant but his lectures can be tough. Fortunately, thorough notes are posted online.Overall the ideas in this course are beautiful when you understand them; I recommend it if you can do the math.",
    "CS475 is a good course, especially if you are looking for a course to count towards the computer science major that is a science credit. Take the class if you are comfortable not grasping all of the information taught in a course but rather you are good at seeing the big picture with topics.",
    "A great introduction to how the brain solves vision problems and how we can do some of the same things with math\/computers. Only an introduction in the sense that we never get to the point were we can say we know how to actually recognize something for real; rather you learn the fundamentals that you use to do that in the more advanced version of this course. Lots of fun, biweekly psets are in Matlab and don't take much time. The final project, however, is supposed to take around 40 hours... Start this relatively early to get it done before finals if you can.",
    "If you don't like math, have never done any chemistry or biology, then don't take this class. If you want an easy class that will completely take care of itself, then don't take this class. Anyone else, I'd have to say go for it. Overall, it was just awesome.",
    "Very abstract look into the various levels of visual organization and the big \"problems\" in trying to understand or reconstruct the way we view the world.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! The subject matter is awesome and at the least has one or two topics to interest anyone, but because it is so good at tying together all the differentareas (neurobiology, math, computer science) into understanding the problem of vision, you are more than likely to like every new topic. While the course is definitely not very programming heavy (trust me I didn't know how to write a for loop at the beginning of the semester), it jumps right into high level math concepts from multivariable calculus, probability, and linear algebra from the start. The good news is that the course mostly requires a conceptual understanding of the math and you will rarely be required to manipulate equations. All in all a perfectly manageable (and perhaps light) course, and an important perspective and great window in on the exciting field of neuroscience.",
    "This class confused me to no end. It draws on so many seemingly unrelated topics, and the professor introduces them all in a fair amount of detail and does not do a great job of tying them together in a way that is easy to understand. I left most lectures feeling like I had understood about 30% of what the Professor had said. He generally does not know who to teach to, so if you are young and don't have too strong of a math background, don't be fooled that you'll understand everything. The homeworks were straightforward, and the TA's help was invaluable. The exams were conceptually easy, especially compared to the lectures. The project was the worst part of the class, because it was assigned too late and was (unofficially) due AFTER finals. The only way to get the project done is to ask the professor and the TAs for help until you have a concrete goal.",
    "A lot of info coming at you in this class, and decent\/doable regular work (problem set due every other week - start it early and ask TAs for help) and a big open-ended project at the end. The project is a lot of work but you learn to enjoy it and you're helped in the right direction. A lot of mathematical thinking is going on in the lectures, but you don't need to cram the details.",
    "Yes! However, if you have not had linear algebra, this class is an uphill battle. I didn't have any and I still found the class rewarding--it was just much harder for me than many of the other students taking the class.Homework isn't too bad. 5 problem sets -- each of them taking about 6 hours or so. Then a midterm, final, and final project. Final project is totally up to you and can be actually a lot of fun.",
    "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an interesting field and a good Sc credit. Some of the math you probably will not have seen before; you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to understand it in-depth, so don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Go to office hours! They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make everything clearer.",
    "You must take this course. It was definitely my favorite computer science class yet. Zucker is the mad scientist type. Sometimes he will blow you away with his amazing examples and stories and other times you will want to hide as he has a penchant for picking on students in his audience. I loved the way he blended together biology and computer vision. The subject material is incredibly cool.Judging by the responses that were on the site last year, I know some of you may be thinking \"oh this seems cool but it looks hard.\" Yes, a lot of it may be over your head. But don't worry. I didn't have the math prereqs and came into the class shaking in my boots, prepared to sacrifice a little bit of my gpa in order to learn some awesome stuff. My fears were not warranted. I thoughtthe exams were both very fair and tested the essentials without fretting over the details. In the end, the final project was one of my all-time favorite assignments. Soooo. Take this class!",
    "This class is a confusing one. Warning: it is not a computer science class. It is a biology and mathematics class (linear algebra and multi-variable calc). The lectures were almost always way over my head; Professor Zucker breezed through many difficult concepts and calculations with minimal explanation, and there was often no way for me to keep up. However, the problems sets, of which there are only five, usually don't touch on the complicated equations and are instead quite straightforward. This disconnect between the lecture and the assessments is unnerving and never changes as the course progresses. Also, the final project is extremely annoying; make sure to consult with Professor Zucker multiple times and early on about it.",
    "If you are able to dedicate some time to the material, you should take it. Be prepared to be confused every now and then, but legitimately an interesting course. Take advantage of the TAs.",
    "The class was a little disorganized. I took it for a science credit and I think most people were taking it for the same reason. It's not a lot of work but the material can be extremely confusing especially since the lectures are hard to follow.",
    "This class is interesting, but leaves you feeling a little unsatisfied. The material is skimmed through as the professor rushes to cover it all, rocketing through challenge topics just to expose you to them, but the mutual understanding is that you are only expected to learn and understand the basics.The workload is small to average up until the last three weeks, at which point this class becomes hell. With a pset, final exam, and a project that the professor states he expects you to spend 40 hours on all assigned and due in a period of under three weeks, you can expect to spend at least three hours per day on the class during that period, assuming you have perfect study habits. It was seriously hellacious. Having both a project and a final assigned means that taking this class is signing yourself up for a week struggling to finish filled with tears tears and a crushing weight of coursework to a degree that I would seriously doubt Yale has made you experience yet, this coming from a CS major who has already the work-intensive core classes.That being said, it's one small part of a long semester. I say take it, but give serious attention to the end-of-semester workloads you will take alongside it",
    "Overall, really interesting subject material but the class is difficult to follow. Lectures get in to very complex math that I think is over a lot of students' heads. But despite the in depth lectures, home works are relatively straightforward and all use MATLAB which is nice to get some exposure to. Final project can be pretty rough if you wait until the last week though.",
    "Really unique class in that its cross disciplinary between CS and BME, so you get students with very different perspectives. Don't worry if you don't have too much coding experience, as the class requires more math than coding anyways. Overall, I thought it was a good class. Sometimes the lectures can be boring and not entirely linear and there's no textbook, but all the notes are online. Zucker is a beast in the field. You learn some realllyyyyyy cool stuff so if you have any interest, I'd definitely recommend the class.",
    "Fascinating material, if you're ok with being lost half the time. I wish I'd had a stronger math background, but the problem sets are very cool, and I definitely benefitted from learning Matlab. Hopefully Daniel is TA again, otherwise I'm not sure how you'll fare. 60% of your grade is determined in the last week of class, by the way - make sure you do a final project that you're excited about, because it's a great opportunity! Tests are very reasonable; notes from lectures will hopefully be a little more finalized next time Zucker teaches this. You won't find a class like this anywhere else!",
    "I would recommend BENG 475 to a student who wants an introduction to various concepts in computational vision. The class, unfortunately, does not have time to go into concepts in depth so it is definitely a survey course. However, the lectures emphasize the process of research and how things are discovered, which is pretty interesting and cool. Professor Zucker is also a very enthusiastic lecturer and clear at explaining difficult concepts. He does a good job teaching such a interdisciplinary course and trying to make sure all the students have a level footing. The workload for this class is pretty light with a pset about every 1.5 weeks. The tests do not emphasize critical thinking but regurgitation. So, they are not stressful but since they test only a few concepts, if you miss the questions, you lose a lot of points. The project at the end of the semester is a really cool opportunity to explore one of many topics in the class. However, it does sneak up on you. By the time most of the class picked a topic, it was the beginning of reading week. Overall, fun class and would recommend if you don't mind an un-rigorous class.",
    "A total mind-#$^!. You'll ask yourself what the is going on 90% of the time. Most people won't know what's going on either, though. It's a mix of neurobiology and math, with a tiny bit of computer science mixed in. You'll learn the basics that allow technology to recognize faces, read barcodes, etc. Concepts are NOT simple. Psets can be challenging because the concepts can take a bit to understand. Midterm and final are relatively easy compared to what's covered in class. 60% of your grade is determined during finals week, which can make this a stressful time.",
    "Great course. Very interesting topics covered but if you don't have a strong background in math it will be difficult to understand everything. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the field",
    "fascinating stuff, taught all over the place, but hey, why not",
    "Vision is a super interesting topic, and by the end of the class you have learned a lot about how it works both biologically and computationally. Zucker is a refined taste, so shop him and see if you like his style. Not directly practical, but hell - what is in the CS department?",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's not terribly hard and it's very interesting. It's very multidisciplinary, you'll talk about a lot of the biology of vision, the anatomy of the visual cortex and how simple neural systems operate to compute basic visual functions and how that relates to the growing field of computer vision. A lot of the focus of the lectures is the biology while the homework is more along the lines of deriving mathematical operators for computer vision. It was a bit more math than I expected but don't worry too much about it. You mostly need an intuitive understanding of derivatives in 2D and gradients. Very little programming and only in matlab which is easy to pick up. The final project can be pretty much anything related to the field which is neat",
    "Despite how specific this class sounds, it is one of general interest - there's something for everyone here! The class touches on so many different subjects - math, CS, psych, biology, physics - that I think everyone was able to take away a good chunk of useful knowledge. This was definitely one of the class's strengths and it was even more accentuated by the final projects in which students were allowed to take the methods learned in class and apply them to any field of interest. The teaching is top notch, Prof. Zucker may have been the best lecturer I have had thus far at Yale. He is very engaging and funny while he is cramming all sorts of knowledge into your head.",
    "I'd beensearching for something that would integrate all my interest in math, physics, and CS and taking this class was a stroke of luck. Professor Zucker is a fabulous lecturer. If you're comfortable tackling new concepts at a relatively fast pace then this is for you.",
    "This class covers a lot of material and can be overwhelming. Zuck may not remember you and will certainly confuse you. I did learn a lot though and I enjoyed the final project, even though it was stressful and ran past finals period.",
    "This class has a lot of potential, as the material is extremely interesting, but I think it should be restructured a little bit to make it more effective. The problem of vision is something that almost everyone has thought about, and this class does propose some important insights into this phenomena, but all the material doesn't get tied together until the very end, so lecture is a little difficult to follow. Professor Zucker is very entertaining and I always looked forward to coming to class, but often felt lost about halfway through. We were provided with lecture notes, but these were quite rough so hopefully they will be improved for classes in the future. But once I started studying for the final and everything came together it was pretty amazing. Overall, Professor Zucker is a good professor and a sweet guy and the class was definitely still worth it, but expectations were just set a little too high after the first couple of lectures. Homework assignments and tests were very reasonable but the final project was kind of a mess since we weren't given much direction, so make sure you figure out a project early."
