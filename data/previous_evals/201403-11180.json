    "Research and Writing could be such a fantastic class to learn and grow as a researcher, but I felt the instructors did not exploit it to its full potential. Because we're writing the paper, I think I'll get a good amount out of the class and I hope (and do believe) that the instructors will give great support and feedback next semester when it really counts to make our work as good as possible.",
    "You will be forced to clarify and defend your ideas in this class.",
    "This is a required course, so this question is not relevant.",
    "Come prepared with a good project idea from the summer if you can.",
    "No, but we don't really have a choice, do we?",
    "I would summarize it as 'write a master's thesis, and hopefully an article', and that it didn't seem all that helpful in this task. Still, its a requirement, so political science Ph.D. students will have to take it anyway.",
    "Try to carve out enough time to push research project forward in the first semester. Overall, can receive some very informed feedback and unique viewpoints that can make your project much stronger."

    "This course is making me better thinking about how to answer a research question I've had for a while.",
    "This course has the potential to be one of the most important courses many of us take. I think with a little re-designing, it could be absolutely fantastic. I think we can drop most of the readings that were assigned in early weeks, and get us talking about and sharing ideas on our projects. It would also be good if we could use the time we would be reading the assigned readings to be doing our own reading\/research.",
    "It really didn't help that much; Most of the discussions about publishing and what I'm working on I have with my advisor or other professors already, and do outside of this course. I didn't learn much about publishing, and besides reading the article on replication (which one already gets in the quant classes), didn't get much on other strategies to publish.",
    "More informed about aspects of other subfields."
