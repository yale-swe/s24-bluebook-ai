    "Don't take it unless it is required or you have some strange interesting in it",
    "Physics 205L is unlikely to be a very fun or interesting course, at least for the first 6 weeks or so. The teachers and TAs are nice, but the labs themselves are just boring (sending a cart down an inclined plane isn't exactly the most exciting way to spend 3 hours). With that being said, you will undoubtedly learn better lab technique, and latter 6 weeks of the course are spent doing far more interesting experiments related to E&M. Since you do the lab reports during the 3 hour allotted time period, the only work you have during the week is the homework assignments and lab quizzes, neither of which should take very long. Overall, the course is a fine course, albeit perhaps not the most interesting.",
    "A generally fun course, basically you get to play with cool toys for three hours each week. I had a great TF, and I can imagine that this class would be a lot less fun if you had a less helpful TF. Low stress outside of class, and no lab reports. Those are serious strengths. The lab handouts are usually ok, but a few notable exceptions were extremely vague. The practical was generally things we had seen before, but a few questions seemed out of nowhere. Basically just follow the procedure like crazy and you'll do fine.",
    "Only take it if you have to, really.",
    "Take John Harris's section.",
    "Three hour labs that usually go over; work is turned in at the end of class, so homework is light. Easy to keep up, even with no prior lab experience. Useful and fun. Highly recommended.",
    "This is not a good course. It is difficult to say what the point of it is, exactly: I came out of it with a better understanding of how to use some basic lab equipment and a handful of error analysis techniques (and these are important, for sure), but nothing that justified the three-hour per week time slot it ate up. The physics department would do well to rethink the structure and goals of the course. The labs themselves aren't particularly difficult, but they're usually quite long--I often had to rush to finish them, and so it was hard to learn the science involved. A few of the professors are condescending, but I was lucky enough to have a great TA--long live Eustace. Maybe the greatest crime of this class is that it's really, really boring; thankfully, it isn't much work, given that we physics majors don't have any choice but to take it.",
    "Nope. I feel like this course was poorly organized, apathetically run, and overall didn't contribute to my understanding of error or error analysis.",
    "I would recommend this course to another prospective STEM major. It certainly gave me great experience with lab-work and data analysis. However, it can also be very stressful at times. The lab write-ups have to done during the same 3 hours as the data collection, making the labs feel rushed and stressful. On top of this, the lab manuals are difficult to understand at times, requiring plenty of prelab preparation. BUT DON'T LET THIS PUT YOU OFF! The course in general is worth the work. You will learn plenty.",
    "I would recommend 205L for anyone who has had some college-level physics before and has a good grasp of mathematical distributions. It can be very difficult conceptually but there are no lab reports so the workload isn't too much.",
    "OH MY GOD I HATED THIS CLASS SO MUCH IT WAS POSITIVELY HORRIBLE LIKE I ACTUALLY FELT PHYSICALLY ILL ONCE A WEEK THE WHOLE DAY BEFORE GOING TO LAB.Sadly, this wasn't the fault of any of the instructors, who basically ran the class as well as they could given the awful format. But the format is just so, so, boring and tiring. Almost none of the labs ever finish in time, and after 3 hours of suffering you're faced with the choice between suffering for another hour or going home and turning in the lab unfinished.Ugh. If you're here you probably have to take this. I'm sorry.",
    "It not awful but it does cause occasional headaches. The experiments are hard to set up but fairly easy to understand. It's great that there is no lab report but there are weekly homework's at least at the beginning. Don't take unless absolutely necessary. This lab is hard but you only have to worry about it for one day a week.",
    "I would recommend it because it introduces students to a wide variety of areas in physics. I learned a lot and I didn't think the work was excessive. Not having lab write-ups is great. The instructors are nice and helpful.",
    "I think your experience will depend mostly on your TA, because I had a chill TA and it was great but I heard some of the other TAs were not quite as kind. The workload is very light: read the lab handout before class, take a short quiz on it, and do the lab. The labs themselves are hit-or-miss depending on what parts of physics interest you. There is also a final exam with a practical and a written part. The consensus opinion was that the practical part was difficult, but only because we had to complete it in 1.5 hours. The written part is not difficult if you pay attention to the few error analysis assignments we have to do during the semester. Overall, a decent class.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to.",
    "Its a good lab course, if you have to take it",
    "If you've done the labs for AP Phys B before, it's worth taking 205 instead of 166 because 166 is literally every lab for AP Phys B.It may have been a bit of a time crunch some weeks, but that was definitely worth it so you only had to worry about lab for that one day a week.The practical, while still a bit scary, really isn't too bad if you keep calm. A little piece of advice: know when to bite the bullet and ask for help.",
    "Only take it if you have to. Labs aren't very interesting. The final is kind of a hit or miss. I didn't really learn anything that seems like it'll be useful except for how to use an oscilloscope.",
    "No. Absolutely not. You'd be crazy to take this class unless you have to. The labs are ridiculous and you're pretty much guessing around the whole semester. That guessing carries over to the practical. It does help if you get a good TA though.",
    "I took this course having not taken AP Physics, or any intro physics course at Yale (I took 205L concurrently with 180). The prevailing recommendation is to take physics 180 a semester beforehand. This would probably have been a good idea - I usually found myself \"learning\" something in 205 then seeing the topic again in 180 a week or two later. This is manageable, especially with a good TA, but it's something to keep in mind for those with little physics experience. The few homework assignments revolve around error analysis, and aside from homework and pre-quizzes, there isn't any work outside of class. Grading is fair enough but some TAs are definitely way stricter than others.",
    "In Phys 205L pretty much all work has to be completed in the 3hr lab block. While this means no time consuming write-ups, it also makes those 3 hours very stressful as one tries to collect, record, and interrupt all the data before the period ends. The rushed nature of the lab makes actually understanding the physics difficult, but understanding is not totally necessary to finish the labs. That said, if you want to figure out what's going on it's not too difficult to do so on your own, and the statistics\/error analysis covered is both interesting and useful. Take this if you have to, or you need it to take more advanced labs.",
    "Physics 205 is a good lab, that requires little work outside the lab. My professor and TF were very helpful and answered all my questions about the equipment and concepts, which was good because I was taking Physics 180 concurrently and hadn't learned some of them yet. I thought the lab was manageable (especially compared to intro Chem labs) but the practical final was difficult.",
    "PHYSL 205L is an intro lab class corresponding to PHYS 180 or 200 lecture (if you're in those classes you have a choice of lab). No lab reports, just finishing everything up within the allotted 3 hours, which at times was stressful, but thankfully Prof. Jack Harris and our TA Charles frequently gave us extensions. There are also 4 homework assignments at the beginning of the semester, which weren't too bad, and a practical exam at the end of the semester. The class did get a bit tedious at times, but overall the lab class was decent.",
    "If you could avoid taking this class I would. I only took it because it's required formy major. There isn't a ton of work involved, but it's not easy. Your experience will depend a lot on your TA. The instruments you work with will be a challenge unless you have a decent amount of prior experience. The concepts are interesting, though.",
    "How you enjoy and learn from this lab depends on which section you get. Basically you do a number of physics related labs from tough-to-understand hand-outs. If you get a good section, you come out with a good understanding of error analysis, which is useful. All labs are under a serious time crunch, but at least there is minimal outside work.",
    "A standard physics lab class. Perhaps a bit harder than 165. Thee TA does more in the class than the professor so make sure you're happy with your choice. Andrew G was very good. Be prepared for ancient, malfunctioning equipment and a confusing an manual. Meets every week with weekly online quizzes (annoying but not worth much), no lab reports, and a final.",
    "don't take this class unless you have to.",
    "Sign up for a section, attend the first lab, see how you like your TA, and make a decision accordingly. The TA will make or break this lab for you-- lab instructions are annoyingly difficult to decipher (and they assume you already have a working knowledge of the topics), so you need someone there who can answer your questions and guide you through each lab. Otherwise, this lab can be really frustrating. The grading schemes are also very opaque.",
    "A good course. It definitely depends on the TA, but if you have a TA who is engaged and can answer questions, this lab can be really fun. The switching around of lab partners means you do have to come into the lab with a partner already picked out, and the work in the lab is really fun. There are four problem sets at the beginning of the lab which are not at all trivial, but they allow you to spend some time focusing on the computational work of error analysis, and after the first four weeks of lab, they stop. Besides that, all the work is done in class. That means there's actually less work in this class as the semester progresses, which is really, really, helpful. An essential class for any physics majors and pretty well done.",
    "Overall, 205L is an introductory lab course with a heavy focus on error analysis. However, the mathematics are trivial, and the amount of stress you feel is TA-dependent. I would take this over 165L if you have taken a physics class before and are familiar with the concepts of mechanics, circuits, and E\/M (205L is much less painful than 165L).",
    "Not many of the labs were interesting. I'd say that 1\/3 reinforced things I learned in PHYS 200 and and maybe 1\/2 were interesting."
