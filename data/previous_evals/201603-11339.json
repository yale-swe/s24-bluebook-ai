   "comments": [
    "I have always played a lot of music and had a natural ear for it, but never truly tried to understand the structure and forms of various techniques until this class. It was extremely helpful.",
    "I have learned a great deal about the different phrase structures a piece of music can contain and how to effectively use those structures in my own compositions.",
    "After taking this class, I feel that I have gained a better understanding of the four-voice works of the classical era. I feel that I have improved my composing skills, and that I have learned the steps to sit down and critically analyze a piece of music.",
    "This class helped me to develop a better sense of classical music. We learned species counterpoint, harmonic analysis, and different structures within a piece of music. This class taught me a lot about the structure of compositions and chord progressions. It was also very fun to work on our own compositional skills through the midterm and final projects which were to create a Theme and Variations and Minuet, respectively.",
    "I developed a strong sense of the Mozart\/Haydn idiom and a foundation in harmonic analysis.",
    "This was my first time taking music theory at Yale. I have extensive experience in jazz, but hardly any experience with classical music. Professor Adam gave us a very comprehensive overview of classical tonal harmony that felt accessible to me even though I have not taken music theory in 4 years. Our unit on species counterpoint was the best unit of the course, and I also enjoyed learning about binary form and different types of sequences, periods, and sentences.",
    "I learned about counterpoint, basic harmony, and basic compositional technique.",
    "Over the semester I learned valuable skills in classical-era musical composition. A recurring theme in the course emphasized the use of simple, small movements of the tone by the reduction of leaps and the use of step-wise motion to allow the melody to be easily distinguished from other voices. This idea evidently began at the very beginning of the course with the unit on species counterpoint where two voices together would ideally move in contrary motion, having different climaxes, and also harmonizing with carefully chosen movements of the tones. All these were learned by composing over a predetermined set of notes called the cantus firmus. I found this method of learning useful as I could put into practice careful harmonization and compositional writing. Consecutive lessons taught me diminution over the cantus firmus and how to correctly\/ideally lead the set of tones to a specific note, to the next measure, and finally to the last tone of the counterpoint line. After the fourth species counterpoint I was exposed to the practice of suspension and resolution, leading me to more easily understand the idea of cadences at the end of a melody line during the following unit of the course. By then I could identify the types of cadences and their context within the surrounding phrases. The constant supply of class examples helped to facilitate all of this learning. Although I found the nature of species counterpoint fun, the beginning of the theme and variations unit released the creativity in the class. I learned the appropriate form: the beginning theme and then its subsequent variations, each developing a transformation of the melody but still holding some previous techniques. This required a reapplication of species counterpoint as well as personal research on the creation of a melody theme while understanding chords and cadences, period and sentence structures, and use of rhythm within a classical context. Once having the means to write a piano theme and variations, we moved on to a string quartet minuet and trio, which made us to consider four synchronous voices instead of two as well as the various binary structures of the form. During the course the material built on each previous unit, interestingly reflecting on the historical progression of music across the eras. By the end of the semester I understood the growth from the dorian mode and other modes toward the use of keys and counterpoint. The class examples by Haydn, Corelli, Beethoven, and Mozart demonstrated not only the forms of the course units but also this musical progression with every nuanced evolution of chord usage, rhythm, and structure. I gained a strong appreciation for musical composition and the transfer of music across centuries. It was wonderful to end the class with a clear understanding of the definition of music and the appropriate interpretation of music by others for its ability to inspire and communicate.",
    "Prior to taking this class, I had no experience with composition and I was definitely nervous about the composition aspect of this theory class. However, this class teaches you skills that make both the theme and variations for piano (midterm project) and minuet for string quartet (final project) very manageable."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - great structure Weaknesses - I would've liked to have a more detailed syllabus, including due dates for major projects",
    "I think this course could benefit from adding in more small composition projects besides the main midterm and final. I think it would be useful to put the concepts we learn each week into practice.",
    "This class gave very little work and provided little feedback. Thus, it was often unclear if you actually understood the material or not. I hope that after taking this class that I'll be prepared for Music 211, but its hard to say for certain. I did feel like I learned a fair bit during this class, but I felt as though a few more assignments could've really reinforced the material taught.",
    "This is a great class. The pace is not too fast and the material was explained in a way that was easy to understand. It's also really fun to make your own compositions using the rules learned in the class. Sometimes the class gets a little long, but mostly it is engaging. The instructor likes playing actual pieces of music on the computer and pointing out how the structures we learned about are actually used in a real piece of music. It made everything we learned seem more relevant and engaging.",
    "Strengths: Focus in model composition and examining examples as a class. Weaknesses: Not enough time given to the development of different tactics for harmonic analysis.",
    "This course moves slowly compared to my other Yale courses. We had a few class periods where it felt like Professor Adam had to fill time that didn't feel very productive. New material was presented slowly, which likely worked to the advantage of other students at a more beginner level, but was not always stimulating. I wish there could have been more material covered in the semester!",
    "Strengths - I appreciated how Prof. Adam combined in-class listening, looking at scores, and his own playing on the piano to help us learn about a piece of music. Weaknesses - Music Theory can be at times quite interesting and at other times rather boring",
    "MUSI 210 gave me the chance to write music for the first time. The courses strength lies well within this provision to students since it motivates the student to study examples of music and test his knowledge on the structures and styles of the classical era. The numerous examples too, is a strength that was repeatedly issued to us students- it was a strength because I believe our primary listening to classical music moved us to seek the theory behind the composition, and in MUSI 210 we could relate the sound to the theory every week. Not only was the composition techniques a skill-builder, but it was also an insightful way to view the history of music-making. Since the course provided techniques, examples, history, and composition opportunities I found myself enjoying my time the whole semester. One weakness I found was the lack of textual information besides the one on species counterpoint. I found it to be so helpful that I anticipated more texts recommended by the instructor or faculty toward the topics presented by the course. Another, and this was more due to the upbringing of my musical knowledge, was that harmonic analysis presented a difficulty to me because of the rate at which it was analyzed in class. I learned music theory only through practice with my piano teacher back home and so working with her over a piano piece, where piano techniques became most of the lesson discussion, did not train me enough to analyze a great speeds. I can see that students come from many musical backgrounds at Yale. Because of that, it can be hard to accommodate all levels of students, as with my example.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Adam meets individually with students to discuss their composition projects- it's super helpful. I enjoyed being able to listen to other students' midterm composition projects in class Weaknesses: I thought we could have had more practice using certain chords and common chord progressions. We looked at a ton of examples, but basically the only practice I had using them was in the midterm and final composition projects."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! The class was so informative, inspiring, and productive. It's great that the class is small enough that you really get a lot of personal feedback.",
    "Yes. For any student who has yet to take music theory but has a musical background this a great class to start with which takes you through the fundamentals of counterpoint all the way to binary form.",
    "Good medium level theory class, and very interesting! Hardly any work.",
    "Yes. I learned so much in this class and found the material easy to follow. Having never taken a serious music theory class before, I really enjoyed learning about how music works on a more technical level. If you are a musician it will help you gain a better understanding of music you are actually playing.",
    "Yes! Develop a deeper relationship with musical forms!",
    "This course is great for beginner students in music theory. A lot of very foundational topics are covered, and the course moves slowly so that everyone can keep up regardless of the level they come in with. The course requires some preliminary knowledge of beginning theory, but it definitely accessible for non-majors like myself who have some interest in music. The course is not very demanding as far as pace and workload go, but the class time is mostly used efficiently and the lessons are structured so as to encourage student engagement and participation.",
    "Take this if you need to in order to take lesson and\/or if you want to take advanced music classes later. If you enjoy composition and you spend time with music outside of class anyway, this class will essentially contribute nothing to your workload.",
    "Music 210 is a good introduction to composition. While Professor Adam reviewed basic tonal theory and chord progressions at the beginning of the course, I would highly advise taking (or testing out of) MUSI 219 before 210 as it reviews harmonic analysis in much greater detail. While Professor Adam was very clear, he didn't really challenge the class- we had two assignments the entire semester, and he rarely posed questions to the class during lecture.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The student however, I would assume, should have a great affinity to classical music, musical performance, and or general music composition. Otherwise I feel that his time could be directed to other interesting courses in music. I view MUSI 210 as a strict preparation for future classes and\/or experiences for the Yale student-musician and I would not recommend anyone to take MUSI 210 that did not fall into the categories above simply due to the use of his time and the unused benefit and application of the course toward other things.",
    "Yes. If you're a musician (or just interested in music), this course is essential to understanding the music of mozart, haydn, etc. Also, I found the workload to be extremely manageable."
