    "Must take",
    "It's tough but worth it. It ended up (surprisingly) being both my favorite and most challenging course of the term. I would absolutely take it again.",
    "Econ 184 is an interesting class. The workload isn't too difficult and you get to do homework with a partner, however, beware of the midterm. If you don't know your material well, you can easily get caught off guard by its formatting.",
    "The syllabus is all over the place, there's no direction to the lectures, the TAs are mediocre, and the tests are unreasonably long.",
    "Econ184 taught a few instructive ways to perceive globalization and trends associated with the increasingly applicable phenomenon. It's not an overly difficult class, work-wise or intellectually.I would recommend it for the major, but there are definitely more interesting classes you can take at Yale.",
    "If you are interested in trade economics at all, and you enjoy drawing graphs, take this course. Otherwise, it may be a struggle for you.",
    "Yes. International Economics is a great survey course in the Economics department. It provides great insight into the subject. It has a good balance of quantitative and conceptual material. Problem sets are reasonable, and the exams are straightforward. Following Professor Schott in lecture and reviewing his PowerPoints are most of what's needed to learn the material. It has been my favorite course in the Economics Department thus far.",
    "Great course!! Highly recommended to anyone who wants to be an informed global citizen of our world.",
    "a very solid course, definitely helped to teach me about how to think about international trade in a more thoughtful manner and if you're interested in going into consulting this course will give you great business intuition for case interviews. schott's attention to connecting the models to current events and both macro and micro level business concerns was very interesting and helpful in understanding them. the number of models taught and the manner of engaging with them was appropriate and helped me learn them. Schott was a good lecturer, a clear communicator, approachable. assessments are fair and it's graded on the usual econ curve so as long as you stay above the mean you will do well. this class is much easier if you have done intro micro and macro. workload was similar to that of intermediate macro, moderate for econ",
    "This course is quite hard not because of the teaching but because of how difficult the problem sets are in general. The professor does a fine job of teaching the material but the material is difficult any way you look at it. Simply, ECON 121 is a course you don't walk out thinking you came out with a whole lot learned, it's merely a course you have to trudge through. Make sure to go section to get help with the problem sets. Dirk is a great professor and having taken the class w\/ both Samuelson and Dirk,I can say they are about the same in terms of difficulty. The only difference is that Samuelson is able to go through the material seemingly quickly because he uses slides while Dirk goes slower because he writes on the board. That being said, Dirk went at a slower pace and had to catch up at the end, leading him to breeze through a lot of pretty difficult material. So in the end, the teaching styles even out.",
    "Take it! The tests are super hard, but the PSets aren't too bad, and sometimes can be genuinely enjoyable. The material that you learn from the course will definitely inform your views on trade economics, and Professor Schott is super big in his field which is a plus. Maybe take it credit\/D\/fail so you can enjoy the material without freaking out about your grade.",
    "Take it PLEASE. You will love it. Actually. If you read the NYtimes a lot already this class is perfect, helps you understand all the hooplah goin' around. Very applicable -- GREAT PROFESSOR. We need to steal this guy from SOM seriously.",
    "yeah it's decent, not to much work, and the material is interesting",
    "Absolutely. Not too much math and focuses on a very interesting topic.",
    "Great lecture. Midterm was kinda ambiguous and was 12 true or false question. Overall it's a great course about globalization and international trade. Problem sets are quite different from normal econ problem sets and quite interesting.",
    "The class is a must for an economist, you will learn the basics of international trade theory without using maths at all. The professor is great and worries that you learn. But the class can get a bit tedious sometimes and the evaluation method and problem sets they use with the \"true or false\" system are not really good.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THISCLASS!!! Professor Schott is one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale, and this is by far the most interesting econ class I've ever taken. The course is about international trade, and the material deals with topics like U.S.-China trade, tariffs and trade protections, multinational firms, industrial policy, etc. I know all this probably doesn't look that interesting at first glance, but Profesor Schott's lectures are really engaging and really help show how all this is very relevant to events in the real world. The course focuses a lot on applications and developing the intuition behind economic models (as opposed to just developing theories with math and graphs), and as a result you really get to learn how to use these models to answer questions such as, for example, why the iPhone is made in China (or if it REALLY is made in China), and why organizations like the WTO exist. I took the class because I really liked the professor's teaching style, and am really glad I made that decision. Seriously, MAKE A SPACE FOR THIS CLASS DURING YOUR SHOPPING PERIOD!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested (even remotely) in the subject matter. This course has actually changed the way that I read news articles and watch the news. I now have a better understanding of so much of the international trade discussions that occur daily.",
    "This was the first year the class was taught. The lectures were interesting and well delivered. However, the problem sets and exams were tedious and ambiguous at times.",
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale, and by far THE BEST economics course offered at Yale. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is majoring or interested in economics.",
    "I would highly recommend this class",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to an Econ major looking for a solid elective. The class is founded on a number of theoretical models of trade, so by the end you'll be well-versed in looking at trade through a variety of frameworks. If you're the type of Econ major who likes learning the models (graphs, intuition, etc.), and then applying them to real-world situations, you'll really enjoy this class. Professor Schott is great and clearly cares a lot about this topic and is clearly an expert in the field. The problem sets are tricky but aren't every week and you can work with a partner. The real downside is that it's at 9am, so ask yourself whether you're really going to go. Professor Schott's slides are all online and are really clear and thorough, but I still don't think anything is a replacement for actually sitting there in class.",
    "I highly recommend this class. Although the tests are hard, the material is easy to learn. If you want to understand more international economics, this is definitely the course for you.",
    "It's a very interesting class, but it can be difficult at times. Definitely relevant for the 21st century.",
    "Take this class with Schott. He's great, and the kinks in the course (sometimes it felt a bit unstructured but only because he was teaching undergrads for the first time I think) will hopefully be worked out.",
    "yes",
    "if you are terrible at true\/false\/uncertain, then don't take the class. all the question on the midterm and final are of this format. questions can be very ambiguous and convoluted. however, test format aside, i think this was one of the few econ courses i've taken where i feel like i really learned something applicable and useful.",
    "great intro to trade theory",
    "International Economics basically covers theories of international trade from the standard Ricardo and Heckscher-Ohlin models to more recent ones. Very thorough theoretical development yet easy on the math. I'd highly recommend it.",
    "It occupies a space between intro and intermediate economics courses and is very graphically based, with little math. I wish it were slightly more technical, but I think that that is just an individual preference. I would recommend it. I is less work (but only slightly less difficult) than most econ classes and is a good class to round out the schedule.",
    "Definitely take this class if it is offered again!",
    "It's a great introductory course into classic trade models from the Ricardian, HO, Krugman, Melitz, and new ones. I would recommend it to students who want to know more about how tariffs, endowments, technology, and specialization fit into what countries produce and how they trade and interact with one another. I think with another year totweak the class, Schott will be a perfect teacher for the course.",
    "Definitely take this course. It was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale, and it was definitely the best economics course I have taken.Prof. Schott teaches Economics the way it ought to be taught: He first goes through the formal mechanics of the economicmodel and then uses empirical evidence to evaluate the model. We learned a number of models throughout the course, and seeing how they all came together was one of the most beautiful moments in economics.Prof. Schott starts the first lecture by telling you that he wants you to leave the class thinking like an economist. He defines this as looking at the world and questioning what model applies to observed phenomena and then evaluating the accuracy of the model given your observations. I can now proudly say that I do this, and it has given me incredible insights into the world.Some other students might give this class poor reviews. I have heard criticisms that he is a bad lecturer; I disagree. I think he's an excellent lecturer. Yes, lectures were poorly attended, but I attribute that to the 9am schedule slot more than anything else. In addition, the average on the midterm was 58%, and I think the difficulty of the test discouraged some students. If you are a student that is not discouraged by such things, then you must take this class!",
    "Yup. It's a lot of models but they're really interesting.",
    "Would definitely recommend it for any economics student \u0096 the field is both really interesting and applicable to the real world. Prof. Schott does a great job of developing economic intuition and thinking."
