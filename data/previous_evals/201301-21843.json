   "comments": [
    "If you're a major, you have to take it. It can get tiring, but it'll help you get your project done in plenty of time if you're the procrastinating type. It also helps the group of majors become close, which is nice.",
    "This is the required senior essay for the linguistics major. At least in 2012-2013, we were required both to write the paper and to attend a 2-hour class meeting every week (unlike most other majors where you do not attend a class). The class meetings consisted of progress reports from 3-5 people per session until spring break, then after spring break they were used for final presentations by 2-3 people per session.",
    "You have to take it, so this summary seems kind of pointless. Raffaella is great, and it's a lot of fun if you like your fellow linguistics majors, which the class of 2013 definitely did.",
    "It was an amazing experience, but it's really up to you to make it a worthwhile experience. With the linguistics department in general, there is always a lot of support available, as long as you seek it, but the senior essay experience is a very difficult one, especially if you haven't done research before (such as a summer research experience). It is especially difficult early on, when you are trying to decide on a feasible topic and general question, since you arekind of just wading into a huge body of literature. I am very glad that I got to use my linguistics knowledge to write about a complete new topic to me, but I really recommend writing about something that you are familiar with from a class or previous experience, or at least a topic that one of the professors in the department is very familiar with. It was a struggle for me to figure out the state of the field, as well as focus in on a specific topic within that field. This semester was also nice because only a few people presented in each class, which allowed us to actually help each other out with productive comments and questions. It was very interesting and rewarding to see everybody in the major present something that they had been developing all year. It seems like much of the work was done toward the end of the year, but I don't think that is a fault of the class.",
    "You have no choice",
    "Take it to complete the major! It will be enjoyable and a great opportunity to get Ben closer to Raffaella and your fellow majors.",
    "You have to take this, so enjoy :) Start early!!!! Start writing at some reasonable time, too. Otherwise - sit back and enjoy. Also, if you want to change something about how the course or your essay is going - tell Raffaella\/ your advisors - it's actually quite likely to work.",
    "The Senior Essay is a difficult but rewarding credit. I would recommend fully committing to the class discussions and deadlines as they will only help your personal project develop. Prof. Zanuttini is a great instructor and the Senior Essay is a really great way to integrate a major's worth ofclasses into one cohesive body of work. Embrace it as such and LING 491 will be an awesome experience."
