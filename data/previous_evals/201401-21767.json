    "Take it, especially if you have read the Aeneid already for AP Latin. It is not difficult. Josh is an easy grader. It can be a bit repetitive everyday translating the same work, but it is worth it to get your language out of the way.",
    "Hard but rewarding",
    "This is a fantastic course to improve your love and understanding of Latin. Take it!",
    "I will recommend it to other students.",
    "Introduction to Poetry is an excellent course. You'll read two books of The Aeneid and the entire epic in English as well. You'll write reading responses that will clarify many themes and help you think more about Vergil in the context of the Pax Romana. If you love Latin, you will love this class. You get the best of the grammar and the best of the literature. It is fantastic. Take this class.",
    "Latin 141 covers books II and III of the Aeneid in Latin and the whole thing in English, with written responses (in English) every week. The work consists of translating 30-50 lines of the Aeneid for each class in addition to some reading in English every week. Workload wise, the class is definitely more work than 131, but if you can't translate the 30-50 lines in a reasonable amount of time, it is possible to get by without doing a full translation of the whole thing. Grading was fairly kind, and I would recommend this class to anyone with a fairly good grasp of Latin and some interest in epic.",
    "Recommend. Why wouldn't you take the opportunity to read Books 2 and 3 of the Aeneid in Latin?"
