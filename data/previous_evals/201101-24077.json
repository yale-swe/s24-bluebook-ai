The final paper is very tedious to write and depending on the country you're writing on, it's difficult to get the necessary sources and Keith Darden does not offer much help. He's also not the most approachable professor here. The lectures were interesting, although I think since our class ended up being so small Darden probably should have changed the syllabus and made it more like a seminar than a lecture.",
