   "comments": [
    "I think this course was flawed in a number of ways, primarily related to the assignments and grading scheme. I did not at all like the group paper, which was 30% of our grade. I think group papers are extremely difficult to begin with but it's even harder when the length is so short- each team member wrote only 2-3 pages. I think it would be more worth while to make it an individual assignment, especially if that much of the grade is going to ride on it. Otherwise, if it MUST be a group paper, it should be longer. I also think that having the second quiz a week before the final is not good. It would be better to either have it earlier or to put the quiz 2 information into the final and do it all at once. All you do is lose class time and make it far more stressful for the students by having to study for exams back to back.",
    "The class was somewhat misrepresented in my opinion. I thought this would be more heavily weighted in health policy, considering it is a Health Policy Management course (HPM), however the policy content was extremely limited. Instead, the course was 95% on the U.S. health system. As an introduction course, I think the topics could have been broader, and included content that is more appealing to public health students, including actual public health policies (and the process by which they are proposed, reformed, enacted). There was only one class related to public health (vaccinations and preventative health) and I think there should have been more, especially because the beginning of the semester we all wrote down our policy-related interests and he said they largely were focused on certain health-related policies (reproductive health, nutrition, food, ect.). This class should not be called health policy and health systems it should be called the U.S. health system. I am disappointed there is no alternative choice for first year students that focuses on health policies, as these are the very things that guide many of our public health approaches, research, and focus. It would also be great if we did not have to do a group project, and instead could focus on something that we are particularly interested in. I pride Yale in its efforts to allow creative freedom. In many classes we choose topics for our papers that are of interest to us, and I think this is a fundamental part of graduate school. Being unable to cater any assignment to our interests made many people lose interest in the course and the paper.",
    "The lecturers were informative, but there was a lot of information to memorize\/understand. The course readings took a lot of time, and I often ended up having to skim them. I didn't feel that the group project helped me learn and would have much preferred to write a paper individually. The challenges of working on a paper with three other people definitely outweighed any potential benefits. The tests were challenging, and they often asked for specific information that we barely reviewed in the course.",
    "I was unhappy with having a quiz in the last week of classes and then a final.",
    "this course took students lots of time and energy to read the papers and the course itself is so boring",
    "Jason is awesome",
    "Incredibly well organized and designed course that provided a thorough, yet manageable overview of health policy. I thought the first few lectures got off to a slow start (but that may be because I've taken a health policy class before), but I found the second half of the course more engaging. There were a lot of different methods of evaluation in this course - it'd be nice if the final or the group project could be removed. There were also a ton of readings. If they could be streamlined more, I think people would do them more thoroughly. Finally, it'd be nice if the final could be typed - more legible for you and easier to organize for the students.",
    "The material is useful",
    "learned a lot about the US health policy",
    "strength: you will learn about insurance and health systems and ACA and you will know it well weakness: too much reading that say very similar things but slightly differently, too much information to cram into your brain for the two tests, too little time for the two tests (it is a speed write), it was really dominated in terms of health systems health policy and health policy is more than that",
    "Strengths: Jason is nice and he is a good lecturer. It's tough when you have a class that big and it's late in the afternoon but he asked question, wasn't monotone and kept my attention. I felt the class moved a little slowly in the beginning but it picked up the pace. I felt I left with a pretty good foundation for future studies in health policy! Weaknesses: A few more clicker questions would have been better. Also sometimes I felt like our discussions became a little belabored. For example, he would ask whether he think the term \"health care consumer\" is appropriate and then take like 8 responses. I think asking for some audience participation is good but once you get to response 8 the ideas are just being recycled (especially when you're asking a group of people who don't have a background in the subject). But these are fairly minor points.",
    "Great course - learned a TON. Content could be dry at times, but very useful.",
    "Great foundational course in health policy. Though the time slot was a bit rough, the professor acknowledged this and kept the lectures interesting. Sometimes felt like an onslaught of material (especially with the density and volume of the weekly readings), but having completed the course, I have learned a lot and have a better appreciation for what the field entails (as someone required to take th course). Some of the logistics could have been handled better (having a test one week before the final? A group paper where we couldn't get feedback on drafts?), but those can hopefully be improved with some restructuring of the course.",
    "I enjoyed the material, but the timing was kind of tough. By the time we got through the news section, my attention span was starting to go. The break definitely helped. I would have liked to get my second exam back sooner to utilize it in studying.",
    "course was excellent but alot of work.",
    "The content of this class is fascinating and gives you a great foundation to understanding US health policy. However the length of each class period is unnecessarily long and instead of covering new content, it feels like Professor Schwartz is trying to stretch out the class by summarizing articles in the news.",
    "The US Health System is complicated - the first exam material was not helpful, but the second exam material was helpful describing the architecture of the healthcare system. The rest could have been spent discussing the healthcare system in detail - while the news segments were interesting, they didn't really tie into the rest of the course in meaningful ways.",
    "The course provided me with basic principles for the health care policy in the US as well as other OECD countries. However, the midterm exams were very subjective. The final exam was very long and full of subjective questions, I wonder how the instructor is going to grade it.",
    "Strengths: gain foundational knowledge of the US health care system, JLS is obviously knowledgeable, the 2 tests were really easy Weaknesses: the fact that class is completely lecture format, everything about the group paper assignment, the timing of tests\/assignments Ways it could be improved: If, for some reason, JLS thinks group papers are something we need more experience in (I disagree that this is necessary for this class), I think there should at least be some variability in topic options so that people can self-select into a topic area and then be \"randomly\" assigned into a group --otherwise you have some groups with multiple people knowing TONS about the topic and caring a lot about it and other groups where, not only does no one know anything, but no one is even interested. Everyone should not receive the same grade. Why bother having people \"review\" their group mates if they all get the same grade anyway? The TAs were all very smart and nice, but seemed quite pointless. Why not use them for small discussion sections? Why not have a weekly assignment that they could grade\/provide feedback on?",
    "This course has the incorrect title. It needs to be called Health Insurance in the United States. I do not feel like I learned very much about policy, but rather how health systems and insurance works in the U.S. I did learn things, but not what the course led me to believe I would. It needs a new title. It was overwhelming and there should have been more exams.",
    "This class was an excellent introductory to health systems, both in the US and worldwide. The content of the class was very well balanced and structured to be a well-guided tour through the different aspects of the systems. Two things that would have made the class even better for me: A bit less of the 'in the news' section. I do a fair amount of seeking out news and thinking on my own, so it felt like a fair amount of precious class time used for unessential information. I do agree that two or three news items a class would be effective at attempting to synthesize the information for everyone, but when you start putting up 7-10 items a week, it's a pretty sizable chunk of time where it's easy to tune out. Secondly, though I understand that it's important in a class like this to gather many different perspectives, it was often a bit frustrating when a larger portion of the class was spent gathering different student thoughts, especially when, by the end of the semester, it was the same 3-4 people talking every class. While I understand it may be hard to encourage talking in a large lecture, I'm not sure if getting the same input week after week is necessarily helpful to the entire class. I believe the tests were fairly graded, though rather stressful to take due to the time limitations. If English was not my first language, I feel like I would've had quite a bit of trouble attempting to convey as much information as was needed. Also, though I think this was changing through the semester and potentially hard to convey, it would've been nice to know what the standards for the different grade cutoffs were, since they seemed to change a bit each examination.",
    "It may be better to only have two exams, each including both objective and subjective questions.",
    "This was by far one of my favorite courses. I learned so much more than I would have imagined, and it was very, very well structured. I appreciated the approach, both historical and contemporary, politically focused, as well as with an eye towards understanding how these issues affect people. Dr. Schwartz did an amazing job.",
    "The course was a great introduction to health policy as it relates to the US healthcare policy, specifically insurance. The lectures were very useful and the tests were a fair way to measure our knowledge on the topic. However, the group paper was not a useful assignment. It is difficult to write a paper with a group to begin with, due to differences in writing styles and ideas, however, when adding in differences in levels of effort from each participant, the paper did less to help me learn about health policy than to provide me with an exercise in editing other's work.",
    "would be great to have weekly lecture and then small group discussions on important themes.",
    "This course covers a wide selection of topics related to Health Systems and policy, particularly in the United States. My favorite part of class was \"In the News...\" topics where Professor Schwartz would discuss recent media articles that covered topics we have (or would be learning later) in class. Majority of the reading assignments are helpful to solidify concepts to be covered in the day's lecture. The grading scale for the course is curved... for individuals who are not in the Health policy concentration, this curved scale may pose a challenge to \"score well\" in comparison to their peers.",
    "There was so much outside reading that was interesting. Since this is my core I wanted to read them all, but there was just too much. The only way to stay kept up was to read an article a day, and study the power points weekly. I only took 3 classes so that was barely doable with 60+ hours a week working. But people that take 6 classes that was too much. Also I hate that my grade was brought down by a group project. I obviously worked very hard in the course, earing 49\/50 on both tests, but then my final grade will be determined by other peoples grammar and effort in a group project, is that fair??",
    "The course provided a nice overview of health insurance in the United States and other comparable countries. It would have been nice if the course addressed more issues related to policies.",
    "very poor; not a health policy course, but rather a U.S. Health systems course; evaluations were based on ability to regurgitate information\/facts back; evaluations (2 40min tests, group paper) were not fair evaluations",
    "Strengths: - Great reading assignments, although a bit lengthy at times. - Really taught me the basics of US health policy and its historical influences. Weaknesses: - The final exam should have been take-home. - The group paper was not a good idea. - The PPTs are great for reference but were really, really lengthy. - I don't know that all of the reading assignments were necessary. Tips: - International students who were not familiar with the US healthcare system had a steep learning curve. Maybe you could have an extra session for beginners where you go over the very basics of US policy? For example, it was hard for me to understand that states operate independently from the federal government... although they have to follow federal guidelines. It's basics like these that trip us up.",
    "This course was very haphazard. I did not make sense to have midterms where we had to memorize facts and a final with solely our opinions. We did not have a chance in the course to cultivate our opinions, thus it was not an appropriate way to evaluate our efforts to learn the subject.",
    "As a future medical professional, I found this course to be extremely useful and informative. However, I know some of my friends felt that the material was too detailed for them, given their specific areas of interest within public health. Maybe some more specific topics on public health policy could be covered, or there should be more courses offered to fill the health policy requirement for MPH students; that way, those who find this course most useful (like me) can take it, while others with more specific interests (e.g. infectious disease research or field work) can take policy classes that are more relevant to them.",
    "Outside of Epi and Biostats, this is the required course in which I learned the most at YSPH. Some of the readings didn't seem relevant or were redundant but overall they were helpful in understanding the material. The sheets that were handed out before each exam with example questions were also helpful. The exams were a fair evaluation of what we learned but the short timeframe in which they were given was difficult and did not allow us to demonstrate what we learned. Many students had a hard time finishing. Also, the number of questions and essays were a lot in such short timeframe. The group essays were a terrible idea. I'm worried that the laziness of my group is going to significantly affect my grade and that doesn't seem fair.",
    "I think this was a good introduction to health policy that touched on the important aspects of the US healthcare system. There was a good balance between hard facts and thought exercises that encouraged us to use the information we learned to think about broader issues in the healthcare system. The group project while a good idea in theory, did not end well. I think ultimately assigning groups was not a great idea. I heard a few bad stories about groups in which one or two members did all the work and thus were successful. Or in my group's case, trying to divide the work among people with varying levels of concern proved detrimental in the end. I liked the assignment and understand assigning it as a group project, but I think having groups assigned made it more difficult than necessary.",
    "Sometimes too fast and too much reading materials (some of them are repetitive). I think that discussion sessions might be helpful at least for the policy concentration students.",
    "Our only grades for this class were two regular exams, a group paper, and the final exam. Therefore, with such few grades in this class, I think it was completely unfair for us to have a group paper. I would have much rather had a longer individual paper, which would have been completely my own work being graded as opposed to a group paper where my grade is determined by the work of others. Also, our last regular test was assigned approximately one week before our final exam, which was a little excessive. Also, since we only had that class one day a week, our last class should have been completely devoted to review and not a test. Additionally, the amount of readings in this class should be reduced as there were way too many to keep track of.",
    "I loved the topics covered and I learned a lot. I wish there had been less readings because I never had time to do them all. I also think more student interaction would have kept me more engaged at times.",
    "This course presents a lot of important topics to make sure students are well-rounded within the disciplines of public health. Much of the material has the potential to be extremely dry, however, and presenting it in a two hour lecture (in a dim lecture hall, with a professor who barely stops to take a breath) makes it extremely difficult to absorb. Some sort of discussion section would be much more helpful, especially in preparing students for the final exam, which asked mainly about opinions. One big issue I had with this course was the timing of assignments. There is no reason why a course should have three of the ONLY four LARGE assignments (two midterms, a final paper, and a final) crammed into the last month of class. Please, spread it out. Students are taking many other classes and balancing many other things. And one other issue: the paper. Group papers are awful. JLS acknowledged this, and I agree that these are things we will all have to do in our careers. Regardless, group papers with a pre-assigned group and a pre-assigned topic is just mean. The material in this course covers so many topics, and no matter what department a student is in (BIS, CDE, HPM, etc.) there is something that is of interest. I have absolutely no academic interest in prescription drug prices, and would MUCH rather have spent my time researching policy as it relates to my research areas. Not to mention, I understand the logic behind putting a policy student in every group, but I felt like the policy students in my group didn't listen to anything I had to say about the structure of the paper (i.e. following the prompt) because I knew the least about the topic. Either let people pick their group and find group mates that can work well together, or let people pick their topic.",
    "Strengths: very well organized lectures. Learned a lot about health systems and policy. Lectures got better and more comprehensive after the first midterm, which I appreciated. Weaknesses: too much discussion in the beginning of semester. Although nice, made it hard to pinpoint main objectives. RIDICULOUS reading lists--made me unmotivated to even attempt to start the readings when I saw the number of readings (and pages) that I'd have to get through. Shorten the reading list to make it less daunting (especially since many said the same thing).",
    "The course was well structured. Please allow more time for tests as students had to get their ideas down in haste.",
    "Excellent overview of health policy in the United States. I am not a health policy student so I found this to be a really useful course and I gained a lot of information that I feel is necessary to call myself an MPH student. I really enjoyed learning about health systems of other nations and comparing them to the United States. I think the \"In the news\" segment at the beginning of each lecture was really important to keep students informed about current events. I think most classes could benefit from including information like this. I liked the format of the two in-class exams, but felt very rushed taking them and it would have been nice to have a bit more time. I also appreciated having options on which questions to answer. Would prefer to have the paper be an individual assignment, but I understand the use of group work. It was great to have a break in the middle of lecture, so keep that for next year! One suggestion is to use the clickers more often, it helps to keep the class engaged. Also, maybe have a couple of homework assignments to encourage students to utilize course material more frequently, there was not much incentive to review material on weeks without exams.",
    "Weaknesses: The two tests were at the start of the class period and only 40 minutes long which made it very difficult to answer all questions thoroughly or even finish reading the instructions. Group papers are always difficult and though I understand the underlying idea that you need to be able to work with groups in the future- I am not sure if group papers are how people learn to work on a team. Strengths: Studying for the tests I felt like I really did learn some essential information about Health Policy.",
    "Strength: Good introductory class into health policy. Weakness: Class size should be smaller to promote more discussion.",
    "It is a lot of work! It is my first time learning about the complicated healthcare structure of the U.S. Jason did a great job teaching this course.",
    "Very thorough evaluation of healthcare systems, problems, and solutions. Very helpful in introducing and expanding on this topic. Just sit back, listen, and think and analyze. Very good class.",
    "I think the course was excellently curated -- I thought the material covered by the course and the way the course were structured was thoughtful and helped me grasp the concepts. The lecture format was difficult for me, and I had a hard time engaging during class. However, I really do feel like I learned a lot.",
    "I found Schwartz class to be a thorough introduction to US healthcare policy. That being said, I think the title of the course should really include the word \"US\" because most of the material was focused on the US healthcare system and the associated legislation. I do believe this focus was necessary because I knew little specific to the US system before taking this course, and I feel I can now speak intelligently about the ACA, the structure of the US healthcare system, and the historical context in which it came to be. However, I would have enjoyed to learn more about other healthcare systems and their benefits when compared to their US counterpart. We spent a week on this topic, while I feel it could have been covered more comprehensively.",
    "I came into this course with very little background knowledge of health policy and I feel I learned a lot by the end of the semester. However I feel a small primer on the economics of healthcare may have been helpful, as I felt a bit lost when we jumped right into the course material. I felt the course load Professor Schwartz assigned was reasonable and that our tests were fair, though I think having a few short assignments in place of our two midterm exams may have helped me better engage with the course material throughout the semester, rather than right before an exam. I also really liked the group paper.",
    "very good",
    "Interesting and relevant course material. Very thought provoking and insightful.",
    "Very large lecture course. Pretty dry content. The group project experience was much better than expected. This is a required course for the MPH degree but if it was optional I would not recommend it to anyone. The time slot is also awful--3 pm to 5:30 pm on Thursdays. Morning would be much better or splitting the class into two shorter lectures.",
    "Strength: Really organized. Everything is clear in the syllabus since day one. All readings are available from Day 1. Weakness: Long readings - sometimes book chapters that consume a lot of time. This is a heavy course. Time allotted during the exams is inadequate.",
    "This course was kind of a mess. At first glance it seemed like a standard lecture course--2 hour lectures once a week, readings, two tests, a project and a final. However, there were WAY too many assigned readings which were often too long, too dense, and redundant with other readings. The topics covered in lecture were fine and seemed like the most important concepts, but lectures themselves were incredibly hard to follow. The slides were confusing and didn't seem to have main points or ideas, and Professor Schwartz would talk in what seemed to be one long tangent for the entire 2 hours. It was very difficult to determine what I was supposed to be taking away from each class. This made it very difficult to study for the tests, since there was so much material that we were responsible for for each midterm, and little to no guidance as to what the most important facts and concepts were. Also, 40 minutes is not enough time for a test like that. Just give us the full hour. Finally, the project was poorly designed and not well integrated in the course. We were split into groups of 4 to research and write a policy proposal for lowering the cost of prescription drugs. We had not discussed this topic in depth in class, and were just giving a long list of readings as reference material. We also weren't given any guidance on how to write a policy proposal, which seems like important information for an introductory policy course, particularly for students who are not in the policy concentration. Also, splitting up a paper between 4 people doesn't make any sense and isn't the best way to learn. I would have honestly rather written the paper myself, since it takes twice as much work to meet and make sure everyone is on the same page, and then to go through and edit the paper for consistency. If Professor Schwartz still thinks a group project is necessary, maybe have us put together a PowerPoint or poster board, which is more conducive to collaboration. Overall, I do feel like I learned some of the most important concepts in U.S. health policy, but mainly because of my own effort and work, and not because of the course itself.",
    "Dr. Schwartz has a talent of breaking down obtuse, confusing concepts\/topics into manageable chunks that are easy to understand. I wasn't a fan of the group project, but I understand the rationale behind assigning one and learned a ton from it. Some possible improvements to this course: -not sure if the professor has any control over it, but two 1.5 hour sessions each week might help with pacing of course. -have TAs who are international students who might be able to better help international students who are struggling with concepts. Maybe have TAs host a \"breaking it down\" session each week for international students unfamiliar with the American policy words being tossed around. -maybe start with the history of healthcare in America to provide a more frontloaded context as to why we're where we're at today.",
    "It was one of the most enjoyable and rewarding courses I have ever taken. I highly recommend it to other students.",
    "Good",
    "Very long (weakness) but the content was interesting and accessible.",
    "I enjoyed this course, and I think it provided a very comprehensive overview of health policy and health insurance in the US. However, I felt that a lot of the coursework was concentrated towards the end of the semester, so I think the course could be improved if the work was more spread out.",
    "I really enjoyed this class and learned a great deal. I thought the material was structured in a very logical way so that each week's material built on what we had previously learned.",
    "The course structure was successful at providing a comprehensive overview of health systems. Of course it is difficult to cover everything, but I believe it adequately touched on the most important aspects to understanding the healthcare system",
    "As health policy is very new for me, initially I was lost and thought he teaching is random with way too much information that did't help me but even after 2-3 weeks I started getting the grasp of the topic. I think Jason did an outstanding job in teaching such a difficult course with a huge course content. He inculcated all aspects of health policy so well. I might still need to read up on a lot but have gained sooo much knowledge and this course has opened up a whole new perspective for me in public health. I loved this course. This was one class I never ever wanted to miss because sitting in the class, understanding, listening and reading on the topic provided really helped.",
    "The evaluation system is in need of reconsideration based on class objectives.",
    "I learned a lot regarding our health system but think we needed to discuss current and previous issues in health policy to have a better understanding of how the system affects public health concerns.",
    "Good foundation to health care policy. However, I would've liked to learn more about other types of public health policy that aren't directly linked to health care. I wish the focus had been less narrow. Also, at that time of day, the length of the class period is too long and is impossible to sit through, especially in Winslow auditorium. Professor Schwarz is a very engaging lecturer, but often I would start to tune him out when he talked about current events at such length. I wish he had kept this part shorter and moved on to the material earlier and I would've maintained by concentration better."

    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0I feel like overall Prof. Schwartz was good but I also thought that he takes forever to make a point. I think it is just his style of lecturing but it seems like he makes the point, talks around it for a while, uses a ton of extra babble, and then finally gets back to the point again. For example... the grill analogy he made at the beginning of the semester. It did not need 40 minutes worth of discussion. We get it. You bought this grill, it's a cool grill, you made an interesting analogy to policy, now let's keep going. It just gets so repetitive after a while it makes it hard to pay attention. Really long run on sentences!",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Professor Schwartz is a great teacher. He speaks wonderfully, is very engaging, and makes somewhat mundane topics intriguing. He was very accommodating and did a great job preparing us for the tests. I don't think he could have done a better job in his role as a professor.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Professor Schwartz is a great lecturer and really tried to foster discussion, although this certainly would have been easier in a smaller class. I think he had very high expectations of students. It seemed to me that he assumed we all had a stronger background in health policy than we, as a whole, did.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a03",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Amazing professor",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Slides are not clear at all.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Great professor! Designed the class thoughtfully and fairly (especially given it was the first time he taught it!). Successfully engaged students even in such a large introductory class.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Practice problems should be given for the exams.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0very good,",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0strength: you can tell he enjoys teaching and lecturing weakness: you can also tell it was his first time teaching this course",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0He was fantastic - always engaged, energetic, and willing to listen to questions and feedback.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Jason gave thoughtful commentary during lectures and is a great presenter. Enjoyed having him as a professor for his first semester at Yale!",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Schwartz is definitely passionate about the subject. I would have loved to learn more about his own research in depth. He used good examples and overall did a good job.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0very organized and knowledgeable. An expert in his field",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0He is very talkative but sometimes difficult to follow. He really cares about students and its open during office hours to talk.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0JLS talks a lot, and fast. As this was his first time teaching the course I think he will have a few items to adjust for future years. He has a tendency to interrupt people when they contribute in class as well as talk for at least ~2x as long as they did in response to any comment. He spends too much class time talking about news articles. He should do more clicker questions. The way he writes assignments and exam questions is way too verbose. I found it pretty insulting when he said that when he was in school the thing he hated most was group-written papers and then chuckled when going over our group assignment. To give 3 weeks for 4 strangers to write a 12 page paper on a topic that none of them knows\/cares anything about is just a terrible idea.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Dr. Schwartz was difficult to follow sometimes, however it was very very clear that he cared a lot about the class and the experience his students were having.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Dr. Schwartz was an incredibly eloquent and loquacious teacher. He had exceptionally clear and verbose assignment and course descriptions, and yet managed to distill these exceptionally complex laws and systems into a manageable and understandable class period. He rarely slipped to tangents. Though it took a week or two getting used to his presentation style at the beginning of the semester (e.g. trying to sort everything he says into what you need to know vs what is merely helpful supporting text), I always looked forward to hearing what he had to say on a given topic.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Dr. Schwartz is a wonderful professor. Strengths: able to clearly articulate the messages from a diverse range of topics and perspectives to a wide audience; selects very interesting and informative readings for the class; reasonable expectations for assignments and tests; responsive to feedback and very approachable\/accessible; covered really interesting topics and really interwove them. Weaknesses: could have perhaps allotted more time to the midterms - they were good tests, but a bit time crunched.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Overall, I really enjoyed this class, and how we were able to cover a wide range of material during the semester. It was Professor Schwartz's first time teaching the course, but it was clear that he cared about each student's experience. It would have been nice to have some more time on exams because many of us felt rushed.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Jason was a great lecturer and professor. He seemed to truly care about his students and helped us to understand the material. Jason also did a wonderful job of incorporating recent news articles into our discussion of certain topics.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0very knowledge. quite verbose. I think the first few intro lectures could be more concise so we have more time for the content. love the news stories. maybe the students who emailed them in could give a 1 min spiel about it to promote more involvement in the course.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Dr. Schwartz has an amazing ability to consistently talk for two hours straight about all topics related to policy. He has an incredible talent for creating appropriate metaphors to teach topics in policy-- \"buying a grill\" to discuss the idea of patients as consumers in the health care system. He was very respectful of individual thoughts in class and would ask very stimulating questions in class. He was always willing to answer any questions that I had throughout the course and was very articulate via email. He is a stellar academic, making him a perfect professor to teach this core course.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Interesting and receptive to students, excellent",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0The professor was really passionate about the course material. The classes were a mix of lecture and discussions, which kept them engaging. The only thing that could be improved is incorporating more discussion opportunities into the class.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0clearly knowledgeable about the material, but lacked ability to engage with students and make material relevant",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Strengths: - Very knowledgeable - Very responsive to in-class questions and emails - Extremely approachable Weakness: - He should have talked about his own work and his career. It's very impressive for an academic his age to have achieved so much. I would have appreciated his career insights and tips.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0He spent far too much time on the cost and economic of different policies and too little time on the policies themselves. We did not need to spend that much time on current news items.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Jason is an active, engaging professor. He keeps us interested despite the ridiculously long time frame of the class (it really should be 1.5 hours\/week maximum). Sometimes he can be a bit wordy when explaining concepts that can be summarized in just a few brief sentences, but otherwise, I think he is very knowledgeable and cares a lot about his students and what they get out of this class.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Wonderful professor. If this is his first time teaching, I am blown away! He's extremely well-versed in a wide range of topics, able to answer our questions, and very approachable. The only thing I would change would be to have more student interaction in class. Perhaps pose questions to the class and allow some discussion. Even more clicker questions would help!",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0I liked Prof Schwartz. He has a quirky sense of humor and a good way of explaining complicated things in a way that makes sense.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Excellent professor! always willing to hear from us and to incorporate our opinions into the discussion.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0He was very knowledgeable and had a lot of good insight. I do think he could have engaged with students a little bit more (3 hours is a long time for students to sit and listen to someone speak, even though he had interesting things to say)",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0JLS was very excited about the material, which was great to hear. He could have paused more to draw attention to certain points, but he did do a good job of asking for students' opinions and experiences.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Cares a lot about his students. Tends to be a bit long-winded and wordy. Improved lectures after the first midterm by decreasing time spent on open discussions and more time spent on lecturing.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Great professor. Very knowledgeable and seasoned.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Dr. Schwartz is a great lecturer, and I really enjoyed his style.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0He was very knowledgable of the subject and I did like how he brought in current events. Overall, the class was not very interactive and I think I could have learned a lot more if I had actually had the chance to talk to some peers in class about what we were learning.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Strength: The professor did a great job bringing many broad topics together. The \"In the News...\" section in the beginning of every class was very helpful in bridging topics taught to current examples. Weakness: Handout format was difficult to print; instead of 1 page per slide, maybe put 3 pages per slide on MS powerpoint format.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Love this professor. He is brilliant!",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Very knowledgeable. Very helpful. Very thorough. Went into the class knowing 0, and came out very satisfied and comfortable with my knowledge in healthcare.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0I appreciated the way he organized the material and the way he interacted with students. He was extremely accessible and treated student questions seriously.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0I think Dr. Schwartz was a wonderful instructor--he was well-informed, excited about the material, and very willing to foster discussion of different perspectives in the duration of the course. He covered a lot of material in a way that did not seem overwhelming, although I wish we had more frequent assessments. I enjoyed the background readings provided, and I think I really would have benefited from a once-a-month discussion session with a TA and a group of students to go over some of the more nuanced material and practice discussing and discovering my own paradigms and perspectives about the material presented.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Professor Schwartz was a informative and engaging lecturer. His lecture slides were well organized and laid out the material well. It would have been nice to have the slides in advance of the lectures, as I and many of my peers like to take our notes on the slides. I find this conductive to my understanding of the material and helps maintain my attention better during class. I did like the inclusion of current events at the beginning of the lectures as a way of reinforcing the significance of the issues we discussed in throughout the course.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0very good, talks too fast.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Very knowledgeable and a brilliant tutor. Sensitive to students and to both sides of discussions pertaining to the subject. Also very good at summarizing and presenting the course, which is a lot of material.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Professor Schwartz is very knowledgeable on the subject matter. The lectures were very long and sometimes very dry but I guess that's to be expected in a required lecture course. The midterms were fair but the timing of the exams could have been better---a midterm the week before the final didn't really make any sense to me. Also it would have been nice to have had more time to work on the paper and more notice about the topic to start planning with the other group members. I think that Professor Schwartz would be great in a seminar style\/the class could be made much more interactive without sacrificing too much of the content.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Amazing teacher with great personality and teaching skills. He clearly put a lot of energy and time in teaching and preparing for this course. This course was taught well.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Professor Schwartz is a kind and knowledgable professor. He seems to care deeply about his course and his students and is always willing to meet with students and answer questions. He is very accessible. However, he does not have a very clear lecture style and does not seem to have a great grasp on YSPH policies just yet. For example, he had all of us wait to pick up our tests after class--which took a lot of unnecessary time--rather than just leaving our tests in our mailboxes like all of the other professors. Also, he would offer call out for a TA in class and none of them would be present, signaling a lack of communication between him and the TAs. Also, his slides were very disorganized and hard to follow and way too long. We do not need 30+ slides about news items before starting the actual topics of the lecture. Also, slides with screenshots of academic journal articles are not helpful and unreadable. In general, I think Professor Schwartz is a caring and well-meaning professor, but needs to improve in many areas when it comes to teaching a large, introductory course.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Incredibly caring and responsive to student needs!! My one grievance is that he may be too nice when it comes to student breaches- for example, not kicking the student out of class who plagiarized his portion of the group paper- but to be fair, I don't know the details or the followup. Still, obviously cares a ton about the students, and is clearly passionate and objective when it comes to presenting topics.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0The instructor was phenomenal. I would take any class with him again.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Thanks for all the work & ppt",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Dr. Schwartz is very passionate about the course and his enthusiasm was apparent in every lecture and in his willingness to work through difficult topics with students outside of class. I knew nothing about policy prior to this class and I feel lucky to have had such an articulate, charismatic, and accessible teacher for the course.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0The instructor was very engaging and knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Dr. Schwartz is excellent and presented a ton of material in a very coherent, narrative way. He is very knowledgable and, importantly, is comfortable admitting when he does not know something, and always follows up with information about questions that he could not answer right away.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Professor Schwartz is a great instructor, and his passion and knowledge of the material is clear through his ability to comprehensively and enthusiastically answer questions in class. He is also extremely receptive to students outside the classroom and is willing to meet to discuss both class topics and career paths\/other student concerns",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Jason did an outstanding job in teaching such a difficult course with a huge course content. He inculcated all aspects of health policy so well. He managed teaching all topics truly wholeheartedly and very well.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Very kind, considerate, and open to suggestions from improving the course. In the future, I would suggest allowing opportunities for small group discussions regarding major concepts and themes throughout the course to synthesize the material and form better arguments.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Very engaging lecturer but also very verbose. Sometimes he spent much longer getting out an idea than was necessary or spent time talking about a seemingly unimportant detail. That said, he was a great lecturer with a lot of enthusiasm and a clear love for what he was talking about. He also took the time to remember all of the students names, which was very thoughtful of him- showed he cared about his students."

   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn about the U.S. health system, take the class. If you think this class has anything to do with public-health related content, don't take the class. Not the most fascinating topics, but it depends on your interests. Professor Schwartz is great.",
    "Excellent class, entertaining lecturer, important material presented well. If you pay attention in the lecture, you can skip all the readings and get a B.",
    "A great intro to American health policy",
    "Great introductory overview of health policy with a lot of readings and a lot of opportunities for evaluation (which can be seen as good or bad). Fairly painful group project.",
    "I recommend this class to all MPH students.",
    "it is not a health policy & health systems course, it is really just health systems with some policy about health systems in it",
    "Take it - important knowledge for anyone in the health system",
    "Great quick overview of the healthcare system. It's honestly hard to teach a policy course because have such varying backgrounds in policy and there is so much to cover. I definitely learned some new things that I didn't know before and had some ACA facts clarified.",
    "challenging course; expands your horizons",
    "It's important to understand the US healthcare system, even though some weeks the material isn't that interesting.",
    "Required course. I would recommend it because I find the topics interesting and it is relatively light workload-wise compared to other courses. Summary: Weekly lectures regarding different US health policy topics with no h\/w (other than a long list of readings that most people didn't do), one group-written paper, two tests, one final",
    "This class covered a number of topics relating to the US health care system, and briefly touched on a few international examples to compare. It did so in an extremely understandable fashion, helped in large part with the very clear course expectations set by Dr. Schwartz. I would highly recommend the course; as well as being extremely pertinent to our careers within the health world, it was also highly useful within my own life. Health insurance is likely something I'm going to have to deal with through my life, and I probably knew less than I should've before starting this class.",
    "An absolutely excellent course. Would certainly recommend based on the breadth and depth of information provided. It is helpful for people from a broad range of backgrounds, as well as a broad range of interests going forward.",
    "a lot of good content. articles were interesting and important. current news stories also gave the course real life application. wish we had more time for debate and discussion. I did not like group paper. I would have rather liked a group presentation or doing an individual paper. in class essays felt like undergrad all over again, but I know it is hard to evaluate us in intro level classes.",
    "Keep up with the readings and attend every class--- and you will do fine in this course. The workload can be a bit overwhelming near the end with a group paper and a back to back second midterm and final exam.",
    "The most interesting and useful 'class' I have ever taken as a health care professional. However it is a lot of work, and there is a superfluous and time intensive group project. You must keep up DAILY with readings.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning about health insurance and the Affordable Care Act. It provided me with a good background into understanding the health care system in the United States.",
    "poor; unfair\/disconnected assessments and evaluation; most of course is based on ability to memorize arbitrary facts",
    "I would say it is very good but that there is a lot of reading. If you have the time and interest and you'll actually do the readings, then by all means take it!",
    "This was a course on health systems, not health policy.",
    "If you want a solid overview of the US healthcare system, how it compares to other nations' health systems, and the major challenges\/barriers to change, this is a great course. However, some find the info in this class to be too detailed and superfluous given their specific interests and career goals.",
    "This is a crash-course in American health policy (with some insights into other countries) and provides so much of the basics that are essential for anyone interested in healthcare policy to know. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Teaches you a lot about our health care system. Moderate amount of work; ridiculous amount of reading. Professor cares about his work, his class, and his student, and is a fair grader.",
    "Great course. Keep up with the readings and think big picture concepts as opposed to little details",
    "I would recommend this course even if it was not a required MPH course. I gained a lot of background knowledge, as well information on current events. This material will be really important for my career moving forward.",
    "Yes, recommend. It is a good intro class.",
    "Take it. You will learn a lot of useful information about the current state of healthcare, its problems, and some solutions. You will be more better for taking it.",
    "Overall a great course for an introduction the US healthcare system, and useful for those who would like to better understand why our system is structured the way it is and how healthcare reforms like the ACA seek to improve it. I would highly recommend it.",
    "As someone who did not have much previous knowledge of health policy and health systems, I feel like a came away with a solid foundation of the way healthcare is structured and the issues with trying to change and improve these systems.",
    "Very good",
    "Course is an important introduction to the various arguments pertaining to health policy. Very interesting and definitely recommended.",
    "This course is an introduction to the US health care system and health policy in general. It gives you a very thorough overview of parts of the health system that you should definitely understand as a public health practitioner. That said, it is a large lecture course--pretty dry, not too demanding. It is required but if it wasn't, I wouldn't recommend it to another student.",
    "This course was kind of a mess. At first glance it seemed like a standard lecture course--2 hour lectures once a week, readings, two tests, a project and a final. However, there were WAY too many assigned readings which were often too long, too dense, and redundant with other readings. Word of advice: only do the readings Professor Schwartz references in lecture--nothing else will come up on the tests. The topics covered in lecture were fine and seemed like the most important concepts, but lectures themselves were incredibly hard to follow. The slides were confusing and didn't seem to have main points or ideas, and Professor Schwartz would talk in what seemed to be one long tangent for the entire 2 hours. It was very difficult to determine what I was supposed to be taking away from each class. This made it very difficult to study for the tests, since there was so much material that we were responsible for for each midterm, and little to no guidance as to what the most important facts and concepts were. When studying for the tests, I'd recommend going through the slides and your notes with a friend, and writing out definitions for the terms and concepts he outlines in the slides. Finally, the project was poorly designed and not well integrated in the course. We were split into groups of 4 to research and write a policy proposal for lowering the cost of prescription drugs. We had not discussed this topic in depth in class, and were just giving a long list of readings as reference material. The best way to approach the project is probably to first split up the readings and take notes in a Google Doc, then get together and decide which policies you want to recommend. Assign different people different sections, and then get together again to edit it for consistency. Overall, I do feel like I learned some of the most important concepts in U.S. health policy, but mainly because of my own effort and work, and not because of the course itself.",
    "A required course that provides an essential overview of the healthcare system and policies, and is definitely worth taking even if not required. To maximize what you get out of the course, do the readings and go to office hours!!",
    "Every management and policy student should take this class.",
    ".",
    "Crash course in topics related to health policy. You'll learn a lot of great and relevant info and probably enjoy the class!",
    "This course provides a useful overview of health systems in the US. I would definitely recommend it to other students, especially those without a lot of prior knowledge on the topic.",
    "The class provides a clear and broad overview of health systems. I would recommend the course to all students with limited exposure to health policy on a formal academic level",
    "I was a complete alien to this topic but this course opened up a whole new perspective for me in health care system. Excellent course. is a MUST",
    "A lot of material will be covered, reach out to the professor and TAs if you have concerns."
