   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend it. A lot of reading, and you need to actually attend lecture, but really good. Learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend it because its a low time commitment really enjoyable course on the history of India and Pakistan that is taught wonderfully.",
    "highly recommend this class, interesting. quite a bit of reading (like 100 pages per class) but readings are interesting.",
    "yes! not a lot of opportunities like this to learn about post-colonial south asia in a broader theme, survey type course. good for building background knowledge about the region, but is also a very detailed course. you will come away having learned a lot. there are a lot of readings, 100+ pages per week, but it's manageable.",
    "This is a wonderful and fun course! This region is fascinating and a great way to dissect the issues of the modern world. Professor De is on the best professors I have had and does a great job of lecturing and also providing unique learning methods such as simulations, film screenings, and literature.",
    "Definitely take it if you're at all interested in the history of India and Pakistan--especially if you want to have an incredible professor who really cares about the class and YOU and if you want to learn about the histories from the bottom-up (not only the top-down).",
    "This class is really great, especially as an overview of India and Pakistan (and the early\/independence days of Bangladesh). I really enjoyed it, and especially because Professor De is amazing! He's so interesting and knowledgeable, and also varies his assignments a lot. He also really wants to give you the opportunity to learn as much as you can, so he advertises other related events like movie screenings, recent articles, talks\/discussions, speakers, etc. that focus on South Asia. I thought it was very helpful in understanding a more detailed and nuanced history of India and Pakistan, since I had only known a vague and general one from hearing about it before.",
    "Great Great class. Take it for Professor De, he is an absolute boss and is an excellent teacher!",
    "Interfering, well-taught course. Expect to come away with a good understanding of trends of recent history in India and Pakistan.",
    "I definitely recommend this course, even if you have no prior knowledge of India or Pakistan. Be prepared for a lot of work.",
    "Good, thorough class on modern history, accessible even for people like me with little background. Lectures are well organized and cover a lot of ground. Readings and tests were reasonable. I learned a ton and got way more interested in the region. Professor De is one of the best for sure."
