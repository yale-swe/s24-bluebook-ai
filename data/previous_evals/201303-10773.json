    "Chinese 110 is a fast-paced course, even for students who might have had some Chinese experience in the past. Students are expected to learn to write and memorize characters by themselves, and there is an assessment every day. However, the large amount of repetition and daily practice definitely leads to visible progress week to week.",
    "You will learn so much Chinese so quickly that if you think you may want to learn Chinese you should definitely take the class. Don't be intimated by the language, teachers make learning the language very manageable, definitely have to put a lot of your time in to learning.",
    "Chinese overall is a great course. There is often a lot of homework and the material can be a bit challenging at times (particularly vocabulary and writing). However, it's very rewarding and you'll ultimately learn a lot, even over a single semester. All the teachers are very good and the day-to-day classes are very well organized.",
    "The difficulty of this course is RIDICULOUSLY overhyped. What previous reviews have miraculously neglected to mention is that this class essentially gives out A's. The averages of the first several tests were in the high 90's, and it wasn't because we became Chinese masters . If you make a mistake on your oral presentation in class, you can redo it for a perfect score with your TA. The rumors that you'll have 2 hours of nightly homework, or that Chinese will take over your life are just blatantly untrue. I really enjoyed my time in Chinese 110. The rotating teacher system is quite nice, though you'll definitely have your favorites. The textbook we use is accompanied by hilariously awkward videos that are physically painful to watch. You'll get a ton of speaking practice every day. It's a fun ride! However the class is not without its downsides. The number of students enrolled in L1 is enormous, and since you only see each teacher for about a quarter of the semester, you don't really feel like they get to know you. Combine this with the fact that the curriculum is super structured with its drill, drill, drilling and rote memorization, and you can end up feeling like you've been stuck on a Chinese-learning assembly line; there's very little room for creativity or flexibility. At times the class can feel like a competition, especially when Li Laoshi is listing the students who got perfect scores on their tests. What I found most disappointing was that while reviews I read raved about how much material is covered in one semester, I honestly don't think we learned more than other L1 classes. So yeah, I enjoyed it and found it relatively painless, but you can take it or leave it."
