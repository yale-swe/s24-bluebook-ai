   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend ENGL 115, \"What is a Detective Story?\" As a relatively new genre, most of it fits nicely into one semester, and the books had a strong sense of continuity. Even if you don't go in liking detective stories, you will by the end. Grimstad is really laid back and will often adjust deadlines to align with pressures from other classes.",
    "This class isn't just about Sherlock Holmes but many of the other detectives that have influenced the genre of detective fiction. Every week is a different novel and movie that was based on that book in the progression of this genre. Would definitely recommend but it is a time commitment to read all of these books.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN. Professor Grimstad is the best of the best. The readings are all fantastic and manageable. If I don't see a waiting list of 100 students the next time this class is offered I will be disappointed.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. fantastic writing credit, yes you do get to watch Sherlock, but you also get to read some incredible authors and find out their connection to the classic detective genre - who would've thought Freud was related ? Take this class to find out",
    "A really wonderful class! I always looked forward to it, because the discussions were exciting and the reading list was great. Honestly, if you want a really fun English class this is the one to take because it's straight up enjoyable.",
    "A+, would recommend. Well, if you like the genre, I guess. While I'm sure it would still be interesting if you didn't, it was the enthusiasm for the material that really sold the class. The papers are definitely work, but they're not too long, and between them the readings are perfectly reasonable and generally enjoyable. Prof. Grimstad's a lot of fun, and if the class composition is anything like it was for this semester a lot of people are really enthusiastic, which makes for great discussions.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, it was about an interesting subject and the Professor was engaged.",
    "ENGL 115 with Grimstad is a fantastic class. The focus on the detective genre means that the readings tie in with each other much better than in other classes. Grimstad knows so much both about detective fiction and literature in general, and the classes are a good balance of a short lecture-type intro about the readings and authors and then a regular discussion-based seminar. I learned a huge amount about the genre and also about how to improve my writing. The papers were spaced out well and never a burden. Definitely a fantastic class that I'd recommend both for the readings and for the professor.",
    "Overall, this class was an interesting and relatively easy class to take that had interesting readings nearly every week. This is a class that based on my professor should only be taken if you feel that you understand how to write an analytic essay, although there is room for improvement as the semester goes on. I would recommend it if you want something that is lighter in writing, and you feel that you have the writing skills necessary for a college essay.",
    "Detective Stories is an interesting class, especially for people who've read a lot of the mysteries on the syllabus before. Definitely gives you a different perspective on what is normally just pleasure reading. Coming from a background with more intense reading assignments, I found the workload to be very chill. Sometimes our assignments were just a few pages long. The maximum number of pages assigned was probably around 100. Essays could be on any topic you wanted as long as it related to the works in some way. Professor Grimstad is incredibly nice, and offers tremendous insight into the works and their relations to other literary masterpieces, but sometimes dominated discussion a little much with his own comments. Probably wouldn't take again, but only because I'd rather take a class that covers more material."
