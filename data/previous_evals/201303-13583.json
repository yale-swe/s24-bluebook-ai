    "Yes I would recommend; fills an important gap between statistics and methods classes to promote a deep understanding of approaches to design",
    "The course provides an overview and facilitates discussion about some of the key issues in designing and carrying out high quality social research. These are issues that every social science researcher grapples with (or should grapple with!). Spending time thinking through the issues thus seems to be a worthy use of one's time. As a result, I would highly recommend the course."

    "As mentioned above, the course covered very important issues. My only complaint is that much of it felt redundant with other courses we are required to take as part of our program."
