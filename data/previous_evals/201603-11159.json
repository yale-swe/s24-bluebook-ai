    "A very solid base understanding of Italian",
    "I think I definitely improved my studying habits. I learned through taking so many exams how to retain a lot of information (such as vocab for instance) in a short period of time. I learned that while writing in another language sometimes it is much easier to use simpler vocab and not attempt to sound the same that we would if we had been writing in English.",
    "This semester I was surprised at my ability to learn fundamental Italian so quickly. After dropping my language in high school, I was nervous about picking up a new language. But it was exciting taking Italian with Julia this semester. Although it was hard to be in a class where you could only speak Italian, it definitely helped me develop my speaking skills.",

   "comments": [
    "I think the pace of the L1 course was a little fast. Had we done one less chapter overall for the course and had allotted more time to each of the other chapters I think we would have retained and understood the language better. After speaking to my fellow students we all agreed that because of the pace we felt as though we were just memorizing things for the test and regurgitating it, and then after we forgot all of the information because we had to move on to the next chapter and we never fully understood the grammar points. I also feel as though we could have focused more on pronunciation and speaking as a whole.",
    "Very efficient in terms of making a lot of progress in a short amount of time. It could use some more in-class conversations and discussions between students",
    "I think one strength of ITAL 110 is that it covers a ton. It is an extremely full course which is beneficial because by the end of the first semester you have a good idea for how to use a lot of different tenses and speech patterns. One weakness is simply how fast it moves. I felt that there were times when I really could have benefited from another day or two to fully grasp a concept.",
    "My strength was grammar and my weakness was speaking.",
    "I think it would be helpful to have more correlation between the temas and the workbook chapters, and if each day could begin with a question (or a couple) related to that day's section that each person would answer. We were able to remember the basics (what is your name, where are you from, etc.) so well because we started class with those questions every day for a few weeks!",
