   "comments": [
    "The first section of the class consists of reading some wonderful short stories and using them to discuss elements of craft (character, voice, etc.) The second consists of workshopping short stories. Probably the best class I've taken at Yale--wonderfully taught and full of enthusiastic, talented students.",
    "I'd definitely recommend ENGL 134 for another student; it's a really well-structured course, where for the first two thirds you focus on learning various important techniques in fiction writing through reading various stories and completing exercises that bring out that particular technique. The last third of the course is a workshop, where everyone writes their own stories and provides feedback. Professor Cunningham is an engaging presence in the classroom, and he provides really thoughtful feedback on how to improve your work.",
    "It's a fantastic course. There's lots of great reading, and lots of good techniques and strategies and new ways to think about writing fiction. It was a pleasure to work with Professor Cunningham. He has a wealth of experience and fantastic advice to share. And I really mean, \"to share\": he's so willing to share what he thinks, he's always honest and clear, and he's always willing to take the time to talk more. The suggestions Professor Cunningham makes always felt \"spot-on\" to me. On a general level, I really feel that he helped me (indirectly, in a good way) articulate what makes a piece of fiction work. Describing what makes a certain sentence sound so good, for example, had been a bit tough for me, but now I think that I'm much more capable of doing so, given the perspectives that Professor Cunningham has showed our class. I also really appreciated that even though he could articulate so well what worked about a sentence, he would still recognize the fact that there's a bit of \"alchemy\" to writing: that it's not a science to describe the craft of what makes something work, but instead we can describe some of it, and there's always going to be that \"alchemical\" part left over that sort of works like magic.",
    "I would highly recommend this class, although only for people who truly care about the craft of writing; if you're just looking for an easy English class, don't bother, because you won't get much out of it (and will take away from the experience of those who are committed to learning how to write fiction). However, experience level doesn't matter at all.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. If you love fiction, if you love writing and reading other people's writing, this class will just make you float. And you'll learn how to write more maturely. But don't try to get in if you're not one hundred percent dedicated to the work, because the class works best when everyone is passionate and invested.",
    "I would recommend this course in a heartbeat. Honestly, it's been the most incredible class experience I've had at Yale. If you care at all about writing, about stories, about reading--then do it. One caveat: I know I was shocked by the revelation that you had to apply. The course listing said just show up to the first class. But make no bones about it: the first class, you fill out an application. There's also a conversation with Michael that turns into gladiatorial 'look at how smart I am, choose me!' 'No me! This is what I love!' combat. Officially, it's just 'let's talk about literature and why we write' but it is, without a doubt, a fight to prove you should get into the course. Out of the fifty or so in that first meeting, twelve of us got in. That's not to say that it isn't a great class-it's a once in a lifetime class--but I know I didn't see the applications coming.",
    "Absolutely. Its difficult to get into this class because its so popular but since there is no creative writing application necessary, even novice writers can get in and succeed. He takes students from every major and every level of experience. Great class. Not too time consuming or difficult, but SPEND TIME ON YOUR FINAL STORY, it'll be worth it. If you like reading short stories and you like writing and you want to focus on the individual aspects of what makes a great story with a wonderful writer and mentor, take the class. Honestly, take the class just to be around other students excited about writing and a professor excited about teaching and mentoring young writers. GO TO THE FIRST SESSION, EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU WON'T GET IN! I was intimidated by the first day and almost left halfway through but just try your luck."
