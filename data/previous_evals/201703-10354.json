    "I learned about anthropological and archaeological issues relating to the Eurasian Steppe, from analyzing when horse riding developed in the region to understanding how the nomadic pastoralists of the region have historically related to their surrounding sedentary societies. The course really reinforced how important a role archaeology and anthropology have even in current-day issues, which is an idea I can carry forward into my studies in other fields."

    "I loved that this course was small, because it allowed me to really engage in class discussions and I enjoyed the reading selections for the course. I also really appreciated the open-ended nature of the final paper, which allowed me to explore a topic I was interested in, while applying what we learned in class."

    "Yes! I'd recommend this course because Professor Honeychurch is a great professor, and the course allows you to dive into the topic even if you don't have a strong background in it. It really changed my understanding of Eurasian Steppe peoples, and nomadic pastoralists in general."
