   "comments": [
    "YES. Winkler makes philosophy approachable for people who aren't planning on majoring in it. He's also incredibly intelligent, witty and engaging. He makes sure to converse with students instead of merely lecturing. Great course.",
    "This was easily one of my most favorite classes that I have taken at Yale. The subject matter is interesting (if you like philosophy) and the discussion were usually quite fascinating and engaging. There's not too much work, and the readings typically went very quickly. Professor Winkler is simply delightful. I can really think of no reason not to take this course.",
    "If you take this class, do the reading. Otherwise it will be difficult to get much out of it. The readings are good and interesting, but as with many philosophy classes easy to neglect until the last minute. Winkler is great.",
    "Yes, if the syllabus looks appealing, take it. Winkler is outstanding.",
    "This is a great class all-around. For both philosophers and for historians, it offers a holistic perspective that I have never had in any other Yale course. That said, it can get pretty heavy on the philosophy side, so don't go into it thinking that it's a strait-up history lecture.",
    "If you dont take this course, take some other course with Winkler. Sometimes the readings are very boring, but Winkler can make any boring reading into a very interesting discussion.Moreover, the assignments are: 3 short essays, 1 long essay, then 3 short essays for the final. It's structured so that you can take the debates you find really interesting and solely focus on them. No need to discuss something you find uninteresting, which is a really great feature of the course.",
    "Really really great class. Winkler is a great lecturer and the material is very diverse and interesting. You do not have to be experienced at all before you take this class--Winkler teaches at a very accessible level.",
    "Yes, highly recommend it for anybody interested in philosophy either as a major or just one class. Great way to get a breadth of knowledge and exposure to the discipline, covering metaphysics as well as ethical and even a little epistemology. Good stuff.HOWEVER, TONS OF READING",
    "Very good. Winkler excels at taking complicated philosophical ideas and articulating them clearly and intuitively.",
    "A great overview of American philosophy over the last 200 plus years. In depth reasons of two or three fairly short philosophical texts each week along with historical background. I thoroughly throughly recommend it if the gets look interesting.",
    "The class is good -- several things, although this class could be an introductory class to philosophy, you would do much better in the class if you take a philosophy class before. Readings are overwhelming at times, especially when papers are due, but other than that, it's a pretty straight-forward class. Prof. Winkler is reserved, but not impossible with A's, so spend as much time as you can in office hours talking about the arguments so that you're familiar with them when you write your paper. I didn't like the three two-page short responses due together as one paper format he used for two of the papers -- I would much rather have written substantial papers instead.On the whole, a solid class -- it's pretty important to see where our country has been and where it is with regard to the arguments and styles of argumentation that American academics have produced. You get to read important books that are rarely assigned at Yale, including Walden and Pragmatism.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, especially if you're looking to try a philosophy class at Yale.",
    "This class is awesome. I highly recommend it. Great readings, great lecture, although lecture is so much more rewarding when you have done your reading.",
    "American Philosophy was my first philosophy class at Yale. I found the whole style of thinking philosophy requires difficult and frustrating at times, but I am glad I had this introduction. Perhaps I didn't learn the major philosophers, but I think the class size and especially Professor Winkler made it a great way to be introduced to philosophy. Some of the reading can be pretty dense and tough, but Thoreau, Emerson, MLK, James, etc. are great to know about. I definitely recommend this course.",
    "Only if you really have a love for this specific type of philosophy.",
    "I would recommend it hesitantly. It exposed me to a body of philosophy that I found really fascinating, but I found it was not the best course in which to develop one's own philosophical writing and\/or thinking. The grading was also somewhat harder than the typical Yale humanities standard - don't expect an A unless you are already a seasoned philosophy student.",
    "A good basic introduction to American philosophy; becomes more theoretical and focused on modern ideas toward the end, rather than traditional philosophic argument.",
    "The course offered an excellent breadth of material, that is both generally accessible to a philosophical novice and still engaging for more experienced students. There is a lot of reading, but not all of it is necessary for assignment or class discussion. In addition to being a lucid lecturer, Professor Winkler is very organized and reliable. In class he does a good job balancing lecture discussion. Outsideof class he is very helpful with getting back to students who have any questions about the material.",
    "Yes, because it is a very good survey course on the intellectual history of the US.",
    "I would! It's a small lecture, so you don't feel pressure to do all the reading, but you want to do enough of it to be able to participate. People raise their hands and contribute, which makes it great.",
    "It is a great survey philosophy course and I would definitely recommend it to students from all majors. Great course!!",
    "American Philosophy is a fantastic course. The authors you read are great, and the work load is very reasonable. Absolutely take this, whether you're a major or not."
