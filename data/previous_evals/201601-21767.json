    "Take French if you love culture, philosophy, fashion.",
    "The continuation of French 110. I thought this semester was easier than last. Great class.",
    "A continuation of FREN 110. I really loved it! French in Action is still extremely funny and the material is so much more in depth than it was in 110. If Ngame is teaching it take it with him because he's an amazing professor!",
    "Take this class if you want to learn French! By the end of the year you can definitely have a conversation with another French speaker. If you can, take it with Professor Ngame! You have to take it for the whole year, but it's so worth it. Also--keep up with the workbooks.",
    "No, unless they had a specific reason that they needed to learn French.",
    "Only take French if you are willing to put in the HOURS of required work. Know that it is way more work than other languages. There are weekly tests, and L2 gets a lot harder than L1, even if you've had previous french experience. Don't take this class if you don't have the time to invest in it. If you do take French (the department is amazing) TAKE NGAME'S CLASS. He is incredible and will make you love learning.",
    "Yes.",
    "it's a great class, well-taught, with lots of prior years of teaching so that the method is well-thought out. you learn a lot in a short time, and it's not as much work as another 1.5 credit class would be, which is nice."
