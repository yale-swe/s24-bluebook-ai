    "The course helped me to develop a better understanding of how sociology and history can work together to form a more holistic research approach.",
    "I feel that my understanding of how various scholars have gone about comparative and historical sociological work has been greatly expanded. I also appreciated the wide array of reading we did across a range of topics, because it really helped me understand more about the discipline. I improved my reading skills, and my writing skills. The papers were really helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Sometimes the focus seemed to lie on history more than on sociology, which made it a little difficult to engage at times. However, it was great having students from both disciplines learning together and teaching each other about what they regard as important for their ideas of successful research and theory building.",
    "I really liked the writing assignments. I thought they were very helpful. I also liked the reading selections. However, at times I thought that the discussion in class leaned too heavily on the history while not paying enough attention to the sociological theory and the method. At times, it felt like the history students in the course overtook the discussion, and if you didn't understand the specifics of that time period or topic, it was not possible to contribute much to discussion. I really enjoyed learning from the history students, though; I just wish there had been a more even distribution of things to talk about. I would have liked to go to the Beinecke and look at archival documents and get some hands on experience and specific teaching about how to do archival work."
