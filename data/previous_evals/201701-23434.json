   "comments": [
    "This course is extremely important for students, however, it is taught very poorly, which limits students' ability to learn important concepts. The instructor is highly knowledgeable, however, language barriers significantly impede learning of such complex topics.",
    "Great course and Professor Chen is an incredible professor. Great content on slides and homework datasets and questions. Could be improved with a little more in class engagement.",
    "Overall I did not really enjoy this course or feel that it challenged me to learn how to use SAS analytical tools independently.",
    "The course was fine in the first couple of weeks, but use of plagiarized (I mean, *cough* word-for-word borrowed notes from Dr.Doug Mckee, but not cited) slides from other professors in later lectures was inconsistent with Dr. Chen's own presentation style and powerpoint style. Made the course difficult to follow and understand; latter lectures seemed patched-in and haphazardly made. Chen's own note-making\/ presentation-making style is much better than Dr. McKee's. Sources of word for word lecture on Instrumental Variables: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FQ3d2syNfYI",
    "Overall, the course was effective in teaching methods. I do not, however, feel as though I am competent with SAS, and feel as though a different class format may be for effective for teaching SAS.",
    "Strengths were the professor and TA's. Weaknesses was SAS was very difficult and hard for me to see the connection to the course itself.",
    "This is an interesting course in that it has a vast amount of potential but is generally not very applicable. Lectures were boring, material is boring, and the lab sections were not well-run. I expected to be taught coding during lab not do my homework; moreover, the idea of teaching coding during lecture when no one has SAS in front of them is stupid. What was severely lacking was the methods in the course. The goal of the group project was to really think about the material, but it ended up just being one person who wrote the whole project and predominantly two people running code, which is clearly not fair and useless.",
    "The lecture notes were not entirely helpful with the home works and it felt as if the information could be greatly condensed. The group project could have also used a section to evaluate our groups members.",
    "Kinda boring but Prof. Chen tries really hard to engage students. It's super useful though!",
    "I just hated the course. The professor is great, not his fault. just not up my alley",
    "Great course content--slides were amazing, and students who studied the material well likely learned a lot from the course. However, I feel as if students without a previous SAS background would benefit from more introductory material or recommended videos (such as those on the UCLA website). Furthermore, for the group project, the workload among the roles are nowhere near evenly distributed. The group liason role is unnecessary, and this team member would be more beneficial doing data analysis or writing.",
    "Professor is a nice person and tries hard to respond to student feedback. He reads off the slides a lot, so it can be difficult to pay attention. The optional TA reviews were very helpful for the homework. You could do well in the class without studying",
    "Great course. Would have liked to have more SAS during lectures",
    "Good",
    "A great course, could have moved a little faster at times I thought, but I think the intention was to make the course enjoyable. I really enjoyed Dr. Chen.",
    "very clear lectures and slides; labs are helpful; appreciate that all assignments were productive and not busy work",
    "This course teaches you hard skills in Stata\/SAS. I thought the course did a good job of teaching us not only different analysis techniques, but also the different types of programming code to use. I think that lectures could be improved by including additional information about when to use certain analysis techniques and how to most effectively approach a research question. One challenging aspect of this course is the group project. I did not feel as though the work ended up being evenly distributed and not everyone pulled their own weight. I think for the purposes of this course, everyone should be required to do some sort of analysis for a final project in order to solidify the skills learned in the class.",
    "Very challenging, but in a good way.",
    "Course readings are completely unhelpful - please actually provide readings that can be helpful (i.e. Related to class lectures). I didn't feel like the class was planned very well, and frankly it's unfortunate because I know the professor is good, but the way he planned out the class was not ideal in my opinion. Also spend some more time going over SAS - most people still don't know how to use it.",
    "The classes were covering a lot of difficult content and I don't think the set up was conducive to understanding the concepts. I think it should have had more of a focus on the lab based aspects, to help us become independent in carrying out the research methods.",
    "Great way to learn SAS and learn\/review of different quantitative research methods.",
    "Although the material for this course can be difficult, the professor did a great job of making it understandable and accessible. The in-class examples and homework assignments were useful for understanding the material. It was also good to have access to the TAs during the homework sessions. More in-class interaction would have made the class more enjoyable.",
    "A lot of haven't taken Biostatistics or learned SAS before so that was difficult. I think that it got better when the lab section was used to teach as well as get help on the homework. Make it clear what the purpose of the lab section really is. The TAs aren't given enough time at the end of class to go over lab material, and they are rushed. Give them more time.",
    "This course was straight-forward and had the appropriate workload and content.",
    "Not a good class for those with very little background in statistics. Was lost from the start, tried to get assistance but didn't and never caught up to speed."

    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Professor Chen is amazing and constructed a great course. A bit difficult to follow in class, but gives so many resources and is so willing to help any way he can. Really incredible asset to YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Cite your sources- if you expect students to not plagiarize their work, don't plagiarize your own. Need to use more in-class examples to explain harder topics. A pre-class quiz would be useful in improving class attendance and attention (could barely keep 25% of original student enrollees in the latter classes)",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Extremely knowledgeable and was regularly available in person and via email to discuss statistical questions.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0The course was fine. I feel as though I may had gotten a better grasp of the material if more time had been spent on interpretation of the statistics.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Very nice professor, very willing to help students.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Prof. Chen means well and is generally a nice professor. He obviously knows a lot about the material. I think he needs to re-evaluate how to teach the course though.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0The professor is excellent! I can feel how much he cares about his students and his class.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0He did a great job with a boring topic. He always tried his best to engage students.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Amazing instructor who is always willing to ensure students understand learn and understand material. The slides are very clear and informative as well. Instruction during class tends to be a little slow-paced, however.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Very good at responding to feedback, would help if he reads off the slides less.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Great Professor. Very kind and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Good",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0A very good teacher. I think there might be some way to increase class participation (maybe move to a smaller room?)",

    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0He is very intelligent and enthusiastic. He was very responsive to students' needs.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0A very knowledgeable professor who makes himself available.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Prof Chen really cares about students and is very kindhis lectures can be quite dry, however, and it's easy not to pay attention. Fortunately, the slides are great reference materials; he gives you lots of good material to work with and learn from.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Xi is wonderful, approachable and always ready to help you understand the issues. He is also open to listening to feedback and changing the class accordingly.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0The professor is so knowledgeable about this subject and does an excellent job of presenting the material.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Extremely helpful and attentive to students.",

    "Work hard throughout for content to properly build on itself. Follow coding lessons to really internalize. Study for exams beyond just making a cheat sheet.",
    "It's fine; use of \"cheat sheets,\" makes the class easy. But instructor was lazy with making PPT slides (copied another instructor's slides) which made classes 8-11 particularly poorly taught.",
    "The course will not be the most exciting course, but is required, and is not terribly difficult.",
    "It was okay, unless it is a requirement I would not recommend.",
    "This course aims at discussing the methods used for health policy and services research. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who wants a serious course in methods. If you just need to take it to be introduced to the material, then this course is sufficient.",
    "Very useful content! Although it might not be what you expect to learn when you first come in and most would be reluctant to try hard. But I have to say this is one of the few classes that I have taken that actually teach you technical skills.",
    "Useful but boring",
    "I didn't find this course helpful or engaging, but the professor and TAs are very nice people and the project was an interesting assignment.",

    "Any student will have a stronger grasp on SAS after this course.",
    "If it was not a requirement I wound not take it - I feel like this was not a Yale-quality education at all.",
    "Take it if you have to. If you don't, you've probably learned a lot of these techniques elsewhere (provided you've had a good stats class)but you might get something out of it! Never hurts to reinforce. But don't expect anything life-changing.",
    "Useful content but difficult to follow if you have no background in research methods.",
    "Great way to learn SAS and learn\/review of different quantitative research methods.",
    "Easier if you have taken biostatistics before. Not impossible without SAS knowledge but definitely harder. Lab was just meant for getting homework help. Towards the end of semester it was also used as a teaching opportunity (about SAS) by the TAs. Material taught here was not shared on classesv2",
    "Need to do a lot outside of class to keep up especially if you do not have much experience in the subject matter."
