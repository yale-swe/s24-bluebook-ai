   "comments": [
    "Absolutely recommended. You learn so much about idiomatic harmonies, get to compose a theme and variations and string quartet movement, and, especially if Megan's your instructor, will have a great time in the process",
    "fast paced and enjoyable, be prepared for a good bit of readingi would recommend it (have already recommended it) to my friends",
    "A detail-oriented close look at harmonic function and syntax in the Classical Era of Western Art Music. Worth taking if you want to understand the basic underpinnings of music, even if you don't plan to major in it.",
    "MUS210 is a course that uses part-writing as a vehicle to understanding the structure and formation of Classical and Baroque music. Through many part-writing exercises, you begin to realize how these compositions are formed. This is not a \"gut-course,\" to do well, one must do all of the assigned readings and assignments with care! I would recommend MUS210 only to those who are passionate about classical music; otherwise, one may find the material uninteresting and un-applicable.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want further knowledge in music theory that go beyond the basics into form and harmony.",
    "Take it! It's a fun class - the work is manageable, you'll learn a TON about music, and you'll get to flex your compositional muscle. Why not?"
