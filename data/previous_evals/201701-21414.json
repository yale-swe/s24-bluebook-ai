    "I developed critical analysis skills, the ability to see comparisons across literary texts, a greater appreciation of the literary elements embedded in children's literature, and was able to improve my overall writing and essay skills.",
    "I learned a lot from this class! Absolutely fascinating exploration of myth and fairytale tropes and their origins as well as how they pop up in modern children's literature.",
    "I've developed the abilities to speak with concision and analyze literature that I've been familiar with for (ever) a long time without letting my old opinions influence my new ones. Except Harry Potter. The opinions are too strong."

   "comments": [
    "This course has an awesome reading list and a lot of flexibility with projects and deadlines to let you get out of the class what you want.",
    "Strengths: insightful teacher, very interesting course materials, engaging teacher, small class size, hard-working students, high class participation, interesting assignments, ability to be very creative, the freedom of the assignments in terms of what the students want to hand in, the class is excellently structured in the sense that students are given the freedom to apply their own individual strength to assignments since students are given a lot of leeway in terms of how they want to approach assignments",
    "At times it felt like the discussion lagged or wasn't as structured as it could have been (although I did appreciate that the students had a lot of control).",
    "I don't know that it had any weaknesses. I honestly felt as though it was a fascinating, comfortable class in which I could share my opinions about wonderful literature. I love the way Professor Stepto teaches us by letting us come to talking points ourselves and then leading us to draw conclusions by incorporating her own knowledge."

   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you loved being a child and you love reading and books. The reading list for this class is diverse and fascinating and the type of work you produce is creative and critical and challenges you to engage with text in new ways. Prof Stepto clearly loves what she teaches.",
    "This English class was by far my favorite class at Yale. I was able to learn so incredibly much, but at the same time I had so much fun. If I could take the course again, I would! So so so happy to have had Michele Stepto as my teacher, and to have been given the ability to take such a different and interesting class. I feel like not enough students know about this course. The class only had 6 students (which I found to be very pleasant), however, everyone that I told about this course, was so excited about it and wanted to take it themselves. So I feel like this course needs a lot more exposure, since there are so many students that would be so interested in taking it, but just don't know about its existence.",
    "It is an incredible, fun, and enlightening course and I will tell everyone I know to take it."
