   "comments": [
    "I do recommend the class to other students since it is one of the most important concepts that we need to know in order to study economics. The professor is good at explaining important concepts.",
    "I would summarize it as a whirlwind tour through many of the major issues in microeconomics, building on an assumed foundation of at least one intro, undergraduate-level micro course. I would recommend it if the course is a stepping stone to other econ classes, but not if someone is simply interested in micro generally.",
    "It is a very theoretical overview of microeconomics. I think I struggled most with a lack of math background. It was difficult, and my analytical skills were challenged, but I think I struggled more than I got out of the course as far as gaining a better understanding of micro theory.",
    "The most interesting and best taught of the core courses.",
    "If it weren't required, I would not recommend it. The professor is charismatic and really know the material, but nothing seems relevant to our discipline, and it was fairly time consuming.",
    "It's a survey course in microeconomic theory with a focus on development topics, with a good balance of rigor and examples.",
    "I would say see my first answer. The course provides a good overview and intuition of some of the key concepts in Microeconomics. It is geared towards application, as opposed to mathematical rigor (though this does not mean it tries to avoid math). For me, this was perfect, but if (for some unknown reason) you believe that the pure math perspective is really important, you shouldprobably take the PhD level micro course.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to student who have previously learned intermediate level microeconomics in undergraduate. For student who has never taken economics before, this class can be challenging.",
    "Not too useful, doesn't add much and no real life examples.",
    "545 provided a rigorous mathematical treatment of the theory of the consumer and briefly introduced the theory of the firm. Other topics such as game theory may or may not be covered depending on the scheduling and progress during the semester. I would recommend this course only for students comfortable with differential calculus and a high level of abstraction.",
    "I would not recommmend this course to a fellow student, since a lot of the most interesting portions of the subject are not covered.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone who will be involved at least in part in economics. It is very accessible, taught incredibly well, and teaches quite a bit for its short time span.",
    "I would summarize it as relevant, interesting and worth recommending to a student who wants an application oriented study of Microeconomics without getting too caught up with the technicalities of the subject.",
    "I would not recommend 545.I don't believe that the course added anything beyond my ability when I entered the program.One of the main problems with this class is that IDE is marketed as a program for those with strong calculus and economics background whereas 545 is open to students outside of economics who have never studied before. It is impossible to tailor a course to satisfy both and therefore as an IDE student, I found the class slow and boring and not helpful.",
    "Only for beginners in microeconomics; it is too slow for a masters level course for a student with economics background.",
    "Focus is mainly on Slutsky decomposition of effects.Recommended to students with no or little background in Microeconomics."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Not - I took it to get a better understanding of economists' thinking.",
    "It gave me a much stronger foundation in micro, and while it will not contribute directly to my research, I feel 'inoculated into the ways of western economic thought', as P. Boozer would say, and this better understanding of how economiststhink is both satisfying and generally helpful.",
    "I have a deeper understanding of microeconomics, particularly as a quantitative discipline. I am uncertain as to how this will feed into my thesis, but this understanding will undoubtedly be critical.",
    "I don't believe it does at all. I will likely forget most of the material and will not have to use it going forward.",
    "I did not gain much from this course. Mostly I used an advantage from already study in my undergraduate.",
    "For me, the course mainly refreshed my undergrad economics background and extended it somewhat. The content will probably not be THAT directly applicable to my own research, but it will likely indirectly influence it. Since I will also interact with economists on a regular basis, it will provide some understanding about how they think and simply help me talk with them in \"their language\".",
    "Good theoretical foundation",
    "This course gives us an advantage over the pure econ Ph.D. students, in that it provides us with the intuition around microeconomic theory.",
    "The course introduced me to a number of the finer points of the discipline which are often overlooked. Plus concepts were applied to practical problems in a refreshing manner, deepening my appreciation of the kind of issues a professional economist would have to grapple with in the applied arena.",
    "The course provided more understanding of the theory on a very detailed and mathematical level. But I don't think that it added very much to my ability as an economist.",
    "I learned a lot from this course.",
    "Does not contribute much, this course focussed too parochially on one small aspect of microeconomics. granted that its a one semester course, it still could have covered more if the pace was fastened.",
    "Did not fully understand Slutsky decomposition of effects until after taking this course.",
    "It has helped me deepen my understanding of certain concepts but not too many. Could have done a lot more."
