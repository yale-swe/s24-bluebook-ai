    "A wide range of people can benefit from MUSI 110 - it's an excellent intro course that is equally appropriate for someone with no musical experience and someone (like me) who has played an instrument for several years without ever learning any music theory. You need to do the work to gain from the class, but the work is pretty fun - you get to write a couple songs - and the workload overall will definitely be on the lighter side out of whatever classes you're taking... it's the kind of class where, if you stay on top of things and put a little effort each week into understanding the material, you won't have to study for the exams for more than an hour. Definitely a valuable class for anyone who's interested in music. But make sure you shop around, because many sections are taught by grad students - and my grad student teacher was amazing, but not all of them are.",
    "You should take this class if you're interested in understanding the theory behind music. It is a good class for both musicians and newbies, although it will require a little more work for non-musicians. Definitely make sure to show the sections because some TAs and professors are better than others. Kirill rocks!",
    "Take Musi 110 if you are interested in taking higher level music courses. It'll give you a solid background. Also take it if you simply want to understand Western music theory tradition in detail. I've studied theory through piano, voice and drum set, and I still learned a lot in the course. Any one with music background will find it easy.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! Take it! Super fun and easy, but you still learn a ton by the end. It's the perfect fifth course. If Kirill is available as an instructor, take it with him. He's the best.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course. It will give you an appreciation for music and the ability to talk about what you've always intuitively felt but never knew how to describe.",
    "Yes--take with Kirill if you can! It is a great way to immerse yourself in music in a non-threatening way and learn to appreciate it from the fundamentals.",
    "Take this class with Kirill Zikanov if you can. He's enthusiastic, brings in guests, and generally makes the class enjoyable",
    "I would recommend music 110 to anyone who is interested in the theoretical side of music who does not feel completely comfortable with the next level of music theory classes. Even if you already have instrumental experience, it was a very fun class to attend, and the basic ear training, I found, is very helpful.",
    "An introduction to the skills needed to read, understand, and create music in the western art tradition. I think it was a great introduction for someone who has some musical exposure but does not necessarily know how chords or harmonies are structured."
