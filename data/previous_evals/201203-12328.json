    "This is a really essential class for anyone who plans to advance their musical studies. Prof. Friedmann is INCREDIBLE, brilliant, inspiring, and hilarious--- it is truly a privilege to study with him. The workload is very manageable, but be prepared to work regularly--- this is not a class you can cram for, as it takes time for something to sink into your ear. GO TO OFFICE HOURS. Go all the time. Every week. They're incredible.",
    "This is a great class for musicians or music majors. It will make you a much better listener and a much more informed musician. Professor Friedmann is a wonderful teacher; I would recommend any of his classes.",
    "A great course if you enjoy ear training. The material does get a bit tricky towards the end, but nothing unmanageable. Prof. Friedmann is great and if anything, take this just to have a class with him!",
    "You learn how to navigate 20th century music in a new way. What surprised me was how much this influences my conception of how to perform 20th c music, as well as how to analyze and understand it.",
    "Great class, will really help with listening to 20th century music.",
    "Friedmann is both brilliant and occasionally overbearingly intense. This class is intriguing and you will learn a lot (his method works very well), but it ultimately wasn't the best thing for me emotionally.",
    "This course is basically an implementation of the system of ear training Professor Friedmann came up with. I found it very effective in familiarizing me with a very wide range of the types of sonorities used in atonal music that are not familiar from studying classical and 19th-century music theory. The course also taught me to understand and be able to generate inversions and transpositions of melodic fragments. Most importantly, Professor Friedmann explains how pieces of atonal melodies can be united by or structured on a common sonority, or a sonority that is projected by the other musical indicators in the melody, which gave me a way of latching on and being able to \"follow\" some kind of structure or uniting force in atonal music. I also learned to really lovethe particular melodies and pieces we studied in the class. Professor Friedmann is an incredibly knowledgeable, effective, and entertaining teacher, and he assigns clear and doable ear-training exercises and is explicit about his expectations of what skills you should be developing. If you want to learn about set classes and gain some insight on ways of hearing the structure and beauty of atonal music (mostly Schoenberg , Bartok, and Stravinsky), take the class!"
