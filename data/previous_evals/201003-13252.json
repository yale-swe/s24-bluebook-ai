    "Good course, with a fair amount of reading",
    "Decent intorduction ot plitics and economy of modern Africa as it relates to the rest of the world. You'll be bored out of your mind if you have no interest in any of these topics, but if you are its a good class to get your barrings in.",
    "Four units on Africa in international relations: colonialism\/decolonization, the Congo wars, the African Union, and China into Africa. All of these subjects are worth understanding if you are a political science or international relations major, and they also make you a better citizen of the world. I took this class for my major and for self-improvement and definitely was satisfied with its capacity in both.",
    "This course deals primarily with the Congo Wars, the OAU and the AU, and China's role in Africa. I would certainly recommend this class. It focuses on interesting, relevant material, and it is taught by a great professor.",
    "Take it. An interesting look at Africa from a lens you may not have been exposed to.",
    "Great class to take if interested in Africa or in international relations in general. Not too much work but interesting assignments. There is an option to do a term paper as opposed to a final",
    "this class had potential but ultimately fell flat for me. perks are that it's a low-time commitment since you're not forced to the readings because there's no section (which i actually wish we had). after the midterm, i chose to do the paper instead of the final, so lectures were pretty useless. unfortunately, i don't think i came out learning much from the class. i learned more from doing the papers.",
    "This is a very straightforward international relations course and provides a useful introduction to African politics. Grades were determined by a midterm, a final and a 6-8 page paper. The final exam could be substituted with a 15 page paper. Prof. Simon is really nice but sometimes the lectures could feel a little long. Attendance was not mandatory but it was still important to come to class because the lecture slides would not make much sense unless supplemented by class notes. This is definitely a class worth shopping and makes a great addition to an otherwise stressful course schedule.",
    "It is a great course if you want general background on modern Africa. I really liked that it looked at contemporary issues like China in Africa and the Congolese war, it made it more relevant.",
    "It had a hard final",
    "If you are interested in an introductory class about African relations I highly recommend this class but if you simply want a class on african history this might not be the class for you. David Simon teaches from a perspective of African International Relations, not simply historical accounts. It is very enlightening and gives you a new understanding of why Africa is in a state of underdevelopment and the effects of Western countries and China.",
    "it is what it describes itself as",
    "easy take it",
    "Interesting class if you are interested in African affairs. The theorising can be tedious though.",
    "i would recommend this class. really interesting course and you learn a lot of new material. the workload is fairly managable, midterm, short paper and final",
    "PLSC 159 is a good general survey of Africa's historical place in international relations. It is the kind of course that you really decide how much to get out of. I would recommend it to another student as long as they're not looking for anything too specific.",
    "If you are particularly interested in the topic then by all means take it. Most people in the lecture seemed unenthused by the course. I wouldn't recommend the course.",
    "this course covers a variety of topics to provide an intro into the world of african politics. for people who are familiar with african history, development and politics, much of the material will be familiar and perhaps redundant. david simon is a great professor but the class was a lot smaller than the room we were placed in so it made the lecture less interactive or valuable than it could have been. not a difficult course for anyone who is not new to learning about Africa.",
    "Yes, it's a good introduction. Not too much work.",
    "It's an average class. We covered some interesting material, and the workload is very manageable, but lectures are pretty boring, and it can be hard to wake up for a 9 am class that's likely to put you back to sleep.",
    "Would definitely recommend this class to anyone who has even a passing interest in African international relations, both historically and more recently.",
    "def take it if you have an interest in africa and international relations",
    "Only take it if you have a genuine interest in international relations. Also, the work load is not too heavy.",
    "yes. take this class.",
    "Good but not great class. Short overview for someone who has never studied African politics or IR. Never goes into much depth about any topic."
