   "comments": [
    "If you get to take a class with Howard Dean, do it and don't ask questions",
    "If you're interested in American politics and American foreign policy, this is a great class to take. Fascinating exercises and in class discussion lead to really interesting topics that aren't usually discussed in a classroom setting at Yale. Also the class allows for students to really get to know each other, and therefore really learn from different perspectives. Not super academic in terms of close-text readings, but definitely allows for creativity with papers and in discussions.",
    "Discussion-based class with a historical focus on some highlights in presidential foreign policy. Gov. Dean definitely dedicates a lot of energy to his students and makes it a very positive experience!",
    "Great course. Interesting, non-superfluous readings. Great discussions. An amazing professor who goes the extra mile to help you with your papers and engage with his students both in- and outside of class. Manageable work load.",
    "Definitely take it! Very informative and interesting to look at the history of foreign policy and how we should conduct foreign policy today. Governor Dean is great! Highly recommend.",
    "It's like a weekly master'a tea with Dean",
    "The readings were all really great and interesting, and Howard is helpful and interested in talking to students and getting to know them. We had class dinners and Howard was able to make time to talk to anyone who asked, and I really appreciated that. Class discussion was a little unstructured sometimes - he kind of just lets people talk about what's on their mind - which can be both a good or bad thing, depending on the people in your class and how much you personally wanted to focus on the readings. Overall I enjoyed the class!",
    "Another student in class aptly summarized this as a \"book club with Howard Dean\" - take it as a fun fifth class.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class. It's an amazing opportunity. All I would say is make sure you make the most of it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Governor Dean is fantastic and you learn a lot about major foreign policy issues in the past and why they were made. Best course I've taken at Yale.",
    "Governor Dean is one of the nicest and most engaging professors at Yale. He actively improved the class and was extremely generous with his time and feedback. His seminar was already good and should get better as time goes on."
