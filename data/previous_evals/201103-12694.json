   "comments": [
    "The homework for this class is 60% of the class grade, and the assignments are excruciatingly frustrating to complete well. I come from a background of music, learning piano since I was 4. And yet that knowledge of music serves very little purpose for this class. I hated the fact that I would spend hours on assignments only to see that I missed so many points off little details. So take this class with the knowledge that you will be tediously working through assignments.",
    "Music 205 is an interesting course and a good intro to music theory at Yale for someone who has a little to a moderate amount of background knowledge. Unfortunately it is taught rather haphazardly, and it can be hard to know what you're supposed to get out of a particular lesson. Damian was a really nice and incredibly smart teacher, but sometimes his class felt a little bit un-engaging. For a fairly small class it took us quite a long time to get comfortable with each other. The textbook reads like it was written by someone who was snorting crack as he wrote it. Homework assignments are 60% of the grade of the class, which sounds nice, but they are graded fairly harshly, and I wish we had had some small quizzes along the way to boost our grade. I advise anyone who takes the class to go to office hours and get help with the homework. You will get a lot more out of the class that way. Nice teacher, fairly interesting material, but not especially inspiring class overall.",
    "Great class to take if you have some background in music and are looking to deepen your understanding of music theory.",
    "Take it.",
    "Take it if you have background in music theory and want to know more.",
    "Music 205 is worth it. You will leave with a better understanding of the nuances of music theory, better ability to read music (and sight-sing) and greater interest in music. Class is fun and interactive. You get to listen to classical music a lot. However, you need to know a few things. Lots of music theory is very detail oriented, rule heavy and mechanical, and writing four part harmonies is more like doing a math problem than being creative. If you don't get much sleep, listening to classical music will not necessarily keep you awake.",
    "I would recommend Music 205 to a student who has experience playing an instrument but with little to no theory experience. If they have theory experience, the class might move too slowly.",
    "If you have experience in music and want to learn more about it but don't necessarily want to be a music major, TAKE THIS COURSE!! It's a fantastic way to learn more about material that, if you play an instrument, you've been using for years. Even though I'm not a music major, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Take it with Damian if you can.",
    "My instructor was amazing and, in the end, I feel that the class was really useful to me. On the other hand, I know that some people had a different experience because the material covered and the methods used vary widely from teacher to teacher. I would recommend anyone to take this class with Mr. Blattler.",
    "Amazing class! It really enriched my understanding of and appreciation for music. Although the assignments took some time to complete, I had a lot of fun doing them and playing my compositions on the piano. Damian is an amazing instructor! He's extremely understanding and knowledgeable and I would recommend any music course that he might be teaching because he's great!"
