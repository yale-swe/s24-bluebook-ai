   "comments": [
    "Strenghts: . Watching videos in class was helpful. Cohort managed to create a safe and vulnerable environment to discuss sensitive topics and personal experiences. Weaknesses: Not so much emphasis placed on writing. I could have been interesting if one of the classes had been a writing workshop. Having 1-page pieces that the students in the class wrote (could be anonymous or not) and go through it together providing feedback and asking questions. We could have had more time to discuss the videos we watched in class. Or maybe have a couple of minutes after each video to recover, since they had heavy content. Office hours over the phone were a bit discouraging. It was disorganized and it was hard to know what content would be covered in each week. Improvement: Noting on the syllabus which readings are required and which ones are recommended. Setting trips and Yale events as far in advance as possible, so that students can save the date. Key learnings\/takeaways from the clas could have been systematized in some way such as a digital or printed handout or an inphographic.",
    "Learned a ton, and class sessions were always incredibly engaging. The class could have been a bit more organized in terms of assignments.",
    "My favorite aspect of the course was learning more about the strategies Ms. di Giovanni employs when she is reporting, and learning about her field experiences and her takes on current humanitarian crises. In the beginning of the course, we watched a few in-class videos. I would prefer to have had those assigned as \"reading,\" so that we could spend class time discussing. I enjoyed the mock interview exercise - more interactive exercises might have made the course even better. Guest speakers were great. I really enjoyed the last few weeks of in-class presentations.",
    "The course offers students an opportunity to reflect on how to do interviews and write journalistic articles. A strength of the course is the fact that students can choose their topic of interest for projects. Janine Di Giovannis knowledge and strong network iffer great opportunities to students. I find that something that could be improved is the continuity of topics from one class to the other, so students can engage more and study them in more depth."
