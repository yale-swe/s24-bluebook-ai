    "Its a good L5 class with interesting literature and fun discussion. I would definitely recommend it; its not too hard and the topics are easy to talk about and relevant.",
    "yes!",
    "Great class to practice conversational skills, as well as spanish skills in oral and written debate and analysis of more advanced texts, such as magazine articles and short novels. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to take any L5 classes.",
    "Spanish 150 has more reading or writing than you'd expect based on its name. However, it is a great great course and I would definitely recommend it to other students. It really helped my speaking and the panels and discussions were incredibly fun. Moreover, the discussion topics are relevant, important, and very interesting. At first I was annoyed that we read kind of a lot of material, but I ended up enjoying nearly everything we read or wrote or talked about. A great class!",
    "You learn how to speak Spanish, and you do it. A lot. I would recommend it if you have a solid grasp of the spanish language aand would like to iron out the kinks."
