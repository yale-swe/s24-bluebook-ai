    "I would recommend it.",
    "PHAR 502 01 is a course for first years that encourages growth and outlook as a new scientist. Not only does the course introduce a myriad of research topics that a new student may otherwise not be familiar with, but also demands that papers be read critically, and next steps are considered and thought out. It is a very informative and helpful course as a student just starting out their PhD career. I would definitely recommend this to fellow first-years that want to better their critical reading skills of primary literature.",
    "It would really help you prepare to be a researcher."

   "comments": [
    "Improved my critically thinking skills.",
    "Although the work did not necessarily contribute to my dissertation, there were multiple papers that not only allowed me to understand the topics I would be interested in pursuing for my PhD work, but also allowed me to meet multiple professors at the top of their fields and to pick their brains about the field in question. I even chose one particular rotation after working with a PI on deciphering the paper, as I appreciated their mentoring style. The course also helped with increasing my knowledge of multiple types of techniques available that I was otherwise unaware of, and that I will likely employ during my PhD work at Yale."
