   "comments": [
    "This class is a great introduction of American literature from Whitman to Rankine, allowing one to see the very large themes that appear in American literature again and again throughout history. I would hesitantly recommend the class because while the readings were interesting and the discussions appealing, the class was VERY shallow and one will feel that a lot of the reading is pointless, because there is not sufficient time to discuss it. Furthermore, the essays graded by Andrews were very demoralizing as it seemed as if it was impossible to improve and that it was never clear what she wanted from the papers. Even with one on one conversations it still felt as if it was impossible to give her what she wanted and your writing was always trash. I loved writing and literature going into this class, that I was statistically and skill wise very well prepared for, however this class has destroyed my confidence and I no longer can look at my writing with pride or enjoy English classes.",
    "It's a great class if you didn't take a lot of analytical English in high school or you are interested in analytical English in college. That being said, it is still more challenging than even an IB English Lit course, so come prepared to put your nose to the grindstone and work, hard. NOT a bird course but covers American Lit you probably didn't get in high school. Recommended only if you're ready to put in the work.",
    "ENGL 127 is a fantastic course that I would recommend to any student. Exploring the evolving ideas of American Literature in depth has had a pretty profound impact on the way I view literature and the concept of what it means to be an American citizen. I found most of the works on the syllabus to enjoyable, despite the reading load being kind of large at times. Professor Andrews was really helpful in helping me improve my thinking process and writing with regard to literature, and I always appreciated her seminars as being particularly quirky and engaging.",
    "This is way more work than the other introductory English classes. But it is worth while and the teachers are great.",
    "English 127 was a great survey of a very diverse area of literature. Regardless of their major, I think anyone would enjoy this class. The workload was a bit heavy at times - there was a good amount of reading, three essays (2000-3000 words), and some smaller assignments. The extra writing instruction from Professor Andrews was very helpful.",
    "YES definitely take this class. Its a lot of fun the reading list is amazing. You get to look at traditional stuff like Moby Dick and Thoreau as well as modern and contemporary works like Gertrude Stein and Claudia Rankines Citizen. Active class discussion is a big part of the experience too especially with Professor Andrews. I hardly felt time pass. Also, this class really pushes you to develop analytical writing and thinking abilities at the next level. You are faced with bricks like Moby Dick and seemingly indecipherable poetry like Seismosis, and learn to appreciate and unpack them. I feel like the three essays were my first real English essays you have place your paper in an already existing critical discussion and try to make an argument that has not been made before, working both from the texts and other literary critics. Do shop around to see what different professors are like I think the experience would vary a lot. I really liked Prof Andrews she is funny, brilliant, full of energy, really cares about engaging students fully in class discussion, and was always free to meet (even offering Skype meetings if we couldnt make her set office hours). If you get the chance to do this class with her, take it!",
    "This class is a good if you want a real survey of classic American literature. Very fast-paced, but good for those who might lack a background in the more iconic and well-known American authors and works. Class focuses often (but not exclusively) on historical contexts. Lots of reading but good introduction to writing academic analysis of literature.",
    "Lots of reading but very engaging. Somewhat difficult \"intro\" level texts, and overall a pretty large workload."
