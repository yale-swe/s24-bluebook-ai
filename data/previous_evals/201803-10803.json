   "comments": [
    "I learned about Japanese culture through the study of reading, writing, and speaking Japanese.",
    "It was nice to engage with a variety of essays, short stories, and visual media.",
    "Gained a ton of reading comprehension abilities and more advanced grammar skills. I solidified content I learned over the summer at a Japanese language program as well. Overall, I feel like I have come out of the class knowing more Japanese than I did going into it.",
    "Time management, deeper understanding of grammar use, and a greater retention of Kanji and vocabulary",
    "Japanese listening, Speaking, reading, and writing.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge and skill in speaking, reading, and writing in Japanese. This includes a substantial amount of kanji characters, both formal and colloquial grammar constructions, and new vocabulary, among others. The course gave a lot of insight into the nuances of Japanese language usage, as well as Japanese culture as expressed in writing and pop culture.",
    "Developed skills mostly in reading Japanese, starting with a rather simple story to reading a complex essay by an award winning Japanese author. Also got to practice a lot of writing in Japanese and expressing yourself on a lot of interesting topics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought the course was great, but I think that doing more personal opinions and having more dialogue\/discussions would help with my speaking abilities. My speaking got much worse after beginning the class (due to lack of practice), but by the end, I felt comfortable with daily conversation again.",
    "I only wish that the class met a little more often. The class offers a fair amount of reading and writing practice, but not enough speaking practice.",
    "More conversation practice would be very useful! Not just in clinic, but having the ability to record and go over the okasii ways we speak and conjugate verbs would be very helpful, I think. Also - I think having class 3 or even 4 days a week, for shorter amounts of time, would make a lot of sense. More consistent engagement.",
    "This course is great as it is! While I did miss the class and teacher rotations from L1&L2, I understand that limited section availability makes this difficult. The strength of the course was definitely Prof. Stever and the readings! Prof. Stever is a really great instructor who takes the time to fully flesh out grammar and reading nuances in a way that doesn't give the answer right away but also doesn't make you figure it all out on your own. The readings were incredible and are the main thing keeping me motivated to take the next semester of Japanese despite my schedule getting harder. It simply feels great to know that you can read (with guidance) such nuanced, interesting texts.",
    "I would enjoy an L5 class that engaged in more speaking practice. I felt that many times I would learn the assigned grammar for homework, and it would rarely be reinforced in class. However, the class kept students extremely engaged the entire time, and the small class size allowed for all my questions to be answers.",
    "It was very good.",
    "The course is strong in my opinion because of the level of challenge and information it provides, despite its approachability. The workload was heavy, but designed carefully to be not only manageable, but evenly spread throughout all areas of language learning. In class, discussion was productive and well-guided by the teacher, switching between both diverse topics and teaching exercises to keep class engaging. The use of digital media and interesting and fun pieces of writing were great choices. Despite the amount and severity of the work, expectations were accordingly clear-cut. Where flexibility existed, it was made clear and understanding of student needs and different skill-levels. But otherwise, the workload, syllabus, feedback, etc. were all made very clear by the teacher, making the work flow accessible and reliable. I do not have any suggestions for improvement.",
    "Strengths: reading and writing passages. get to also practice how to debate in Japanese and the senseis are really helpful and there's a strict structure so you know what's happing every class and for homework Weaknesses: a lot of homework and after studying in Japan and coming back to this class my speaking level is not where it was in the summer"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course because it helps you maintain Japanese practice, as well as teaches some interesting perspectives of culture. Also, the quality of teachers in the Japanese department is always phenomenal.",
    "Yes! If you want to Japanese after L4, this is literally the only course for you.",
    "I definitely recommend this to anyone in a position to take L5. Just come into it knowing that the emphasis is on reading comprehension over speaking ability (or this was my impression, at least). I was fine with this. I actually prefer reading practice over extensive speaking practice, but many other students who wanted to improve their conversational abilities found that there were not as many opportunities to do so. Even so, I'd say go for it. Prof. Stever is wonderful, the readings are really eye-opening, and the class is incredibly rewarding.",
    "Yes. It is good for someone who want to go further in Japanese.",
    "In my opinion, for students invested in studying Japanese, this course is perfect. It is well-rounded, engaging, and combines a healthy sense of difficulty with understanding teachers and policies as well as clear-cut expectations. Despite coming in as a first-year, I was accommodated, yet challenged, and I am very appreciative that I was encouraged to take this level by the department.",
    "Yes because the material is interesting and exposes you to a range of Japanese media and writing. Speaking practice is sparse though since the class is only 2 days a week and if you dont volunteer to talk they won't make you speak."
