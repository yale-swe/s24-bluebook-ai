    "If you get into this class, take it. It's a must-take for anyone interested in writing, for anyone who thinks that they're writing is good -- Klinkenborg will make it infinitely better, and you'll have a ton of fun along the way. Everyone writes a piece every week, but there are no assignments -- you write about whatever you want. Then you read everyone else's piece, and he picks two to discuss in-depth during class. The readings he assigns are also incredible. The work load is constant, but manageable, and if you truly love to write it doesn't seem like work at all. I wish I had taken this earlier, because it's completely changed the way I approach writing. Everyone should apply and if you get the opportunity, take it.",
    "Genre of the Sentence was an amazing training in how to write clearly, concisely, and stylishly (don't be put off by its highfalutin title; the title simply refers to the fact that we focused on breaking pieces down sentence by sentence.) It featured an excellent balance of writing, editing, reading great authors' work, critiquing fellow students' writing, and being critiqued in turn. Verlyn is a wise, perceptive, and humane teacher, and going to office hours and seminar were weekly pleasures. My writing unquestionably improved over the course of the semester, and I learned things about writing and life that I will take with me forever. If you have the opportunity to take Genre of the Sentence, don't hesitate!",
    "Great class. Verlyn is an awesome writer and chalk-full of advice. He spends the first part of class just asking if anyone has any concerns\/questions\/etc so you get advice when the problems arise, not just randomly. You write a piece a week, which compared to the workload of all other classes, is pretty doable. You get good feedback on each piece if you go to office hours and it's also pretty instructive to be able to read everyone else's pieces too! Take it if you get in.",
    "If you want to be a better writer, take this course. Simple. It makes your so much more aware of what you're saying and how you say it. You need to be okay with criticism, because your writing will be evaluated by everyone in the class. It is humbling but also foritfying.",
    "Definitely recommend it for pretty much anyone who is interested in writing!",
    "Absolutely. Even if you're going to move to Bolivia and never write another word in English, Verlyn Klinkeborg will help you become a more perceptive, thoughtful person. But you're not going to Bolivia, so also take this class to become a better writer, in whatever field you choose.",
    "A YES. This class will make you rethink your entire writing process only to realize you knew exactly what you were doing all along. Most importantly, you write write write - so much content. You'll write at least 2 pages a week (about ANY topic!), submit and get detailed line by line notes. Valuable at any level - I haven't taken Daily Themes but I imagine this to be a \"weekly themes\" type class, with the value of a seminar.",
    "Verlyn's class didn't feel like a class. It was more like a study in what it means to be alive, noticing. I feel more aware as a writer. More aware of the sentences that aren't working. More aware of the importance of creating sentences in your head. More aware of the fact that everything about a piece's structure is optional until the moment you submit it. More aware of the fact that every essay has multiple beginnings. More aware of the importance of writing through the ending. More aware of the fact that writing does not mean sitting down in front of a blank computer screen. It means going out into the world and exploring! Verlyn's lessons will stay with me for a long time.",

    "An incredible writing seminar. Each week, you'll be assigned a piece to read (often short), as well as a 2 page piece on literally whatever you want. It's a low-stress format that allows you the freedom to really explore and challenge yourself. It's one of those \"you get what you give\" things. Absolutely take this if you can."
