    "I would recommend the course to others only if he\/she were interested in qualitative method. You have to devote your time for interviewing others during semester and it's quite demanding.",
    "Great methods class for those interested in ethnography and interviews. Recommended.",
    "No. I realized that the how to of fieldwork cannot be taught.",
    "I would not recommend it as it was taught this semester. I did not learn much from it.although some changes are needed, the design of the course is quite good. the implementation very poor.",
    "I would recommend it in theory but with the warning that you may not get as many technical skills as you might hope for out of the class.",
    "A good workshop for practicing field research techniques. Yes, I would recommend the class."

   "comments": [
    "There are plenty of courses on quantitative method but only few on qualitative method. By taking this course I was able to know what qualitative research is and what I should do for qualitative research.",
    "Learned a lot about a new method.",
    "It did not contribute at all.",
    "in my opinion a course in qualitative methodology is an essential component in the formation of a political science student.rather than teaching students how to do research, however, this course was in practice a repetitive discussion of what potential benefits qualitative work brings to a research. the analysis of the pros and cons between qualitative and quantitative methods was the central discussion of at least three classes. this topic seems more appropriate for an undergraduate introductory course. it should occupy only alimited space (and possibly at the beginning of the course, not at the end) within the broader context of a course that instead should focus on how exactly that should be done. unfortunately, the discussion remained at the initial superficial level without ever delving into the epistemological and practical intricacies of how to develop a rigorous research based on qualitative methods.this missed opportunity has the potential to leave significant lacunae in a student's formation. also, this is quite problematic given that this course is considered to be the filed seminar for a field specialization.",
    "The project for this class was a good way to think through in advance many different concerns I might encounter dong field research. In this regard it was very useful.",
    "This course was very helpful in developing my understanding of how qualitative research may fit into my own program and dissertation."
