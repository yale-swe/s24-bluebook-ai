    "Do it! You cover a really cool range of international econ topics (agricultural subsidies, free trade, NAFTA, exchange rates, the Asian crisis, the Euro...), and from what I've heard about other macro-ish courses, this is a much more interesting way to learn the material. The workload is also very light - 40 pages of reading\/week, 4 short response papers, and a final paper. (I don't know why people claim it's so hard in earlier years' evaluations.) The professor is mildly eccentric, to say the least, but such a smart guy and he really cares about his students. Having a good group of people in the class is actually crucial to this class being good, though, so if you shop it and it's a silent\/obnoxious group, stay away.",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "great class! if you are interested in either economics or international finance you should definitely take this class.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in international trade, trade agreement and emerging economies.",
    "Good seminar that will give you a solid background in international trade and finance theory. Reading load is moderate, have to give 1 - 2 presentation on a paper, and write 4 3-6 page reviews of readings for the course, in addition to a final paper. No exams though.",
    "It reviews international econ questions (trade, NAFTA, currency regimes, capital controls) through readings from 2-3 journal articles a week (they're paired with two books but we rarely brought them up in discussion). The questions are interesting and the papers accessible. Be cautioned though that neither the papers nor class comments are particularly technical, though I generally found the dicussions illuminating.Towards the end of the semestes our discussions became far too tied to the papers: we would spend all class following a student presentation as we went through every step of the paper we had read. That said, it's a good class in a current and important area.Reviews from previous years made the course seem like more work than it is. You have to write 4 review papers (3-6 pages, but edging towards 6) of an article in light of a few other articles, but these were not that bad. One or two presentations a semester required making a two-page outline, but this was more tedious than challenging. The final paper can become quite long and I'd encourage seeking his help early. Listing it out, it again seems like a lot of work, but over the semester it never felt like much."
