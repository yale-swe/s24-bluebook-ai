    "Professor Ganssle is great, but he sometimes goes with the flow of the most vocal students such that you may be confused.",
    "Of course you should take it! It's in Directed Studies, which is the greatest thing ever!",
    "AMAZING",
    "Take it.",
    "The second semester of philosophy is definitely more manageable than the first, with the exclusion of Kant (anybody who says they understood anything from the Critique of Pure Reason upon reading it, before lecture or class, is a flat-out liar). Most of the works are much more interesting, and definitely easier to read than Aristotle was first semester. People who like debating philosophy will probably love this class. Also, Professor Ganssle is AMAZING.",
    "Absolutely recommended.",
    "Yes. This is a great intro course to potential philosophy majors.",
    "Hell yes, if you like philosophy and are willing to engage sometimes abstract or complicated ideas. Be prepared to struggle over Kant's syntax and Kierkegaard's sheer profundity.",
    "A good overview of western philosophy that covered all the big thinkers you need to know.",
    "DS Philosophy with Professor Ganssle is absolutely fantastic! Dr. Ganssle (or Greg, as he insists you call him), is both incredibly down-to-earth and extremely knowledgeable. He does a great job leading seminar and is also very helpful during office hours. Sure, this class isn't easy -- Kant's Critique of Pure Reason is no walk in the park -- but it's definitely worthwhile!",
    "TAKE IT."
