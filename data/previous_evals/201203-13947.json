   "comments": [
    "Interesting course but better structuring needed to improve the learning experience",
    "I think that some of the assigned readings were innappropriate. They were far too technical for the typical MPH student to understand, especially considering that this class was almost all first years.The instructors were definitely tough graders. For example, on the midterm, when asked to provide a plausible explanation for why some forms of birth control increase the risk of HIV transmission in discordant couples,Me: Perhaps hormonal contraceptives alter the vaginal environmentInstructor's response: HOW? (with points deducted)How am I suppossed to know how? I'm not a biologist or a clinician. All I know about HIV is what you've taught me.",
    "Good course overall - I like the way it was run, with a lot of time devoted to interaction and breakout groups, and critical thinking. I did not particular enjoy the heavy genetic focus of this course.",
    "Interesting topics, although I'm not sure it needs to be two semesters long. Jigsaw groups never really worked in practice, and we often didn't seem to come to a consensus regarding topics discussed in groups. Readings were always really interesting and relevant to class, but sometimes were posted last-minute. Tests did not seem to cover the majority of topics discussed in class, and practice questions were not similar to test questions. Grading on homework and tests sometimes seemed a bit arbitrary.",
    "This was the first year the course was run in this format (jigsaw, presentations), so I'm sure that in a few years the course will become more regular. I personally found the jigsaw format to be helpful, with each group of students reading a particular paper and then presenting the results, as this helped with both literature review and presentation skills. The lectures were more scattered, and the learning was dependent on significant memorization. I wish there had been more structure to the lectures in terms of themes.",
    "The course was good but expectations were lofty. Professors expected students to make incredible jumps to link information. The ability to make these connections comes with experience in the field which many of us do not. Moreover, it was impossible to get full credit on assignments or exams because of these lofty expectations.",
    "Strengths: the topics were very interesting and the combination of normal lectures and group analysis of journals allowed for a novel way of analysis.Weaknesses: in some cases, the objectives of the assignments were not very specific and created a little confusion as to what was the goal of the project.",
    "The course was very interesting. I felt like I learned a lot.",
    "Heavily focused on global initiatives, public health oriented, and not biologically focused. Emphasized epidemiology on the exams but focused more on the biology during lectures. Group jigsaw were not as effective as they could have been. Instead might consider having pairs of students signing up for a topic and presenting about the article(s) for that class in conjunction with the lecture provided by the instructor.",
    "Loved the content.",
    "I loved this class and learned so much about infectious diseases, not only from a biological standpoint, but also from a public health perspective.I really liked how the learning objectives of each lecture were presented at the beginning of each lecture.I was frustrated by the grading of homeworks and exams. Homeworks and exams were open ended, so it was difficult to figure out what Melinda and Jamie were expecting us to include in our answers. I think they had very specific expectations and we had no guidance in what they were looking for.",
    "Jigsaw groups were a little disjointed and confusing. Lectures were great but sometimes moved two quickly, I often had to go back to the slides on my own and reread material and teach myself.",
    "This course was very engaging. The presentation of the material is clear, the tests are fair, and the homework and groupwork was interesting.",
    "I liked the structure of the course and feel like I learned a lot.",
    "This was a great course for students interested in infectious disease epidemiology. I enjoyed the bi-weekly homework assignments and I found the readings very interesting. I liked the jig-saw group idea but sometimes I felt like students didn't want to participate. Maybe the jig-saw group idea could be reorganized so that students are encouraged to participate more. Overall, I learned a lot of useful information about infectious diseases and some of that information even affected my personal lifestyle choices as well.",
    "Very interesting and well applied to epi.",
    "This is a very interesting course. I liked the topics covered and the speed with which we covered them. The jigsaw was not that great. I think I prefer learning from an expert, my professor, over my peers. There were several creative homework assignments that were actually fun and engaging. Others were somewhat bland.",
    "This course is very helpful in providing an overview of relevant infectious diseases. Providing articles to read by group and discussion in class was helpful to integrate, understand and evaluate information in the readings. I think going over some of the homework in class to discuss what other classmates would propose would be interesting and beneficial.",
    "This was a fascinating course that was taught in a well paced and engaging manner.",
    "STRENGTHS: We covered a lot of content in class, but I think I got the main concepts out of all of the information because they were reinforced throughout the semester. The lectures were engaging. I also thought the exams were fair assessments and offered a chance for students to write about what they had learned without requesting unnecessary specific details. WEAKNESSES: I did not like the jigsaw assignments at the start of the semester. However, I enjoyed the group work when the structure was amended to include lecture time on the readings for the jigsaw groups. That way I was sure to have acquired all the necessary information from the readings and could then focus on the group discussion portion. I did not find the written assignments to be extremely helpful. A couple were useful for review of concepts, but otherwise, I did not feel I got much out of them. IMPROVEMENTS: I do not have a very strong background in biology and found it a little difficult to do some of the readings and follow some of the lectures. It would have been useful to have been provided with some summer reading (i.e. chapters from the textbook) so that I would have been more comfortable with some of the terminologyand concepts at the start of the semester. I guess I was not prepared for how biology heavy the course would be.",
    "This was a strong course that provide me a solid foundation in the topic of infectious disease epidemiology."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Makes the class interesting and interactive with Jigsaws and other interesting activities.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Melinda was hilarious and knowledgeable. She stressed interaction and understanding of broad concepts\/their application, which helped keep the work we were doing relevant.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Very knowledgeable and approachable; helpful powerpoints and questions throughout lectures; went over complex biological processes sometimes too quickly",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Funny, light-hearted, but a little disorganized when it comes to lecture. I do believe that a restructuring of the class schedule (perhaps with section) would allow for a better classroom experience. All lecture or allgroupwork is not a successful strategy.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0She was great and knowledgeable. Jaime Childs also taught a few lectures. His lectures were very hard to follow. Information in them was very disconnected and detailed at a level way about the students.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr. Pettigrew was an excellent instructor who molded the schedule to allow the exploration of diseases according to the diversity of interests in our class. Her lectures provided good biological background, but also tied in with many of our additional courses.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr. Pettigrew was very thorough and made the class interesting and enjoyable. At times she was a little fast in reviewing material, but was always available to clarify missed points. I really enjoyed having Dr. Pettigrew as my instructor!",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Good. Concise. Talked quickly and sometimes flew over mechanisms even though they were important for understanding how the pathogen is transmitted and furthermore how this affects the epidemiology of the disease.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr. Pettigrew was great, made the subject material easy to understand and was always available after class to answer questions.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Melinda was a fabulous instructor! She was very clear in her lectures and responsive to student feedback. I really enjoyed being a student in her class.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Smart and engaging.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Presented the material in a very clear way. Great professor!",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr Pettigrew is a great teacher. She did a great job of explaining the course materials and she always had a response for students' questions. She also did a good job of engaging everyone in the class and she found ways to make the class more interesting and enjoyable for us.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Great!",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0She is a very good lecturer and extremely knowledgeable on all of the subjects covered. Where she wasn't as knowledgeable, Dr. Childs filled in. Together they built a great entry level course into infectious diseases.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr. Pettigrew is organized and clear in her classes. Her strength is that she encourages students to analyze and think about possible solutions and causes of disease, not just memorize what is known about them.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Professor Pettigrew was responsive and engaging. Wonderful instructor.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr. Pettigrew is a very enthusiastic instructor who is able to present a lot of complicated information in a very structured way. She can be a little intimidating, but she also seems to really enjoy teaching and having discussions with her students during class. She also is very happy to answer questions and explain anything further that is not clear.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0The instructor provided strong lectures and was responsive to students questions. She fostered demanding discussions that greatly added to the course"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Great introduction to a BROAD range of infectious diseases - very genetic-heavy, however.",
    "I would recommend it as a broad overview of several globally important infectious diseases. A background in biology is necessary.",
    "Although a requirement for EMD students, this course would certainly be appealing to many MPH students who want to understand diseases better, and wish to have more detailed discussions about journals, both in understanding their content, and finding the strengths and weaknesses within them.",
    "I would recommend the course. It was very interesting and I felt like a learned a lot about different diseases and pathogens.",
    "Yes, interesting but actually more of an epidemiology of infectious disease course rather than principles of infectious diseases course since the focus is not on the biological factors of disease. A lot of material covered.",
    "Great class that explores the interface between the biology and public health considerations of infectious diseases.",
    "I don't really think this course needs to be two semesters long.",
    "very useful course, would definitely recommend!",
    "This is a great course and the perfect introduction to infectious disease epidemiology. I would recommend this course to another student because I learned so much information that I can see myself applying to a future career in public health.",
    "I would highly recommend this course",
    "great class if you are interested in infectious diseases. Taught at a fast pace, but the material is fascinating and the principles you learn agree useful.",
    "I would recommend this course primarily to students who have a strong interest in learning more about infectious disease and who have a strong biology background. It is possible to take the course if you do not have a strong biology background, like me, but that certainly makes it much more difficult to do the readings and follow along during the lectures. The course content was very interesting though, and Dr. Pettigrew and Dr. Child had a lot of personal experience and knowledge to add."
