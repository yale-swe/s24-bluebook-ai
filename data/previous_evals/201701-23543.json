    "This is an absolutely necessary course for all FES students - especially because we take a lot of courses that have group project components. This should be a mandatory part of the curriculum - it has really helped me figure out how I work best and how to work well with others.",
    "Too much reflection homework. I ran out of things to reflect on later. Homework can have more variety. Maybe we can read more real cases\/do more case analysis than writing reflections.",
    "Great change of pace from other data\/research heavy courses. This was about the soft skills that many of us were lacking or didn't know how to unlock\/uncover. Really did like this class even though some of the sessions were repetitive or uninteresting.",
    "Everyone pursuing a master's degree at a professional school should take this course or something comparable. I'm an MESc candidate, and I am truly relieved that I fit this into my schedule. It ended up being one of the best classes I've had at FES. We often fail to make time for \"soft skills,\" yet those are the skills that frequently matter most. I am grateful for the teachers in this course, and I am grateful for the course itself.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes. I went to it on day 1 mostly because it didn't conflict with others during shopping period, and was expecting to drop, but it was so incredibly well-planned and thought-out. There was a lot of work put into this class, and it showed.",
    "This was an incredibly valuable course, however it was strongest in the first half of the semester. The course is new and still being tweaked, so I think one area for improvement is making the second half as strong as the first. The guest speakers and case studies were very heavy on the SOM\/management side of things, and sometimes were just not that engaging. However, overall the class was definitely worth taking, especially for a student about to graduate and thinking about their next steps.",
    "The course touches on wonderful areas and topics anyone training to be a professional should get educated on. However, I think the assignments could be structured in a more interesting manner. At the end of each module we presented a write-up based on the topics taught in any particular module. This felt repetitive with time, and I found myself not feeling intrigued enough. For future years, switching up the type of assignments, from written to even practical (like interview 10 peers on their take on a topic, and juxtapose that against yours in a paper) might be a great way to keep things exciting.",
    "WE NEED THIS CLASS. I was blown away by how thoughtful the teaching team was and how valuable this course was. Working with people, building relationships and understanding ourselves and how we work with others is absolutely critical to the success of students and to the functioning of organizations that carry out the critical missions of the environmental movement. If we keep pretending that these skills are soft, or can't be taught, or are about personality that you either have or don't, the people who are bad at this stuff will just always be bad at it and the people who are adept will continue to have more influence than their expertise always warrants. This class was the only class I took that takes a critical approach to working better in teams even as the MAJORITY of my other classes require semester-long in depth team work as a requirement. We need this class and more like it to be more successful in our careers and in our time at FES.",
    "The course is extremely relevant. Just attending lectures and having discussions around it was very helpful for different aspects of my academic, professional and personal development. I do think it could be improved, but it helped a lot even during this first run. During work meetings, I find myself wishing everyone in my team would have taken this class."

    "The early sessions were really magical. Learning about ourselves and others, listening to people, understanding how teams work. That was like a shot in the arm at 8:30 in the morning, and that's the stuff that I'll carry with me to other parts of my life.",
    "Deep dives on management research\/theory and how to apply- real meat\/content that clarifies skills\/where to focus that aren't as subjective\/dependent on individuals as case studies- like Amy W's lectures, plus opportunities to put into practice through simulations and exercises.",
    "It brings professors from SOM and practitioners from outside the school, thus, it brings very practical skills.",
    "The first module was incredibly valuable, particularly the opportunity to reflect on our individual strengths through the Insights Discovery Profile and the Reflected Best Self exercise. Hearing from speakers with a vast array of practical experience leading and managing teams was also extremely valuable. In my opinion, Indy, Amy W, Heidi, Michelle Bell, Peter Boyd, Jen Molnar, and Rodrigo offered the most focused, applied experience for FES students delivered very effectively.",
    "The best aspects of the course were learning about and understanding professional development skills as they apply to working as part of a team and within organizations. I also enjoyed group exercises during which classmates shared various perspectives on course topics.",
    "I liked how we explored a variety of subjects and got exposure to SOM professors, simulations, and highlights from the best SOM courses",
    "usefulness of concepts taught & the practical applications via simulations",
    "The structure of the course covering intra personal, interpersonal, organizational and network aspects of working with people made the contents clear and easy to follow. Reflection papers were great, although one less of them would be appreciated.",
    "I learned something new about myself, my peers, and the world around me every single class period. That's really unheard of in my realm of study. I frequently learn facts about the natural world, but I rarely take the time to reflect on myself or the people I interact with. This course provided time for that reflection in a guided way, and that was only the beginning.",
    "gust speakers and exercises from SOM",
    "Each module built on the previous one in a constructive manner. Some classes lose their steam mid-way through a semester. This one did not.",
    "This is the first class in FES to address these types of topics. Many speakers came in from varying backgrounds. Also, the reflected best self exercise helped me gain self confidence in my career path by highlighting the aspects that I am good at.",
    "All the lecturers and students are engaged and sincere, which sets an example for the theme of the class.",
    "Curated guest lectures, individual personality profile assessments, ability to reflect and connect to your past\/current\/future work",
    "The beginning of the course was fantastic, up to the \"change management\" section. In class simulations were great.",
    "The class provided me the time to explore my strengths, weaknesses, future career goals, and leadership style. It exposed me to different cases of how people collaborate and communicate to work on environmental challenges. Overall the class gave me the space to reflect and learn about some of the most important things that we often fail to discuss or think about-- how to work with people. Some of the highlights of this course were the reflected best self exercise and the discovery insights profile, the change management simulations, Jen Molnar's talk, Peter Boy'ds talk, Amy's talks, and the final reflection paper.",
    "I really enjoyed the wide variety of speakers that were brought in to the class. It was great to hear from people with all sorts of different real life experience.",
    "The conscious structuring going from personal to team-level. It made for a great building of the course.",
    "The topics and materials chosen, also the guest lecturers were great - but the work done by the teaching-team knitting it all together was the most important part. Also, the role played by students participating in the class is crucial. We had a very good class."

   "comments": [
    "The last module seemed less cohesive compared to the other modules.",
    "The final session on navigating across orgs didn't have quite the same vitality as the earlier sessions. Maybe it had to do with the lecturers, or maybe that it was pretty close to the within orgs section thematically.",
    "Paper assignments became repetitive- possible to mix up with case studies, group projects, etc.? Case study curation to be sure reflections match overarching takeaways rather than individual experiences could be helpful. More serious grappling with data and strategies on race\/gender\/etc., and not just how to navigate as someone from a less favored group, but how to check biases to be more effective if you are in a more favored group. Pre-class reading reflections\/participation rather than post-class reflections\/participation to ensure people prepared.",
    "I think the last module needs further refinement. I did not see how a lesson on mission-driven organizations fit within the leading across organizations module, and I didn't think the Herman Miller case was the best choice for that module, either. I know it's a large class, but I think it would be helpful to take some time once shopping period is over to understand who is in the room and get to know each other's backgrounds to facilitate class discussion and breakout sessions (and to facilitate first years and second years getting to know each other - difficult to do at FES). Some of the case study class sessions felt over-facilitated by the teaching staff. The question tool was a good idea, but with several of the speakers (Jen Molnar and Murali), we didn't get to many of the questions on the tool and didn't even have time for students in the room to ask questions. It felt like there was missed opportunity to have students drive the discussion and take advantage of an opportunity to ask questions of these experts because of too many questions \/ too-structured of a session by the teaching staff.",
    "I believe we spent too much time on some course topics, including how to be an effective listener. I thought almost 3 course sessions on this one subject was too many and that students would have benefited from more discussion regarding conflict resolution.",
    "It might be nice to have end-of-module summaries to more explicitly capture takeaways from each module",
    "response paper at the end of the course",
    "Given that the course is about working with people, I think we could have had more practical exercises on this matter. I remember the group synergies exercise as one of the most valuable ones I have had in school. Why not trying to have more of this kind of exercises in all modules?",
    "I did not enjoy the final module quite as fully as the rest. The content was good, but it could have been delivered more directly during a few class periods. This is a small critique--it's difficult to find any fault with the course at all without really pausing to think.",
    "I didn't find the final units as relevant to me.",
    "Perhaps rather than aiming to incentivize participation or use of the question tool, switching up these types of asks with exercises similar to the reflected best self, simulations, short answers or other assessments. Perhaps this is my bias, but I didn't get the sense that folks were stifled from speaking during the lectures themselves, so I don't see the question tool as critically necessary from a participation standpoint, though it was indeed quite useful to go back and see the responses.",
    "I think perhaps only having the course once a week would be good.",
    "The classes near the beginning were excellent but near the end they lost their potency. I think to aid in this, the guests could use some more guidance in terms of key points to cover. Also, the course focuses on working with people when you are a manager which is very useful but I think it would be insightful to also learn about or at least have some lectures discuss important aspects when you are not the manager or in charge.",
    "Maybe it's the session design, because some of them may be distant from students who have little working experiences.",
    "Very little. This was an excellent course. The online discussion board was not super effective, and I think the module summary days could get a little slow \/ repetitive, but other than that everything ran incredibly smoothly.",
    "I would re-structure the reflection papers after each module. It was sometimes hard to think back to how what we learned would have been useful. Perhaps you could give people the option to just discuss what takeaways were most valuable to them and why.",
    "The reflection papers, while useful, were also somewhat repetitive, so there might be better ways to synthesize what we learned.",
    "Too many reflection papers. The prompts made it difficult for someone with limited or no work experience prior to attending FES to respond. The class size was too large to effectively facilitate discussion. Sections separate from the main class time would be helpful in the future.",
    "The nature of homeworks. Would be great to not have just written submissions, but something more practical.",
    "Maybe reinforcing basic concepts that everyone should take home; although providing a very free learning environment was good in itself."

    "Yes, although we'll see how much I'm able to use them in the professional world at this stage in my",
    "Generally yes, the course met my expectations. I certainly have a stronger theoretic background on aspects to consider when working within large organizations or leading teams. Something unexpected was the final module on working across organizations, which I found makes a lot of connections with systems thinking.",
    "Yes, but this course far exceeded my expectations.",
    "yea!",
    "Yes, very much so!",
    "This is a new class so considering it is new, I thought it was great. There are some issues with making sure speakers cover certain key points and that they are presenting tangible guidance. Overall, I am happy with what I learned from this class and I think next year students will learn even more.",
    "It's a little different from my expectations about intercultural communication but it's great because it introduced much more perspectives of working with people, especially in careers.",
    "Yes \/ exceeded",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, absolutely. I learned a lot about how to work well with other people.",
    "Yes!",
    "Exceeded my expectations!",
    "YES. I didn't have very clear expectations, but I unconsciously find myself going back to the lessons of this course continuously through my work."

    "The advantages of group work included exploring diverse perspectives to challenging issues and receiving helpful feedback from my colleagues. The disadvantages of group included working with groups too large to best represent the perspectives of all students in the group.",
    "met new people, learned cleaned listening, great insight from people with varying experience",
    "Group work is essential for this course and in my view should be strengthened in future versions of the class.",
    "I very much enjoyed the table-group discussions that led to whole-group shares. These allowed me to hear new perspectives, and it also helped me feel comfortable sharing my own thoughts in a smaller group before discussing with the whole room. This was very important towards the beginning of the semester, when I felt out of my normal comfort zone at times but very much wanted to participate.",
    "It's the most useful part for me because it provided a new way for the individuals to improve themselves.",
    "We were able to practice the skills we were learning in the different groups, which was helpful, but I think the individual module reflections were key as well."

   "comments": [
    "There's a reason this stuff is central to the SOM core. It's a crucial part of success in any field. Trust that. Also speak up in class",
    "This was the first time to offer this course, but it was very well organized. Definitely worth the time and the money to take this course.",
    "If you have never worked across diverse groups of stakeholders and plan on working in environmental policy I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Take it! You get exposure to simulations and content from the best SOM classes and professors, as well as some interesting guest speakers. Plus there is a lot of opportunity for important self-reflection. Brad and Stu and the teaching fellows really care about making this an extremely useful course, and I would be excited to see how it evolves!",
    "This is a great course for anyone - no matter their focus at FES!",
    "The course takes some contents covered in the SOM core curriculum and condenses these in a way that is both theory-grounded but also practical and engaging. If you are considering working within environmental organizations and don't have any background on working with people, you should take this course as a starting point to cover some of the most essential contents and techniques on knowing yourself, working in teams, navigating within organizations and leading across organizations.",
    "Do it! Really, you will thank yourself later. I don't care if you have to drop another course--you should take this one. Everyone should before gradating. If you're like me, you will learn so many things that you never before considered needing to know. I have realized that very few people ever need to use heavy statistics in their job, or have to know various equations off the top of their head. These things can be learned on the job as the need arises, but \"fundamentals of working with people\" can't be captured through a quick Google search. This is the kind of course that justifies tuition in my mind. I couldn't have learned these things in an effective way on my own, and I would have never been exposed to so many professionals and leaders in the field without taking this course.",
    "Take it. You'll be surprised both at how much you'll get from it, and the extent to which it will impress future employers.",
    "I would take it! The course load is lighter which is great to balance out a heavy schedule but you still learn so much.",
    "Please prepare for each class if you can.",
    "Do it. Even if you think you don't really need it, or you think it feels too 'soft,' it will be 100% worth your while to engage with the lectures and exercises.",
    "Do not write this course off because it is a soft skill or because you may be worried it will be too \"touchy feely.\" No one is forced to share anything they don't want to share. This course gave me the opportunity to reflect on my strengths and weaknesses and future career goals at a critical point in my life.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this class.",
    "You get what you put in. Do the readings without a doubt!",
    "DO IT.",
    "Take it! and let it improve different aspects of your experience without being too invasive."
