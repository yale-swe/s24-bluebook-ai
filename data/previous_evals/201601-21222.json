    "Great class! Elizabeth Miller is amazing - take any class with her and you won't regret it. I liked Reductionism because the subject has so many easy-to see, real-world applications.",
    "This is a great course for thinking deeply about hard topics. I always felt that my understanding would lead to more questions and allow me to realize how complicated the topics at hand were. Despite the difficulty, we had great conversations about challenging but manageable readings, and for anyone who is interested in philosophy in generally (particularly metaphysics), this is an excellent course to learn more about a fascinating topic and to practice listening and talking about philosophy, which I've found is one of the hardest but most valuable skills to have in the field. For those who come from a less philosophical background, the course might be challenging, but the topic is sufficiently deep that most of us had very little experience about what we ended up discussing, so as long as you have an ability to think deeply and critically, I would shop the course and talk to the professor, who is super great.",
    "This is a little known subject for a lot of students at Yale. Although it can get pretty technical if you haven't studied Philosophy, it's a good place to start.",
    "Took the ill-defined topic of reduction, one that's hard to parse, and gave me facility in dealing with a lot of the issues related to it. Great readings and discussions. I'm unsure of ways to improve the course--by its nature, reductionism is very confusing."
