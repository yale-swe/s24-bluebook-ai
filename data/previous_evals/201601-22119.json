   "comments": [
    "This was a good course that help one understand how to do research effectively. And the multiple ways to write research: writing an article, a chapter in a book, a dissertation, and a book project.",
    "HIST 736 is a great introduction to \"How to Write a Research Paper,\" and I would highly recommend. You will write a lot, receive a lot of feedback, and be challenged and supported along the way.",
    "I would recommend it. The course is an excellent way to think about research papers, conferences, and doing academic stuff from the ground up. I really enjoyed it.",
    "I would recommend this course as a wonderful opportunity for thinking about large scholarly projects and for practicing writing. This course operates more like a workshop than a seminar, and what you get out of it depends in large part on the time, energy, and seriousness you bring to it. The course structure is fast-paced and rigorous in terms of output, but there is plenty of time and support to pursue challenging and long-term work throughout the semester. The course is oriented around producing a final project that matches the stage of research and writing you are at; it offers an excellent platform for thinking big about your work while also doing the hard, step-by-step work of getting your work on the page with clarity and style. If you are looking for a course to walk you through examples of what history writing is, this is not necessarily the course for you; however, if you have some sense already of work you admire and at least some idea of a project you want to try, this course is a brilliant source of energy and motivation.",
    "I would certainly recommend it! It became more than a required-ish class--it became a community of historians in training.",
    "This course--really the candor and kind guidance of Professors Gilmore and Gage--will have an indelible impact on any student hoping to expand his or her research skills. Furthermore, I would emphasize the significance of classroom chemistry and a strong cohort of fellow students. I found the class encouraged guidance and strong support from my peers and I benefited from their perspectives tremendously. Strongly recommend.",
    "I would describe this course as: \"How to be a Grad Student 101: An intensive research course that aims at producing a research paper, with a number of check-in assignments aimed at developing different professional skills.\"",
    "This is a researcher's dream class in which you can explore a specific topic in a focused and organized manner with two superb practitioners. I would definitely recommend it to another student with the caveat that they not only have a specific project already in mind, but have either already undertaken significant prior research or work with a very discrete source."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "It allowed me to have at least 1 chapter for my thesis.",
    "See above--I think this course was a very helpful in our professionalization as grad students. We considered the role of the article in our scholarly development, and how it ties into other professional activities (research, conferences, definition of the field, etc.).",
    "The course helped me think about an academic life. I have a better sense of what researching and writing are all about. Very good experience!",
    "This course significantly deepened my knowledge of history\/the profession of history, and it contributed significantly to my early stage dissertation research. Glenda and Bev gave us clear, experience-driven advice about writing history and about the work historians do beyond their research and teaching. I feel much more highly informed about the work I want to pursue from the experience of being in this course. Because we were able to work on projects that we were independently interested in, I was able to use the writing in this course to significantly deepen my research and writing on a topic that I hope will have a place in my dissertation.",
    "It got right to the heart of the writing process in an extremely helpful and motivational manner.",
    "This was a dream course for many of the reasons already described. I learned the nuts and bolts of the writing process. I heard many insights into the general state of the field of history. I had the chance to critique (and be critiqued by) my peers. The class highlighted areas for improvement in my approach to research. It also provided the chance to further develop ideas, put some of that research into writing, and identify research gaps (some of which I already knew; some of which I did not)."
