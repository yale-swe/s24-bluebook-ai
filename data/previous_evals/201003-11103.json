    "It's a very good class if one wants to get into Japanese history studies. The syllabus is excellently organized, and Professor Botsman is one of the best men to turn to for great references and guidance. It's easygoing while you can learn a lot from the class.",
    "History 888 is a reading-intensive course. I would recommend it to another student because I learned so much from reading the academic literature that is available in the field, and the final annotated bibliography assignment will also provide me with a helpful tool for further independent studies on areas of Japanese history that are of interest to me. The course is excellent for providing a solid base of knowledge through which to study Japanese history, as well as a general understanding of the academic terrain of the field itself."

   "comments": [
    "It expands my knowledge considerably and provides the fundamental methodology, research background for further studies.",
    "It provided me with a solid foundation in a broad range of areas of study in Tokugawa and Meiji period Japanese history. I read books that dealt with areas I don't have much interest in, such as intellectual history, as well as books that were closer to my area of interest."
