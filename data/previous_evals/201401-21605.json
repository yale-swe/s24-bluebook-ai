    "Only if you like theory or you're a sociology major.",
    "It is a life-changing course. You get exposed to really strong and interesting material.",
    "Take it",
    "This course covers a wide array of theory. I'm not a huge fan of theory, but I still enjoyed the class",
    "Absolutely. This class is fun, and you will look at the world differently upon completing the class. You learn so much about the social realm of humanity, and you realize just how important other people-- whether it be society, a campus group, or the family-- are to your own life. You answer some pretty awesome questions that are often reserved for Philosophy, but, in this class, you don't read boring treatises or hard-to-understand tractuses.",
    "Even if you don't have a background in sociology, or even in the humanities, this class is absolutely wonderful. You have a mix of grade levels and backgrounds (although most people took DS at some point) and the material is accessible and also challenging. The class is really small, and Professor Eyerman really makes an effort to demonstrate how the material is relevant and engages his students.",
    "A wonderful and exciting approach to studying theory."
