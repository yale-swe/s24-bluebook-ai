    "Course was amazing. It covered a range of topics but in a way so that overarching concepts could apply to multiple diseases. I enjoyed that the homework was often based on research articles and how to analyze them. I felt that the course and testing was very application based as opposed to merely memorizing facts about HPV or cholera without any knowledge as to how the biology impacts research, vaccination, populations, history and evolution of disease. Easily that best constructed course I have ever taken. Possibly a little biased because I loved the topics covered. I felt that I'm coming out of the course with knowledge that I can apply to other courses like EPI I and PID II and hopefully my future research.",
    "Great class, it's different than a lot of public health classes that I've taken. It's not just about memorizing epi facts or designing arbitrary interventions. It's focused on looking at current research and seeing how that impacts what we know about diseases and how that affects our response to an outbreak. I think this class was the best at looking at real-world implications for public health issues.",
    "excellent. I really enjoyed how Melinda posed questions at the beginning of class that encouraged critical thinking. It was less about memorizing and more understanding and interpreting. The questions she asked in class were challenging and encouraged discussion. I also really liked the small group exercises when we did them. I would have liked a little bit more unity or cohesiveness as far as the organization of the class went. I sometimes felt we were just jumping from disease to disease. I also really enjoyed the epidemiology and biology pairing, although I liked the epi portion more because I felt like we were just memorizing random things as far as the bio was concerned. The case control portion for studying IDs was really informative.",
    "The professors are great and this class is a very good overview of infectious disease. It made me think in a way a public health official would in regards to an epidemic.",
    "This was an amazing class! I learned so much about different diseases and also a lot about public health practice. Very well taught. The homework were not too hard, but still challenged us and helped to solidify concepts learned in class. Also, the small class size was a plus, as it facilitated discussion.",
    "My favorite class of the semester. It comes across as a lot of information at first, but you pretty quickly adapt and are able to keep up. It definitely helps if you have a biology and chemistry background to some extent as they do glaze over certain topics that because you don't necessarily need to know the details - but it helps if you understand the science behind them. The one weakness is that Professor Pettigrew sometimes speaks too quickly - but she acknowledges this on Day 1, so really don't hesitate to stop her.",
    "Prof. Pettigrew really seems to know the material from both a public health and microbiology perspective. I liked the pathogen of the day style of the course and the sensible progression of material. The study guides for the midterm and final were appreciated as it gave us insight into the big picture questions to keep in mind. Strong public health orientation to the topics covered which is important! Sometimes the delivery and pacing of the material was problematic. Yes, she sometimes zips through a slide too fast. I appreciated the summary boxes on some of the slides and the verbal delivery as well. I think that many of the slides were too busy; whenever they were imported from had extraneous information for our purposes and I wasn't sure what to focus on. Other times the visuals were indecipherable; especially true for Jaime's lectures. Likewise the final had some suspect visuals as well. Unfortunately more time should be spent making these graphics clearer.",
    "I really enjoyed this course! The topics were interesting and relevant and there were great current events examples interspersed throughout. I was expecting there to be more biology in the course, but the biology that was included was very accessible. I loved learning not just about the biology of diseases, but also the policy aspects that public health officials must consider.",
    "The course was fascinating and interactive at different, important stages and helped in better understanding a multitude of diseases. The class was structured well, and the constant questions back and forth kept the learning dynamic even when high in content.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I was a little worried since I'm not in the EMD concentration, however it was a great introductory course. I learned a lot about various infectious diseases and the various contextual issues one must consider when addressing infectious diseases. But you really don't need an extensive background in infectious disease to get a lot out of this course. I do think having some background in biology would prove useful to understand the details of vectors and epigenetics and the like, but Melinda is great at explaining things in a way that is clear and is more than willing to review concepts that are more difficult.",
    "I thought the course was insightful, practical, and a great introduction to infectious disease. PID was not a requirement for me, but I took it because I found that the material was presented in a thoughtful and challenging way. I liked the background readings provided, and the fast pace of the course kept me constantly engaged in understanding these complex pathogens. I think it would have been helpful to have more problem-solving activities in class to better prepare for the kinds of questions asked on exams.",
    "I really enjoyed this class and learned a tremendous amount.",
    "I'm a CDE concentration, but felt like I have a good knowledge base in infectious disease after taking the class. I felt it was very good a establishing a general overview of the issues and pathogens.",
    "Everything is good."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Melinda is great, and I like her sense of humor. Jamie is an excellent role model for mad scientists. His presentation style is too rambly. Two recommendations for Jamie: 1) Work on your blackboard technique. Not writing over your previous writing would be a good start. 2) Make it clearer when you are transitioning between topics in your presentation.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Amazing instructor. Cares that the students understand the concepts and is truly passionate about many of the topics covered and takes an interest in the student's wishes\/ concerns. She comes off a little distant in the beginning but that wears off pretty quickly and she opens up to everyone as she gets to know the students. She's pretty cool\/ relatable to students, I think.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Melinda is so wise. Not the most approachable person, but I feel like she cares about her students and wants us to learn and do well. I would take another class from her anytime, mostly cause I think there's so much I could learn from her and the way she approaches public health.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0excellent. comments above.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Melinda is awesome!",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Great instructor! Good sense of humor and passion about the subject. In PID2, I hope she will sit at the side of the room and make random comments like Jamie did this year.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr. Pettigrew is phenomenal. I love her teaching style. She makes the course relevant and interesting.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0A great instructor that knows the material well - and updates the lectures with pretty current research and news. She acknowledges that she sometimes speaks quickly right on the first day of class, so you really shouldn't be intimidated to ask for clarification on material.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Professor Pettigrew was a great lecturer. The material was well-organized and presented in a straightforward manner. I enjoyed the in-class exercises we did, especially the one where we mapped the hospital epidemic. The lectures could get a bit fast-paced at times, but overall everything was fairly easy to follow.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Bravo",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Professor Pettigrew did a great job in instructing the course and made room enough for students to participate. She made the course interactive and fun and helped to push us to question the info provided.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0I loved Melinda! She was very engaging and made everything very clear and easy to understand. I could tell that she wanted us to understand the material. Her passion for infectious diseases is infectious and made it easy to engage with the material.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0 She was an excellent, knowledgeable, well-prepared professor, cares very much about imparting as much information as possible regarding the subjects that comprised the course material.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr. Pettigrew was a wonderful instructor who was very knowledgable about the course material presented. She was able to use her personal insights and experience to add depth the pathogens we studied. I think she could have made the main or most important features of each pathogen more clear on her slides--at times, I felt we were dwelling on minutia that wasn't particularly relevant or tested upon.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr. Pettigrew is incredibly knowledgable and has a great presence in class. I love that she was confident in the material and also comfortable to acknowledge when she was unsure about something or did not know the answer to a question. I thought her powerpoint presentations were great because they weren't too wordy and required that you actually understand the graphs\/ charts etc. presented.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0She's a very engaging lecturer and explains things very clearly. She does a good job of making sure everyone understands before we move on to a new topic. Sometimes moved quickly through the mechanisms, but we weren't tested over them unless they were emphasized so it wasn't too much of a problem.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Very good."

    "Interesting material, presented well by Melinda, and not so well by Jamie.",
    "Take this course. End of story.",
    "It's a challenging class but I really enjoyed it and would recommend it.",
    "Loved it - I would recommend for people both in EMD and not in EMD. Gives good exposure to a breadth of infectious diseases (albeit some I was less interested in) and helped me gain critical thinking skills. I also thought it complemented epi 505 really well.",
    "Take this course! You won't regret it.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone with a broad interest in infectious diseases, particularly STIs. There is a wealth of knowledge which is applicable to the practice on public health.",
    "This was a great course! We covered a wide range of topics in infectious disease. There wasn't an overwhelming amount of biology involved and what was incorporated was very accessible. I loved learning not just about the biology of diseases, but also the policy aspects that public health officials must consider.",
    "The course was informative but also allowed us to expand our own interaction with the course content, pushing us to learn about the why, how, and benefits\/drawbacks to the initiatives and strategies around diseases we focused on. It was an excellent course.",
    "Principles of Infectious Disease is a great introductory course about Infectious Diseases for anyone wishing to learn more about common infectious diseases, their origins, modes of transmission and sociopolitical contexts.",
    "Need sufficient time to learn the material to be prepared on a weekly basis.",
    "If you are at all interested in infectious disease, this course is a must take. It is comprehensive but not exhaustive and easy to understand even if you do not have a background in IDs. Dr. Pettigrew is interesting and engaging, and the class really teaches you how to think about complex public health issues in many contexts.",
    "Gives an overview of many of the important pathogens and how to study them.",
    "This course is fun and interesting. If you love infectious diseases, then you will probably love this course. If you were a bio major in undergrad, you won't think the science is too hard at all. The instructors and students are all excited about the course material, and the sessions are interactive, which makes it a fun class to attend every week."
