    "French 120 is the logical continuation of French 110. It is essentially the same course but with different topics. If you do want to learn French and have already taken 110 (or I guess if you placed into L2) you should definitely take this class, and try to take it with Ngame. He is an amazing professor and you will not believe your ability to speak, read, write, and understand French at the end of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are serious about learning a language. L2 is a continuation of L1 so you know what to expect as far as the weekly tests go.",
    "It's a fine course. Sometimes all the workbook pages and weekly tests can feel a little monotonous but that comes with pretty much every intro level language courses.",
    "FREN 120 follows much of the same format as FREN 110: video presentations on Tuesday, four days of practice, and tests Monday night. The workload is manageable (especially given the fact that it's a 1.5-credit course) ... maybe even lighter than FREN 110. You leave with a very solid foundation in and comfort with French. Take it!!",
    "This course is a lot of work, but id highly recommend taking it with prof ngame! He is amazing and kind and understanding. Keep on top of your work or it builds up!"
