   "comments": [
    "This really helped me to appreciate all the ways in which you can approach a single topic, namely the human body. There are legal frameworks, medical perspectives, and more that sometimes conflict with one another but combine to form our conceptions of bodies. HUMS 205 also helps you learn how to continue attacking a problem even after it becomes clear that there is no right answer.",
    "I really enjoyed the readings for this course and the way that Dean L encouraged us to look at them together. I think I gained new ways of approaching texts about issues about the body, though I would have preferred to learn more about how to approach them from a legal framework -- the legal end was often glossed over, which is sort of what I wanted out of the class. But I enjoyed thinking about how different arguments related to each other and implied each other. I would have enjoyed more direction on how to write about these issues, but I guess I learned how to think independently about these issues.",
    "I learned a lot about the nature of the human body and about a lot of the issues concerning bodies, most of which I had never really considered before. It was a fantastic introduction to the legal issues binding the body, and I was really excited to be able to consider it from that unique standpoint.",
    "This course is one of those that is completely discussion based. The readings were incredibly interesting and professor Lizarribar knows how to lead an interesting and engaging discussion. Class was very much an open and safe discussion space, which is good given the nature of the topics discussed (gender, race, bioethics, abortion, end of life care, zombies, body modification, etc.) I left being able to think more critically and see more sides to all of these topics\/debates.",
    "The class was really fun! It was definitely really interesting to talk about Supreme Court decisions, theoretical texts, and zombies (!!!), often in the same breath. And the open-endedness of the final paper was really nice, as were the flexible deadlines!!",
    "Conversational skills. Better ability to accept other's opinions. Thinking in new ways.",
    "This class helped me to parse a lot of the nuances of ideas surrounding the body in new and interesting ways--sometimes, at Yale, students are afraid to not have definitive answers to questions, but the most interesting conversations can accompany such gray area. Dean L was so good at picking apart these issues and letting us express our opinions. She was also sensitive to the class's mood, given the unusual political climate this semester, and was always receptive and open to meeting students, despite how busy she is as a dean. I loved this class, and it was my favorite this semester and one of my favorites all of Yale.",
    "Wide variety of topics!",
    "The course gave me the insight to how complicated the concept of the \"body\" can be, and how the ambiguity of that concept then translates into areas that affect us everyday. From Law, medicine, and social dilemmas, are but a few topics that are touched on in class, and I developed skills to look at these issues from multiple angles. The subject matter is also tricky in that often there are no clear answers, so I was forced to think and observe multiple perspectives all at once, which are all skills that are necessary in any discipline."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class discussion sometimes fell heavily on a few students - not sure if everyone else was skipping the readings or if they were just content to listen. I think it could be helpful to pose a question at the start of each class and require everyone to think about it for a few minutes and maybe even write out some of their thoughts. It sometimes felt like Dean L. was posing really interesting questions but the class as a whole didn't really engage with them. Otherwise fantastic class! Really everything else is a strength.",
    "I think the biggest weakness of the class is organization. We would have really engaging texts assigned each week, but the class would sometimes feel disjointed for two key reasons. First, the overall level of class engagement was low and it was rare that all of us were on the same page. Second, the discussions were highly unguided, letting us get on tangents instead of discussing the readings. Especially for tougher texts like Foucault and Hyde, I would have loved more guidance, and that could have really brought the class together. I think that Dean L could hold students to a slightly higher standard to encourage this. A strength is that it is low-stress and enjoyable. Another strength is that it is able to discuss things that a lot of Yale classes don't.",
    "I thought the readings were all really interesting and diverse, and enjoyed doing them (to the extent that I had time to! Sorry for sometimes not being totally prepared. I really did enjoy the course). I would have maybe preferred to spend more time learning about court cases dealing with the body\/reproduction and less on just the general dead body stuff later in the semester. But I thought it was really interesting and loved the flexibility of the final paper (and truly appreciated the flexibility of the deadlines).",
    "The strength of this course was definitely the professor! She was really excellent at moderating classroom discussions, and also really, genuinely cares about each of her students and gets to know each of us individually, both as students and as people. The course could be improved if there were more professors like Lizarribar so they could collectively teach more seminars like this one. It could also potentially be improved if held at a location with more natural light than Bass library?",
    "Readings were amazing! One weakness is that the course organization was different from the syllabus, so it was a little confusing. Also, a huge plus is that professor Lizarribar is the most understanding professor there is, so there were no hard deadlines to not add stress to already stressful weeks.",
    "Its strengths were definitely the diversity of the readings and topics, as well as the way dean L let us shape the direction of class discussion! I only wish there were maybe fewer readings? I only say this because, while it was super interesting to connect different readings, sometimes during discussion it seemed like people had read different things so engaging deeply with one of the texts was a little harder to do in class.",
    "Strength is the subject matter. Potential weakness is not high enough level of engagement with the material. Some of it was glossed over in discussion. The readings were so great and some of the classes didn't do them justice, I don't think.",
    "Dean L was super responsive and flexible while also maintaining high academic standards in the classroom. She always let the class talk it out, and she never pretended to have answers but rather just raised continually interesting questions to the issues we were assigned to discuss. I loved the syllabus, and I loved Dean L.",
    "The strength of the course stemmed from class conversations between students of different backgrounds. As the subject matter was often controversial, it was best suited to the class that provided multiple perspectives to as how the material was interpreted. Also, the readings of the course were varied across all disciplines and engaging so as to really address how complex the \"body\" remains. The multifaceted approach was phenomenal. A weakness would probably be that there was at times too much material to absorb and condense all at once, but I think that also made the class more exciting."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone at all interested in anything to do with the body. We covered everything from reproductive rights and capital punishment, to transabled\/transracial identity and cannibalism. It's provides a unique opportunity for you to discuss those topics (and more!) with students from across various disciplines and a professor who clearly loves the material. The assigned readings and writing assignments will not take up much time, but you will probably find yourself thinking about & discussing the course outside of class often.",
    "The reviews from last year says this course is fun, low-stress, and that you learn a lot. I thought it was pretty fun, very VERY low-stress (one 5-page paper and one 10-page paper, about whatever you want, due whenever you want), and not super engaging in terms of learning. Discussions were often disjointed because student engagement was low, and when students did participate, it was often not based on the readings. It was disappointing in that sense because I think I could've gotten a lot more out of such fun, interesting readings, with just a little bit more guidance or pedagogical intentions. That said, Dean L is so kind, fun, and really wants you to enjoy the class. I really admire her and love her, but this overall taught me that a strong seminar requires that everyone puts in a lot of energy -- and that just isn't the case here.",
    "yes",
    "Take it for a good mix of interesting articles relevant to questions that we've had to increasingly ask ourselves + foundational theoretical arguments situated in law\/literature\/media. The pace\/quality of class discussion is heavily dependent on your classmates, but Dean L usually starts us off with questions (though she really leaves that up to us, that's just how we preferred things.) Papers are fun to write because you have lots of freedom topic-wise!",
    "Great course, even better professor! Dean L is super flexible and receptive to students' needs and interests. Sometimes the readings and lectures could get a little heavy, they were always really interesting. The class felt very welcoming and comfortable, and it was always a nice respite from the stress of the semester.",
    "Yes, Id 100% recommend this class to anyone\/everyone! You should take any class that Dean L. ever teaches, always! She is one of the kindest and most caring professors you will probably ever meet in your entire life, and it is worth taking it just so you get to bask in her presence for a couple of hours every week, she is THAT awesome. She is SO incredibly knowledgeable about all the topics that we covered over the course of the seminar, and would always ask the probing, important questions that I often hadn't considered when I was doing the readings for the class, and kept us on track with the overall themes of the course. Full disclosure, the seminar does tend to get oversubscribed (with a cap at 18 I think), so theres an element of luck involved if youre trying to get in. But if you ever wanted to talk about the history and evolution of zombies, cannibalism cases, whether or not you own your own body, artificial wombs, consent in sex, and\/or the nature of the soul in modernity, and if you want to talk about it with lots of really cool people and an amazing professor in a thoughtful and welcoming space, this is your seminar! (So, like, it's everybody's seminar I guess. See first sentence.)",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE IT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THESE TOPICS!!! SUCH A FUN, LOWKEY, NOT STRESSFUL SEMINAR!!! Dean L is amazing! and the conversations are super interesting!!!! Felt like more of a book club and less of a class! Love love love",
    "Yes! The readings are great (definitely make sure you do them, because you'll get so much more out of discussion!), and Dean L is the best. Dean L is always willing to steer the class in the direction in which the students want it to go, so the more engaged you are, the more you'll get out of it. Also, you can write the papers about (basically) ANYTHING you want, which was really really great.",
    "This class helped me to parse a lot of the nuances of ideas surrounding the body in new and interesting ways--sometimes, at Yale, students are afraid to not have definitive answers to questions, but the most interesting conversations can accompany such gray area. Dean L was so good at picking apart these issues and letting us express our opinions.

She always let the class talk it out, and she never pretended to have answers but rather just raised continually interesting questions to the issues we were assigned to discuss. I loved the syllabus, and I loved Dean L. Take it for Dean L, if for no other reason.",
    "Really great, thought-provoking readings, but I'm not sure I would recommend the class as a whole because discussions weren't structured, which can be either a great or a bad thing. In this case, I felt like a lot of the times it was just classmates who clearly hadn't read expressing half-formed thoughts about whatever they wanted. I felt like discussion wasn't as rewarding as it should have been, which was frustrating. Dean L is great and so nice though, so perhaps worth it to be around someone as warm as her.",
    "Yes absolutely",
    "Yes, if you like talking about the \"body\" in the context of ownership, legal status, ethics, social hierarchy, medically, corpses, zombies, pop culture, sci-fi,etc..., then please take this course. The professor is amazing, and the subject matter touches on mostly every field so you are able to learn material from all genres and disciplines. The best part, is that the class allows you to engage with what a \"body\" represents with regards to your personal interest. The papers are designed to let you tackle your own questions and to build upon your writing. The class overall is nurturing, and designed to let you succeed at your own pace."
