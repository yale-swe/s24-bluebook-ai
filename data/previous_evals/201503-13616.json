    "I would recommend this class only if you don't care about the quantity of writing.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It's a ton of writing, but you learn a great deal about evaluating NGOs and other anti-poverty programs. It does become repetitive towards the middle because you talk about many similar market failures, but the solutions and studies we discuss are always very different. I loved this class and would recommend it to other econ or even non-econ majors.",
    "Definitely not as gutty as everyone says. Still kind of a gut though, but a mild one at that. Like, you need to put in the work. The readings are pretty interesting. Karlan is a pro in the field. Overall, above average class. Positives are that it's an econ writing credit, and, if you're interested in development econ, Karlan is the guy to go for.",
    "I recommend, you only have 3 writing assignments, a midterm, and the final is optional if you feel you have done well enough on the previous assignments. Also you get a WR credit out of it as well.",
    "I'd recommend this class as a comprehensive view of poverty alleviation methods without a very heavy courseload.",
    "Take it if you're really interested in the material, because that's the only way you'll survive without getting frustrated. Grading is arbitrary and unfocused, the material is poorly organized, and the paper instructions are very vague. I did not take the final because I did well enough on my final paper so don't know what it was like. Just try and write the papers in formulaic fashion - make sure you mention the things that are being looked for, ask your TAs for help and feedback, and you should be okay.",
    "The class is decent overall but needs to be structured a little better. It ends up being just a lecture with no focus on reading the papers - we wrote three papers and a test on material that could have been better taught if we had discussion sections. Prof Karlan isn't the greatest lecturer but is clearly very accomplished. This is not the worst Econ class, and if you don't have a background with Development Economics it'll be fun - although the strong focus on RCTs is a little restrictive in vision. Writing credit and a very very generous curve in the end.",
    "Yes, take it. Do the readings, take the material seriously, if you do, it might just change how you think about dev econ.",
    "As someone who took this for the WR, let me tell you right now this class was not worth it. I wish I could have taken ENGL 120 instead. Somehow from 2014 to 2015, the double spaced requirements changed to single space, so you would be writing roughly 40-50 pages double spaced by the end of the semesters. This is broken down into 1 final 20-30 page paper and 2 10 page papers (double spaced). In addition, there is a midterm exam. Grading is heavily dependent on the TAs, and it was VERY arbitrary. The final is optional if you are satisfied with your grade before that. I'm not sure about the distribution of grades, but it probably follows standard econ curve. After the first month of learning experimental design and evaluation design, I can't say I learned much more. There is really no point in going to class after the midterm if you get the TAs to check your paper. Experimental design is one of those things that you learn in an AP psych class or something, so it's not really worth spending a semester to learn in my opinion. I would not take this class if I had known it was going to be like this. I hated the arbitrary grading, which was so dependent on the TAs and expectations differed from TA to TA. Plus, they were not native English speakers (most of them at least) so it was so absurd for the class to be a writing credit. In summary, didn't learn much, hated class, a lot of meaningless work to please TAs that shouldn't even be grading your paper.",
    "An interesting class that is definitely worth taking. Can recommend for econ majors looking for a class that isn't as math heavy, but still teaches important skills about the field.",
    "Good course overall, though not always taught with the most clarity. Not very writing-heavy for a writing credit, and really no math at all for an Econ class.",
    "There are definitely some pros to taking this course. Professor Karlan is an extremely smart individual who is very well known throughout the world of economic development. He also comes across as a super nice guy in general. It was interesting to read some of his work as well as the work of his colleagues. The class also had a solid reading list with a lot of interesting material. These things aside, I would say the biggest pro to taking this course is that the final is optional, assuming that you are happy with your grade after 3 papers (approximately 6, 7, and 15 pages long, respectively) and a midterm. Very few people end up taking the final if that tells you anything. This was not a particularly difficult course, but it does require a decent amount of hours for each of the papers, especially the 15 pager. On the other hand, there are some severe weaknesses to the course. Unfortunately, I got next to nothing out of attending the lectures. I only went to one or two after the midterm, and all of the people I know did the same. It's sad that everyone I have spoken to about the course says that they do not enjoy the course, and several people have gone as far to say that this is the worst course they've ever had at Yale (juniors and seniors). I definitely do not feel that this was the worst class I've ever had, but it was a source of annoyance and frustration at several points in the semester. Now that I'm on the other side of the class, I can definitely say that I learned quite a bit by taking this class, but it definitely was not an enjoyable learning experience. After reading my above statements, it is possible that one could ask, \"Well if you learned nothing from the lectures then where did you learn everything for this class this semester?\" I learned the bulk of the material in this class from two sources. The first resource that taught me the most in this class is the \"Running Randomized Evaluations\" book (extremely well-written book that forms the foundation for the entire class). It is so clear and explains all of the core concepts of the class in an understandable and succinct way. The second way I learned things was through writing the 3 papers for the class. The prompts were clear and forced us to examine the evaluations carried out by organizations as well as design our own for an organization of our choice. These were valuable exercises, although I did not enjoy them at the time. Overall, I am hesitant to recommend this class. I know Professor Karlan has a lot to offer to his students, but I really think his teaching style is more suited to a seminar style format where he can dialogue with students and critique\/challenge them. He is an extremely smart guy and 100% should be teaching this topic to students, but I think something needs to be changed up.",
    "The class was split into two halves. In the first half, we talked about the different market failures that led to poverty (behavioral failure, information failure and such). In the second half, we talked about specific areas of concern for developing countries in which these market failures are manifest (e.g. healthcare, education). Good class overall, fascinating material, and really chill too. Only a quarter of the class was attending lectures after the midterm.",
    "It is a good class, where you can learn to see the poverty problems as economist of poverty see them. The focus is on impact evaluations, so learn how to run RCTs and what does not work to really evaluate impact. It is good, but I am still indecisive on how applicable is.",
    "I would recommend Econ 327 to another student who, like me, was looking for a writing credit. I felt that I learned skills that definitely will be useful after graduation.",
    "Unfortunately, by the end this course became an all-too-literal representation of why more work on evaluating NGOs needs to be done. Professor Karlan is an all-star, and a pretty good lecturer, but I felt like there wasn't really enough content to fill an entire semester in this class. That being said, it's pretty easy (probably too much so), and not much work for a writing credit. Plus, you actually learn stuff, and can't get away with bullshitting. So overall, a pretty good class, and a pretty easy one, too.",
    "The course is okay. I think it is a bit disorganized, and Dean Karlan didn't really seem to care about the class at all. It starts off as a quick crash course on econometrics, then you get lessons about key market failures, and the rest is just learning about different field experiments. It kinda feels like after the first half of the course, the second half of the course doesn't really have much value. Also felt repetivie at times. But it was a writing credit, so...probably take it if you want a non English class writing credit. This is one of those classes where people will mark \"Good\" because it wasn't downright awful, but it really wasn't a good class. You don't really learn that much at all. If you want, just download the syllabus and do the readings on your own time. You'll probably learn much more that way.",
    "We learned a lot of material in the first 1\/3 of the class however after that it became a bit dry with just case study after case study. However, it was nice reviewing all the technical econometrics related information in the beginning of the semester. The papers are LONG. The final paper was 12-15 pages...single spaced...And there was even a final after that, thankfully it was optional.",
    "It is a course about randomized control evaluations. If this interest you, take the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in international development.",
    "ECON 327 is a good course -- I definitely learnt a lot about RCTs. I thought it was focused too heavily on only one method of evaluation (RCTs) though. I don't think I learnt that much after the first month or so of the course -- in the latter part, it just seemed like reading one unrelated study after another. Prof. Karlan is an okay professor -- most lectures were just ok\/subpar. I've definitely taken better courses at Yale, but this was a good writing credit and very applicable to life outside yale!"
