   "comments": [
    "PCHEM is fundamental. I wish I had taken this as a freshman.",
    "You probably have to take it if you're a chem major, but I'm probably phys. It's going to be painful if you hate math, but if you're okay with partial dervatives you're more than fine. Math 120 or enas 151 would definitely help before (or concurrently if you have to). It's definitely challenging but doable. The workload w\/ Dr. Cross was pretty light but the material is challenging. Take it if you're interested in p-chem, you'll learn a lot.",
    "It isn't great, but it's not as hard as people say it is. Honestly, there isn't a lot of work, and the first two exams were very fair (the second exam was even a bit too easy, I think). The final was literally the hardest test I could have imagined, but that is the nature of the beast, I suppose.",
    "This class is not easy class unless you like both physics and chemistry. I would not recommend for any one who is not major in Chemistry.",
    "Talking to students who took it before, it sounds that Professor Cross's class is a lot easier than Professor Zilm's. We had a fairly short p-set every week and the midterms and finals were not super difficult. They were fair tests, but not the impossible kind.Professor Cross is not a very interesting lecturer though...",
    "If you're willing to put in the time, take it.",
    "When taught by Cross, this class isn't great. I have heard awesome things about Schmuttenmaer, but Cross simply is uninspirational as a lecturer. It wasn't tons of work (although the exams are certainly not easy), and the material is reasonably interesting. Be ready for a lot of math.If you're reading this review you probably have to take it anyway for the chem, physics, or chemE major, but don't worry, it won't kill you.",
    "CHEM 332 primarily covers thermodynamics, covering many topics mentioned in the general chemistry in greater detail. It's a great class to take, particularly because you go through the process of using only a few principles to develop and derive other concepts in p chem.",
    "Chem 332 is a physical chemistry class dealing with thermodynamics, equilibrium, molecular dynamics, etc. Lots of learning to be done and more material than you realize. A good math background helps a lot, and going to office hours\/reading the book helps a lot as well. I won't go so far as to say that you should only take it if your major requires it, but it's a tough class. Prof. Cross is really nice and willing to listen to all your questions though.",
    "The course is a challenging and rigorous lecture that is best for students who are serious about chemistry and the physical sciences. Depending on your background, it can require a great deal of outside work in order to understand the concepts. While the general workload may not seem too great (one problem set with three or four problems per week and two tests and a final) the problem sets can often be very difficult, especially if you haven't done the background work in order to understand the concepts. If you are serious about it, though, you will get a lot out of the course and do well in it.I would recommend the course only to those very interested in chemistry and the physical sciences, as its subject matter is far too specific and advanced for someone simply looking for their QR credit.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is willing to do the work. The course covers a lot of material in a short time which means that Professor Cross has to choose between showing derivations of equations, which is great because then you know where the crazy equations come from, and examples of problems. This means that you have to read the book carefully as well as attend lectures in order to get the most possible out of the class. If you do this the class will be a good experience, even for a freshman, and Professor Cross is GREAT!",
    "A very challenging course that should be taken by upperclassmen only. Expect difficulty understanding concepts and a lot of derivation. This whole course is based on derivations. You don't look at the periodic table ever.",
    "This is a good class. If you need it for your major I would say that you should take it. The work was very manageable.",
    "By the end of the semester you will look back and say \"I can't believe I used to think that was hard.\"First semester pchem is not that bad, just try to stay on topof your work and the reading. A good ta works wonders. You just have one problem set a week and they seemed to get easier as the semester progressed...Chemistry majors have the option of taking this class and the pchem with biological applications. Frankly, I understand that pchem with physical applications is more straightforward.Math 120 definitely helps but it's not entirely necessary. You'll see a lot of physics come up again (well...of course). In Prof. Cross' class, at least one problem on each test was a derivation. Once you get the hang of those, they're actually fun and it's incredibly satisfying when you answer one correctly. When your world is falling apart from too much work and material you don't understand, there's nothing like solving one of the derivation problems to make you feel smart again.",
    "Good course. Careful who is teaching it though. I hear Sch.... someone is good, but Cross is not the best. Also, this class has a lot of freshmen in it, who have no real other difficult classes and can therefore just pour their non-burnt out energy into it. Beware.",
    "Don't take it unless it is for your major.",
    "I would not recommend CHEM 332 for fun; only take it if you are a chemistry major (or possible MB&B) or find thermodynamics and calculus very interesting or are just super good at that sort of thing and wouldn't be phased out or overwhelmed by the math. It is a pretty fascinating subject if you take the time to understand what is going on.",
    "Chem 332 with Professor Cross is pretty good. I sometimes found lectures a little hard to follow but Prof Cross is always willing to answer questions. Problem sets are very manageable and tests are fair.",
    "First semester pchem is not too bad, especially with Prof. Cross. His tests were not too hard. About 2\/3 of the material is not really conceptually harder than chem 118--there's just a lot more material and more math is involved (ie partial derivatives)",
    "Depends on the professor! The material is really fun, and made me see chemistry and experimentation in a completely new light. Basically, PChem introduces you to the nitty gritty of gen chem to make it actually useable in real life. However, professor Cross might be a bit TOO easy, and teaches too little (read: class was not very hard. problem sets and tests were fairly easy). I definitely feel underprepared in my PChem background. Professor Cross IS really funny and really helpful when you talk to him though, and he really knows his stuff. He also has a great laugh. Fun lectures. I really like the material, though, so I still think it's a great class to take.",
    "This class is excruciatingly boring, but it has a very generous curve. The material isn't intrinsically that difficult...but it is really hard to motivate yourself to go to lecture or study. I really hope he isn't using Atkins again because that textbook is a bit useless.",
    "If you are chemistry major considering this course, you also have the choice of taking chem 328 in place of this class. Don't make the mistake I made. Shop both this class and 328! This class is not amazing, and you will almost learn nothing. Cross isn't clear on most topics, and add to that the difficult topics you're covering, and you have a class that is both frustrating and almost unbearable.",
    "Very good course. Although the lectures were slightly confusing at times and hard to follow, Prof. Cross posts all of his lecture notes which were extremely helpful when studying. Prof. Cross is also always helpful and wants to see his students succeed.",
    "Though I am a Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry major, I took CHEM332a because I felt, vaguely, that I wanted a more fundamental understanding of physical chemistry than that given by the biological equivalent, CHEM328a. I also took the class because I had heard that 328 was incredibly easy and quite boring. In the end, I feel as though I have a better understanding of thermodynamics and other principal concepts of physical chemistry as a whole, but I do not believe I have learned material that will be very relevant to my own future as a scientist. In terms of the depth of the class, the core concepts are covered in general chemistry - at least, I felt that I had learned many of the equations and basic ideas behind electrochemistry and rates, for example, in AP Chemistry in high school. The only area in which my depth of understanding was significantly enhanced by this course is thermodynamics, including the fundamental properties and how they are related. In terms of the workload and commitment, I usually spent around six hours a week on the problem sets and studied for the second midterm and final the night before, but I still did well in the course overall. Prof. Cross was a fair professor; his lectures are not always captivating, but he does have a good sense of humor and I believe he is helpful in office hours. I do not necessarily recommend this class over 328 - it depends on how both are being taught when you will take it, as well as what your own goal is in taking physical chemistry.",
    "Definitely not an easy course, but if you understand the material well, it's an extremely rewarding class. The content that you learn in this class is damn near magical in some instances, and definitely worth the effort you put into the class. Be warned though that it's pretty math intensive to start (the first 30 pages of my notes are just partial derivatives). After the first month or so though, the endless stream of derivatives starts to make more sense though, and when you finally derive that first equation for yourself, it's all worthwhile.",
    "Dont take it unless you are a chem major. The material is difficult and takes a lot of time to master.",
    "The course isn't too difficult but the material can be challenging.",
    "This class is very manageable if one keeps up with all the work and concepts. The problem sets are not too bad but extra work is required outside class to fully grasp the concepts. If you like gen. chem. you will like this class. I would recommend this class to those interested in chemistry.",
    "Chemistry 332 01 is a thorough course with many interesting topics in thermodynamics and kinetics. I would definitely recommend it to another student because it shows a different side of chemistry that helps to understand where the basis of inorganic chemistry comes from. I loved it.",
    "P-chem was difficult for me because I am mathematically challenged. A more numerically inclined person wouldn't have the same difficulty."
