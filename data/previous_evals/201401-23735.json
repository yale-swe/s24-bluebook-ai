    "- I've learned so much about lighting this year, and I'd like to thank the department for doing a great job. I feel much more confident about talking about lights. - In thinking of ways to improve the class, I think we should kill the whole play discussion session, and give that valuable hour at the end to Robert Wiezel, who is panting breathlessly in the morning (the poor guy), teaching us the basic step-by-step on lighting and drafting. By the way, he's got to find a way to use visual aids to teach that class. Maybe he could use the visualizer. - Also, using the rep plots are a great idea. - Overall, the practicals are good, but sometimes you don't get to learn as much as you wish you could because of the nature of working in groups, and also working with non-lighting people. Its the luck of the draw and I'm glad we have a rotation policy. We have too many designers who can tell each other let's ombre this, and lets ombre that, but at the end of the day, lets just stick to the lighting process otherwise we'll be here forever. If my classmates are spending 2 hours deciding on the perfect gels to use, I'm gonna kill myself at some point. Like I said, its the luck of the draw, and thank god for the rotations.",
    "suggest to add a little section about analyzing lighting design elements for different type of theatre.Could also introduce some famous lighting designer\u2019s work to the students, and how they develop their initial ideas from the research. This part could be included into the play discussion section. Maybe the teacher could show some images about what has been done for the actual production after students talk about their ideas.",
    "The most difficult thing about Lighting Design is how broken up it is. There should be a clear plan about what we are going to learn and then going forward and doing it. Class with Robert was so short that he got flustered and repeated things without finishing thoughts and then we would have weeks between actual table work because of Rep days and Opera field trips. Once we moved into the classroom with tables and worked out light plots I think things were much more productive than they were trying to explain things on a white board in that stuffy wooden box light lab. I wish we could do away with the play discussions so that we could have enough time to work through the fundamentals of lighting. I feel unprepared for next year. We lost a full day when it was discovered that there were people in the class who couldn't read groundplans, sections &\/or elevations... I'm not sure how to remedy that in lighting class but it was a big step back that week. Practicals were educationally useful, I just would request a schedule for them as many of them were sprung on us at the last minute (by which I mean some weeks we had emails on Friday night telling us that we had a practical due on Monday morning) Keep in mind that first year Friday night is spent preparing for Saturday set design leaving only Saturday evening and Sunday to do this brand new assignment. Rep focus days were frustrating. It was like pounding palms on a piano trying to make music. On the days we knew who was going to be called out everyone not being put on the spot pretty much mentally checked out. I thought at the very least knowing the prompt Before seeing the billion and one lights in the air could have given us a little more hope of figuring out what to turn on when it came to our turn. On the days we had table work with Robert's attention on the light plots we were trying to make, I made progress. Those moments were just few because of the way the class is scheduled and structured. Sorry to be such a downer, I like the faculty for this course quite a lot and the Practicals have trained my eyes to spot good\/bad lighting, but Mondays were nonetheless frustrating I think with some strategic tweaks to the structure of the class it could be much better.",
    "I felt material to be repeatedly discussed. If there were an objective of goals week by week I believe further progress could be made."
