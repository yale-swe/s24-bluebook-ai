    "i have learned the most in this course than in any other course taken at Yale.",
    "'Literature into Film' offers the opportunity to both explore great texts as well as to overcome the widespread bias for fidelity criticism in discourses of adaptation, according to which \"the book is always better than the movie\". Prof. Marcus' course challenges such notion by applying a variety of critical tools (most notably those of close reading) to a rich selection of works, devoting to both books and movies the consideration they deserve. Class discussion was always engaging and though-provoking, thanks to the enthusiasm of Prof. Marcus and the active participation of all the students. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in film studies, Italian cinema, and adaptation theory."

    "This course enriched my knowledge of Italian cinema while more generally offering me a great introduction to film studies. It gave me the chance to explore a case study that I was particularly interested in as well as to engage with many texts important for my formation as an Italianist."
