   "comments": [
    "Great class. I liked the section\/lecture structure of the class. Some of the texts, while understandable in terms of their purpose for the course, were just uninteresting (Augustine, Freud). Other texts were incredible (Satanic Verses). I had a lot of fun in discussion section.",
    "It was a basic introductory class. If you need to take it because you are a literature major or want an introduction to college reading and writing, I would recommend it. Otherwise, I would recommend skipping it and heading straight to a more advanced literature class. I did not find it entirely necessary for me.",
    "The class is worth taking if you like reading and if you plan on actually doing the readings. It would be all too easy to not do the readings, but then the class is pretty useless. The reading is sometimes a lot (like a lot) so if thats not your thing then don't bother. The lectures, when at their best, are amazing and eye opening (again, only if you have read the book). If you like reading dense material and talking about it, then I suggest this class to you.",
    "A great intro course. I enjoyed the tag-team lecture method and the professor-on-professor rebuttal. It made for a lively atmosphere. Our books cumulated in a very hard-to-read but worth it book: The Satanic Verses. For those who like to read and think about narrative structure, this course is for you!",
    "If you're a Lit major, you'll have to take it at some point or another. May as well get it over with. You will enjoy the texts, even if you don't develop any particularly new skills in the course. Try to get into a good section - this can really make or break the experience.",
    "Take it-- the thematic approach to this course is interesting and expansive. The type of discourse you'll have in section will reappear in other Lit\/English classes you take.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend LIT120 to other students. While the work load (especially the readings) may be heavier than other courses, the course is very rewarding in terms of the extensive exposure we get to various forms of narrative.",
    "Answered in previous form!",
    "Take it! The course is quirky and probably unlike anything you'll take at Yale. For those who dislike lecture, having a class that is half lecture and half seminar is very helpful. And learning from multiple professors is really a gift."
