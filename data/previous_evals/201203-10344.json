    "Yes, I would recommend this class.",
    "In the format we took it in, I would recommend it to a student who has no idea about methodology, or which types they would like to use. But for someone who already knows the discipline they want to do research in, this course might be a bit tedious. The class provided breadth, but not much depth into any particular methodology. It is useful for planning interdisciplinary research, but again, for depth I would recommend someone take a research methods class (or classes) in economics, anthropology, etc - whatever their field of study is."

   "comments": [
    "It helped me practically get an early start on writing research proposals for funding applications in the spring.",
    "Coming into this class not having taken a research methods course before, it was useful for me to think about the types of methods I might use fro my own work. Once I identified those methods though (for instance, archival research, ethnography, or econometrics) I feel as though I would need to take an additional course in those fields to utilize the methods in my summer research. So yes, the course was helpful in one regard but limiting in another. I understand you can't teach a semester's worth of a research methods course in one or two class periods, but a run down of common techniques and steps used in the field would have been useful."
