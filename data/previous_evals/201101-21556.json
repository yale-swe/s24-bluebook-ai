    "It's fine. Miki's super-nice and approachable, though her lectures are pretty disorganized -- she's like the exact opposite of Andrew Casson. Motivation for the topic's really tough, but there are some gorgeous flashes of insight if you're patient enough. Tests are mildly unfortunate, but the curve is (hopefully!) generous and the homework isn't too bad. If you want to go farther in math, this class is a reasonable way to do so -- neither a must-take (based on quality only, as the subject's fair important, I suppose) nor a must-avoid.",
    "Galois is a fascinating class. It's generally taught by a different professor every year, so shop it first, but definitely don't finish the math major without it!",
    "Great class. It's quite a bit of work, but the material is very interesting and Professor Havlickova is really awesome.",
    "It's a lot of technicalities, but the reward is definitely worth the effort.",
    "Galois theory is a very beautiful topic if you like algebra.",
    "Absolutely take this class with miki. She is the best math teacher I have had at Yale by a long shot. The class is tough and fast paced, but not prohibitively so, as there is plenty of help available outside of class.",
    "Galois theory is a fascinating subject - assuming you took 350 in the fall, the proofs in this course are much less definitional and require more insight, but the results are also much more beautiful. You get to see the way in which properties of groups can be translated into properties of fields, with applications to subjects like constructibility of figures and irreducibility of polynomials. Overall great class - absolutely recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Almost everything covered in this class will interest you. You will cover Theory of Fields, Galois Theory, Polynomials and much more.",
    "It's a lot of polynomials and number theory. It reminds me a lot of analytic number theory.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it. It starts off with a lot of factoring polynomials, but it gets a lot harder\/more interesting. You learn some really cool math, and it makes you appreciate better the group theory you learned in 350."
