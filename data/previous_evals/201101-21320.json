    "If a student is good with reading a book himself\/herself, he\/she has almost nothing to gain from this course. It must certainly be improved.",

    "The class definitely has to rethought. Once again, please refer to the current DGS who has received thorough feedback from the graduate students.",
    "Very important for a grad student to take, because he will learn lots of methods!",
    "PHYS 502 is a necessary class to take in order to gain a thorough background in E&M, especially with regards to special relativistic dynamics. However, to be honest, one may be just as well off simply reading Jackson as taking the class.",
    "E&M was not helpful, and I would recommend that if they can, they should avoid it completely."

   "comments": [
    "Working on problems, I gained an insight for what problems can be solved using which methods, I became somewhat more comfortable with manipulating field equations, solving differential and integral equations. I guess it served as a course on some mathematical topics.",
    "I think it had deepen my knowledge of electrodynamics, specially Green's function!",
    "While almost all of the material certainly has been glossed over before in undergraduate E&M classes, this course offers a much more thorough understanding in such areas as boundary value problems, special relativity, and the wave equation. It is extremely useful as it pertains to including dynamics and interactions in relativistic quantum mechanics. I have benefited a lot from the material."
