    "THIS CLASS IS FINE. I DID SOME RESEARCH AND WROTE A PAPER AND GOT A CREDIT FOR IT. ONE QUESTION THOUGH, WHY DO ALL THE EMAILS FOR THIS COURSE NEED TO BE IN ALL CAPS? HOW DOES IT FEEL, MADELINE CAVANAUGH? I CAN ALL CAPS TOO, BRO!",
    "Allows you to do research for credit(obv), which is an awesome opportunity if you are into research and don't otherwise have time in your schedule.",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "Research course for MB&B, with a proposal, presentation to your lab group, and 12-15 page final report. I would recommend to those MB&B students who want to do research and get some credit for it too.",
    "Why would you not take this course?",
    "Yes. Especially if you have the chance to construct your own project, definitely work out.",
    "As long as you have a good PI, this should be a very good experience. Keep in mind that you will likely be spending more than 10 hours a week in lab.",
    "Research for credit is a great experience, not just to learn lab techniques, but also to learn how to think logically and how to design experiments effectively.",
    "MB&B 471 is a great way to legitimize the research you are already doing. Much of my most worthwhile learning here at Yale has occurred during my last two semesters of research for credit. I highly recommend it.",
    "If you are in the MB&B major then you have to take this anyway. It is nice to work independently and gives you experience in presenting. The lab report is annoying though.",
    "If you doing research during the semester might as well get credit for it. Your experience though will totally depend on your PI.",
    "Essentially you continue independent research in your lab. It ends up being more than 10hours a week but of course that's the nature of the beast! The research proposal, report, and presentation aren't very difficult, just make sure to work with your PI\/postdoc on drafts",
    "This is a research-for-credit course and all depends on who you're working with and what you're doing.",
    "I would recommend this class to any aspiring BS student. Research is an important component of any BS degree and what science is essentially all about. A worthwhile course."
