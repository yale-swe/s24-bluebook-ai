   "comments": [
    "I learned to take a quantitative skill-set for the energy problems of the future and apply them to qualitative questions of carbon emissions and different resources.",
    "I acquired more experience with scientific calculations that pertain particularly to energy systems like solar PV systems for example. I have a solid grasp over the history of energy transitions in the world and in the US as well as a good understanding of energy systems at Yale.",
    "I learned a ton about energy policy and how to calculate energy use using physics and math through this course.",
    "I learned a decent amount generally about climate change and then also about different technologies associated with reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "I did learn more about Energy in the US by taking this class.",
    "Close to nothing gained from taking this course.",
    "I had to take this course for Energy Studies, if I could choose not to take it, I wouldn't have taken it. I think that the course is a nice science credit for non-STEM people since it is focused on a lot of different aspects of energy and does not deal with a lot of science. However, as someone coming from science background and as someone who is actually interested in energy to study Energy Studies at Yale, this course was not really interesting for me since it did not go in depth into anything.",
    "This course gives a very broad understanding of energy trends in the US, and globally, and covers briefly mainstream alternative energy technologies.",
    "I learned a lot about Yale's energy management and basic energy physics. I also became comfortable doing simple calculations to estimate energy use",
    "This course covers an immense breadth of topics that are listed in the syllabus. It is very ambitious but it introduces the students to the jargon and the bread and butter of the field.",
    "The majority of what I gained in this course consisted of factoids, but I did not learn in terms of the ability to analyze or synthesize information about energy, energy consumption, or its effect on the climate.",
    "Learned very little useful or relevant information. Did learn about Kroon Hall (twice) because we were given the same lecture three weeks apart (same slides and everything) when the professor forgot. I learned I should speak up sooner when the professor is unprepared and forgetful."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that making this course the mandatory gateway course for Energy Studies students was a fantastic idea. It gives a comprehensive overview of fossil fuel and renewable energy sources, as well as energy management here at Yale. Some strengths: Class size. 30 is a perfect group to be accustomed to throughout our remaining time at Yale. I have formed some great friendships and learned about opportunities in the energy job industry from hearing about my classmates' experiences. Level of engagement. The tours, field trips, dinners, frequent study sessions, poster practice sessions, and advisor meetings ensured that all students were engaged and on track with deadlines. Freedom to choose our topics! Some weaknesses: unequal participation. I wish I had gotten to hear a few of my classmates speak more. Slightly confusing wording in later problem sets. I don't remember specific examples very well, but there were (a few, not many) questions that one could get different answers for based on interpretation.",
    "The final project and tours were excellent and enriching, but the lectures themselves tended to be dry. There was minimal discussion of the current political situation and potential challenges that will arise, so I wish I there had been more of that.",
    "Well-organized, but lectures could have been more engaging.",
    "This course had a ton of potential. It focuses on what I believe are some incredibly interesting and important topics in today's world. However, lecture tended to be quite dull and quite often the problem sets did not seem to relate to the material discussed in lecture. We even had the EXACT SAME lecture taught to us twice.",
    "The strengths of this class include a good overview of different energy sources as well as gives the students practical application of the math\/physics\/chemistry behind real problems through the problem sets. I also really enjoyed the fact that the class was taught by many different professors. Each professor brought a new outlook on energy systems, and the guest lecturers were truly great. Weaknesses include repetition of material (even an entire lecture), which makes it mundane. Also, many Energy Studies students are also Environmental Studies majors. The EVST major requires us to take a good deal of chemistry, biology, and math, so I felt like this gateway course was underwhelming and that I already knew most of the material. APHY 100 had been listed as a \"science for non-science major\" but I had already taken a lot of science and did not realize how repetitive the class would be.",
    "Worst class I've ever taken.",
    "The problem sets and midterm often covered advanced physics material that we didn't fully cover in class, and that didn't feel completely relevant to the course. While the lectures were very insightful, they often became repetitive and dry. I highly enjoyed the field trips to learn more about energy use at Yale. The final group project and report were a great way to allow the students to explore an area of energy that interested them. I wish the course were more interactive, because given the size of 30 students, it definitely could have been organized into more of a seminar-style class rather than simply being a lecture.",
    "The lectures can be incredibly dry and the problem sets not always very clear.",
    "I thought that one of the strengths of this class was that it touched on many aspects of energy and gave me a good overview of energy in general. I also thought the individual and group projects were very rewarding. The midterm and problem sets were a bit confusing and could maybe be improved if the instructors gave us a list of key terms at the beginning of lectures to look out for instead of just the entire powerpoint printed. I wished we could have gone more into the geology side of energy - fracking, tar sands, etc.",
    "The course may be greatly improved by having more structure and revising the syllabus. The homework for example did not have much to do with the lectures, and the lectures that were about science seemed a bit out of place at times. The lectures about Yale policies and buildings were good and informative but I wish we did something more, all together after that section. I'm not sure how it can be improved but I just felt like I was floating through the class and I don't know if I got anything substantial out of it. I recommend that it not be a gateway course for energy studies, in its current form.",
    "Easily the worst and least useful class I've taken since 7th grade.",
    "I think this course should not be made mandatory for Energy Studies. If there needs to be a capstone course for Energy Studies, it should be specifically structured to be suitable for people with background knowledge in basic energy concepts. For example I am sure people who take Energy Studies would know what Watts is and how it is different from Joules. I agree that there are people with backgrounds in economics etc and not science in Energy Studies, but then maybe there should be different sets of requirements for different types of students.",
    "The course material was often very vague and I didn't feel that there was a totally clear message being delivered. However it did approach each topic from the ground up and gave a solid overview of a wide range of topics.",
    "The problem sets were much harder than what we did in class",
    "Overall a good experience! I have one major criticism: Please organize the course more cohesively. It was often unclear what notes were for which day and what was being covered. There was no need for that much paper to be printed out every day. Also, Prof. Prober gave the same exact lecture twice and we were very confused.",
    "The conceptual idea of this course is amazing. While it was a great course to take because it was taught in this format for the first time, there were slight organizational issues that I am sure will be fixed for next year.",
    "A lot of information in this course was repeated throughout the semester, so I feel that all the information provided throughout the semester could have been accomplished over the course of a few weeks rather than a whole semester. The projects were also not well thought out, considering the wide range of interest and knowledge of the energy sector.",
    "This course doesn't cover much material interesting to people in the Energy Studies program (except for Dr. Oristaglio's guest lectures). The course would be improved by completely redesigning it so that it addresses the material students actually care about. Moreover, communication between professors and TAs would be useful. The problem sets and midterm exam were silly exercises in google and multiplication. Lectures were so slow and boring that people regularly fell asleep. Really need a complete overhaul of this course if it is to be offered again."

   "comments": [
    "One of my favorite courses at Yale, and as this is the gateway course to Energy Studies, I highly recommend that program too. Anyone who is passionate about energy management or renewable energy should join us!",
    "Take it if you're in Energy Studies, but if you're just looking for a science credit, you'd be better off in a survey course.",
    "Yes, if interested about thinking about the future of energy in a new way.",
    "If you want a solid foundation in energy systems, definitely take this class. If you have been interested in environmental studies for a long time and have taken a year of chemistry or the intro to environmental engineering class, don't take this course, as it will be repetitive for the first half. We get to do final projects at the very end, which consist of our own research, which is actually a very cool way to look at energy systems at Yale.",
    "My God do not take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student in the Energy Studies program, because it is a great overview of energy use and energy policy. If you are able to get into the class without being a member of the Energy Studies program, it is a great science credit for non-science majors, because it only requires a level of high school physics for the problem sets and midterm, and rather than having a final, the course required a final group project and paper. Energy is such an important issue in our modern world, and is one that most students at Yale should understand. However, beware that the course can often become repetitive, and that even though it is a small class of 30 students, classes are taught as lectures.",
    "Don't take the class unless you have to.",
    "This course is required for Energy Studies, and, as such, I felt it was a good overview of energy. Take this course if you want to learn generally about the field of energy.",
    "I wouldn't. I felt like I was wasting my time twice a week each week. And the homework, which was due every second week and was basically physics mixed with googling, also felt like a waste of my time. If you are energy studies, I suggest you ask them to excuse you from this course (it was a gateway course so i had to take it, hopefully its not anymore). If you absolutely have to take it, choose an interesting group project topic because you will be working on it for weeks. Presenting our research and learning about that of the other groups was fun.good luck",
    "This is honestly the worst class I've ever taken in my life - at least since the start of middle school. Julie Paquette and Mike Oristaglio are both great, but Prof. Prober is awful. He is a friendly and well-meaning guy, but a very bad teacher. Prober barely was knowledgable enough to scratch the surface on any of the topics he covered. I think he quoted a NowThis video in one of his lectures. He also delivered the EXACT SAME lecture twice - only three weeks apart! Same slides, almost word for word the same, zero differences in topics covered. He literally handed us the same slides before class so that we could look on as he delivered the same exact lecture. Half the class just stopped showing up after the midterm, and honestly I don't blame them. This was the most mind-numbing two and a half hours every week I think I've ever had. I read the poor reviews from last year before the class started but I didn't believe them - horrible mistake. I'm glad that I'm in energy studies, but this class seriously needs to be revamped, and it probably just needs a new main professor. Energy studies is a great thing and a fantastic group of people (Oristaglio is great, I already said that), but this class either shouldn't be required or it should actually be well taught and have an interesting curriculum. I feel bad writing this, but I have to warn the next group of students that might take this class. Don't do it.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is not in STEM and in need of a Science credit. But if you are in STEM, you'll be very frustrated with the level of content.",
    "If you have a solid background in energy policy and technology, this course offers very little. If you're going in blind it's fairly helpful.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It's a worthwhile entry into the Energy Studies program.",
    "Fantastic course. I would certainly recommend it to anyone. I do wish I had more time to dedicate to it, though",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone even remotely interested in the Energy field. The instructors were all so knowledgeable.",
    "I would never ever recommend this course to another student. If you just need a credit and you don't care about what you're gaining, feel free. However, if you want a course that will challenge you and introduce you to new ideas, this is definitely not the way to go.",
    "Do not take unless you are incredibly interested in Kroon Hall or are required for major\/Energy Studies."
