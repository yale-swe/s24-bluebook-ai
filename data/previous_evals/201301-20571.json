   "comments": [
    "ENAS 508 is a critical part of the graduate experience. This class is merely an introduction to the world of ethics and responsible conductin our research driven environment. I would recommend this class to all students, researchers, and faculty (especially faculty as some of the emerging ethical standards are changing).",
    "Yes. Very helpful course. Should be taken by any graduate student who want to do research in the future.",
    "This class is required, so I don't think I need to recommend it! It's not too bad, though, once you get over the 9am-on-a-Friday thing, and it only meets for the first half of the semester. The class will tell you the basics of what you need to know about professional ethics, and it will provide you some excellent resources to refer to if you find yourself in a sticky situation. I bet you could ask the professor for advice down the line, too, if necessary - Prof. Latham seems like a great resource.",
    "It is necessary for NSF funding, so suggestions are mere formalisms. But it is not completely a waste of time; some interesting stories are told. Class participation and discussion can be awkward.",
    "Yes I would it is an important subject",
    "Yes. Definitely.Have to keep ethical issues in mind when we do research and work.",
    "Yes, I will recommend",
    "recommend",
    "It's required. So... yes.",
    "It is an essential course for those who want to conduct research in any field.",
    "It is required, so yes",
    "yes and we should take this course",
    "Yes",
    "Yea, even though it's required there are still some really interesting things to learn",
    "The course overviews ethical implications of conducting academic research in many settings, as well as Yale's policies for proper research and student conduct.",
    "Yes",
    "A useful course. I feel that I have a better grasp of ethics in academia than any of my colleagues at different institutions"

    "As a Ph. D. student, this course is definitely helpful for my career.",
    "It basically set out some ground rules for how we should be conducting research. It helped me improve some of my habits to ensure best practices with regard to data taking and research in general.",
    "It has provided me with a slightly enhanced ethical background on which to base some decisions I might encounter.",
    "It gave me a basis to set my day to day decisions of in lab, and in my writing",
    "Very much. Helped me think about research ethical issues and be more responsible with my works.",
    "very helpful",
    "kind of",
    "It didn't really deepen my knowledge of the discipline, as most things covered ought to be clearly established in the mind of a student by the time he or she reaches graduate school.",
    "It provided me essential ethics on research.",
    "It was a required class, so it was not technically helpful. But it is a good solid reminder of the ethics resources and structures available to students.",
    "will be useful.",
    "Helped me understand ethics a little better.",
    "I definitely learned more about ethics in scientific research, particularly proper authorship.",
    "Helped me understand what is considered ethical in the field.",

Having followed this course I feelbetter prepared for discussing topics like author-rights and intellectual property \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this will be a great help during my research."
