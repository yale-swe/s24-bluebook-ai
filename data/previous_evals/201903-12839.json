   "comments": [
    "I gained a sense of the interconnectedness of the structures that act in our lives and in the lives of those around us. I truly got the chance to see into the mechanisms behind struggles I only vaguely knew existed. This class is really eye-opening and, even though it's disheartening to see how so many forms of inequality came about and became so normalized, I feel learning about institutions of inequality is a valuable step toward dismantling them.",
    "This course taught me to think critically about the ideologies that govern institutional behavior, and how institutions in turn transform our understanding of class in America. I gained a new understanding of how social stigma preserves the economic status quo and leaves the market unquestioned, how the creation of a perpetual \"underclass\" functions in service of profit and state power, how seemingly disparate institutions operate in concert to privatize what once were considered basic public entitlements, how all of these developments shift the terms of citizenship and national belonging. Anthropology provided a new toolkit and a new lens for the sociocultural forces that underlie, preserve, and challenge political and economic systems.",
    "I gained an understanding of various aspects of inequality through reading an ethnography each week.",
    "I gained a greater understanding of economic, political, and sociocultural constructions of inequality from a variety of perspectives and experiences as a result of taking this course. I also developed my ability to discuss and debate these ideas and their implications with my peers.",
    "What makes this class so incredible is that it's not simply a deep dive into what has changed so drastically in America's political economy over the past half-centuryit's an examination of why those changes have occurred. Inequality in America gets you to trace seemingly disparate phenomena of recent American life, from increasing private indebtedness to mass incarceration to workfarism to the financialization of the American economy to violence on the southern border, and see how they all fit together as part of a broader shift in American institutions.",
    "This class allowed me to see the various moving parts that sustain and perpetuate inequality in America as repeated, connected, phenomena. The repeated emphasis on each of these elements throughout the semester, through their re-emergence in the various ethnographies we read, helped heighten my awareness of them in ways that will stay with me post-graduation as I start working. There was a lot of emphasis on the various ways that policy creates and maintains these systems of social inequality, an emphasis that I really appreciated.",
    "This course completely changed the way I view life and more specifically, inequality in America. I had never taken an anthropology or American studies course in my time here, so I already came into the class knowing I was going to learn a lot. What I didn't yet know is that the works we would be reading would fundamentally transform the way I understand myself. Through the books we read, I learned about the production of inequality, the self-legitimizing nature of inequality , and the impacts of inequality (which aren't as clear-cut as they may seem). I learned of the importance of on the ground perspectives to make sense of the issues that are seemingly beyond the scope of individual humans. I gained the vocabulary and analysis tools to talk about inequality in a nuanced way that goes beyond binaries of painting people as good\/bad, oppressor\/oppressed, complicit\/innocent.",
    "I learned so much more about various US systems that perpetuate inequality and a little about how to analyze them using institutional analysis."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Every class starts out with a go-around so every student can talk about their ideas about that week's book and then we settle on a question or a few ideas and talk about it. I think that it was very helpful to articulate my thoughts and be questioned, as well as to hear what my peers thought. Everyone's ideas were treated with respect and Professor Dudley was great at pushing the conversation along and asking provocative questions. The books were always interesting and the prompt for the essay always tied the readings together in a way you might not have seen before. I don't think the class had any weaknesses except that it was easy for a few people to dominate the discussion and that was never really challenged.",
    "Looking at the syllabus, I wondered if attempting to cover so many different issues over the course of the semester would make the class feel scattered. The opposite proved to be true; reading about and discussing such different institutions helped demonstrate the commonalities between them and the types of discourse that many of them shared. By semester's end, the picture of inequality in America I came away with was actually quite unified. I enjoyed the paper assignments, especially the autoethnography, which forced me to reckon personally with the influence of the institutions we'd been discussing in my own life. I enjoyed the go-rounds at the start of class it was great getting to hear from everyone in the room but sometimes they went on quite long and didn't leave as much time as I would have liked for us to engage in a dialogue with each other. This was such a phenomenal course and I've very glad to have gotten the chance to take it.",
    "The reading list was really great overall, and class discussion was productive to an extent, but I think the teaching methodology could have been better. By the end of the semester, having each person give their initial reactions before discussion began took up far too much of the class and prevented in depth discussion.",
    "This course facilitated critical conversations in which students actively engaged with the concepts of the class and their personal worldviews. We collaborated to develop deeper understandings of the ideas that were presented in class.",
    "I think the class does a wonderful job of delving into the multiplicity of ways that inequality is reproduced in America across a number of sectors and institutions. I think it could do a better job of setting up theories of institutions in the beginning to contextualize and guide instruction.",
    "Strengths: Professor Dudley alone is a reason to take this class. Beyond that, the syllabus is phenomenal, and the weekly reading responses helped me crystallize my understanding of the readings and relate them to other works we'd read. The papers, while difficult, were a lot of fun to write. Weaknesses: Every class would begin with each student giving a comment about their interpretation of the reading in a circle, though often this would take up over an hour of class time. Often, many students' comments would use their comments to preach to the choir: summarizing the essential points of the reading without offering much in the way of analysis or relating the readings to the broader through lines of the class. I often thought that these parts of class wasted a lot of time (especially since many people were simply recapitulating what they had already written in their reading responses), and that we would have been much better served if Professor Dudley asked some probing questions at the beginning.",
    "This course was overall very good, and class time was always valuable, but I thought there could have been less time spent in the initial circle-- it left less time for deeper discussion and for the professor to speak.",
    "I really appreciated reading a text per week for the course, as I think it helped us get into the ideas the author was presenting much better. Additionally, doing the reading responses each week after reading the texts, and having the responses organized the way Kate required them to be, helped the texts stick much better in my mind. Class discussions were always pretty thought provoking, and I often found the classroom space to be a space in which I could further develop and be surprised by ideas relating to the text. I so appreciated the comments of my various classmates, of the ways people were vulnerable in offering their personal experiences, and in the ways that Kate would prompt us to be more specific about the claims we made in class, to elaborate on what we meant, or further our thoughts by offering an alternate opinion. I also really appreciated the specificity of the essay prompts.",
    "The strengths are undoubtedly my fellow classmates and the book choices. This class attracts people who are genuinely interested in discussing some of the most pressing problems of today and SEE how they may be implicit\/complicit in the systems they take issue with. It attracts empathetic people that listen and respectfully engage. I greatly enjoyed learning from everyone and our different but not entirely dissimilar backgrounds. As for the assigned readings, I am so happy that we focused on a single book a week. Focusing on one reading really allowed us to dive deep into a particular issue of inequality and explore the nuances of said system. Every single book had contributed something new to our understanding of inequality, and I also greatly appreciate the wide variety of forms of inquiry and fields the books presented (though most of them deal with ethnography in some way or another).",
    "Strengths Prof. Dudley is divine. She's so great at setting up discussions and she knows exactly when to intervene with commentary and when to hold back. Also, the readings are a great overview of a wide variety of issues relating to inequality. Weaknesses At the beginning of class, we all went around to make a comment about the readings, which at times felt rather tedious and unhelpful (especially when some people took a lot of time to say very little of substance). Also, Prof. Dudley seems to refrain from invoking and assigning \"pure theory\" texts, but I think it would've been useful if we talked more explictly about the theory and key theorists interested in institutional analysis. She often referred to the term \"institutional analysis,\" but I felt that we didn't always know what that term meant or how to *really* do institutional analysis."

   "comments": [
    "I definitely think anyone interested in learning about what got us to this point in history or power structures or the systems that operate around us should take this course. Professor Dudley is amazing and the discussions are lively and enlightening. The entire syllabus is incredible and doing the work is never boring.",
    "This course totally changed how I think about class in America. Professor Dudley will help you think critically about the ideologies at the roots of our broken economic system and the ways in which institutions do our thinking for us in an effort to render themselves natural, impossible to critique. I came away with a fresh understanding of inequality and a real sense of promise that we might be able to find a way into a new discourse and a new kind of politics.",
    "I would recommend this class if the rest of the students are engaged and the beginning of class go-around is significantly shortened .",
    "I would recommend this course to a student that is interested in gaining an anthropological perspective on the production of different forms of inequality in the United States today.",
    "Absolutely. It's an essential course to take for anyone interested in learning about inequality and its sociopolitical manifestations.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. Anyone who wants to understand the depth and severity of recent changes in American society and culture needs to take this course.",
    "Yes I would. It does require a good amount of commitment to the course and sometimes the content we go through might feel repetitive since there are so many shared themes across the texts. But something the class really prompts us to do, particularly through the essays, is to go over, and thus really understand and remember the specific ways through which inequality is perpetuated. But the class was really useful for me both for thinking through the themes of the class and furthering my critical thinking and writing abilities.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to ANYONE, especially those who have never taken an anthro\/american studies course. Reading this books made me see the issues I've explored in my own major in a totally different light. More importantly, I think this course has fundamentally changed my life.",
    "Yes! Don't expect to get a rigorous \"how-to\" guide on how to analyze institutions and inequality per se, but for sure you'll learn a ton about how you might do that. You do read a tooon of ethnographies and, through the papers, you learn a bit about how to understand \"the logic of capital\" manifests across various institutions."
