Another weakness is I felt like the feedback on my reading responses didn't actually help me improve at all, and I actually got no feedback for the majority of the responses I submitted."

This class requires a deceptive amount of effort which is hard to tell from the syllabus but you get a lot out of it, especially if you're considering a career in molecular biology research."
