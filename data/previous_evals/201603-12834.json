    "This is as much a skills course as a critical thinking course, and I enjoyed especially the wonderful practical sessions. The readings were quite good, but sometimes we didn't actually discuss them in favor of letting the discussion move where we wanted. I value this discussion flexibility, but there were some days when the discussion moved away from materials and towards general musicology. I appreciate the forum to discuss these general questions, but sometimes we got into a rut. On these occasions the discussion was dominated by too few people, but I saw that you did what you could and I didn't see what else you could do. I like the flexibility we had in our final projects, and enjoyed the day of presentations. It's always very interesting to see what my colleagues are doing. You kept the discussions very friendly and open, which made it easy to contribute. The system of requiring abstracts and bibliographies well in advance of the final project works well. It was great to have these frequent opportunities for feedback and it kept us on track. It was wonderful to have this introduction to Yale's resources and libraries. One wonders if it should be required for historians."
