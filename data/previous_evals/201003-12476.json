   "comments": [
    "The experiments are fun (it's *really* satisfying to crunch a whole bunch of numbers and end up with an experimental value for R only 0.5% off what it's suppose to be!) and not at all intimidating, even if you've never done anything more than once light a Bunsen burner. Lab reports are super-easy (admittedly, I'm comparing this to upper-level biology labs) but the quizzes can be killer. Honestly, I'd recommend it even for non-premeds -- it's a whole lot better than sitting in a lecture, doing problem sets, or writing papers.",
    "It is a lab course so be prepared to spend a good amount of time in the lab and finishing lab reports.",
    "I found this course was a lot of work for only half a credit",
    "It's not a bad idea to take it if you need an intro lab course or if you're taking chem 118.",
    "Lab consists of a number of experiments, and for each one you take a quiz at the beginning of class before starting the lab (on the material in the lab), then you write a report to turn in the next week. This lab isn't too bad. I would often finish around 4:30, with some exceptions that took much longer, and a few that were quicker. However, most of the experiments are tedious and didn't provide much important information on chemical concepts. THe quizzes involve some useless memorizing.",
    "Chemistry 119L is an excellent class to learn the basic principles of laboratory studies. Highly recommended for those who have little\/no experience in the lab, but are diligent and enthusiastic to learn the concepts of labwork. Be prepared to be amiable and forge connections with new lab partners each week, and also study ahead of time to understand important calculations and concepts for quizzes.",
    "It requires a lot of tedious and time-consuming work, and was not the most enjoyable experience for me. I would only recommend the lab if it is a necessary major requirement or needed for premed.",
    "Lab was long and tedious. Worst part of my week.",
    "Definitely. IF you don't know how to use anything, they will teach you.",
    "An okay intro lab, though some of the labs do get a bit dry and tedious at times. Professor Parr is generally pretty helpful if you have any questions and lab reports usually only consist of results and calculations and occasionally the discussion section. Not a horrible course but not a great one either.",
    "Too much work for half a credit, but a worthwhile class all the same.",
    "A good intro lab class. If you take 118, you might as well take this course. The workload is not too bad, so long as you stay on top of it, and the weekly quizzes tend to be based off the basic information in the lab packet. Also make sure you get a good TA, especially Kurt, if possible: your choice of the first or second lab room is important in terms of TAs.",
    "Although the class certainly isn't fun (it is quite tedious), it is very important for someone who may want to major in a science (both in that it teaches important scientific techniques, and that it may scare someone away from science early enough to focus on something else). I would definitely recommend it to another student. The lab days can be brutal, the reports are long and challenging, but the experience is very rewarding.",
    "Chem 119L is necessary if you're pre-med and taking 118, but highly unpleasant. The lab reports are long, but it is easy to do well on them if you follow your TA's instructions and comments on previous reports. If you make sure to read the lab manual before class, you'll do well on the lab quizzes, too.",
    "Chemistry 119L was, at times, very tedious, as all lab classes can be. I would only recommend the class to someone who plans on pursuing a major for which this lab course is a prerequisite.",
    "No, I do NOT recommend it. But seeing as how it's needed for med school, there's not other choice is there?",
    "Only take the lab if you have to because it is so much work.",
    "I would recommend it, but preferably with another professor.",
    "It's a course with an annoying amount of work for how little credit we receive, but if you're thinking of going into the sciences, it provides decent experience with navigating the lab.",
    "A lot of work, but it's only one semester.",
    "It's not too much work. Reports aren't that bad. You don't really learn anything, though--I did all these labs in high school, and with more advanced equipment back then. Really the only difference between this class and AP Chem lab is that it's much harder to get an A (which isn't exactly conducive to learning).",
    "Chem 119 was a tough course. It took a lot of time and a lot of tedious data entry and calculations. But it did help reinforce concepts learned in chemistry, and full lab reports were not required every week. I would recommend students taking Chem 118 to take Chem 119 along with it, but to be prepared for a big time commitment.",
    "It is a good lab course that will ease you into taking lab at Yale.",
    "this lab course is pretty straightforward. the labs are interesting for the most part and they cement some of the coursework done in 118. id recommend the lab as a course if you are interested in the practical side of chemistry.",
    "Deadly. Tons of Time. onlhy if you love lab write ups.",
    "Take it if you have to. If you're not pre-med there's really no point.",
    "Chem 119L is the corresponding lab course to Chem 118 lecture. It's a great course but requires a lot of work and effort.",
    "Chemistry 119 is good for a reinforcement of lab techniques that will be prolifically used in the future in many different lab settings. For someone who did not have an intensive lab or experimental course in high school, this course provides an excellent foundation in college.",
    "119 is not a bad lab course, though it is a lot of work. There\u0092s about 11 lab reports, but only about 2-3 of these reports are actually full reports with procedure, conclusion, etc. Most of the time, Dr. Parr only asks for the results and calculations. However, even the results and calculations can be very time-consuming. Start early or you\u0092ll have a lot of work the day before the report is due. There\u0092s also pre-lab quizzes before every lab, and these are not challenging, though they are worth 40% of the grade (too much in my opinion). Dr. Parr can be intimidating, but I enjoyed his sense of humor by the end of the course. I found the TAs to be helpful and approachable during the lab as well.",
    "This is a way to fulfill a lab requirement. The labs are not difficult to do, but can be time consuming. The lab reports themselves can be frustrating, and require a lot more time and effort than other 0.5 credit classes.",
    "If you're not a premed or serious about pursuing chemistry, you have no business in this course. There are much better things to do with your time. For a total of 1\/2 of a credit, this class is not worth the misery.",
    "If you are on the pre-med track, do not take Chem 119. In fact, don't take Chem 118 and 119.I know a few people who dropped this class, and to be honest, I am not surprised.One of my main problems with this class was the weekly quiz. Not only was it difficult to prepare for by simply reading through the experiment, but some of the questions were pointless and cruel (\"What does EDTA stand for?\"). These quizzes counted for 40% of your grade...In addition, although a lab manual is given with all of the experimental procedures, it still did not suffice in terms of fully explaining the calculations needed for our lab reports. Sometimes Parr failed to add a few extra requirements, and he would not go over them in lab. Thus, it's easy to find yourself trying to finish things up last minute.The time that I spent in this course exceeded 0.5 credits by far, so be prepared to commit time to this class.Overall, if you are taking 118, you might as well take 119... It is not the best lab, but it isn't the worst here at Yale. But don't forget, this lab isn't curved; the grades are set.",
    "If you plan on taking more labs in the future I would recommend this lab. It goes over many important topics in General Chemistry like Electrochemistry, Spectrometry, and Acids and Bases, After this class I have become very confortable with working in a lab, preparing for a lab, and writing a formal lab report. This class doesn't really coincide with the lecture course but it does cover important subjects that are not heavily stressed during lecture.",
    "Lab wasn't too hard, overall. Try not to do the labs last minute because you will regret it. Take it with 118, it just makes sense.",
    "The labs in this class do not parallel what is taught in Chem 118. We covered acids and bases first in lab, then in lecture. However, doing the labs themselves helped me understand some concepts such as titrations, acids and bases, etc. Be prepared to spend hours on each lab report, though. They were not fun at ALL and made the night before each lab quite miserable.",
    "The lab is four hours long, once a week. The labs themselves are not super difficult as long as you follow directions. There are pre-lab quizzes given each week, and those can be tough if you have not studied. The lab reports generally take a few hours each week. This lab is as much work as a full credit class, but it is only half a credit.",
    "Didn't like this class... so stressful. I felt like the quizzes had nothing to do with what was provided in the lab manual sometimes! Definitely spent more time on this class than my other classes, just because lab reports were so long and the quizzes were so difficult! Too much time. Also I have never heard of a class that didn't ALLOW for students to contact their TAs outside of class. If you needed help, it wasn't available to you. Also, the lab reports often feel like busy work -- feels like a high school class to be honest, just plugging and chugging. The class is not curved at all for all of the points you lose on quizzes (it was common to get a 12 or 15 out of 20 on a quiz! They seriously take off too many points for seemingly no reason... so, so annoying.) Overall, this class is totally NOT worth taking. Look elsewhere! Remember, you are only getting 0.5 credit.",
    "It was useful though the reports take some time.",
    "I would only recommend it if you have to take lab (like if you're pre-med). Lab does not correspond to material being taught in Chem 118 at the same time.",
    "Although it's only half a credit, this class was more work than my 1.5 credit language class. However, if you need a chem lab, definitely take it (you might not have a choice depending on your major). The labs take a while, so it's not a class where you can do everything the night before it's due. Some of the quizzes are also pretty hard, so you need to put in a good amount of time studying for them. Overall, the class isn't too difficult, but it's a huge time commitment.",
    "A decent amount of work, labs run a bit long but are very manageable. A nice, neat, tidy sort of lab - I'm very thankful it was only half a year though.",
    "This class is a classic lab course. Definitely take it if you are taking 118 because it's helpful to do them alongside each other. The difficulty really depends on the TA you get.",
    "This lab is appropriate for students in chem 118 because it corresponds with most of the material you are learning. Getting used to lab is a process but it is completely manageable once you do.",
    "You pretty much have no choice. So you arent really reading this for any good reason. Buy a life somewhere.",
    "Yeah take it. It's chill.",
    "Chem 119L is a MUST for anyone taking the lecture course. It helps those with no lab experience wet their toes and reinforces material learned in high school for those with strong chemistry backgrounds.",
    "Yes! Do the lab reports early and it's a great intro lab experience",
    "Chem 119L 01 is a good introduction to lab techniques and practices. It is not frustratingly challenging, although some of the lab reports take a lot of time to do. I would recommend the class to anyone wanting to pursue future science labs.",
    "Good class if you need a chem lab. Fairly straightforward.",
    "If you take Chem118, definitely take the lab course.",
    "I wouldn't take this class unless it were required for a pre-req or something. Every afternoon I spent in that building, I felt like I was dying faster. Seriously.",
    "I would recommend it. I learned quite a bit both about chemistry and lab techniques.",
    "I would recommend Chem 119 but I would warn students to prepare heavily for the lab quizzes as they are a significant part of your grade.",
    "Take it if you have to. It's not a bad experience, I enjoyed the lab portions of it (though, it sucked that my lab time was on a Friday--big mistake). However the lab reports are way too time consuming.",
    "Take Chem 119 is a good introduction to lab. The write-ups can be lengthy, but overall straightforward.",
    "I would recommend Chem 119 lab because it really helps you understand the concepts of Chem 118 and is so much more tangible than the lecture. Although some of the labs are a ridiculous amount of work, but everything is doable, especially if you make friends with the people on your lab day and make sure to read the lab before and actually study for the quizzes. If you're on the fence about wanting to take lab, I would recommend it, because it's hard to be sure at the beginning of the semester whether you're going to need it for what you want to pursue.",
    "A solid introductory course to common laboratory practices in college chemistry.",
    "In terms of lab courses, I don't think this was too bad. The work load was completely manageable and the subject material was not difficult to understand. It really makes sense to supplement Chemistry 118 with this course.",
    "This course serves as a great introduction to college chemistry labs. It familiarizes you with many classic chem lab procedures. The instructors structured the course very sensibly to allow you to progress in knowledge\/lab skills each week, and the lab reports never blow you away. We actually only had to do a few full lab reports, while doing a partial write-up (requiring about 4 hours of time, very reasonable for a lab report) most weeks.",
    "Chemistry 119 is your typical general chemistry lab; you will perform labs dealing with everything from titrations to electrochemistry to calorimetry. There are weekly quizzes that test knowledge on both upcoming and previous labs, which can be a little tricky. In general, however, lab reports were often not excessively time-consuming (very rarely did we have to prepare full lab reports). Many students take Chem 119 because they are trying to fulfill prerequisites for other courses or for pre-professional programs. However, I would recommend Chem 119 to other students in the Chem 118 lecture because it provides coverage for some general chemistry concepts that are not particularly emphasized in the Chem 118 lecture but are nevertheless important to understand.",
    "Chem 119L is a work-intensive class that will keep you up late nights before lab.",
    "I wouldn\u0092t recommend this class to be taken just for fun, but for a pre-med student who has to take Chem lab, its not great but its not miserable. In order to be successful, really study for the pre-lab quizzes and make sure you keep track of things like sig figs and labeling, because that\u0092s where the points come off from.",
    "Chem 119 is a pretty demanding course for just .5 credits, but the professor is one of my favorites and you can get some really valuable skills and knowledge from this class. I would recommend it to another student, but with warning that you have stay on top of your stuff.",
    "The concepts that the lab covers are pretty basic. I wouldn't do this if you haven't worked in a lab before, though - the instructors aren't really willing to help you out with using the equipment.",
    "CHEM 119L was a tough lab, but overall a good course. The work was quite tedious and the lab reports took a very long time, but I think it is worthwhile. The one thing that was difficult was having labs (and lab quizzes) on material that had not yet been taught in lecture.",
    "This course is really only for people who have to take lab. Lab can be stressful because several of the labs are graded partly on accuracy. Try to shop TAs, if possible. The TA can really make lab miserable and frustrating if he or she, for example, doesn't help you avoid making common mistakes or treats messing up in lab as some kind of hazing experience. Don't hesitate to ask questions during lab and try to start the report as early as possible because if something is wrong with your results, you can use the rest of the week to talk to Professor Parr and fix what you can. Professor Parr is a great resource when working on the lab reports, which take a LONG TIME (up to 6-8 hours). The quizzes can be tricky but usually aren't too bad. Be careful about units and labeling phases etc. because it's really easy to lose a lot of points on quizzes that way.",
    "This will take up a lot of time; study for the quizzes and start your report as soon as possible. It will take hours but you will feel proud of your work.",
    "Your opinion of this course will be entirely based on your TA. For those of you with an easy TA, the course won't be that bad. You'll master some essential lab techniques, and you'll have a greater appreciation for plug-and-chug equations. For those of you with a bad TA, this course will be a half-credit hell. Choose wisely.",
    "Chemistry 119L was a good basic lab course to take.",
    "Experiments are simple to perform, and labs often do not take all four hours. Grading is sometimes unjust depending on the TA you get, but overall this is a good lab course to take.",
    "Just know that you will be doing a lot of work for only half of a credit. You spend a huge amount of time writing lab reports, and it is not a very enjoyable experience.",
    "It is a very good first lab. I believe this is the only lab class at Yale that provides a genuine introduction to what is expected in lab work. Take it if you plan to ever take another lab here.",
    "Unless you have to take it, don't. Look carefully at the requirements for your major before you decide whether or not you need to take this course; you could save yourself some agony.",
    "Chem 119L is the required lab for chem 118. If your pre-med, you take it because you have to. If you don't, then think twice before committing yourself to five hour labs and lengthy lab reports.",
    "Chemistry 119 is a tedious but overall useful class, especially for those thinking of being pre-med or a science major. It teaches useful laboratory practices that are not always stressed in high school. Some advice to those thinking about the class: some lab reports are extremely tedious and should be started in advance.",
    "I wouldn't recommend taking this lab. It's really time consuming and the quizzes are really difficult.",
    "This is a fairly fun lab course. The pre-lab quizzes can be unnecessarily tough\/random sometimes. It is a good intro lab course, though. Obviously it's necessary if you're a pre-med but if you'd like to try out a lab course to see if it's your thing this is a good one to take. That said, don't take it on unless you really want to\/like it.",
    "The primary weakness of the class is its' dependence on TAs. Most of the time this does not pose a problem, but when you get a horrible TA, this is a serious issue. Sometimes I feel that what is stated in the lab manual and in lab lecture and what is graded for in the lab report are two different things. The lab itself is not too bad, but the TAs can be horrible. Make sure to put sufficient effort into the lab reports and be sure to prepare for lab quizzes. If Candice Baird is an option as a TA for your section I advise that you run in the opposite direction.",
    "Only take the lab if it is necessary - it does not help the chem 118 course.",
    "A good class (though I suspect I like it a lot more now that it's over) that supplements the 118 curriculum decently well (and gives you lots of practice doing some calculations that might come in handy for 118, especially acid\/base calculations). The workload gets pretty heavy some weeks when a full report or a particularly tedious report is due, so be prepared. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE. Spend ample time doing the reports, and you should do pretty well on them. Pay attention during the pre-lab lectures and take notes so you'll know what to do for the report (the lab manual is very unclear sometimes). Quizzes aren't too bad (some were challenging, most were easy) as long as you read over the lab once or twice (I'd recommend twice) and pay attention to the equations and calculations involved.",
    "Don't take this class if you don't have to. But it is a very good class for premed requirements.",
    "Lab sucks - you'll be so happy when it's over. You'll make friends, and you'll all bitch and moan about it together.It's not impossible. The first few labs are easy, but then they all get really long and really hard. Start early.",
    "A bit of work...only try lab if you're sure you can handle it. Overall I would recommend the course as long as the student is aware of the work it entails.",
    "Chem119 was helpful in getting used to using lab equipment (especially with all the titrations.) I definitely would recommend taking it with Chem118. Because the lab is ahead of the lecture, you really understand the concepts when lecture gets to them.",
    "If you're in Chem 118, I don't recommend skipping out on the lab half of the class. If you're pre-med like most of us, you need it anyway. You learn quite a bit, and the experiments are surprisingly accurate (coming out of high school sciences where I used to run into 83% error, etc). Professor Parr is smug and sarcastic and awful, but the TF's are much easier to approach. Lab will still probably be the terror of your week, considering it's slated to run from 1 to 5 (you'll finish early most of the time), but it's only as bad as you make it really.",
    "A fast-paced lab designed for students who already know what they're doing. much of the concept learning has to be done beforehand, but the course packet is well made. could be improved by having more explanation before each lab, and quizzing students on material in the course packet (not including assumed knowledge of other formulas). I'd recommend it if you are confident with chemistry and are fine with lab reports.",
    "Chem 119 is a very difficult class to do well in if you do not allocate time properly to finish the lab report over the whole week. I recommend it to only those students who are very interested in the practical application of chemistry, or else need it as a pre-med requirement, and nobody else.",
    "Chem 119 is a pretty good lab if you have to take it. The concepts are not too complicated and the requirements for the lab write ups are pretty straightforward and explained in the lab manual. Be prepared to spend many hours on the reports, however, mostly trying to figure out excel and making word do what you want with tables etc. Also, a piece of advice: make sure you read the lab manual before the pre-lab lecture, because the quizes have a bad habit of being kind of tricky. Dont worry so much about the procedure, but definitely look at the example calculations. Overall though, this lab is a good experience and even helps you understand whats going on in lecture.",
    "Well, hate to repeat this, but: if you're premed, you ain't got a choice! Honestly, this class isn't that bad. Actually, it was easier than I expected it to be, though I did expect something terrible. It wasn't terrible. If you start the lab report in advance, this class could actually be EASY. Of course, no one ever does. Thus, lab was moderately challenging just because lab reports took a long time to put together(with lab reports due on Mondays, Sundays were always brutal: 4-8 hours of work, at least for me).Still, labs are interesting and they really do relate to what you're learning in 118, which is cool. Ask for help, because the TAs are generally really nice about helping you out.Grading's a bit harsh: quizzes are a sizable chunk (40%) of your grade, and often the questions seem too specific and mean. A lot of people complain about them, but that's unavoidable.There isn't a curve, as far as I know. But the lab reporters are graded pretty fairly, and you'll do well on them as long as you make sure you are neat and thorough.",
    "A lot of work. Take it if you need it. Lots of similar things to AP Chem. Quizzes are tough.",
    "A lot of time spent each week writing very tedious lab reports but realistically you're thinking about this class for a major or premed or w\/e so you really don't have a choice.",
    "Many of the experiments in Chem 119 should be a review of high school lab courses and a few will be in more depth. Take this if you're planning on pursuing chem further.",
    "It is a lab at the end of the day which means half a credit for a lot of work so dont take it unless you have to. However, if you do have to, its not bad at all.",
    "Well I assume that if you take Chem 118, you are probably going to take this course. Nonetheless, this lab is wonderful and I would definitely recommend it if you take it with professor Parr.",
    "I would recommend this lab if you need it for your major or if you really like chemistry.",
    "the workload is deathly",
    "Chemistry 119 wasn't my favorite course. It is a long afternoon every week, the weekly quizzes are stressful, and the material doesn't correlate chronologically with Chem 118 at all. I did like that we didn't have to write a complete lab report every week, so I didn't feel like this class gave me a bunch of pointless monotonous work, and I do feel like this class gave me a good introduction to and general knowledge of labs and lab equipment, procedures, etc.",
    "Chem 119L is difficult, as any intro lab course would be. The lab reports are time-consuming, but the labs themselves are not bad. The 4-hour session usually goes by quickly and the method of switching lab partners every week is a great way to meet other students interested in science. The lab experience is mostly dependent on your TA.",
    "This is one of those pre-med weed out courses, not because it needs to be hard in any way, just because there is so much unnecessary work, a very hard and at times rude Professor, and impossible quizzes.There is no reason why this course should be offered the way it is; because one starts and ends learning absolutely nothing, and for the amount of time invested in course, it is ridiculous how little is learned and how frustrating the course is.",
    "Take it if you have to. Dr. Parr is an effective teacher, and the course is basically what it sounds like it will be.",
    "Not a very good course at all, and a ton of work.",
    "Overall not a bad lab, make sure you study for the quizzes. Several of the labs are rather lengthy be sure to read over the manual so that you can complete all of the procedure easily",
    "This lab course covers a wide range of chemistry topics, most of which are review from AP Chemistry, although the lab material does not often coincide with lecture material from CHEM 118. Eventually, however, the topics and calculations from lab will help with calculations on CHEM 118 midterms and exams. The course involves a lot of work on a weekly basis- one lab report is due every week and one pre-lab quiz is administered every week. However, if you take detailed notes during pre-lab discussions and keep up with the classwork, the lab should not be overwhelming and you should be able to maintain a good grade. Even though the lab course is separate from CHEM 118, it is definitely a helpful review of material from AP Chemistry and is extra practice for calculations for CHEM 118.",
    "Chem 119 Lab was a standard, fair introduction to lab protocol and methods at Yale. While most of the experiments were effective at driving home important concepts in general chemistry, the methods we used were extremely tedious and out-dated. This notion was not just from me, but confirmed by Dr. Parr and my TA. The lab reports were very reasonable. The lab quizzes were stressful and for a half-credit, unnecessary. They detracted from listening to pre-lab lectures for overall meaning by demanding minute details. Overall, I took away the key concepts and feel acclimated to lab life at Yale. I just wished there was a less tedious way to do it. Dr. Parr is a great lab instructor. His sarcasm and wit help him cut the tension created by eager pre-meds and over-anxious freshmen. He is very talented at explaining tough concepts and procedures clearly and patiently repeating himself to those who still might not understand. The best parts of this course were when he was involved. Simply put, he is very good at teaching this lab. Avoid the TA Josh Karli at all costs. Other than that, take this course with Chem 118 or for pre-med requirements.",
    "Overall I would recommend chem 119. There are weekly quizzes in lieu of a final, which is nice at the end but makes every lab stressful. However, the grading is fair and the lab report writeups are not too bad.",
    "I recommend it, it's not that bad at all!",
    "It is a run through all of the basic laboratory techniques and experiments used in chemistry labs. It complements the Chemistry 118 class. I would recommend this course to someone currently taking Chem 118, because some of the concepts needed to understand the experiments aren't fully explained in the lab manual.",
    "It's a good introductory lab course. The experiments are pretty interesting and varied enough, and the workload can be pretty heavy but still within reason. I would recommend taking it, but it can definitely get a bit frustrating at times during the experiment, especially the ones where you're being graded for accuracy in results but you're having trouble with the lab while also being under a time constraint.",
    "I would recommend this lab to any student. The labs covered are more advanced than high school labs (not repetitive) while also not too complex. They serve as a great introduction to college lab (both writing reports and conducting experiments in a timely mannor).",
    "If I weren't a pre-med student I would probably not take this course, just because it is a lot of work for the credit that it is worth."
