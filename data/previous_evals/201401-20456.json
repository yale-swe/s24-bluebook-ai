    "Take it. Esp, if you are looking for an easy, light coursework Humanities credit.",
    "You will not learn much Buddhist philosophy. You will learn more history and, of course, art. There was very little focus on Zen Buddhism (iconic gardens, etc.), which I realized later I had expected more of. There's a greater focus on Buddhist deities I had never heard of, and the class really explores the Buddhist art not present in mainstream. Be wary of the expectations you have for this class. Additionally, the memorization for this class is unconventional. Lots of strange names (e.g. Avalokiteshvara, Yamantaka Vajrabhairava, etc.) that really do not have much emotional value or weight. So look into what Buddhist art actually IS before you take.",
    "Would definitely recommend.",
    "Easy class, take it for sure.",
    "Interesting Lectures (if you find art interesting) and a fun final-paper where you really get to write about anything that is relevant to the course that interests you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It gives you an introduction to a type of art\/religion you don't normally learn about.",
    "Great!",
    "Take it credit\/d\/fail, not for a letter grade if you're looking for an easy fifth class.",
    "Yes, this was a wonderful class!",
    "A simple choice for a fifth class, or for indulging a passing interest in art history.",
    "Easy (two tests which require memorizing images) and a short paper. Not a super interesting topic, but if you're interested, the professor is nice and the class is a breeze.",
    "Yes, definitely take this course at some point during your time at Yale. The material is very interesting and presented in a very stress-free environment. I grew to love and appreciate art as a result of this class!",
    "Yes, relatively easy. Not always interesting but a very passionate professor.",
    "I would recommend this to other students who are not necessarily art history majors because it's a great beginner course. Professor Mimi and the TA's are very approachable if you need help and the information is not something you need a ton of background on (maybe a little). The work load is rather light as well if you can memorize pictures.",
    "It's an interesting class and all material that you probably would not learn on your own time. The tests are a lot of memorization for someone who is not an art history major, but other than that it is relatively relaxing as a class.",
    "HSAR 143 is the second part of a course that focuses on the diverse visual cultures of the Buddhist world. The course begins with an overview of Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, and the key concepts\/figures we must know in order to be able to interpret art and architecture. We then moved into more region-specific studies, looking, for example, at Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka and Zen Buddhism in China and Japan. I enjoyed the class and would recommend it, although I at times found it a bit difficult to follow because I had no previous knowledge of the topic. Most of the time, however, I felt quite comfortable and I feel that I really learned a lot from this course. Section also helped clarify what we learned in lecture. The course workload is fairly light. We have 2 midterms (which are based on memorization of ~50 images that we talked about in class\/the ability to analyze or compare\/contrast them), and one final 10-15pg paper.",
    "Take this class! It's a great introduction to the History of Art department in an unconventional way.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The subject is fantastic and Mimi (the professor goes by her name) is one of the best I have had at Yale. She knows a lot about Buddhist art, she is extremely approachable and she is always willing to help. The course load is not very high: two midterms and a final paper (which does not have to be research-based). The TAs are also great! Without a doubt, take this class, even if you're not a humanities person.",
    "I would recommend, as it is one of the rare courses focus on East Asian traditions and artistry worth knowing."
