    "Mark Bradford was a fantastic teacher. I believed he did an amazing job of appealing to a variety of different student with an even larger variety of interests and soil ecology depths. Lecture material was presented clearly and to a sufficient depth to be interesting. However, the field portion of this class was pretty excessive. I understand the benefits of doing some of the field and lab work but the groups should be broken into smaller groups. Most of the time, several folks were sitting around. The whole process would have gone more smoohthly and everyone could have been working more if we had smalle groups.As for the TF, she was very nice but not particularly helpful in review sessions. More often during reviews, the students engaged in a dialogue to answer each others' questions.",
    "I thought this course was excellent. The material was interesting and it had the perfect combination of science and management using a biophysical lens. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in managing natural resources as it was made evident that what happens below ground is important!",
    "1. The textbook was extremely useful to the course, as many of the figures from lecture were drawn directly from the readings. For students without prior knowledge of soils or physical science\/chemistry this was essential because material was covered very quickly during lecture.4. The pace of the class was a little quick, but I appreciated having the last two weeks to work on analyzing data and group presentations.6. Ashley was a great resource for answering questions, and was highly organized in managing the class. I appreciated her willingness to generate study questions and hold review sessions before each exam, which was extremely helpful in directing my study time more efficiently.10. Mark moved through the concepts quickly, but was willing to go back and explain the information presented more clearly when asked. He always made sure to stop and ask for feedback and questions throughout the lectures. I found the use of \"take-home\" messages for each lecture to be very helpful in placing individual lectures within the broader context of the course.",
    "Please put some explanation on the slides with figures\/graphs. Some material comes from the book, some from in-class discussion, but it would be helpful if we knew what we were looking at when reviewing the slides because it's impossible to write down everything said in class.",
    "Question 12 - I gave Professor Bradford a rating of 2 because he is really enthusiastic about teaching, which I really appreciate, but speaks too quickly, and sometimes does not provide enough time in class to explore the management implications of the material presented.",
    "Mark was very responsive to suggestions. He speaks too quickly and doesn't need to run through the 80 minute class in 60 to provide room for questions. Better to take the full amount of time and explain things more clearly. Loved the enthusiasm!",
    "It would be good to have had more discussion of practical applications, but I feel like I really learned a lot about soil science.",
    "The field trip was convenient because so close, but not particularly interesting.",
    "Great class. Mark is really enthusiastic, clear, and dedicated. I highly recommend this course.",
    "Mark is a good scientist and asks good questions, and forces students to think critically about the information. However, the class lacked slightly in organization - we were challenging methodologies before we were confident with the basics, and we were studying hi-tech and \/ or large scale applications of soil science (global carbon stocks) before we were familiar with basic concepts and basic practices (going to a site and measuring soil types, ph, infiltration, etc.)",
    "This course spends too much time on soil carbon and fleshing out the methodology of different scientific papers. discussions were generally useless and student time could be much better spent learning more practical applications of soils science than rehashing for an entire hour, the details of papers they were assigned to read.",
    "I loved this course, and was very challenged by it. Mark is very committed to creating a solid learning environment, although the format of the class often worked against his best intentions.It is quite clear that there is strong demand for this course, and that it needs to be taught more often in order to avoid a class of 40 students, which made discussions laborious, inhibited question asking, and was just generally challenging. On the positive side, it was nice to have so many of my classmates learning this sort of material.A class of 12 or 15, or even 20 would have seemed like a luxury, and would have promoted learning.Mark is brilliant, and very responsive to student questions, although he often moves too fast to really absorb certain concepts or take accurate notes. I wish the powerpoint presentations had more content in them to go back and review. I wish there were problem sets or review questions each week. Perhaps the TA could help devise these. The field trip and lab component were awesome, but more of each would have been great. I liked how responsible we were for the production of lab knowledge and routine, but I should have liked more training and context for each of the processes. In addition, I found the division of labor in the lab group actually inhibited my overall understanding, since the pace was very rushed and I ended up just focusing on my finishing my own tasks as quickly as possible.",
    "course was good...more field trips\/labs would be helpful and add to the course",
    "Speaking too quickly through slides inhibits ability for students to process material.Mailing out some guiding discussion questions prior to those classes or breaking students up into smaller groups or having some students in charge of presenting on some readings... all of these are suggestions to deal with the problem that thediscussion sessions were not very rich and there was therefore not a good connection between scientific readings and lecture.It was too bad we never had a lecture on carbon. All the scientific readings were on carbon but we had no formal knowledge to analyze them with. The discussion sessions were not super helpful so as a result I did not learn a lot about soil carbon.Never really, aside from the test, had a chance to check in with myself or with the professor in between tests to see how I was comprehending material. Small quizzes, small paragraph assignments, small student presentations, ANYTHING on a weekly basis would be really helpful in the future to apply learning. Case studies are crucial.I feellike I have a good handle on the material now but I am not sure how I would use it professionally. Weekly assignments would be great for this and case studies.The student presentations at the end ofthe class werereally interesting. I would recommend putting those before November breakto break up the monotony of lecture and apply learning a bit. Then the exam at the end. Otherwise it feels like we lose steam at the end and never have a chance to breathe and process in the middle.",
    "I liked that the professor moved quickly through the material, and that he focused extensively on discussion and class participation.",
    "During the first part of the course, I thought that we were moving quickly through the material, often jumping to a new topic before completely comprehending the ones before it. Course discussions were helpful, and the field trip helped to put things in context. It would have been useful to have a weekly problem set or at least one question, structured similarly to exam questions, to make sure all students understand the course material.",
    "This is an important course for MFs - but it was heavy on the organic chemistry side of things and light on the management perspective. I certainly have a greater knowledge of soil science - but we should have talked more about how to apply that knowledge to real world management.",
    "14. It was helpful, but a lot of it was less relevant to agriculture that I had hoped.",
    "I have nothing to add.",
    "Q9: Didn't learn much except how to wield a soil corer duringfield trip; that exercise should be treated like an opportunity to learn what is being looked for and how the methods used will enable that (instead of the current treatment of the \"let-the-minions-blindly-collect-our-samples\" approach - this is why there were so many errors in the data entry: students didn't really understand how what they were doing fit into the bigger picture.)Q12: Mark covers material far too quickly in class lectures, and is not as thorough as the highly varied level of student expertise demands. I think he knows this...",
    "The pace of the lectures was fairly quick but the instructor seemed very conscious of this and tried to adjust accordingly. It's easier to try to keep up when you can tell the instructor cares about the learning."

    "Lectures were incredibly informative and concepts were explained effectively",
    "Lecture material, especially on soil biota, nitrogen cycling, water-temperature relations.",
    "I really enjoyed learning the basics of soil science. The class went through the Brady textbook pretty thoroughly and I definitely had a much better handle on topics like CEC, water in soil and basic soil characteristics down by the end of the midterm and final exams.I really liked the format of an early midterm and early final. Both of these tests definitely solidified my knowledge and understanding of these topics. I thought the tests were fair and that as long as you put in a lot of study hours, you could do well. The earlier dates also made it work well with other classes - spreading out the workload. I enjoyed doing the small presentation at the end of the semester as a chance to dive into a topic.",
    "I am so glad that this course existed; Soil studies are so important for ecosystem studies, agriculture, forest management and watersheds.The class provided a solid introduction to major soil ecology concepts. I was so glad that we had a small taste of field and lab work, and that paper reading and soil-relevant statistical methods were introduced.Thank-you for the ecological focus!",

    "Refining of the field portion",
    "The discussions - try not to have the conclusion every time be we don't know or there is so much uncertainty. Also, I thought the first one was way intense for the amount of material we had covered up to that point - very intimidating!Also, the lab work seemed a bit like the students were being used. Especially when we found out they hadn't even spread the compost. Consider eliminating.",
    "I would have liked to focus on more applied issues of soil science (agriculture, forestry, etc) rather than the fairly strong focuson theoretical issues during the semester. I gained a good working knowledge of soil structures, nutrient cycles, modeling, and current knowledge gaps, but would have liked time to discuss how these soil characteristics relate to other areas that students are working on. This class could have made better connections with other forestry and natural science courses with a greater focus on applied research.",
    "The \"field trip\" was a thinly disguised ploy to make graduate students perform free labor for a PhD project. The learning from this experience was minimal, and the attitude that the professor and TAs brought to it was patronizing.Maybe next time we can go out in the field, dig some soil pits, and talk about the soil. Or, if you truly wish to teach us about bulk density and pH, spend more time explaining what's going on rather than giving us instruction sheets and staying there only to make sure we don't break something.",
    "There was little discussion of the topic's management implications. Or, if there was, it was too vague, like \"be careful of adding too much carbon to the soil!\"It'd be nice if we could take actual field trips and identify soils etc.",
    "This was my first soils course and because I am graduating it will probably be my only course in soils. For that reason I feel that it is extremely important that the course cover the fundamentals in great detail, and I was unsatisfied several times in the semester when Mark and\/or Ashley zipped through a topic that I feel I really need to understand.For example, the lecture on pH went so fast that Mark ended about 25 minutes early. Efficiency is great but in a 75-minute class this is way too short. There was plenty of time for questions but there were no questions--and speaking for myself this was because I didn't understand the material enough to ask a question.Ashley's lecture on the nitrogen cycle had the same problem--the lecture lasted about 45 minutes.Even if the basics can be covered this fast, there must be ways to explain the material from a different angle, or to simply slow down--take the time to use analogies, give more examples, whatever teaching tools that there doesn't seem to be time for--there's time for them!",
    "The discussions were really challenging. I think that the class was too big to facilitate a helpful discussion where people are not just trying to say something to get points for participation. It would have been helpful to take time at the beginning of each discussion to summarize three key take aways from each paper before launching into the nitty gritty of the methods sections.",
    "More field time!",
    "The field trip\/ lab work was a waste of time. Discussions should be broken into sections of no more than ten student to facilitate participation.",
    "I think this class has a lot of potential. Mark is a great teacher with more enthusiasm than most teachers at FES. I don't know how useful the paper readings and discussions were for the majority of the class. Coming in with very basic knowledge of soils made the first few papers pretty tough to follow. I know Mark was frustrated that more of us weren't participating, but I think many of us simply didn't understand the papers all that well. Perhaps a few of the paper\/discussion days could be cut, but Mark could explain what is going on in key papers in a lecture format. This could help really visually explain what these methods are, what they mean and what key findings were. We could also be asked to read the papers as a supplement. Shimi uses this method - we read the paper and they explains the papers very thoroughly and by the end we all understand what the experiment was really well. I know this is a much more passiveway of learning, but I think I actually would have gotten more out of it. I also know that there are some students who want to do soil science research. But this class seems like its the intro to soil science class, not readings in soil science. I think those folks wouldn't mind losing some discussions if they know that there is a follow up class in the spring that does a thorough literature review.So many of us will be managers, so I think after learning the basic characteristics of soil, it would be really helpful to get some insight with soil managers about how to make it better. For example, we could talk to someone from NRCS about soil management practices. We did a field trip to Stone Barns in New York last year in our Farm Bill class and it sounds like they have a fascinating compost project that those interested in ag would really enjoy. Hearing from real soil managers would be great, especially if they showed us how they are actually improving their soils. Another example - in Silviculture we take a field trip up to Central Mass to see the water system that supplies Boston. More locally we could hear from New Haven water managers on some of the lands in Guilford\/Branford to understand how soil plays a role in their management practices.I think the class needs a ton more lab time. Most people are hoping to go into some sort of land management and the ability to go outside and dig a soil pit and know what we are looking at seems key. Maybe additionally to have some labs where we get to experience different soil types and textures to reinforce concepts? I think replacing some of the discussions with this experience would be beneficial. Obviously we are in one soil zone so there isn't a ton of variety. But we could check out a forested soil, ag soil (at the Yale farm would be interesting), and something along the coast?Like I said, I think the presentations were a good feature of the class. Perhaps you could provide a more thorough suggestion on how to present. Our group choose two main papersto compare and I think that provided the appropriate amount of material given the time. The groups who presented tons and tons of findings had presentations that seemed a little all over the place and they generally ran out of time, so I do think that providing a framework would be helpful.",
    "This class was designed for fewer people than were enrolled; well handled by Prof Bradford given the situation, but it was nonetheless very difficult to have productive discussions with so many people. Having more TAs to allow students to break into smaller groups would have yielded better discussions.Material wise, I think that we covered a lot of important bases.There were a number of topics, however, where I felt we jumped between information that was extremely basic, to the cutting edge of the field and back again, without real understanding of the building blocks in between (mechanisms, more in-depth discussions of microorganismal communities, factors that effect nutrient cycling, etc).I ended up frustrated sometimes, feeling a bit stranded without more of that 'inbetween' knowledge (this may have been an unrealistic hope for an intro class, however).",
    "The lectures. The lectures were almost straight from the book. White background, with graphs from the book!! Yikes. I think it would have been really interesting to have a case-study type of thing for the lectures with practical information. I.e. the tilling\/no till topic could have been the soil aggregate lecture! Assume the students have read the text then go ahead and get into the practical application of texture in an engaging way. For instance, I recently saw a NRCS presentation by a soil scientist talking to farmers and ranchers who did a soil aggregate stability test with no till and conventional till soil clods in baskets in a tube of water. Very illuminating of the book and lecture material. And a great discussion of r species microbes eating the organic matter and how the hyphae and roots etc that make stability were broken up. There was even a microscopic video of a root pushing through the soil and exuding stuff! And a movie with a worm pulling a whole corn leaf down a hole! Bring it to life! It would probably be more fun than just lecturing on the powerpoint too.Basically, I'm trying to say that soil science can be abstract. So using things that are more engaging and bringing things to life would go a long way in helping students understand the topic. I also think soil science can sometimes be abstract in its application. Current issues OTHER THAN CARBON should be discussed. I know carbon is all the rage, but there are many other interesting topics, and again global soil carbon is pretty abstract.",
    "None.",
    "Class Size- too many students.Primary Literature- narrow focus.Very weak to practical management issues.Uninvolved teaching fellows.Very hands off approach.Lab work and analysis minimally educational.Discussion sessions were a nightmare that I dreaded attending.",
    "Organization (see 15) and content - too much of the course was geared towards academic study of global carbon stocks and not the practical applications of soil science that would be more relevant to majority of us as practitioners - how to manage the soil in a particular site so that it is amenable to forests, agriculture, etc.",
    "The review of physical and chemical properties of soils was more challenging for me than the work on nutrients and soil biology. I wonder how this material could be more integrated and robust....I would say that the size of the class should be much reduced, there should be problem sets or review questions to go over the material. The lecture powerpoints could contain a little more of the content and opinions expressed in class. Then we could review them ahead of time and speak more intelligently during class. I thought the brady and weil text was an awesome reference, and I really liked reading primary scientific literature for the discussions.I would have like more material on soil ecology and soil biota, and more on carbon cycle modeling. Also, the statistics used in this class really assumed a basic familiarity with certain concepts and skills i lack, and still lack. Perhaps a primer for those students who haven't taken stats would be useful.",
    "more hands on material",
    "See above diatribe :)Carbon gapsConnection lecture - readingNot applying the material into a professionally relevant settingNo incorporating and using knowledge through small assignments during the course (instead of having assignments around reading, send out discussion questions or something to make those sessions more interactive and then require assignemnts around the lectures - they don't even have to be graded just a way to use the material)Schedule of presentations exams",
    "The field trips could have communicated the same information in less time.",
    "Discussions need to be smaller, as not everyone had the opportunity\/or felt compelled to participate. Multiple small groups would have been more productive. A short weekly problem set or question would have also been helpful.",
    "The readings should be broader. I understand that it is important to look at some of the finer details regarding soil ecology, nutrient cycling, carbon storage etc. but that knowledge is less useful without discussing how to apply. I would highly suggest including more reading about managing soil resources or restoration or degradion of soil - I think it would add a broader, and thus valuable, perspective to the course.",
    "The rate was pretty fast overall, especially the first half of the semester. I also wish that there had been more practical information (as far as management implications for things OTHER than carbon sequestration go).",
    "The class size prevented discussions from being as useful as they could have been.",
    "The discussion sections could be improved as were sometimes rather tepid. Perhaps more structure, such as a short introductory lecture on the readings that gives more context, might help. This was done for one or two and I felt like it aided discussions. Sometimes there was just a lot of complexity for an introductory course (e.g., soil carbon models) that naturally made it difficult to have more than just a surface conversation about them. That said, the exposure alone was still useful.",
    "More field tripsEither limit class size, or split the group in half (at least) for discussions. (or, offer every year so students have more opportunity to take it and don't flood it! obviously there's demand.)Ssssslllloooooooooowwwww doooooowwwwwnnnnnDemands\/requirements for student presentations were so strict and limiting that it wasn't that fun to design",
    "The tests seemed a bit harder to read than most classes - in terms of what to prepare for as well as how to interpret the actual questions. This may be because of the sheer amount of details packed into this course, which is unavoidable. There is a lot of material."

So maybe splitting into a couple of days and watching the technique be run through in smaller groups by the TA.",
    "It would have been much better if we had broken into smaller groups for the discussions! They were unwieldywith so many people.In terms of subject matter, it was great to have a chance to read papers with Prof Bradford who knows the field so well.The discussions near the end of class where we really focused on one paper were the most rewarding for me.",
    "The discussions were way too much carbon. And also, too focused on reading the methods of papers. I understand the professor's desire for students (especially those MEMs!) to be able to truly understand the science their basing policy off of, but maybe we could do that like one time. I think there is plenty of room to do more practical things !",
    "Yes, the discussion complimented the lectures. Discussion helped to understand the contents on the subject and prevailing uncertainties in the field",

    "Great TA. Responsive and helpful.",
    "Don't offer review sessions and then ask the students to answer the questions. People are there because they are looking for help and guidance - getting a half right answers from their peers is not helpful.",

    "Instructor: Ashley Dawn Keiser \u00a0I think Ashley was great!One way to improve would be to make sure you follow through on what you say. For example, for the presentations we were supposed to get feedback and that never really happened. Just be sure to keep your word!",
    "Instructor: Ashley Dawn Keiser \u00a0Ashley provided good support as a discussion co-leader and was responsive to student questions. At the beginning of the semester she made it clear that she was available to help throughout the semester, and was very organized in setting up labwork.",
    "Instructor: Ashley Dawn Keiser \u00a0Ashley was very sweet, very communicative, and prompt with information, but she was a little lost during the review sessions.",

I am glad I recorded it so I could listen again. I would have liked more guidance on the big picture of the lab work, not just the specifics, and a slower pace with the field and lab work that allowed more integration and question asking.",
    "Instructor: Ashley Dawn Keiser \u00a0Ashley and Mark could have communicated more about the scope of the tests; Ashley's review sessions got tied up in minutiae that never came up on the actual exams. Also, it was frustrating that Ashley sometimes got herself confused in review sessions explaining the very questions she'd asked us to look at. She was great about following up later with explanations, but it would have been nice if she'd prepared more in-depth answers for her own review questions.",
    "Instructor: Ashley Dawn Keiser \u00a0She was overall very helpful!",
    "Instructor: Ashley Dawn Keiser \u00a0There were many questions that she was not able to answer right away, however, she would always follow up and send out updated answers to most of our questions. She even took the time to send out notes about things that may have been fuzzy in class. Also, soil science is a quickly changing and complex subject which does not always have a definitive answer to a given question at this time. Her review sessions were very helpful in putting all the pieces together after trying to just absorb everything in lecture."
