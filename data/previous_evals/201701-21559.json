    "E and M, Maxwell's equations, some quantum, optics. Emphasis on problem solving",
    "the particulars of electromagnetic physics.",
    "This class was not the most informative I've taken but of the STEM classes offered at Yale, it's certainly one of the better ones. Though they ran through quantum, circuits and so much more stuff that I can't remember, the professors were very friendly and accessible.",
    "Problem solving skills, understanding physics concepts comprehensively, deriving equations representing physical phenomena",
    "This course was the continuation of PHYS 200. The material covered started with Electromagnetism and ended with Quantum Theory with a brief foray into waves.",
    "I feel that the online lectures improved my knowledge of electricity and magnetism in physics; however, lecture was useless.",
    "I never learned any E&M in high school aside from some simple circuits, so 201 definitely was a lot of new material to intake in the short span of a semester. However, I learned a lot, including electric and magnetic fields, electromagnetic waves, optics, and some basic quantum mechanics. I feel like I retained a good amount of it (even if my final grade doesn't reflect this).",
    "I learned a lot in this course about electricity and magnetism, especially in new topics such as quantum mechanics and the properties of waves. I also learned a lot about how to go about solving a problem that, at first glance, seems impossible. Working in groups really helped with this course and I'm so glad I took 201 because I think the flipped classroom nature and the focus on groupwork and problem solving really helped me gain a better understanding of Physics.",
    "I learned about electro magnetism. Also preparing for a course with a flipped classroom, since much of the learning took place on our own. It was important to take good notes.",
    "Electricity and Magnetism, optics, basic quantum mechanics, problem solving skills, teamwork and independent learning skills",
    "I learned a lot about how to think through physics problems.",
    "Learned the introductory concepts of electricity, magnetism, optics, and quantum mechanics as described by the description.",
    "I learned a great deal about physics, especially electromagnetism and relativity",
    "Physics 201 provides a sturdy introduction to the second half of modern physics subjects. Professor Shankars lectures move dependably and comprehensively through the major areas of Electricity, Magnetism, Light, Optics, and Quantum Mechanics. Professor Shankar excels at showing the beauty of unified theories, the ingenuity of physics discoveries, and how to develop a keen analytical intuition for physics problems. He shows an interconnectivity in our thinking about physical reality and demonstrates the remarkable features of that reality. Of course, PHYS 201 is flipped, so there is also the in-class, collaborative component. That aspect of the class intends to promote problem solving and collaboration; I think this claim was to be empirically tested with a trial through the physics department. (Im curious as to the results.)",
    "Problem solving in teams, teaching myself an entire semester's worth of physics on my own\/with TAs.",
    "Few, I felt the class added very little",
    "We learned electrostatics, magnetism, waves, optics, circuits, quantum. We learned how to work in groups and how to solve problems.",
    "I learned all about electricity and magnetism. My goodness.",
    "An introduction to a variety of physics topics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Classes that were half lecture half problems were good. Weaknesses: Doesn't match up well with Shankar's course, making what material is covered slightly confusing.",
    "The flipped classroom is not necessarily impractical, but certainly means that this class requires more time than normal. There is essentially double the number of class hours in addition to problem sets and pre-class quizzes. I would have preferred if this class had been the traditional lecture style.",
    "I personally did not benefit from the flipped classroom approach. I would have preferred an in-class lecture and mandatory section outside of class in addition to the office hours provided on Wednesdays. However, given my performance I think that this course structure was not unproductive and that with more independent practice outside of class I could have been more successful.",
    "Very interesting material, video lectures entertaining and well done, less then ideal organization of the class. Did not like the flipped classroom structure, as lectures in class felt redundant and time did not seem to have been well spent doing practice problems together",
    "This course should not be a flipped class. It simply is not the kind of course to do it in because i) the material does not actually follow the material in the lectures and ii) there is no incentive to go to class because other than learning the material you also have assigned problem sets to do at home! This course also needs to precisely determine the amount of mathematical knowledge required to succeed; while 180 uses no multivariable calculus and 260 does, it is unclear what kind of mathematical knowledge is required in 200.",
    "Flipped classes do not work for intro STEM classes. We end up having to go over the material in class anyways, so why not just keep the class as a lecture? We end up not getting enough practice in class (which is what the whole point of a flipped class is), which makes taking the midterm and final really difficult.",
    "Flipped classrooms do not work in this context, especially where the online course varies so much from that of the \"lecture\" where we \"problem-solved\" endlessly.",
    "200 and 201 are \"flipped\" classes, and while I was open to the whole thing, I realize at the end of the semester that I would learn much better if the class was a regular lecture. The concept of doing problems in class is well-meaning, but we didn't actually get through that many problems in class, and it always felt like we were wasting time. I would much rather sit in a lecture and then have one or two example problems towards the end of the lecture to give us something tangible.",
    "The content of the course was awesome, the structure was awful. Flipped classroom is completely ineffective for physics. I often had questions about the video lectures that were then difficult to ask in class, I acquired virtually no personal connection with either professor or any of the TA's because we did not have lecture followed by section, and the \"challenging\" group problems given to us in class were often easy, yet we often spent huge amounts of time on them. The table that I was at often spent the majority of the class doing nothing or other work, waiting for the rest of the class, and I observed other tables experiencing the same thing. It was quite frankly an awfully organized system.",
    "I thought this course was very strong in its emphasis on group work and in its structure. Professor Caines was excellent at answering questions and the lectures at the start of class were very helpful to understand the material presented in Shankar's lectures. The course moved at a good pace and I think the problem sets really contributed to my understanding of the material. It would have been helpful if we had moved through more problems in class, however. We usually only had time for one or two example problems and it would have been good if we had time to go through more of these.",
    "I think classes could have been better organized because they often started out strong, then we had a really long time working on one problem or not really doing anything, and we would all be distracted by the time we solved the problem as a class.",
    "The lectures delivered by Shankar, although very well done and very enjoyable, no longer sync up with the class itself. I spent a great deal of time and energy just figuring out what of Shankar's lectures was relevant for my purposes in the class and how to use his theoretical and proof based lectures in applications. A lot of times the lectures did not teach us what we actually needed and they taught us a lot of other material instead, which is interesting, but inconvenient in a STEM student's overbooked schedule. I think the lectures ought to be redone in a condensed way. Also, I am quite unhappy with Professor Robinson's teaching; he is very unclear. The biggest strength of this class is Professor Caines and the TAs, Anthony and Volodymyr. All three of them are amazing: very clear, approachable, helpful-- I am so thankful for them.",
    "The support system of the course was definitely one of its strengths and the flipped classroom setup was one of its weaknesses.",
    "The opportunity to work out the problems in class instead of a lecture was very useful to me. Professors Caines and Robinson are both very fair and explain concepts well in class. The main weakness is that the material covered in Shankar's lectures is not very relevant to what is covered in class which in turn is not very relevant to whats on the problem sets and exams. Shankar's lectures are very much proof based, but the written portions of the class are focused on problem solving.",
    "This course was flipped. It was a lot more work because of this, and much harder to learn the material well. I would not take this course again.",
    "The strengths of PHYS 201 might be summed up as flipped classroom--in theory. Lectures can be watched at students preferred time, place, and speed. The core of the material will be acquired on ones own in a setting perhaps more flexible than a regular lecture. Interestingly, being unable to ask questions seems less of a loss because (a) Professor Shankar provides such thorough explanations and (b) time in class can always be availed for questions. Class time also becomes chance to collaborate and practice problems with support from TAs. The weaknesses of PHYS 201 would then be flipped classroom--in practice. The difference between live and taped performance does not seem insignificant, and watching the lectures can feel somewhat canned (Although, I reiterate Professor Shankar is an outstanding lecturer.) Also, the course doesnt always maintain a strong correspondence between the short in-class reviews, the lectures, and the quizzes\/problem sets\/exams. Each emphasizes different parts and the overall effect can be disorienting. Finally, student collaboration can be alright, but the in-class work can fall on the same couple of students with students arriving to class at all different levels of preparedness. Two suggestions come to mind. First, try to align the course material a little better. Second, maybe offer more systematic practice problems, perhaps listed from a textbook, so that students can secure the basics before delving into the Phys201-style questions.",
    "This course needs to change. It has great content: quantum mechanics, advanced circuits, magnetism, etc. are all extremely interesting and\/or relevant to physics and\/or engineering. However, I found it VERY difficult to learn in this class because the curriculum Shankar follows in his videos does not line up with the curriculum we are expected to know in class. Frank and Helen are very nice and very helpful, and they certainly know their physics. However, I learned everything I did ON MY OWN, and not necessarily in Shankar's videos because I sometimes was not sure what he was saying actually applied to our class (on many occasions, it didn't). Also, instead of actually doing practice problems all class like the flipped classroom setting calls for, we spent more than half of each class going over the material we had already watched about. I'm not saying that wasn't helpful, but it wasn't the point of the flipped classroom. I would suggest that instead of trying the flipped classroom (which I don't think works for this class), the class is a normal lecture teaching the material. Then instead of doing practice problems during class (or holding pset sessions on Wednesday nights that everyone inevitably has to go to in order to complete the pset), I think it'd be much more helpful to have mandatory section, but instead of classic lecture\/seminar-style section, it would be problem sessions, where you would work with your classmates on problem, like you would in class in the typical flipped setting. Having the TA's help during the aforementioned Wednesday evening sessions was AMAZING-- seriously, Anthony and Vlad are SO SMART and SO HELPFUL. However, they always ended up having to practically teach us the course in addition to trying to help us with problems. Lastly, working with others to solve problems was really really great, and teaches great teamwork skills and builds really amazing friendships (nothing is more bonding than an impossible physics question). I don't think that component of the class should be taken away. (Side note, though, all our problems were solved in pairs or teams, and yet when it came to the exams, we had no one by our side. It makes sense to take a test on your own, but maybe the class should have more practice with that, rather than pushing all problems as \"team\" problems). Ok sorry I still have more but it's only because I really love physics and really thought this class was conducted poorly. But while I'm on exams, it was very stressful to just have a midterm and a final, and the gaps in between left many students unengaged. For that reason, I think there should be more evaluations (NOT the MC quizes after each lecture, those were more confusing than helpful and exams were never MC, so they really weren't very helpful). Maybe one or two unit tests that count less than the midterm and final would be more helpful? Then you'd incentivize students to actually learn the material on time (most don't!) and to understand the material before a few days before the final.",
    "I think the biggest problem was the lack of connection between the lectures and the material needed for the class. Shankar's lectures do not really correspond to what we did, there were lots of derivations, and I believe we would have done much better to have just been taught the material. Additionally, I found I was never taught the material well enough to make the jumps needed for the exams. I would remove the flipped classroom style, or film new lectures, or make it clear the lectures are fairly different, have separate pset office hours and regular mandatory sessions to go over material.",
    "The strengths are the fact that it's a flipped classroom, I really liked being able to watch the lectures at my own pace, pausing and rewinding when necessary. I liked that the problem sets were shorter because we had lectures for homework, and the quizzes helped us make sure we understood. I also liked working on problems with a group in class, I think it really helped teach me how to approach the problems. The weakness of this course was that sometimes the in class explanations were not explained very well.",
    "The strengths and weaknesses are at once in the flipped classroom style. It was a strength because you really get to know your \"table\" of peers and can work out problems and study with them, etc. but if you're confused about a lecture topic, the original lecturer is not there to helpful you. Although Professor Caines and the TAs did a great job of walking around and answering any questions we had, the curricula of Shankar's lectures to the class feel slightly different and requires a mentality shift\/way of solving problems.",
    "The flipped-class style isn't great. I find that I often am not actually learning the material. The focus on problem-solving is an advantage of the class, but there is almost nothing connecting the lecture videos of proofs that we watch and the problems we do in class. I wish there were more of a connection between, even if it were a list of essential information to get out of each video that we would need for problems."

    "If you like reverse classroom (more problem solving and less lecture), then take this over other intro. If not, don't",
    "No.",
    "Yes but only if you like the flipped classroom layout, watch lectures consistently and enjoy physics. Also, get a tutor!",
    "I'd say if you want to learn more advanced material and take 200\/201, be prepared to do a lot of self-learning\/clarification. Use your time wisely, as video lectures\/classrime\/problem sets together take up a lot of your time. The physics is interesting, but be prepared to not always understand all of it because you move pretty quickly at times.",
    "Do not take it. Either take 180 (if you want an easier class) or 260 (if you want a bit of a challenge), do not take 200\/201, because you will not retain as much as you would in the other classes.",
    "Never, ever, until the classroom is \"un-flipped\" and professors who are capable of providing quality explanations are running lecture.",
    "Trying to avoid this class because it is a flipped classroom while also taking the right level introductory physics might be impossible for you, as it was for me. I couldn't move up to 260-261 because I didn't have multivariable calculus under my belt before I got here, and I definitely didn't want to move down to 180-181 because I actually wanted to be taken seriously as an astrophysics major. So I was stuck in 200-201, and honestly I would much rather want the class to be a regular lecture than the flipped class. But you have to deal with what you get, and I dealt with it. The material in 200-201 is actually pretty interesting, and Professor Caines and Robinson definitely know the material very well, but again the whole flipped classroom is a big downer.",
    "I would not recommend this course except for those interested enough in the content to weather the awful organization.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any student who wants to study Physics in an intense manner. The workload was definitely great and to succeed in the course, one had to go above and beyond what was required to really understand the material. However, in my opinion, the final and midterm were both very fair - they just required a lot of outside work and studying. However, the professors were always available to answer questions and were willing to meet with students almost anytime. Section on Wednesday nights was also very helpful where the TAs would answer any questions we had on the problem sets and we could work with other students on them. Overall, I really enjoyed the course, even more than the first semester of Physics 200. I thought I had a better handle on the course and on how much work I needed to put in.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who came into college with the same level of physics experience as me, which was AP C in high school, because it went beyond the AP topics but I think any faster would have been too much for me.",
    "Really depends if you can do the flipped learning thing. I really liked it, but also if meant that this class was my life for 2 semesters, especially because I came in with an insufficient physics background so I was learning everything for the first time while for other people it was review. The TAs are amazing, although Anthony is leaving, and Professor Caines is also amazing!",
    "I would probably not recommend this course to another student. Though the topics are interesting, the flipped classroom setup makes learning the material unnecessarily difficult and tedious.",
    "If you want a more challenging and comprehensive class than 180\/181, but don't have advanced enough a background for 260\/261, take 200\/201.",
    "No. It was awful.",
    "My recommendation is mixed. If you are considering the course, there are two key factors I would keep in mind. First, I do think the course material can be much more interesting than PHYS 181. The additional Maxwell work and quantum mechanics are interesting topics to encounter, and Professor Shankars lectures are a boon. Second, dont underestimate the flipped classroom. For some, its an advantage, but the style will not be for everyone (myself included). If youre unsure, find Professor Shankars lectures online. Try watching a few and realize that the class is not much more than these strung together with problem sets and two hour-long practice sections each week (i.e. class).",
    "In it's current form, I would not recommend this course. In terms of content, the material is so interesting and exciting, especially quantum mechanics. However, the course is not well organized or well taught, and so in order to learn these interesting topics, you have to teach yourself, in addition to watching hours of videos a week. Unfortunately, with 3-4 other courses on your plate, this is just not something that is easy to fit into a busy Yale schedule.",
    "No, I would suggest 181 for the easier grading or 261 for the challenging material, not the same material with worse instruction",
    "I would recommend this course because the flipped classroom style of the course really helps me learn at my own pace. Working in a table group also helps you learn how to do the problems and makes it much more comfortable than a lecture. The concepts do get tricky, but if you are willing to put in the effort it is doable.",
    "I'd recommend. It *is* a flipped classroom again (like 200) but you really get to know your \"table\" and can use them as a study group, etc. Professor Caines and the TAs are immensely helpful. You just have to see through Shankar's never-ending derivations in the lecture videos and you'll be fine using whatever equations he spews out as his final result in the problem sets. Having said that, I do wish we had more lectures in-class because then the problem sets and exams would line up more with what we had learned. If you took 200, you'd know about the in-class problems. Yeesh. They were usually extremely hard and your table often wouldn't have enough time to finish it before the professors start going over it (with varying amounts of detail) and then move onto the next question. Luckily, they post more in-depth answers online after class. But still. Also, in 201 the professors lecture more in-class (which I felt was amazing.) Remember, that final can be 100% of your grade if you do better on it than everything else combined. Also, Wednesday night (can-I-make-it-to-Woads?) study hall saved my life many times this semester. TAs are there to help you and your peers push through the pset. It's quite the experience. Electricity and magnetism (including quantum mechanics) are really fascinating subjects and everyone's mind usually gets blown. Just remember what I said about really relying on the final results of Shankar's complex (but brilliant) derivations and that's most of what you need to apply to the class problems. But yeah, I really bonded with my \"table\" and have increased by number of friends, so there's that. But have I increased my GPA? Not so sure about that.",
    "No. It doesn't teach you well, you'll just be perpetually confused (unless they fix the structure of the class). The instructors are great and helpful, I only blame the flipped-class structure and the way the lecture videos do not connect to the material directly."
