   "comments": [
    "very interesting subject matter, practical with real life applications",
    "I liked how the information applied to the real world. I also liked the fact that our final project was based on helping out New Haven or a real-wold need. That is very rare at Yale.",
    "This was a very interesting and useful class. The number and types of topics varied giving students a wide exposure. Class materials were supported by the real life experiences of the instructors.",
    "i never knew what was goin on in this class. there's a syllabus but we never stuck to it. things were assigned last-minute and it seemed like a lot of the lectures were given \"on the fly\" without much preparation. I had high hopes for this course, but they never were reached.",
    "I really liked the course and thought it was very in line with my interests. I liked that much of the work revolved around applying skills to the real world compared to just for academic purposes. I also enjoyed the exercises and skills we did toward the end of the class. In terms of improvements, I would try to have more discussions and class interactions as it was mainly lecture style, especially in the beginning. Also, I would have tried to tie in the readings more so that people had more incentive to actually read them.",
    "strengths: the topics we cover in class are extremely interesting. The instructors brings field experience to the discussions. I feel that what we learn is useful and pertinent to current public health issues. We have a significant amount of freedom in terms of our final project topics.weaknesses: the type of specific emergency response language was difficult to understand. Some assignments are not very clear.",
    "I thought that this was a solid course and a good introduction to the workings of public health emergency preparedness. The strengths were the quality of the insight of both instructors and the \"war-stories\" which provide excellent learning opportunities. With respect to weaknesses, I would have made the readings a bit more targeted. While I understand the importance of understanding the regulatory basis, I think that had the readings been more explicitly highlighted (as oppossed to saying, read the 3 entire preparedness manuals, e.g.) more would be retained. Additionally, I enjoyed when academic literature was included - I think that creates an important balance. Regarding the project assignments, I thought they were very valuable and frankly, it was easy to tell who did the work and was prepared and who was not. I would suggest, that there be more of those assignments (they could just be shorter), but I found them valuable - particularly the final project (which again, you could easily differentiate between those who spent time and those who did it the night before).",
    "The course was a great introduction to historical public health disasters and evaluation of how preparedness should change. The certification process for disaster management and preparedness is very useful in a practical real world setting.",
    "I thought it was very interesting and a more real-world, \"professional\" school sort of course than most courses at YSPH. There was a focus on having tools and skills and references for when we have that job someday. Great.",
    "I enjoyed the course and it's narrowed focus on emergency response and preparedness topics within public health."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Both are Excellent. Personal experiences make the class interesting",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0I think the main instructor was Ms. McGovern, so I will talk more about her. (Dr. Bogucki always had an interesting perspective, by the way.) Ms. McGovern was very knowledgeable and passionate, although, at times, it seemed like she didn't have the class outlined which was slightly chaotic. I am not complaining as these were usually the most interesting classes. Overall, I preferred the classes where Ms. McGovern just taught and didn't have PowerPoints. They were the most interesting.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Excellent instructor. Willing to help students beyond the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0sandy didn't do much of the lecturing. i wish she had because she was awesome to listen to and very intelligent. Joanne did much of the lecturing. I was often lost listening to her.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0I thought Sandy did a good job but she was not always there due to other responsibilities. She always had good and constructive feedback to give and I liked her presentation style. Again a weakness was that she was not always in class. I thought Joanne McGovern did a good job as well and was really invested in us students. I like hearing her stories and experiences in the field. I thought her style was a bit harsh on students at times and so at times she could be intimidating but on the whole I learned well from her more direct feedback.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0She is very dedicated to the class. Her lectures and discussions are always interesting. When she could not be in the class physically, she would phone in or skype to participate. I wish that the instructors would use more field-experience in lectures.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0I will evaluate both Sandy&Joanne.Joanne was the primary, I thought that she did a great job of providing on-the-ground experience. I think the discussions were appropriate and insightful. I think that Joanne's real-life experience was unparalleled and was an excellent compendium of practical experience.Sandy brought a similar excellent insight and when she was there was a good foil for Joanne. In particular, the knowledge of the academic literature seemed to be pretty good and should have been brought up more.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Sandy and Joanne were great instructors with some amazing connections. They were able to have guest lecturers talk about local response plans and innovative systems they developed for disaster situations. They devoted a lot of their time to the students and remained interested in their students overall educational growth.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Great instructor, again, different than most at YSPH,",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Dr. Bogucki and Joanne McGovern strived to gives students an overview of their fields in a real-world setting. They explained the material very well and attempted to give us as much real-world experience in the classroom as possible."

   "comments": [
    "TA Kate was terrific",
    "Great. Clarifies assignments and available to help",
    "Kate is among the best TAs I have experienced while enrolled in classes at EPH. Here knowledge of the material is very high and is consistent with a professional who has been in the field 5 plus years. Very impressed by her ability to help others and I am glad to have had the opportunity to interact with her in this capacity.",
    "Kate was great! When i was confused about what was going on in class, she helped me out a lot. Great resource and very intelligent as well.",
    "Kate did a great job as TA. She was prompt in sending out information to the class and she was very helpful to me with work assignments, especially with my final project.",
    "Kate Corvese was extremely helpful both in class and outside of class. She is sincerely passionate about the subjects and is able to help the students in their assignments. I enjoyed working with her.",
    "I really don't think there was a need for a TA in the course - the amount of graded work simply did not justify it. I think one of the things that hurts Kate is an unintended unpleasantness in her affect. The biggest issue is a sense of bravado and a tendency to \"crap\" on people in the industry when she is talking about them in the third person (not anyone in the class, but just when referring to other people) - particularly those who have a lot more experience than she does - it's just disrespectful and I think this turns people off. The other issue is that she adopts a tone of authority which is not always so appropriate, given limited experience. I understand the desire to contribute to the class, but sometimes the instruction she would give seemed to be for the purpose of reminding people that she was there. Kate does have some substance to offer, I just think it could be done better.",
    "Kate -Kate is a great TA and I know that she worked extremely hard behind the scenes to make this course happen. Kudos.",
    "I do not think this class warranted a TA."

    "Definitely recommend this course!",
    "Take it if you want real-world experience for times of disaster.",
    "well, if you're interested in emergency management, this is the only class at ysph that you can take. so take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to people who are really interested in this area of public health. It was fairly focused in that way, so if you were not as interested in some aspects, it might not be the course for you. I enjoyed the course on the whole though and would take other classes with these two professors.",
    "This course covers emergency planning from both the planning phase and the actual execution phase using real emergency situations such as 911 and Hurricane Katrina. We focus on the public health aspect of disasters and how to decrease the amount of mortality, morbidity, and trauma post-disaster. I would recommend this class because it is interesting and extremely important for public health careers.",
    "Good overview of how to marshall oneself and resources during a disaster. A great introduction to all the things that could go wrong, which is important. For instance, I now am always thinking about, \"wheredo we put the dead bodies \/ mortuary issues\". I think this was the most valuable part of the course - no disaster will be the same, but the questions that we have to ask ourselves in preparation and during can be planned out ahead of time and its all about preparation and preparedness. I think that I at least know where to look for the answers now when a disaster strikes or in the preparation phase.",
    "The course is a great background to disaster management and preparedness. Ideal for students who plan to work at the local, state or federal level of publichealth.",
    "Very good if you are interested in working in emergency management someday. Not recommended if you are not interested in this field."
