    "An in-depth reading of Hegel's Philosophy of Right and its contemporary elaboration within the Frankfurt school. I would recommend it to anyone with background in continental philosophy and\/or some Hegel. Without any background, it will be difficult to get much from the class.",
    "Hegel's \"Philosophy of Right,\" Honneth's \"Freedom's Right,\" and selections from Habermas's \"Between Facts and Norms.\" Highly recommended."

    "Benhabib knows these texts incredibly well, and was quite able to translate this knowledge to her students. Hegel is central to my work on modern intellectual history. Though his writing on \"history\" is rather annoying, the broader structural implications of his text are essential to the project of historiography.",
    "The texts covered in the class are crucial texts for the work I intend to do, and they are very daunting to approach alone for the first time. I expect to continue to engage with this material in the future.",
    "I learned a great deal in this course, and it contributed significantly to my research."
