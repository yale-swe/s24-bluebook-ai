    "This course gives an amazing survey of all aspects of Baroque art.",

   "comments": [
    "strengths: interesting lectures and readings improvements: could have received the set of images that would be on the midterm\/final before we lectured on it. it would help give context to what is important, and what is just supporting information",
    "The structure of the class is good. Two lectures a week, each lecture about a different artist or theme, plus a weekly discussion section that applies what we learned in lecture.",
    "Great course! Interesting lectures and Professor Suthor is so kind and knowledgable. At times, I thought the sections were a little unnecessary and could have met every other week instead of every week.",
    "Strengths: interesting material, great professor, really interesting works chosen for analysis in section. Weakness: Hard to make up class, as the lecture slides aren't made available online.",
    "All strengths! This course was amazing. Professor Suthor is both knowledgeable and approachable-- she is the most friendly professor I've had! The curriculum covered a wide breadth of art produced during the Baroque period in Rome. Sections were genuinely instructive, unlike those of many other courses. Readings were manageable, interesting, and relevant. Papers were fun to write and exams were very fair! The trip to the Hartford Wadsworth Atheneum was a major plus-- when given the opportunity to go to an art museum with an expert art historian who truly cares about her students, take it!",
    "Sometimes it is hard to keep up in lecture, it would be helpful if the slides were posted (or at least the quotes) to help us keep track of what was covered when",
    "There is a great deal of memorization that the midterms and finals rely on, but that is inherent itself within the field of art history, so it can't be really avoided I suppose.",
    "Professor Suthor is very talented and knows the content very well. Sometimes I felt like I would have liked more historical context about the period to place the works we were studying.",
    "I wish professor Suthor would upload her slides! It's much easier to study and follow the conversation since most of the names were in italian",
    "Great",
    "I liked how the course incorporated painting, sculpture, and architecture.",
    "This course is engaging and interesting. The biggest strength is just how fascinating the material is and the opportunity the course presents to look at beautiful art. The only suggestion for improving the course is perhaps disseminating a slide list before lecture. Sometimes it is unclear what the title or dates of the works of art are when they are presented."

    "Yes! Great course if you are interested in the material.",
    "Yes, this is an excellent art history class, especially if you are interested in Rome or the baroque. Artists like Caravaggio and Bernini are among the most influential in their fields, so it is fun to study them. The workload was low, but the class is engaging, and you learn a lot.",
    "I'd definitely recommend for anyone who's looking to learn more about Baroque art! You definitely don't need any prior knowledge of art history to do well in this course--Professor Suthor will teach you everything you need to know.",
    "I would absolutely recommend! Professor Suthor is so kind and intelligent. The art we studied was beautiful. Rome is one of the most important cities in the world and it is so cool to learn about the art produced during the Baroque period. I always looked forward to my Tuesday and Thursday mornings because of this class. The small size (for a lecture) made the class more engaging, because Professor Suthor would ask us what we thought about the art we looked at.",
