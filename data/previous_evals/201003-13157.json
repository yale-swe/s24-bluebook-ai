   "comments": [
    "Washington, D.C. was a very broad survey course that examined the capital of the U.S. through a Humanities lens--that is to say, through politics and history and art and culture as well as through prominent figures and social movements. It criss-crossed between the past and the present - much of what we learned about the city reflected on its history and origins but also on its current state.",
    "This class was really great! Though seeming a little rudimentary and all over the place in subject matter at the start, things began to fall into place by the end. Perhaps more attention could have been paid to linking ideas and themes throughout the course better, and perhaps a more focused reading list as well. More theoretical or rigorously historical texts, rather than vignette-ish or anecdotal accounts, might've served us better too. All in all, though, a very pleasant experience that I would thoroughly recommend to a fellow student.",
    "Very interesting. The class didn't have all that much direction, which was unsettling for the first half or so. But Hill is fascinating, and it's highly entertaining to hear him speak. The readings rarely came up in class, but they were usually interesting. Conversations were often about current politics and news, or the grand scheme of American history, politics, and sociology viewed through the lens of Washington. There was very little work. Besides the reading, which was sometimes heavy, there was just a midterm, a paper, and a presentation. The latter two could be about virtually anything, and it was nice to be able to explore. The class could probably have used a bit more structure, but, as it was, even though there were too many people in the class, it was a good bit of entertainment for a Friday afternoon.",
    "Fun look at politics using all the things you always wished were proper evidence and now are, like the DC gossip page. Interesting discussions with fun people.",
    "Yes. It is a fascinating class and you will learn a lot about the history of U.S. foreign policy from a very knowledgeable professor.",
    "A very different approach to studying anything (humanities approach to studying a city worked perfectly), and studying Washington is really fun too, especially because it is so relevant to the our experience now. If you can get in, absolutely take it. It's too much reading to actually get done (I think) but you don't need to finish all the reading.",
    "The reading load gets larger as the weeks go on but if you listen to Hill you'll pick up on what is important to read and what is not. Seminar style with a lot of lecture by the professor. One short presentation (everyone went over the five minutes allotted. I don't think he wanted us to. Learn to be concisely intelligent.) and a take home midterm which was actually pretty fun and a final paper. Very little direction on anything, that's not the kind of professor Hill is. May be better as a lecturer than as a seminar teacher actually but I liked the experience.",
    "For people who love seminars in the Humanities, this is a great course--it's very multi-disciplinary, and Hill ties together lots of elements, including his own experience, to paint a full picture of the complex inner workings of our nation's capital. I think one's enjoyment of this course depends most on whether you like Hill's teaching style--sometimes criticized as overly opinionated--whether these kind of seminars are your thing, and whether you've got a class that functions well with group discussion, which you've got no control over. This course is classic Charles Hill.",
    "This course had ambitions to be truly interdisciplinary, but we often did not have enough time to discuss readings or explore the intended class topic. Some classmates were more interested in asking irrelevant or tangential questions than in trying to have a discussion. Professor Hill gave insightful and interesting 'mini-lectures,' but if you're looking for an intimate seminar experience, look elsewhere.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially if they are interested in studying a city in a really in-depth manner. Every class, you start out talking about D.C. news from the week, then one or two students will give a presentation, and finally Hill will lead a discussion and\/or do a mini-lecture on a topic. A lot of material kind of fell by the wayside because we had so little time, but the discussions were great. Also, the books assigned for the class are fantastic. The final is a long paper on a topic of your choosing. This is great because it lets you tie in a bunch of different stuff you may have picked up from the reading and class.",
    "This course was great because Charles Hill was teaching it. I describe the course as \"endearing.\" The discussion was great, but the course had little cohesion in it. Nothing was really deeply explored, but that is not really the point. Just having an outlet to discuss America was really invigorating.",
    "Charles Hill is a difficult man to figure out. He seems entirely uninterested in everything until he erupts in passion for subjects few and far between. This class was worth it just to see the look on the Cold War diplomat's face when he played us Duke Ellington."
