    "Definitely take this course. Sure, it's a niche subject, but there is hardly a professor out there better than Keith Wrightson. I had the pleasure of attending an optional trip to the British Art Museum, where I was able to discuss the artwork in detail with him. He was incredibly excited to talk about everything he was asked, and what more could you want than an leading scholar who loves to teach. Oh, and if you want to gain a better understand of religion, politics, and community life in Early Modern England, I'd definitely advise you to take this course, history or otherwise. Only two papers (5 page, 10 page) and a final. Not much work for a class you'll surely learn a ton in.",
    "Basic lecture. 2 papers and a final. The lectures aren't riveting but interesting if you push yourself to stay focused. It's a pretty solid time period in terms of interesting material.",
    "Solid lecture course.",
    "Take it!! It's fascinating and not much work. Professor Wrightson is the best in the field, and he's very willing to help you. Also he has lots of funny stories to tell in lecture. Dont get me wrong, ge's not the best lecturer at Yale, but he's good, and the information is interesting enough it all works well. You probably need to be interested in the subject first though.",
    "I recommend this course to someone interested in the subject.",
    "Loved this class, was great as an overview of the period and was also low stress. I find this period very interesting, and Wrightson is a great lecturer. Papers are easy to cope with.",
    "Good class! The materials are quite interesting and the professor is wonderful. I took it for my pre-industrial credit but ended up loving it.",
    "As an Anglophile obsessed with the Tudor dynasty, I adored this class. For those who may not be as Anglo-centric as I am, I think this class would still be interesting. I learned much more about the common social dynamics of the time period than I thought. There was much I didn't know regarding the Protestant Reformation, the English Civil War, imperialism, riots, etc. This class provided me with a much richer view of England at such a pivotal moment in history than I had ever expected. I would highly recommend this course. The subject matter is both fun an exciting. When reading about witches and feuding kings, it feels more like reading a novel than a history book.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, as it provides a prime opportunity to learn about history from numerous unique perspectives, truly engendering self reflection like never before.",
    "Excellent course. The topics covered in this class are important for any person living in Western civilization, especially in a former British colony like the US. As the course title suggests, it is a mix of political, religious, and social history. I was nervous about the social history but was pleasantly surprised it was actually really interesting and tied in well. Prof. Wrightson is an engaging and fun lecturer, passionate about the subject, and an extremely accomplished historian. I was very fortunate to have him lead my section, too. This was my favorite class this semester!",
    "I definitely recommend this class! It's not burdensome and gives you the freedom to choose what you want to study.",
    "I would recommend the course: the period is worth studying, the instructor tries to keep students aware that they are studying history (i.e. historical method) and a particular period of history. I'm not sure how I feel about the thematic divisions of lectures (e.g. one on witchcraft, one on education), but that might well be the best approach for a survey course.",
    "Yes I would recommend.",
    "This is a great class. If you need a pre-indust take this. Professor Wrightson is a good lecturer and he packs a lot into each session. Additionally the readings are broken up into readings for class and readings for section so you can basically get away with just doing the section readings. The papers aren't bad you can essentially summarize other sources and the final was 2 of 20 topics. Definitely an interesting and not too hard class.",
    "A fantastic, illuminating, entertaining, enjoyable class. I'm not a history major and took it just because the subject matter interested me and I'm so glad I did. Prof. Wrightson is an exceptionally knowledgeable and entertaining lecturer (in that dry, British sort of way that I especially appreciate). Going to lecture was like storytime for adults. Just an excellent class, so long as you actually attend, do (some of) the readings, and are interested in the material. Work is relatively light - one short paper, one long paper, and a very straightforward final exam. For all, you're able to focus on whichever specific topics really interest you. Quite enjoyable. Take it as a fifth class, take it as a history major, take it as a senior trying desperately to soak up what little time at Yale is left in something interesting.",
    "Great Class!",
    "Absolutely take this course. It is without a doubt one of the best lecture courses in the department, and Professor Wrightson is brilliant, enjoyable, and inspirational. He is exactly how I imagine a Cambridge Don, and I was never once bored in section. In particular, this class is wonderful for its dual emphasis on the exciting high court politics of the Tudor and Stuarts (the Reformation, the Civil War, the Glorious Revolution, etc), as well as a really wonderful introduction to English social history from the perspective of the common people. Take this course. You will not be disappointed.",
    "This class was a great history of the Tudor and Stuart periods-- well worth taking if you want an introduction to the period--",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a fantastic outline of Early Modern England-looking not just at the royalty, but into the social history, into the society of England at the time, as well as Scotland and Ireland.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for History majors, and I think it is a great course to fulfill a pre-Industrial requirement. It is awesome to have the flexibility to write the midterm and final papers on whatever topics you like, and it is a pleasure to get to know Professor Wrightson.",
    "Loved this class. Lectures were really interesting and Prof. Wrightson is an easy person to listen to for 50 minutes. Lot of choice on assignments which is great.",
    "I didn't love this class but I assume if you're more interested in early modern England then you would enjoy it. The professor and TAs were nice and the work load was very manageable.",
    "Highly recommended."
