   "comments": [
    "You have to take it, and thats about it.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in improving your spanish, this course definitely improves your writing and challenges you to more complex sentence structure and readings.",
    "Spanish L4 is a little bit of a step up from L3, but it somehow seems as though the pace of learning is a little easier. A lot of the new material you cover is vocabulary: you spend a lot of time reading novellas and short stories and things. Grading is very fair except for the online homework, which has arbitrary deadlines and a steep late penalty. Quite enjoyable overall, however, especially since the semester includes so many fun projects and presentations and things that are low time commitment but help increase your awareness of Spanish history and culture.",
    "It significantly improved my Spanish so I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to learn the language.",
    "I would definitely recommend SPAN 140 to another student. This class was a lot more activity based and literature based than previous spanish classes and gave me the opportunity to really improve my spanish. I am so much better at speaking and understanding thanks to this class.",
    "i wouldn't recommend this course to anyone unless they had to take it.",
    "Take this class with Maria Pilar! The class can be a bit tedious and repetitive but she does a wonderful job of keeping the class's energy up. Again, take it with Pilar!",
    "If you're taking this class it's probably for the language requirement, and so you don't really have a choice. That said, I enjoyed it, especially in comparison to SPAN 130 - I thought the content was more interesting (colonialism, US intervention in Latin America), and the essays are complex and by established Spanish writers. Five days a week is a lot, but if you keep on top of the work and the concepts your oral and written skills will improve."
