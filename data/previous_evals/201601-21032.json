    "This course is to help students learn about reactors and the details surrounding reactors and reactions. What reactor do we use for a specific reaction to meet a certain set of criteria?",
    "I think this course needs to be severely re-structured before anyone takes it again. If you can, don't take it with Prof Taylor because nothing will get done and it's frustrating considering the level of problem you are expected to know how to do by the end of this course.",
    "A mostly relaxed class with emphasis on plugging in equations and qualitatively understanding how different reactors and reactor sizes influence reactions.",
    "Ceng 301 is a basic chemical reactors course with a bit of reactor kinetics thrown in towards the end. I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to get a better idea of the types of reactors that exist in the chemical industry.",
    "Interesting course material where you get into the nuts and bolts of what chemical engineers traditionally do in industry (Ex. sizing and selecting reactors, predicting output). Quality of the course probably depends on who is teaching it though. If Dr. Taylor is teaching it again...well there wouldn't be much teaching. In any case, the textbook is decent and the concepts are fairly straightforward so you can more or less teach yourself. The class isn't easy, but it's not one of the super challenging courses in the ChemE curriculum."
