    "Collective Memories in East Asia is a good course if you are interested in the question of historical memory, and how history continues to be contested and shaped by present realities. Some background knowledge of contemporary East Asian history is good to have.",
    "EAST 443 is a discussion based seminar on Collective Memory in East Asia. It begins with an overview of the theoretical framework for understanding collective memory, and continues to trace the collective memories of major events in China, Japan, and Korea, starting with the Nanjing Massacre and ending with the No Gun Ri incident. Brings up interesting questions such as, what were the major events in collective memory in east asia, what happened, how are they remembered and by whom, and introduces a discussion how should they be remembered. Really got me to rethink the narratives that I am reading about all history with an incredibly critical eye and think twice about who is creating these narratives, for what purposes, and then finally perhaps, what are they leaving out. Definitely recommend, especially for those looking to focus on Sociology within the East Asian Studies major. Also helpful for history majors who will one day be piecing primary sources into historical narratives that may be used in collective memory."
