    "Take it if you're interested in how ancient civilizations evolve and interact.",

    "Recommend as good survey of Egypt and its place in the Mediterranean. Solid PI.",
    "A very good Egyptian survey that puts the kingdom into dialogue with the rest of the Mediterranean. If one has studied Mediterranean history, this is a great class taught by two passionate experts.",
    "Great class if you want to learn more about ancient egypt and its role in the mediterranean. Manning and Hogan are a great duo and play off of each other very well!",
    "An amazing class where you learn about the history of the Mediterranean through the lens of connections between Egypt and the classical world. You are exposed to every kind of primary document and learn how it all connects together."
