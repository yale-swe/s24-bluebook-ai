    "you just listen to a different speaker every week, it's boring but it's rquired so yeah. you don't have to do the reading.",
    "It's chill, it's fun, it's only for majors so you don't exactly have a choice. Cool to listen to the speakers though I doubt anyone actually took inspiration for their senior projects from them. But the senior project itself is perhaps more of a big deal than you might have realized. By the time you're reading this, CogSci seniors of the future, it'll probably be too late for you to get your shit together much in advance. Just a heads-up, your project has to be totally independent, not just the work you've been doing in lab unless it's really truly your own project.",
    "Gotta take it",
    "Yes, you have to take it if you're a cog sci major.",
    "If you're a cog sci major, you obviously have to take this. But it's fun, so don't worry about it! They make the senior project pretty low-stress!",
    "Not like you have a choice, but it's good to know (finally!) who's in your major, and the talks are mostly interesting.",
    "Definitely, I mean you have to take it.",
    "Required course",
    "You have to take it if you're a senior cog sci major and you can't take it unless you're a senior cog sci major so you can't really choose to or not to take it.",
    "It's a fun survey - you get to hear about cutting edge research from boss professors across cogsci disciplines. No work, except some optional reading.",
    "I would recommend, it is also required for the major.",
    "You'll take it if you're a senior in the major. First semester is just a series of cogsci lectures from different areas in the field, which is cool some weeks and boring other weeks. It's nice to have a place for the whole major to get together and talk about theses and questions and stuff, because otherwise we might not be sure who to go to. Kate is really great--approachable, reasonable, helpful."
