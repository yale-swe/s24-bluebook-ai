    "Are you a serious chamber musician? Take this course, end of story. Wendy is a delight, the other musicians are super talented and enthusiastic, masterclasses are always lively and the workload is quite low. I will be taking this course all 8 semesters that I am here. Come join me! It's a blast.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!!! You will learn an incredible amount and get a lot of amazing experience",
    "MUSI220 is a great course for advanced musicians looking to collaborate with other students. The course is extremely well structured and you will get out of the course as much as you put into it. In addition to getting weekly coachings, the bi-weekly performance classes are a blast because you get to hear your peers perform. The end of the semester performance was my favorite because we were all able to show off what we had been preparing all semester and support one another.",
    "Play great music for peers and teachers. Learn about it through experiencing it.",
    "A great course to take for advanced musicians interested in playing chamber music! Wendy Sharp is an amazing coach and gives feedback that not only touches on balance but also on group sound quality and musical character. If you plan to audition for and take this class, be prepared for a decent time commitment each week (each group rehearses outside of coaching once a week). This can be difficult with an increasing number of people, but it is worth it for those who find chamber music rewarding!",
    "If you want to play chamber music take this class",
    "The BEST way to learn and perform chamber music as an undergrad at Yale - great fellow musicians, fantastic coaches (music students and professors), and many opportunities for performance. Take it if you love chamber music and want to be able to play as part of a serious group!",
    "In this course you intensely study one full chamber music work. Each group rehearses during the week and has a coaching with fantastic faculty. Every other week, students and faculty meet for studio class where the various groups play for each other.",
    "Great way to play chamber music at Yale. Coachings can be good or bad, depending on who you're assigned. Your group can also be either good or bad, depending on who Wendy decides you should play with. You don't have a lot of choice of either group members or repertoire. Overall high level of playing and a good way to get to know fellow musicians, as long as you can put up with the minor frustrations that come with that.",
    "You are placed into a chamber group that has one coaching a week (you alternate coaching times and coaches every other week), two hours of rehearsal a week, and biweekly two-hour studio classes. At the end of the semester the groups all perform in two concerts. I would absolutely recommend this course. It requires a lot of responsibility because your peers are relying on you, but it is so great to work with amazing musicians, and the coaches are so talented. The studio classes are also really constructive, and all the students in the class are supportive of each other.",
    "Awesome class! You are exposed to a long-term group to create wonderful music together. We, for example, worked on a quartet by Mendelssohn over the semester, and performed it in a finale concert. Relaxing, but essential class to take if you are a soloist or avid chamber musician.",
    "Definitely a must for all serious musicians at Yale.",
    "If you like chamber music, go for it! It is not extremely time consuming.",
    "Definitely! It's fun and easy.",
    "This is a great course for someone who is very serious about his\/her instrument and wants to get credit for playing in a group with other talented musicians. It's pretty competitive to get in (difficulty of getting in depends on instrument), so make sure you have a backup in case there's no room. Be prepared for a minimum of one rehearsal a week and plenty of practice outside of rehearsal as well."
