    "Sure. Any student in Chinese literature should read Hongloumeng. And the course is taught in a seminar style, which means the students are also welcome to contribute their thoughts and analysis.",

    "Having been reading for many years, some academic instructions on this are really helpful.",
    "I read Hongloumeng many times before, but through taking this class and discussing the novel with others, I learned how to approach this classical novel from multiple perspectives, especially the anthropological perspective. The methodology of close reading, which was emphasized a lot in this class, will be one of the main methodologies in my dissertation writing."
