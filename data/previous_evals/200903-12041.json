   "comments": [
    "This is a discussion-intensive class; come to class prepared every week for a thoughtful discussion. Also, it is probably best to come to this class with a firm background in economics; otherwise, it's quite easy to get lost in an avalanche of theories and ideas.",
    "Political institutions, financial crisis, effects of colonialism on the current state of emerging economies... good stuff.",
    "This seminar has been one of my favorite classes at Yale because of the fabulous professor, engaging class discussions, and fascinating syllabus that is highly relevant to our understanding of the international political economy. I really looked forward to attending class every week and cannot think of any reason why you wouldn't take this course. I guess the only catch is that you have to be willing to put in the work, so it is helpful if you are interested in the subject matter.Throughout this semester, Professor Kingsley has become my favorite professor at Yale. She is intelligent, thought-provoking, funny, and truly passionate about teaching and sharing her knowledge. It's touching to see a professor who cares so much about her students, and I have learned more in this class than from any other class at Yale. The critical written reviews were especially enjoyable to write, and leading class discussions was a valuable exercise that enabled students to go in depth with specific topics.",
    "If you have any interest at all in investing, emerging markets, or the intersection of academia and practice, you have to take this class. Actually, even if you don't care about any of that, you should take it just so you can get to know Professor Kingsley.",
    "This class was filled with very bright people and that made the course for me. Of course I can't promise it will be that way again, but that seems to happen year after year. Go shop it and see.The course covers a wide array of material from currency crisis to risk mitigation in FDI. You will learn to think very well on these subjects, butthe course will not offer you ''right answer'' on most of the questions. So the topics are cool, but very open-ended.",
    "A fantastic introduction to the international political economy of markets that will allow you to probe the complexities of the subject from a variety of viewpoints and perspectives. If you have any interests at all in politics or economics, take this course! You will not regret it.",
    "I think the class could satisfy many people with diverse interests. There are academic readings that could interest people who care about how investment affects developing countries. There are also case studies on specific investment projects that help us gain an understanding of why some investments might be bad and why some investments might be good. Teaches you how to think about risk analysis.",
    "A Seminar that should be taken by anyone interested in finance and private equity. A good amount of work, but well worth it in the end.",
    "A fairly detailed look at international markets, with an emphasis on crises and actual project deals. There's complicated and useful stuff here. Take it, but only if you're willing to put in the work and make comments in class (otherwise, you'll just have the feeling that great knowledge is swimming above your head while you try valiantly to snatch some of it), and only with Kingsley, who is the bomb.",
    "This is a really interesting class on foreign direct investment, project deals, and economic theory. Definitely take it!",
    "Tough, need a lot of political and economic background. Make sure you put the work in for the papers.",
    "Definitely. It combines theoretical, historical and contemporary perspectives. The readings are very interesting. At the end, the students are able to write analytical reviews on articles covering international political economy.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have a solid understanding of financial markets. You definitely need some economics to do well and understand what is going on in this course."
