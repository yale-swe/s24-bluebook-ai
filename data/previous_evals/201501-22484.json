    "MCDB 300 is a challenging course, but the material is highly useful and actually quite interesting if you want to understand exactly how life proceeds. Breaker is great; Clay is not as great, but she is knowledgeable and her material is definitely doable--going over her slides slowly after class will ensure that you understand the pathways. I'm glad I took the course, even though I read many poor reviews of the class.",

    "This is a good course for premeds, but I would say not a great course for those simply interested in biochemistry, as it doesn't really let you explore or think about issues in depth due to its enormous amount of memorization and in many cases lack of thought involved. I loved all of the topics we covered and would have loved to think about them and talk about them more, as opposed to just memorizing the angstroms in a DNA turn, for instance.",
    "If you're like me, you're probably reading the evaluations and freaking out about Nicole Clay. Don't. She definitely gets a bad rep because the material of the course is really challenging and there's a lot of work involved. But Nicole is not actually a bad teacher and is very welcoming to students. I personally despised every second I had to spend in this class, but that's required classes for you and my dislike had nothing to do with the faculty.",
    "Hard",
    "Breaker is a good teacher and the first half of the class is very easy. Clay is going to ruin you. She blows through 2 chapters in every lecture and just assumes you have perfect knowledge of every mechanism. She's a bad teacher, but you'll be fine, you need to take this anyway.",
    "I thought it was a solid biochemistry course. I know that Nicole Clay gets a bad rep, and I agree that she's not the most cogent lecturer, but I think a lot of the negative reviews have to do with the fact that she teaches metabolism, which is unfortunately a memorization heavy topic. No one likes having to memorize lots of stuff, but no reason to punish the instructor for it, I think. Be prepared to put in a lot of time studying, and don't go into the class thinking \"this is stupid-- I have to memorize all of this.\" You're likely taking this for a premed credit and you'll have to memorize this stuff in medical school too so might as well get a jump start on that.",
    "Biochem kinda sucked. The first half was great with Breaker. The second half absolutely sucked with Clay. It moved super quick and had to memorize a bunch. 4 tests and that's it. No work otherwise.",
    "Take the MB&B course if you can instead. The first half is great and explained really well, but once you get to the 2nd half with Nicole Clay, it's taught very differently and the mechanisms are much harder to follow. Friends of mine who took the MB&B course in the fall said it felt more consistent and continuous, as well as the concepts explained more thoroughly.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in both Chemistry and Biology and wishes to gain a deeper understanding of how to apply the material to processes that occur in our body all the time.",
    "Overall this was an understandably intense class. I will say the material was very back loaded, and I feel that in the future the distribution of new material should be more even throughout the course. I enjoyed the teaching styles of both professors, and help was easily accessible.",
    "Hard class. Second half especially. Need to crush the first two tests in order to do ok on the class.",
    "The first half of this class is about proteins and DNA, the second half is metabolism. The pace and level of difficulty really kicks into high gear during metabolism, so be ready to study A LOT, but metabolism is sooo interesting! Overall a good class.",
    "What a surprise, this was much better than I expected. All three professors Breaker, Engleman, and (yes) Clay are excellent lecturers. Breaker goes a little too slow, Clay a little too fast, but Engleman was just perfect. Too bad he only gives a couple lectures. But really all three are great. Clay gets a bad rap and I think its just because we cover metabolism at such a high depth. She goes through ludicrous amounts of information each lecture, but she does so in an extremely cogent and comprehensible way. Her exams while tough are very fair as long as youve studied the lecture slides and her psets (which arent graded). The class is just four exams so you have to be ok with that model of grading. But honestly, if youre premed, you better be able to suck it up and study because this class is a close simulation of the way med school classes work (as far as I can tell). If you put in the time and it is a lot of time theres no reason you cant succeed in this class, so Id say take it. My main complaint is that I wish the lectures aligned better with the textbook, as I am generally a textbook learner, but on the bright side the lecture slides are pretty clear so you can use those as your main study resource. Its unclear how nice the curve is so I cant give a final word on how easy or hard this class is, but it seems entirely reasonable so Id recommend it for sure. I give this class an A-, one of the biggest surprises of the year for me.",
    "I would recommend the class, however, with caution. The reviews that Prof. Clay \"is terrible\" is not true. Professor Clay put in a lot of work in the course and her lectures were actually quite good. It's the material, however, that makes the class so difficult. If you stay on top of your work, do the review exams, problem sets, and go to section, you should be able to do well in this class.",
    "I would say it is a tough course, but much more thorough than the other option for biochemistry at Yale if you aren't an MB&B major.",
    "It's a good course for pre-meds and bio majors. There's a lot of interesting stuff that is covered that really helps you to understand the chemical mechanics as to how biology works. As a word of advise, while the first half of the class seems to be pretty easy, just be wary of the second half, because it gets a bit more difficult as the amount of information that is expect of you to learn goes up by a lot. Just make sure to do the homework and ask questions like you would in any of your classes and you'll be golden.",
    "A very intensive introduction to basic cellular chemistry. A lot of material to learn and memorize but the knowledge is worth it (and required in many cases).",
    "I didn't really like the material, and only took it for my major. It's certainly a lot of effort, and it's remarkably easy to fall behind and never catch up, which will screw you over in the course. That said, all of the professors were really nice and did their utmost to make the material easier to digest. Prof. Clay especially has gotten a bad rap in the past evals, but she was SO nice and tried so hard to help the students understand.",
    "MCDB 300 was a well-taught and well-organized class, comparable to MB&B 300. Biochem will be biochem. The material is difficult, but Professors Breaker and Clay were clearly dedicated to the students and the extra attention and instruction they paid did not go unnoticed! The second half of the class was, I think, difficult by virtue of the material, but Clay did a good job making it all easier to comprehend.",
    "Biochemistry is a very interesting subject, but this class makes it painful to study, at times. The course is has a really unusual structure: it's taught by two professors (they switch off halfway through the semester) and it's graded only based on the four midterms. Breaker is a fairly straightforward lecturer, but Clay can be very difficult to follow (her exams are also much more difficult). Take the class if you need to fulfill a requirement or if you're really interested spending a lot of time studying biochem. If you do end up taking it, I would really recommend keeping up with the material - not only attending lectures and taking careful notes, but reviewing those notes every week - otherwise, you'll spend 30 hours learning everything in the two days before a midterm, like I did."
