   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course provides a fantastic overview of major issues in maternal and child health nutrition. I thought it was a great class for someone who is very interested in this topic but does not have a clinical nutrition background. The workload is more than my other classes but not too intense, although expectations for the weekly reading summaries could have been clearer (e.g., what separates an \"excellent\" paper from an \"outstanding\" one?). The group project (systematic review) really helped me understand an issue in this field more in-depth, and the feedback from my peers on the group presentation was helpful in shaping the final systematic review paper.",
    "This class was my favorite of the semester. Rafael is very passionate about the topic and has a wealth of experience that we can benefit from. His focus on improving our epidemiologic skills by reading and summarizing articles on course related topics and putting together narrative reviews successfully made me apply and develop these skills.",
    "The course was interesting! I wish he had delved more into the topics instead of talking about his work in the field so much but it's very relevant to what the topic is so I understand why he does that. The readings are interesting and the summaries we write up really refine your knowledge of the topics at hand.",
    "I think the insight provided by Dr. Perez-Escamilla is the greatest strength of the course. While the content itself is interesting and valuable, the extra information that he can provide due to his personal involvement in so many MCPHN efforts are what really make the course special. This course also strengthens your ability to critically read an article. Also, I think the timeline of the systematic review is appropriate. Weaknesses: the grading scheme could be more transparent.",
    "This course was excellent. I really valued the course readings, I think the syllabus was well-designed. I also appreciated the weekly assignments. My ability to distill complex topics and research into concise responses and main take-aways improved over the course of this semester. My only suggestion for improvement would be to collect assignments at the beginning of class, rather than at the end. Unfortunately, I noticed that some students would write or change their reading responses during class based on the lecture or discussion, and print these assignments immediately afterwards to hand in. I think the best way to avoid this would be to have each student drop their assignment off with the TA or in a pile immediately at the beginning of class.",
    "strengths: several important topics are covered; close reading of one article per week was very useful to prime our minds to thinking about the lecture topic of the week weaknesses\/suggestions for improvement: in terms of the structure of the lectures, it would have been nice to have a 5-minute break in between the two hours of the lecture",
    "Overall I was disappointed with this course. I had high hopes because of Rafael's reputation and the interesting nature of the subject. However, Dr. Perez-Escamilla spent most lectures just reciting findings from a selection of various studies, which quickly became monotonous and quite tedious. I'd rather he summarize the findings\/bottom line instead of giving us the ORs\/RRs from 10 studies to make his point. I didn't find his lectures interesting or instructive at all. His grading style is also very unclear - his use of vague adjectives to rank your weekly reading summaries (i.e. outstanding, fantastic, great, very good) were not helpful in figuring out how I was doing. The systematic review was good practice, but didn't make up for the class's other shortcomings.",
    "A great course - covered a wide range of important topics for maternal and child nutrition. Appreciated that these were policy and program issues that I had not learned about in any other courses, but have great ramifications for public health. Also appreciated the timeliness of taking this course, as it corresponded to the 2015 Dietary Guidelines being updated. Was really valuable to have a professor so involved in the process who could speak from that real world perspective.",
    "I thought this class was excellent. Even though we had a large class, I still felt like I learned a ton and benefited greatly from the weekly reading\/writing assignments, as well as the systematic review group project. Not many suggestions for improvement, although it would be cool it the class could be capped and kept under 20 students.",
    "The systematic review is a huge undertaking. It took up a lot of time; if you're not willing to put in this time, don't take the course. The weekly critical review summaries also take a lot of time and effort. Definitely learned how to critically evaluate literature in this course, and I thought the midterm was very fairly structured and assessed this ability to critically evaluate studies well.",
    "Wonderful course with excellent weekly discussions as well as a unique opportunity to conduct a systematiic review of a topic of interest.",
    "Strengths: learned a lot, taught VERY well, learned also about nutrition topics such as the Dietary Guidelines. Systematic review project was also good practice. Weaknesses: All reviewers of the week's paper should go up to lead discussion (versus only the primary reviewer).",
    "The class was great! The systematic review takes a LOT of time at the end of the semester but it is a great skill to learn.",
    "I enjoyed the material covered in this course. However, it would have been helpful if the grading policy for this course was made clear earlier in the semester. I personally find it problematic that a person can have a 96+ average in the course and still be given a High Pass. What constitutes an Honors grade seemed to be very subjective. Knowing that basically everyone will get a High Pass can make students lose motivation, as you could be putting in much less effort for essentially the same grade.",
    "This course is incredibly well-organized, focused, and interesting. It is demanding because the assignments are high-level but they are rewarding in nature. This course was the best I have taken at YSPH.",
    "Overall useful course but expecting one to write a narrative metanalysis is just too much work and I am not sure that it helped me to learn much more.",
    "Great course with a great instructor. Very enlightening.",
    "Excellent course! The systematic review is very time intensive. I would recommend getting students started on it as early as possible. It would also be great if students could choose or draw straws for the weeks when they wanted to present because the students who presented second had a serious advantage (not having to work over break, getting a whole additional week to write their papers)---and the students who went first had to worry about the paper over break and really buckle down at the busiest time of the semester during exams and when other papers were due. Having the final review due on the last day of reading week or of finals period would be really great.",
    "Too much time is spent on non-substantive information which diverts time from lectures, consecutively running out of time and pushing material to onto the next class."

    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Rafael is one of the best professors I've had at YSPH. He asks students to think critically about important topics, and his experience in the field of maternal and child health is unparalleled. I really enjoyed hearing his personal experience in the field!",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Rafael is a fantastic teacher. He clearly cares about his students and thus is willing to put in the effort to provide meaningful feedback that enables our work to improve over the length of the course. He has great experience and knowledge on the topics covered, and I feel I learned a lot from him.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Such a nice, great guy! I appreciate his knowledge and involvement in the field. His lectures were informative although he sometimes did not finish going through the slides.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0RPE is great! I enjoy his teaching style.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Dr. Perez-Escamilla is an excellent instructor. He is extremely kind and responsive, I never felt intimidated or uncomfortable participating in class discussion or asking questions for clarification.

    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Dr. Perez-Escamilla has a very strong reputation at YSPH, which might have been why I was so disappointed with his class. I don't doubt that he has contributed a lot to the field of maternal\/child nutrition, but he was not a very effective teacher. His lectures were not well organized, he focused too much on extraneous details of studies, and he had difficulty getting main points across, and I don't think I know anything more about maternal\/child nutrition than I did in August.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Excellent lecturer, high expectations, and consistently gives great feedback. Very engaged. Weaknesses: Needed to find a way to have the critiques be turned in before the discussion begins because people would edit their critique based on the discussion in class.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Fabulous professor.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0I love Rafael! He was very supportive of students but also so knowledgeable and interesting to listen to in lecture! No suggestions for improvement.",

    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Professor Perez-Escamilla was one of my favorites at YSPH. He is very knowledgable in the field and it was really wonderful to have weekly updates from him regarding pertinent issues in the field. He is also a fantastic lecturer who provided great feedback on our weekly assignments and larger systematic review. A real joy to be a part of his class!",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Amazing professor who is so knowledgable about this field. Clearly cares a lot about his students and always available to Skype if he is not in the area.",

   "comments": [
    "Provides great overview about critical issues in the field. I would definitely recommend that anyone even remotely interested in this topic take the course.",
    "Fantastic course with a professor who is very knowledgeable and passionate about the topic and who will challenge you to develop practical epidemiologic skills to benefit you in both reading and writing articles.",
    "It was a good introductory course! I learned a lot of different aspects of maternal and child public health nutrition from Rafael and from my classmates themselves. The systematic review project was a good experience to do with my team and the presentation itself was great.",
    "Each week you go through a different specific topic in the realm of MCPHN and are asked to read a few articles on the topic. One of the articles you must summarize in ~750 words. Then class starts with a student-led discussion on the article. The rest of class is RPE lecturing on the topic. There is a midterm regarding one specific article. Throughout the semester you prepare a systematic review, which you present in the last week(s) of class. I would definitely recommend this class to another student. If you are interested in MCPHN this is your place to learn about it from different angles\/programs.",
    "This is an excellent course for anyone interested in maternal and child health and\/or nutrition. Ideally the class size would be smaller so that more people could participate more often in class discussions, but I never felt cut-off from participation. The material was fascinating and I felt that I applied what I learned in epidemiology to this class.",
    "If you are pursuing the global health concentration, there is just no way you should not take this course.",
    "Overall was disappointed. Wouldn't recommend.",
    "Wonderful course; strongly recommend for learning about topics in maternal and child nutrition not likely to be learned in other courses.",
    "There is a tremendous amount of material covered in this course. You will get out of the course as much as you put into your work. Dr. Perez-Escamilla is always accessible by email and he is very supportive of his student's work and gives consistent feedback, especially with the systematic review.",
    "If you are interested in maternal and child health or nutrition, this is an excellent course. You will learn very specific information on important components of maternal and child that I am very happy I now know!",
    "Great course, but it's challenging. Don't take it unless you are very invested in the material and willing to put in the work.",
    "An excellent course, particularly if you have a strong interest in maternal and child nutrition. Professor Perez-Escamilla is an expert in the field and fantastic lecturer, definitely an amazing opportunity to be a part of the class. Though the course require a lot of time, it is well worth the effort and recommend to all.",
    "I highly recommend this course to everyone, even if maternal-child nutrition is not your interest (it wasn't mine). I learned so much and the professor is amazing. The readings weren't overwhelming, and the reading responses were helpful in helping me understand the readings better.",
    "This course is a must-take class for anyone interest in nutrition or maternal and child health. It is interesting, rewarding, and a high-level public health course. You leave the course feel accomplished and knowing you have a knowledge set and analytical skill base. The professor is outstanding and the classroom environment engaging.",
    "Overall very useful.",
    "Course addresses relevant topics about maternal and child nutrition with an accomplished instructor and teaches how to approach ones own review of literature in the field. Highly recommended.",
    "This course is a great introduction to maternal child health nutrition. It covers topics like breast feeding, obesity, gestational diabetes, study design, etc. Very interesting material. Would definitely recommend to another student.",
    "The course is alright if you want to learn generally about nutrition-related programs. I do not recommend this course to anyone who is especially looking for nutrition-specific education."
