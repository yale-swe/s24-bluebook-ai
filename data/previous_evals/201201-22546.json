   "comments": [
    "Take this class. Are you a guy? Take this class. Are you a science major? Take this class. The #1 reason to take it is for professor Chang. She will give you a positive perspective on life which we should all strive to attain. She is always lively, encouraging, and a pleasure to be around. You'll learn how to appreciate literature and life.",
    "Awesome class. Engaging teacher. Really interesting material. You should take it.",
    "Fun class on an interesting topic. Professor Chang is lovely and it was a nice break from my regular schedule.",
    "I will definitely recommend it to any student. It's a rare gem at Yale, and while not being too stressful, teaches you a lot when you are paying attention.",
    "A fairly easy class with two papers and a short response essay. Prof Chang is hilarious and very helpful and knowledgeable in the subject. Since it's all in translation, however, it is difficult to differentiate between styles.",
    "This is the best course I've taken at Yale. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "Quite easy in terms of workload. Would be helpful to have more historical background. Not very WGSS-y.",
    "A reading of Chinese female poets that is unique to Yale and shouldn't be overlooked!",
    "This class is excellent. Professor Chang is extremely knowledgeable and an engaging lecturer. I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in Chinese poetry!",
    "Every class consists of Professor Chang's lecture and a class discussion led by the TA. I would definitely recommend this class! It was my first Chinese literature class at Yale and I absolutely loved it!",
    "Chinese 201 is exactly what the title of the course is. It's about women writers in imperial china and you don't just learn about their style of writing... you learn about their lives and how they thought too. Definitely recommend it.",
    "This is a great 5th class to take. I never thought I'd take a WGSS or East Asian Studies class, but I enjoyed it! It was very little work, readings were not heavy and pretty easy to skim through, and the professor is pretty nice when it comes to grades. That being said, I don't think I gained that much from the course. I have a vague knowledge of ancient Chinese literature, but only from what I wrote about in my papers. I had high expectations because of all the rave reviews, and I would recommend this to someone who needs a lit class and isn't confident in other English classes, but it's not the best class I've ever taken.",
    "It was really wonderful. Take it before you graduate."
