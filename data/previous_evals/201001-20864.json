   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the course for a fellow student. I would probably classify it as somewhat of a \"potpourri of Renaissance stuff.\" I would recommend that a student going into the course approach it on a week-by-week basis. If someone were looking for a more in-depth study of a particular theme, this might not be the class for her, and if he were looking for a class following some kind of trajectory throughout the semester, he might find himself frustrated. However, if she were open to a class structured more as a series of mini-seminars in which each week presented the opportunity to engage with some fascinating texts, then she could really benefit from the class. It took me a few weeks to adjust to the structure and style of the course, but once I stopped trying to make everything fit together and just approached each week as its own, individual thing, I started to really enjoy the class and, ironically, I started seeing more connections between the various weeks.",
    "I would recommend the course to other students with the caveat that it might not be a terribly focused experience."

   "comments": [
    "This course will help provide context for my studies. My work focuses on the literatureof one particular country, one which we did not discuss much in this course. However, I do focus on this time period of history, so the course will help me understand the background against which the authors I study are writing.",
    "I found the literature components and the later components of this course less relevant to my disciplinary needs. I would have liked to see a greater focus on the Renaissance in Germany, France, and Holland. We seemed to spend an inordinate amount of time on British subjects\/writings."
