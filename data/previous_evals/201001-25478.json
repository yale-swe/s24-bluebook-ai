   "comments": [
    "lots of reading but a requirement for majors. do not think that you must take it with kapustin or in your sophomore year. i waited to take this class and could not be happier with the results. professor stimson is amazing. she leads discussion incredibly well and provides great insights on the material. prof stimson makes all the readings come together real well. she is also very understanding, very helpful, and one of the best professors i have had at yale. it is a shame that she is not a permanent faculty member..",
    "My favorite class this semester. The readings are excellent and provide for great discussion. In class, Professor Stimson perfectly balances student discussion with her own insights on writers. There is a lot of reading each week, and it's best to do all of it, but it is enjoyable and class discussion really helped me understand all of the esoteric philosophy. There are three papers spaced throughout the semester that are totally manageable, and Professor Stimson is really accessible outside of class for help.",
    "It's required, and Stimson makes you not mind at all that it is.More substantively, reading these classic texts will give you a greater command for the history of normative political economy, a history which offers perennially useful lessons.",
    "If you are interested in political\/economic\/ethical philosophy, this is a great course. You will learn the classics and analyze them in a deeply rewarding setting.",
    "Take it from Stimson."
