    "What skills did I develop? What skills DIDN'T I develop? JDP is a master wordsmith and thought provoking on all counts. The flow of the course and wide-variety of readings made me rethink media studies pedagogy -- this class is on-point.",
    "I learned the philosophy of technology after the WWII, especially under the impact of cybernetics, and some cutting-edge studies of media.",
    "I gained a tremendous entry into the world of media theory and the major intellectual currents related from the 20th century.",
    "Much knowledge, many skills and insights.",
    "I had never taken a class on media theory before, and this class exposed me to a whole new field that I think will be very productive for me in the future.",
    "This course presented a wide range of media theory, focused particularly on cybernetics and the relationship between state-sponsored, military-funded technologies and the networked communities that grew from and around them. Over the course of the semester, as the class built up a shared vocabulary, I was able to develop a broader and more nuanced approach to various conceptual genealogies and overlaps within this media landscape."

   "comments": [
    "Reading load is perfect, discussions well moderated, themes fit together nicely. 10\/10.",
    "Readings are all very interesting and inspiring, but in later sections, readings focus more on the case study. I don't mind reading more about research methodology in media studies.",
    "Excellent course.",
    "The strength of this course is in the way the seminar is run. John understands how to maximize the learning of his students in a seminar setting, which is increasingly rare these days. The students become familiar with each other and comfortable talking frequently - because they are actively encouraged to do so by name. John's excellent feedback on drafts was also exceptional per my many other seminar experiences.",
    "I didn't know what to expect going into this class, but I found that the structure of the course was extremely productive and helpful. Each week brought together a selection of critical and primary texts that helped to elucidate important questions in media studies. The only weakness I can think of is that class discussion sometimes didn't really go anywhere, but John was always able to bring out important points.",
    "I really enjoyed the wide range of materials, and the diverse considerations of media within this time period. That said, while the syllabus flowed well from week to week, sometimes it was a bit difficult to synthesize the thru-lines on a longer scale. Each individual session generated interesting questions and connections, but I think the course could be improved by building in some time to loop earlier readings and conversations back in from time to time."

   "comments": [
    "Prof. Peters is unlike any other within the field of media studies -- his idiosyncratic syllabi will attest. If you're looking for a course with terrific in-class discussions, this is the one.",
    "Yes, the professor really provides you with an interdisciplinary perspective.",
    "Easily.",
    "yes",
    "Yes! The class was inspiring.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It offered a unique approach to media theory that, depending on one's own emphasis, could function as a general survey or as a more specialized course. Also, John is a great professor, so I would recommend the course just as an opportunity to work with him."
