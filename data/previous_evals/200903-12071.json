   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Professor Matthews does a great job expanding the discussion to include important questions of Roman history rather than focusing solely on parsing the Latin. This course is a good mix of both Latin language and Roman history.",
    "we close read tacitus and pliny all semester. good for your analytic ability.",
    "I would recommend it because it was interesting.",
    "This course involves surprisingly little translation - you could almost get by just reading the translations. If you're into slacking, that's convenient; if you're interested in improving your Latin, you'll have to be your own motivation. Each week saw the discussion of a set of passages from Tacitus, Pliny and occasionally, some related authors. These discussions, though often enlightening - Professor Matthews knows more than you could imagine - were also often wandering and occasionally superficial. I only worked out what the course was about a few weeks from the end of term, which might just have been me, but, I think, also speaks to a certain fuzziness in the class itself. That said, this fuzziness allowed a relaxed vibe that I didn't mind; it was the sort of class that would have been well held in a luxurious study with a glass of port close at hand. It's possible a student more engaged than I was would have a different take on the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anybody, classics major or not. It is an interesting subject taught by a brilliant professor. There could be no better combination."
