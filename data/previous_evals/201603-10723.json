    "How to develop and write about personal experiences, particularly in different, specific contexts.",
    "My writing has got a lot better, and this class has helped me work through a lot of the personal issues I had.",
    "I really liked how we were encouraged to experiment with different writing strategies and styles in this class, and I hope to use these tactics in the future. This class also allowed me to learn how to write for an audience along with for myself. Definitely a great class if you want to learn how to write nonfiction!",
    "This class really elevated my writing to college level and beyond. With the skills I acquired in English 120, I really feel as though I am now a good enough writer to excel in any future profession with a writing component.",
    "I was exposed to a type of writing very different than anything I had seen in high school. It was fun and interesting to read personal essays, and challenging yet fulfilling to write them. We learned a variety of techniques and structures to employ and learned about six different types of modern essays styles.",
    "This course really helped me to develop critical and close reading and revise my writing more efficiently. It was helpful to learn about tremendous resources available to improve one's writing.",
    "I learned a lot about how to write creatively and engagingly, which was a fun alternative to the academic essays I've written my whole life.",
    "I learned many effective writing techniques and how to use certain rhetorical devices, all of which, I can use in my future essay writing. I also learned how to craft an essay based on a public significance and the appropriate audience. I learned when to take advice for revisions and when to not take advice.",
    "I learned how to critically examine what a piece of writing made me think and feel and how it did so. I learned how to apply the techniques I was newly aware of to my own writing.",
    "Writing techniques and strategies for creative non-fiction essays."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course taught a lot about how to convey a message through writing a creative nonfiction piece, which is at once very hard to do but very rewarding. There are a lot of nuances of writing that you either do or don't get, which can be very challenging.",
    "I would have liked if we had some shorter or longer writing assignments thrown in (most of the class was spent writing 4-6 page essays). The assigned readings were diverse and wonderful and the suggestions from our professor were great.",
    "The depth of the syllabus in our section was really useful. Its far easy to write well when you read lots of examples of good writing.",
    "This course does not have many weaknesses. The readings are interesting and help prepare you to write your own essay in a similar style. Personal writing is difficult but it is a good outlet, and it is different than the expository writing I am used to. The small class size is a good environment to get comfortable sharing and hearing your peers' opinions, and getting to know the professor. The only weakness I would say is that there could've been more detailed and ample feedback regarding drafts. That said, if you wanted more feedback, the professor was very willing to meet privately.",
    "Strengths: Allows for great creative writing and essay feedback is awesome Weaknesses: Classes can get boring\/repetitive.",
    "It was challenging to meet the expectations in the beginning of the course. Grading seemed subjective and the graded papers came late to incorporate any improvements into the following paper. I really loved the readings and I think analyzing them in class helped me the most. To improve overall experience, I would have a writing rubric.",
    "I thought this course was really well structured, I don't really have any suggestions for improvements.",
    "The strengths of the course include the structure with five essays, alternating between submitting drafts and revisions. The readings chosen for the course were also very good. Dr. Hopper did very well in choosing classic pieces, as well as pieces that were relevant to current events. A weakness was the section of the humor\/satirical essay. Many of the readings were student-chosen and consisted of very short humor essays, which did not really help with the assignment. I wish that there were better examples, as well as more guidelines for this essay.",
    "Just the right amount of work. The workshop aspect of the class was very useful and enjoyable! Wonderful readings."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I will definitely recommend this class to other people.",
    "Yes! A great course!",
    "Most definitely. A must-take if you want to be able to produce writing that you are proud of.",
    "Yes, if you want to work on personal essays and try something different.",
    "If you enjoy writing personal essays and writing about true things creatively, this is the class for you. As a STEM major, I still enjoyed this class and even enjoyed the writing process as the essays are very fun to write.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who would like to polish his\/her writing skills. However, if you are looking to satisfy your WR, there are other courses that would do just that with more clarity and ease.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The essays and class are really fun and creative, in a way many other classes at Yale are definitely not.",
    "I would very much recommend ENGL 120, to any student at Yale, regardless of year or major. With the way it's set up, it's incredibly helpful for everyone at any writing level. The workload may seem difficult, because it is a draft due one week and revisions due the next week, but once you're deep into writing, it isn't burdensome at all. Workshopping may seem really stressful or intimidating at first, but you'll realize that every one of your classmates wants you to improve, and most of the comments you receive will be really constructive.",
    "English 120 is incredible and you have to take it. I am not an English major, but this was by far my favorite course I've taken in my three semesters at Yale. I looked forward to doing the readings (they were fun, New Yorker style personal essays and never too long or dry), and I looked forward to going to seminar and taking about the readings and how to write. It was just a fun, engaging class. I also felt my writing improve so much over the course of the semester. It was just one of those classes where you can feel yourself growing. The feedback on the drafts is through, deep, and often difficult to implement, but you always know what your instructor will be looking for on the graded revision, which lessens stress considerably. Also, take it with Dr. Hopper, she's wonderful! She may not have the magnetic charisma of some of the other professors, but she is extremely talented at teaching you how to write. She was exceptional at making sure we all knew how to read professional essays in a way that would improve our own writing, and was very methodical and effective at showing us exactly how an author achieved a desired effect. You come out of every section feeling like you just know so much more, and its all things you can use in every type of writing. Take it, take it, take it!!!",
    "Yes, absolutely! This is a fantastic and refreshing class, especially is students have been conditioned to write analytical essays. ="
