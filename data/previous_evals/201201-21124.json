    "The course gave a comprehensive overview of the scholarship and issues in the field of manuscript studies. It was particularly helpful in that we were introduced to paleography, and had the opportunity to do a codicological examination of a manuscript in the Beinecke. I would recommend the course to aspiring specialists who need to broaden their knowledge of the history of Byzantine art, though it might not appeal to people with only general interest, as the issues discussed were quite particular to the field."
