    "In Writing About Food, I developed a greater understanding of the successes and failures of the American food system and how it impacts Americans of all socioeconomic statuses; I also learned about the history of food and cookbooks and their role in shaping our views of women and their place in society. We had many fascinating readings from food luminaries all over the world and across many different time spans. I also honed my ability to write creative nonfiction.",
    "This course isn't so much about pretentious food writing, but more about writing about food in such a way that it connects to people. You get to study history, political policy, and creative writing in this course! I would definitely recommend it if you get the chance!",
    "I learned that good writing can be truly excellent and can take many forms.",
    "I learned a lot about the craft of food writing--how to present food in recipe form, how to write a food memoir, how to critically analyze cookbooks, and how to make personal food experiences accessible and engaging to others.",
    "I learned how to craft the stories of food into a narrative with rich personal details and interesting factual\/anecdotal information.",
    "In taking Writing About Food, I was able to learn both about the mechanics of becoming a better creative writer, within the context of learning about food writing. Since food writing requires some stylistic differences to other types of writing, this class allowed me to explore outside of writing styles that I am typically familiar with."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course have to be the readings and the workshop style of the class. The readings were quite enjoyable and engaging, and the workshop atmosphere made the class feel less like a competition than a writer's guild: a group impassioned, interested writers all working together to discover the meaning of food. I think the weaknesses in this course are the slow return time when it comes to grading papers and the food film fest. It's difficult to gauge how we should edit our next paper when we haven't received back the paper before it yet; returning papers more quickly would help with that. The food film fest, while interesting, is a tad unrealistic in its expectation that fifteen students nearing the beginning of finals week will find time to watch over a dozen food-related movies. There was also significant overlap in the presentations that I felt could have been avoided very simply. The instructions were also very unclear as to what the presentations should analyze (my group thought that each movie was supposed to be discussed and analyzed as a single, isolated unit; the goal (we discovered only after presenting) was to make connections between our assigned films (which was curiously unstated in the film fest rubric).",
    "Strengths: we read a wide range of authors and topics. Weaknesses: we did not spend as much time on craft as I would have liked",
    "more focus on writing instead of reading a course packet with the readings would be useful",
    "I enjoyed many aspects of the class. The reading assignments were excellent; I enjoyed watching films for the food film festival; in-class tastings (of cheeses, marshmallow fluff, bread, etc.) were a blast; and I honestly enjoyed the writing assignments and peer-edits. The bi-weekly blog posts were an unexpectedly large amount of work. I would have preferred that we each have to write 5-10 posts over the course of the semester, rather than one post for every class. I was relatively disappointed by class discussions. Many of my classmates were on their laptops for the entirety of class, rather than engaging in conversation. I think a no-laptop policy would help. I also think that Professor Stuart could do a better job of changing up the class format. Most weeks we either had a peer-edit session or simply discussed our blog posts. I would have preferred critical analysis of our reading assignments, film clips, mini student presentations...anything to mix it up. Perhaps each student could present one food film over the course of the semester, taking 15-20 minutes of class once or twice a week. That would be less stressful and in my opinion more interesting than the all-at-once food film festival we had at the end of the semester. The final complaint I have about the class is the restaurant review assignment. I found it completely unreasonable that Professor Stuart expected each of us to go to New York and eat a multiple-course meal at the Union Square Cafe; it was a logistical and financial disaster for many of us. New Haven is such an interesting food hub! I think the restaurant review assignment is valuable, but would much prefer that future students get to stay in New Haven, and perhaps even pick which restaurant (whether a cafe, food cart, etc.) they eat at and review.",
    "The course was an overall excellent experience with each unit providing an interest approach to writing about food. My only complaint would be the group film project at the end of the semester. The project seemed disorganized and groups were impossible to coordinate. It would be best for this project to be re-structured into individual or partner assignments.",
    "This course does a great job in keeping the students engaged as it requires a blog post for every class, meaning that at least one of the assigned articles needs to be read beforehand, ensuring some foundation for discussions in class. Additionally, this course covers a surprising range of food writing topics, from cookbooks to familial traditions and the inclusion of food in movies. As far as the mechanics of the course then, I don't have many criticisms that could not be solved with further student engagement."

    "If you have even a topical interest in food, try to take this course. And if you can get in off the waiting listtake it! Your writing skills will greatly improve and you will learn so much more about food than you ever thought there was to learn.",
    "It was an interesting course that did not require too much work. It wasn't my favorite course, but it was quite solid.",
    "Yes I would except for that it can be very critical of an enjoyable subject.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students for its fun reading and writing assignments, but would caution them about the nature of class discussion.",
    "Honestly, don't even bother. This class was disorganised, and Prof Stuart's teaching style gets increasingly dishevelled over the course of the semester, to put it kindly. This would be fine if the content was good, but the syllabus is mind-numbingly repetitive throughout. Not only that, it's exceedingly Eurocentric, and she regularly assigns outright racist readings without comment or critical analysis. She depends heavily upon international students \/ students of colour to provide counter perspectives in the class, giving the impression that in a less diverse class, those critical views would not be engaged with at all. If you're planning to put in mediocre work and be barely engaged in class and still get an average grade, this is the class for you. But if you are someone who actually puts effort into assignments and expects to be rewarded for your hard work, definitely avoid this class. You could consistently get the highest score on every assignment, speak up constantly during class, get a 94.75% numerical grade on Canvas, and still get saddled with an A- because of her strident policy of not rounding up grades true. story. Grades wouldn't matter if the class was worth it otherwise, but it really isn't. Write about food in your own time. You won't gain anything here.",
    "If you have even the slightest interest in food and writing taking the course! The readings are a bit excessive but are all very interesting and fun to read. Class discussions can be a little dry especially towards the end of the semester, but Professor Stuart keeps the class engaged with well-timed food events. Your creative writing skills will improve as well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who needs a writing credit and would like to take a course outside the standard ENGL 114\/120 writing cycle. As someone not typically associated with the major, this class provided a look into proper creative writing without coming across as intimidating, as the subject matter was very approachable."
