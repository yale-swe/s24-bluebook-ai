   "comments": [
    "I improved my ability to compare texts beyond recognizing simple differences. Professor Weaver pushed us all to consider why these differences matter, to pull out big ideas. Perhaps with greater frequency than any other course I've taken at Yale, this course made me think about the role scholars themselves play through their contributions in shaping their field.",
    "I already came in with background knowledge about the criminal justice system, but I read a lot of books that provided excellent theoretical and historical background. Some of the books I had wanted to read already, and some I hadn't heard of - I enjoyed almost all of them. I also learned a lot about the American criminal justice system before the past twenty years, which is often not discussed as much.",
    "Awesome introduction to the U.S. criminal justice system and the effects of mass incarceration. Fantastic subject matter and an outstanding professor.",
    "I gained and intensive introduction to sociology\/political science literature about punishment in America, and also an intensive introduction to how to think about and conduct social science research. I tremendously enjoyed this course and it now allows me to develop more complete insights about this field.",
    "I have expanded my knowledge and developed my skills in essay writing throughout this course. I have learned about the influence of institutionalized racism and other forms of systematic oppression on the criminal justice system. I now know the criminal justice policy history of America. I understand the connections between law enforcement agencies and various non governmental entities. I understand the disparate racial impact on communities by police, prosecutors, judges, etc. I have been able to practice in depth political science research. I understand the impact of punitive systems of governance and social services and welfare. I have learned so so much from this class and my perspective on race and poverty in America has been transformed.",
    "This class provided a strong foundation for understanding the political and social histories that have resulted in the expansion of the racially disparate carceral state. I further developed my knowledge and understanding of one of the most pressing crises of our time.",
    "This class provides a wonderful historical and political background of incarceration in America. We were exposed to compelling theories and analyses of the carceral state."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is challenging in the best way. Professor Weaver expects a lot from her students, but she rewards them with engaging meetings and thoughtful feedback. The course is exceptionally well organized, and Professor Weaver helped us draw connections between the texts throughout the semester, even months after a reading was assigned. For that reason, every week of the course felt indispensable. If I could change anything about the course, I would shorten the student presentations to open up opportunities to participate, but this wasn't always an issue.",
    "I think this is a really wonderful course. Class discussion is robust, and the readings are great. (I think the order of the readings maybe could be altered, but we discussed that in class). Professor Weaver was very helpful during office hours. I think student presentations took up a little too much time - they might be more helpful if they only took up around 15 minutes.",
    "Exceptional seminar with a highly engaging Professor who genuinely cares about her students and what they think! My favorite readings of any course I've taken - gives a great depth of knowledge about the intersection of race and punishment.",
    "This was a great syllabus and I thought the assignments were appropriate\/helpful. My only wish for this course would be for professor weaver to speak more (I was really interested to hear her insight) and also for (if possible) there to be a smaller environment, although I know that is hard since the course is over subscribed.",
    "The books were informative but all very similar. The discussions were complex and engaging. There was very little discussion of black women and LGTBQ people in the criminal justice system. More guidance with the final paper would have been helpful.",
    "This course was extremely strong. The discussion was extremely engaging, fascinating, awe-inspiring. The readings were so eye-opening. This class is a must take for any Yale Student who wants to understand one of the most pressing issues in America currently. Criminal justice is a topic in political science that only recently has received interest. This class inspired all of us to take action. I now understand how integral understanding the criminal justice system is to understanding employment rates, homelessness, incarceration, welfare reception. My professor taught me that statistics can be manipulated in academic journals and this lesson was extremely valuable as well.",
    "The readings were wonderful, but the discussions were one-sided and scattered. I would've liked more structure, because I often felt that the conversations didn't really further my understanding of the readings.",
    "Strengths: Geat selection of works. brilliant and incredible knowledge-filled teaching by our professor. Weaknesses: Class discussions could often go on tangents unrelated to the text or topic at hand. Discussions strayed from the policies into incredibly abstract realms. This always seemed to happen when the discussion to the students. Of course this is not a weakness of the course itself per se. I think that more effort can be made to refocus discussion on the political science\/theory without straying too far into the anecdotal when not relevant."

   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're willing to put in the work. Professor Weaver is a force of nature.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to everyone",
    "Yes! Professor Weaver is brilliant, and you will be challenged to push your thinking and writing further than you have done before. She has high expectations, and you will not have your hand held, but she is always willing to talk about your work and your ideas in a really constructive manner.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course - you learn so much about the current criminal justice system, but also about its historical and theoretical underpinnings. Class discussion is very engaging, and some students are doing amazing work on trying to fix various aspects of the criminal justice system. Professor Weaver is so knowledgable and a leader in the field!",
    "A wonderful course that gives an amazing introduction to the political, economic, and social impact of the U.S. penal system as well as a strong overview of the origins of mass incarceration. You start by learning how it originated and end with how to reform it!",
    "Yes, This was an excellent course. However, it is important to know what to expect. It is an intensive introduction to the social science understanding of punishment and race in the United States. While philosophical\/theoretical frameworks inform this understanding, this is a social science course and people expecting to have more humanities oriented discussions\/understandings of the topic will be disappointed. If you are looking for a social science introduction to the topic, this course is perfect.",
    "I would absolutely absolutely recommend this course to all Yale students and all people living in the United States in general. This is key to creating visibility for the remaining prevalence of institutionalized racism that still influences American governance. This relates to the criminalization of blackness and the militarization of police.",
    "Yes, absolutely. The subject matter is so pressing and critically important, and this is a great class to further develop your understanding."
