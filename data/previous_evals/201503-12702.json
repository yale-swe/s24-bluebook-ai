   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I would not recommend it if you are not a pre-med or not interested in the biological and chemical implications that physics has. It is a lot of outside work and shouldn't be taken in conjunction with other science classes in my opinion. Either way we truly learned some very interesting ways to apply physics to infectious diseases, blood circuitry, and even nuclear chain reactions!",
    "Pretty good class, the professors are very helpful and accommodating. Psets are a bit tough though",
    "PHYS 170 is a challenging but interesting physics class. It does a decent job of incorporating physics into biological concepts which is extremely applicable for those on the pre-med track. The level of calculus required is reasonable for a non-STEM student. The midterms were excessively difficult in my opinion and seemed to be more about trick questions than testing my knowledge of the course. I will be taking PHYS 171 next semester, so hopefully this course has served as a solid base.",
    "I would recommend this class over 180 because it is much more tailored to the MCAT 2015.",
    "If you want a class that isn't standard intro physics, takes 170. It's not the best class, but at least you won't be doing the same thing again.",
    "Only take if you have to. A ton of work",
    "PHYS 170 is exactly what is advertised--a less intense version of intro physics that emphasizes biological applications of physics. Half the course is really about problem solving and has little to do with traditional physics, but they were good at developing problem solving\/calculation skills. I know many students had complaints about the class in terms of teaching quality and pace, but I thought that both instructors were fairly good teachers and that the material was readily understandable if you spent a little time studying problem solving approaches presented in class\/modules.",
    "It is a confusing class that is difficult in many ways and not in just a couple others. The overall structure is pretty good but the material gets a bit murky. The exams are very appropriate for what is taught but the psets don't really help with anything.",
    "I would recommend physics 170 to students that are not as interested in physics. The class deviates from Newtonian physics pretty early on (after the 4th module) and the class gets intensively math-y afterwards. Interesting at times and difficult most of the time.",
    "Great professors. Horrible class.",
    "I would advise against taking it. Take physics 180.",
    "PHYS 170 is a class on the physics of life sciences. It teaches basic principles of physics but shifts and primarily focus on the physical aspects and approaches in biology. Although an intro class, it's not a conventional physics 101. I would recommend this course to students who would be interested in learning a physical or quantitative approach to biology, rather than pure physics.",
    "Great, challenging class that should be taken with friends because study groups proved essential for success.",
    "Very hard class and expect to spend a lot of time on it, but overall you learn a lot and it is very rewarding. TAKE WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS OTHERWISE YOU WILL NOT SUCCEED IN THIS CLASS. Problem sets are impossible and all of them will require asking the TAs or professors for help since you can't do them by yourself. Exams were generally fair and they curve it.",
    "A class in which you connect biology and physics. Definitely still a challenging course, and if you haven't taken calculus in a while it might be difficult.",
    "I would not recommend this class, but obviously if you are considering it that is because you have to take physics, in which case it isn't a terrible option. The class is hard and the psets are ridiculous, but the course is incredibly well supported by the staff and the professors and TAs go above and beyond to provide as much assistance and support to the students as possible. If you take advantage of that and are ready to work hard it should be fine.",
    "This class was very time consuming and even though the material was interesting, it was sometimes presented in a confusing manner.",
    "I do recommend. I usually don't like physics, but this was maybe my favorite course this semester. It was an interesting new way of thinking about a lot of basic physics concepts, often to a more complex depth than I was expecting.",
    "If you want a traditional physics experience, do not take this class. Made for pre-med students",
    "PHYS 170 was geared towards bio majors and pre-meds and did a good job relating physics concepts to biology and chemistry. I would recommend it over 180 for premeds\/bio majors, but the problems sets require a ton of work. The lectures can be frustrating because they tend to go into derivations in too much depth. However, the exams were mostly fair.",
    "All the reviews that I read when deciding between PHYS 170 and 180 said to take 180, but I didn't listen to them because I was like \"oh, 170 will be fine, it can't be that bad.\" I wish I had listened. DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE. 170's instructors are nice and helpful, and the grade clarity (they would post your grades right away and you could track them easily) was super nice, but other than that, 170 is super obscure concepts that are barely physics. The psets are ridiculously hard and no one is able to do them without the TAs and instructors basically telling them the answer. The midterms are of unpredictable difficulty and the final was unreasonably hard.",
    "I would only take this course if you are premed\/need physics and are interested in life processes and don't want to learn classical physics.",
    "It's a physics class, but more fun that I thought it would be. If you need to take a physics class and want to take something that you feel will be somewhat useful as a pre-med then definitely take this class.",
    "I took this class as a pre-req for my major and because I am pre-med. I enjoyed it and it was one of my favorite classes, but the exams were much harder than the practice tests and the PSETs were way too hard at many points throughout the semester.",
    "Don't take it unless you have it as a requirement. There is a fairly intense workload and the lectures are dry and derivation heavy.",
    "To be honest I'm not sure I would recommend physics 170 to another student. It is taken mainly by premeds looking to fulfill the premed requirement but not much physics is actually learned. If you really like physics, take 180. If not, take 170, but be prepared because problem sets are difficult and so are exams. You may find the material more interesting, but it won't be as helpful for the MCAT as you may like.",
    "I only took basic physics in high school and that didn't help me at all for this class. To do well on the psets you just have to go to office hours and get the answers and explanations from the TAs. The exams were actually pretty hard, and they are not curved. Only the final letter grade that you receive for the class ends up being curved. And I did not dig the teaching style. I just didn't follow anything going on in class, and learned better from just reading the module on my own, which is exactly what they go over during the lecture. But you have to go to class because you have to get participation. While the difficult biological applications of the physics we were learning, made it harder to grasp the actual physics part, it was pretty interesting, and I think I understand some biological methods better now, but I think i'll still try to avoid the physics surrounding it.",
    "I would recommend the course for anyone wanting to learn basic concepts of physics. However, I do not think premed students should choose physics 170 over other physics courses just because they are premed, since I did not learn much about medicine.",
    "PHYS 170 has the potential to be a useful class, however without any physics background it is difficult to keep up. It is not a regular straight forward physics class (and doesn't pretend to be), however it is also so unique that finding outside materials to help is nearly impossible. I would recommend it to someone that has previous physics experience and wants to do lots of application without needing to learn the basic physics on its own first.",
    "Read if you care want to know what this class meant to a senior applying to grad school, working two part time jobs, in a senior society, and doing the intensive BS major. First: It is possible, but it is a lot of work. I did terribly on the two midterms (below average) and because I participated in class, did mostly well on the quizes, did really well on the psets, my grade towards the end was okay. Homeworks: Work in groups or with friends. These things are impossible to do alone. Try working on them alone, then go to the section learn how TF did it, then go to your group learn how they did it, discuss etc. The first two weeks of school start eyeing friends or potential people you wouldn't mind working on the psets with. Trust me, if you do the pset alone you won't get full points. Study Hall and Section Go to them. It is a big time commitment. I could not go to Study Hall on Thursdays nor Sundays because it intersected with my society. I think I would have done much better in class had I gone. Go to your TAs section. Most TAs go over 1 or 2 problems, and if you don't understand what happened in class (which was the case for me), going to the TF section clarified a lot of things for me. Quizes Although some of them are simple and easy some of them are not. So study for them. I recommend doing the grey boxes (examples) in the module since those are usually modified in some form as the quiz. I don't think I got an A in this class, but I don't think I got a C or a B- either. If you are juggling with a lot as a senior like I was: studying for the GREs, grad school apps, jobs, society, research, and other classes... this class will be very difficult. But, I was able to do it because I dedicated at least 10 hours to this class every week (mostly PSETS). My thoughts: The material in this class is super cool. If you took bio classes and learned about actin polymerization, DNA replication, myosin, or other topics... you will learn how and why these things work in a physical context. It's really cool. You also learn about how plagues spread and why they do. I really enjoyed the material. It was hard to go through, but cool. Good luck.",
    "If you're a premed or a biology major, don't be fooled into taking this class for that reason. They biological concepts complicate the basic physics that you need an understanding of for the MCAT. It's not any easier than 180, and you end up learning applications that are useless in practice. If you enjoy or excel at calculus, take 180 or 200 which don't involve these abstract applications.",
    "Phys 170 is a lot of work. Before taking this class, understand that you will be putting in a lot of time on problem sets and studying for weekly quizzes. Most students only take the course because they need to for a requirement but I would recommend it to anyone. It is an interesting class and does a good job integrating physics and biology in a a new and interesting way. Just be aware of the time commitment!",
    "Don't take it. Seriously. Don't.",
    "I think PHYS 170 is a lot of work, but ultimately, it is a worthwhile class to take if you plan on taking the MCATs. Be prepared to devote a lot of time to the class and seek out all the help\/collaboration possible; go to study halls and office hours, and work with fellow students on the problem set--this will make things much easier.",
    "It was a fine class, interesting and not near as bad as people say. Sometimes the examples with biological systems are pretty forced, but it's overall an interesting class. I would recommend it, it's difficult but pretty interesting.",
    "I think that PHYS 170 was by far one of the best science courses I've taken at Yale simply because both instructors (Simon and Claudia) were so open to feedback. I could truly feel the class becoming better over the course of the semester simply because instructors were incorporating the feedback from students into lectures. As a pre-med student also studying for the MCAT, I always gained a huge insight into how much physics goes into biological systems. It's a great class for any pre-med student!",
    "Phys 170 was a little all over the place, but as expected it strayed away from a classic understanding of physics. Its connection to the biological sciences was very interesting and compatible with my biochemistry class. Take it because its workload is probably easier than 180. The material was very interesting and Dr. Simone obviously made a great deal of effort and talent to wrote the well thought out modules. The TA's at the end of the day did most of the work preparing the students for exams. The lectures were not necessarily that compatible with the exams and a lot of the material in the modules were superfluous.",
    "PHYS 170 was some forces\/vectors\/kinematics\/traditional physics and mostly probability and its applications. I would only recommend this course if the instructors made it more straightforward, especially the modules. I do not think this course really teaches basic or fundamental physics, but I am hoping it makes a difference in preparation for the MCAT since it is supposed physics for the life sciences.",
    "This class in sloppily organized (no textbook - the information is in ten ~20 page modules written by Prof Mochrie) and the information is confusingly taught in class. The psets each week are hard, but the TAs and study sessions on Thursday nights are extremely helpful. But, this class is the best us pre-med students are gonna get when it comes to physics, and you just gotta keep pushing and you'll make it through and maybe retain some knowledge about random walks and pressure systems."
