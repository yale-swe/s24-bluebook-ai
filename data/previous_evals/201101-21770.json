   "comments": [
    "Take a seminar instead. The problem sets were actually fine, but the paper didn't get any easier because of them. And sitting through days of presentations was absolutely awful.",
    "No, I would take a different 400 level econ class that's taught more like a seminar.",
    "The problem sets and take-home midterm were incredibly tedious, difficult, and time-consuming. Aside from that, though, not much work for the course. Much of the class was built around student presentations. Putting together and presenting was incredibly informative and instructive...listening to other students do the same was not.Glad I took the course, but it definitely got a little boring at times. Only take if you are an econ major and have a good grasp of econometrics. LOTS OF STATA!",
    "Ehhh...probably better econ classes out there.",
    "This class is not worth your time. There are much better senior seminars in the economics department. The class was very interesting and fun in the first two months of the semester, and then became positively ridiculous in demands and mode of delivery.First of all, while the first two problems sets were manageable, and a good way to apply the theory covered in class, the take-home midterm was way too hard, and completely unrelated to anything we had done in this class before. Not only did the professor expect us to know pretty advanced econometrics and data processing in Stata (without this expectation being explicitly stated on the course syllabus), but he also required us to find our own data sets online in order to do a ridiculous empirical exercise.What is more, the second half of the course was devoted entirely to student presentations of published research, followed by a session of questions and answers during which the professor would call on us BY NAME to answer specific questions about the paper. This was very stressful for me, and has detracted a lot from my understanding of the research being presented, as I would be too busy looking for the answers to questions he might ask and writing them down, while nervously waiting for my name to be called. Overall, this class has felt like a major waste of time, and the only new things I've learned from it came from the individual research I did for my final paper. This is not what a Yale class should be like.",
    "Tough but rewarding.",
    "Recommend.",
    "Really good course. The material is interesting and a good mix of theory and empirics. Professor Atkin is very fair and the smartest professor I've had here.",
    "Great professor. I really enjoyed writing the final paper. All in all, I would recommend it.",
    "Solid class - not the most interesting ever, but important issues.",
    "Interesting macro trade topics are covered starting about 4 or 5 weeks into the semester, but expect a lot of boring lectures on models in the first month. Not a whole lot of work, and the professor didn't seem to care about whetheror not people came to class. Good senior year seminar if you want to slack off and pick up some interesting cases about trade, but also expect a lot of boredom along the way."
