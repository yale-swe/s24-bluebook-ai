   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The SAS instruction was not very comprehensive and I feel a lot of my classmates and I did not learn much about SAS at all.",
    "strengths: well paced - but sometimes the concepts were scattered.",
    "More clear SAS labs - no differences between TAs",
    "Strengths - enjoyed SAS lab, review sessions for examsWeaknesses - difficult to understand hand writing and follow notesImprovements - incorporate more examples in class that are calculated all the way through (from first step to the last, with all calculations), especially for the first half of the material. I remember preparing for the midterm and not knowing what to do because I didn't have an example done all the way through. Also, it would have been nice to have the outline given during the midterm review (the flow chart) as we were learning the different statistical tests so that we could have organized our notes in an understandable and clear way.",
    "I felt that I was not integrated into the course. It was difficult to understand how\/where to apply certain things at time. I also think that the homework was also unrelated to what was learned in class a good portion of the time. However, I think it is fairly tested.",
    "Dr. Klaus was a vary good teacher. She deviated from the book occasionally which made it hard to always follow along if you missed class. Handwriting was also a bit difficult to read, and hard to get notes if you missed class. (I'm not one who skips class regularly, but had to miss a couple).",
    "Strengths: discussing manual calculations along with corresponding SAS coding, open book exams are helpful to skip the memorizing and get better grasp of conceptsWeaknesses: lab should be longer, homework should be due every other week rather than just four times throughout the semester",
    "Excellent",
    "Strengths- very relevant to public health.Weakness- The homework was repetitive and uninformative at times.",
    "I learned a lot. The exams are not like the homework so don't always reflect what you know.",
    "The professor could have used more examples and practice problems from the text book so that when approaching homework questions, it would have been easier to figure out where to start. Additionally, the TA's could have been more prepared for class and better at understanding questions instead of spending 10-15 minutes reading the lab and then sharing with us how to approach the assignment.",
    "This was a great class, and I enjoyed learning the material. It has definitely given me a better grasp of statistical analyses, and the material fit together with at least two other classes that I took this semester.I also think that the Pagano&Gauvreau textbook is quite good. The class goes in a little bit of a different order, but the book is brief, informative, and (mostly) clear.Strengths are always hard to talk about. I liked that Prof. Claus integrated SAS into the lectures as much as she could, and the frequent handouts proved to be extremely useful. She was about as chipper as one could be at 8:30 on a Monday morning. Her lectures were clear and deliberate, and I appreciated that she wrote out her notes as we went along. I can't imagine what a mess this course would have been if it had all been on PowerPoint.The biggest weakness was its seeming lack of coherence from the POV of the students. For the midterm and then the final, Prof. Claus laid out two flow charts to help guide us through the decision-making process when analyzing a problem. Those flow charts should be established on the first day. Then, as you go through the semester, she can say \"we make this decision here, head down this path, and this is how you do the relevant calculations.\" I remember that, before she set out the flow chart for the midterm, several of us spent many hours trying to understand out how everything that we had learned fit all together. Give the students the map right the beginning, and refer to it often.Finally, I think that the amount of homework was fine, I would just try to spread it out a little better. For many students it was a cycle of three weeks of nothing, then one crazy week of panic and biostats, then three weeks of nothing, etc. I know that we should be doing the homework as we cover things, but we're busy with hundreds of other projects and classes, so a hard deadline is the only thing that can really keep us honest. Maybe instead of four homeworks, students get six. The same number of problems, just spread them out a little bit. Alternate weeks or something.",
    "I like the course's use of SAS. I've never had any other statistic's course teach how to do statistics on paper and on SAS, concurrently.",
    "Michelle is my TAMichelle is friendly and approachable. She is always willing to help, even beyond her TA hours.Weaknesses:When there is homework due that week and I approach her, she had not read the question before and so took a while in figuring out the solution. I hope that she would at least be beware of the question and have solutions on hand during TA sessions.Also TA sessions should be wed-fri when homework is due on fri. Having sessions on Mon and Tue would not maximize the time of the TA since few students would go to Mon\/Tue TA sessions.",
    "I thought that this course was an excellent introduction to statistics and SAS. I thought that every assessment we had was fair: both the midterm, final, and homework assignments. I though the small lab sections were great to have one-on-one help with SAS which has such a steep learning curve. I think that the strengths are the ease of explanation, the instructor, and the lab sections. The only weakness I can see is that class is not required, so many people do not attend class, but that was not an issue for me.",
    "The course could strongly benefit from more organization of the material. I liked the structure of the SAS labs, although they did not seem to match the material until later in the semester. I also liked our textbook, although it often did not seem to match the work done in class.I actually liked the use of overhead notes and I attended most lectures. One aspect of lectures that would have significantly made a difference was organizing the lecture material with an agenda (i.e., I. Chi-Square Test, II. McNemar's Test). It would also be helpful if we labeled our example problems and equations. I spent a lot of time organizing my notes and taking my own from the book to help make sense of what we had done in class.Similarly, the use of ClassesV2 was great, but the material on there also could have been strongly improved by organizing it!One thing I really, really liked was the use of handouts. It was really helpful to physically have a handout and be able to mark on it during lecture.Another thing I liked was the quick feedback on our homework and the structure of the midterm and final exam.However, the exams were really crowded! Could we besplit into groups or spread out a little more? I learned my lesson on the midterm and showed up for the final exam 45 minutes early to claim a seat (and the one next to me) so I could comfortably take the exam.",
    "The course moved very quickly - too quickly. We went through the entire textbook in one semester, and I feel it moved too quickly to be able to cultivate a solid understanding of the material. Also, the lectures and section presentations were very disconnected from how the material might be applied in the real world. I felt that when I got to the homework problems, I had no idea how to apply all the formulas from the class into real world examples. And the textbook went through many unnecessary derivations of formulas, which was confusing and unhelpful.",
    "Strengths: I like the way the units were organized. The class flowed easily. Lots of repetition with many examples on the same idea, which helped me. Lots of examples using SAS output\/code in class, which was VERY helpful. Overall a great stats class, I learned a lot and grew in skills.Weaknesses: No power points, no way to go back over notes if you wanted to review what was discussed in class, because she took notes on the overhead and had poor handwriting, could not follow it.",
    "I think that the lectures were clear and easy to follow. I don't think that the text book was particularly useful, but the homework questions fit well with the material covered during class. I think that SAS lab was a weak point for me.",
    "Strengths: Material was presented pretty clearly and at a good pace in lecture.Weaknesses: Not enough time in lab to really learn the SAS material. Instead, we worry about just completing it but it would be more valuable if we had time to go over less material per session especially because it builds each week.",
    "The material was interesting, however, the lectures seemed unorganized and not as easy to follow if the book wasn't read beforehand.",
    "Strength: TA sessions and practical SAS labsWeakness: The actual classes were unhelpful",
    "This course provided a very good introduction to biostatistics, and effectively reinforced main themes of the course through homework assignments and exams. I wish SAS labs were a bit more comprehensive, because I feel as if I didn't take away as much from that portion of the class.",
    "The instructor handwrited class notes so cann't see quite clearly",
    "While class session were easily replaced by just looking at the textbook, this course was extremely effective in communicating the key concepts. I feel as though I learned a lot about biostatistics.",
    "I think that the course material was covered in a logical order. I think that the first couple problem sets did not relate as well to in-class lectures as did the later problem sets. It was more helpful when the homework served to reinforce class concepts as opposed to adding more confusion. I thought that overall, lecture was a little confusing, but that Dr. Claus tried to make things easy to comprehend. The lab component of the course was my favorite part, but I think that potentially the TAs should have better training on how to instruct the lab. I thought that the tests were fair and related well to class concepts. I think that I learned a good amount in this course, but that sometimes things were more confusing than they needed to be.",
    "Even though I struggle with SAS, the lab is valuable to get experience with programming and get comfortable with the platform. However the labs still need a bit of refinement; some of them were ridiculously straightforward so that they amounted to copy and pasting the example code. Some were so difficult (for beginners) that the TF basically had to lead us through every step.",
    "I don't feel very comfortable with SAS coding. Perhaps choose a better book to teach us.",
    "Strengths: we are able to learn a lot of useful information that will help us interpret and analyze papersThe exam is open book-- excellent idea considering that in the real world we won't be expected to memorize all formulasTAs (Yasmyn (sp?) and Michelle were awesome and so easily to follow. Joe is sooo sweet but he does not know how to teach (I'm sorry)!Weaknesses:Winslow: the lighting is not bright and this makes it very difficult to focus during a math class, the chairs are extremely uncomfortable (I was so uncomfortable during the final because there was not much space..the desk was pressing on my stomach)-We could benefit from a smart board, it is difficult to follow along because the professor uses a permanent marker on a transparency. If she had access to a smart board, she could write more because there will be more space. In class we usually struggle to quickly write everything because each transparency is filled after 1-2 sentences, so she switches it quickly.-Her handwriting and note organization are confusing. Again, I feel like a smart board will help her organize and present the notes more neatly andmore in a more organized manner.--During the review section for the midterm and the final, the professor presents a web\/chart that connects all statistical procedures in a simple way. She should show this in the beginning of the semester (or way sooner). I was very confused about how all these statistical tests connected, until I saw this chart!--There should be makeup exams or extra credit opportunities--I appreciate the introduction to SAS, but we do not actually learn how to use SAS. In lab it just feels like all we do is copy and paste code. Many people have said that.-I know that this can't be changed, but why must the class be so early at 8:30? It is so hard to process math at this time (for non-morning people) Of course this might sound like I'm just complaining.",
    "This course needs logical organization and progression. Lecture topics did not necessarily help with homework, and the labs were at times very frustrating. There was no comparison of the different statistical tests until the last week of class.",
    "The course was overall good, and I can say that I learned quite a bit. The homework assignments are very heavy, but the weeks without an assignment are not terrible. The teaching assistants have been incredibly helpful in ensuring we understand the concepts.",
    "SAS labs were pretty good in teaching SAS, and the homework assignments were very good. However, I felt that sometimes the lectures didn't teach enough to complete the homework assignments. The textbook was relatively difficult to read.",
    "More emphasis should have been on the labs",
    "The course was a good foundation for people who have not taken statistics before. Strengths include: the pacing of the course, problem set assignments, and the availability of the professor during office hours. However, the course could be improved by standardizing the grading styles between all TFs and putting an emphasis on completion efforts rather than accuracy.",
    "Strengths - We cover all the basic statistics required. I think that whatever Prof Claus covers is necessary and sufficient, and the material is not difficult for a beginner statistics class.Weaknesses - The labs could be better structured. The questions in the labs, for instance, could be split up in smaller parts and a piece of code and an answer would be sufficient to answer the question. For a beginner level, this seems to make more sense.To better understand coding in SAS or any language, I think that having to write down code on paper really forces an individual to understand and memorize the code. I have done this before in an undergrad computing class, and I found that it was both challenging and a thoughtful exercise in getting students to engage in coding.",
    "Overall good, large lecture is not the best for math.",
    "The class was clear and straightforward, and I thought the material was very useful in terms of understanding the statistics provided in studies I read in other classes. The textbook was helpful. Despite the sas labs I still don't feel confident in my Sas skills, and I think sas labs should be led differently and that the TAs should be more prepared for the lecture portion",
    "I miss understand the question",
    "The format of the class was fine, and the quality of instruction was great. The textbook (Biostats, not SAS), however, is awful. Worse than useless. Capable of confusing you on mean, median, and mode. Could not be less accessible if it were written in the Dutch equivalent of Pig Latin. Etcetera and so forth.",
    "I thought this class was horrible. The content was appropriate, but the manner of instruction was poor. I didn't feel that the lectures actually explained anything properly. The SAS labs were okay, but ultimately I felt that much of the grading revolved around making sure that you were not only answering the question asked, answered and presented your answers as they",
    "It would be more helpful to have more sample problems in class. The SAS printouts were great.",
    "Strengths - provides a good understanding of statistics and introduction into SAS",
    "Strengths: lab recitationWeakness: not having homework and tests organized for us to pick up",
    "Good class; lecture boring at times; homework slightly busy work; like open book",
    "Strengths are the straightforward design and layout. Weaknesses are the TAs mostly lacked knowledge on SAS.",
    "sometimes the TAs have incorrect answers so I was rarely inclined to go to office hours. Office hours with Dr. Claus were great but the TAs were very inconsistent and I was honestly more confident with my own answers than theirs.",
    "Really great, useful and interesting (once you get the hang of things) class.Strengths: very useful subject; the homework assignments throughout the semester made sure we were keeping up with the material; again Dr. Claus' teaching styleWeaknesses: none I can think of (except the class time was so early!)Improvements: perhaps starting off each half of semester with a summary flowchart of everything we will be covering (similar to what Dr. Claus presented to us during the midterm review session)",
    "Strength: SAS skillsWeakness: Terrible time slot.",
    "I felt that most of the learning I had to do myself. I would attend lecture, but felt that the professor was a bit scrambled in her teaching methods. Her notes were not easy to follow, but the book did a better job explaining the material. Her tests were however, fairly straightforward and her review sessions were great! Also, handouts in class were very helpful.",
    "Examples and homework assignments were helpful",
    "There needs to be better communication between the instructor and the TA's about how to do the labs and the homeworks because there was a lot of confusion about them, and it often resulted in incorrect answers.",
    "strengths: professor was amazing at being able to articulate exactly what she wanted her students to learn\/take away. couldn't be more specificweaknesses: the lab with the class could be longer than 1 hour. at times, the class was not long enough to learn the material for the first time then apply right away esp with one TF helping 20 students who are new with SAS",
    "Professor explains concepts well.Lab portion was not as helpful as hoped; did not come away feeling confident in SAS.",
    "Prof Claus is clear in the structure of the class and fair in her grading and assessments. It was unclear upon registration that the class required a separate lab time, so it would be nice to get a heads up on that. Further, lab time should be allocated for 1.5 hours, not just 1 hour. There were too many times the majority of the class was in there past the dedicated time and the TA would plan on staying later.Finally, the SAS book was not helpful for class. All SAS instruction in class and via the TA's in lab was helpful, but the book was not. I started the semester doing the readings but until you are in the lab, it is not relevant. Even then, I did not refer to the book given the quality and comprehensive nature of the instruction from Professor Claus and the TAs.",
    "Overall, I found it very helpful to attend the lectures as they were useful in understanding basic concepts. Examples were covered in class and I referred back to them often in tests and homework assignments. The book was also helpful in fleshing out concepts. I appreciated that the tests were meant to test your understanding of the concepts and not based on your ability to memorize formulas.",
    "It would be good to learn the basics of some other computer programs, as well.",
    "Lectures were good, SAS was not as relevant to me and I'm not sure how much I really learned there except to get through the coursework as needed.",
    "Good course.Strengths - Good instructor and TA'sWeaknesses - Can give more emphasis on SAS labs and practical applications of biostatistics.",
    "Although TA office hours are very helpful, I think it would be better to include an extra discussion section, 10-12 people each, for the course. In that way, students questions will be answered and many key points can also be reinforced during such sessions. I found it helpful for Epi. Given that Biostat TA office hours are usually very crowded, espeically before a homework is due, I think such addition would be beneficial to students.",
    "I thought the course was very good, and Prof. Claus showed mastery over the material. I would have preferred more in class test-like application of curriculum in place of formula derivation. Overall, though, I thought it was a good intro to Biostatistics.",
    "Very useful; good (re-)exposure. 50 minutes of laboratory session might not be adequate.",
    "Class was okay. The difficulty is that it is extremely social ... that is, the very structure and nature of the class is set up so that if you have one or more people with whom to study, go over homework, etc, you are empowered to potentially do better in the class than someone who is on his own.For me, a non-EPH student and someone who's a bit older than most of the students in the class, I never found a \"partner.\" The rest of the students are 25 years old, and in the first week or two are still meeting people. In the meantime, they're eating and living together, forming relationships and making it easy to get together to go over biostats stuff.So by the end of the semester I was left feeling extremely frustrated. I put in as much work as the average student -probably more- including attending every class, every lab, 2-3 TA sessions per week and 2 hours\/week with a tutor. Even so, I felt handicapped because other students were comparing answers on homework and I had to fit in as much as possible into the TA and tutor sessions (each question takes a LONG time to go over) and what was left, I just had to hand in and hope I'd done the work properly.Though I don't know for sure, I suspect that there might be others who find themselves in similar situations in this class. It would be helpful if the professor or TAs offered a way for students without friends\/study partners in the class to get to know each other. Just an opportunity to meet up would be great - it's really hard to get to know your classmates when you only see them for 1.5 hours twice a week in a large lecture hall."

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Great professor, but sometimes lecture is difficult to follow. It would be helpful if better headings were used to separate topics during lecture and if we didn't skip around from handouts to free notes in one lecture.

In addition, she was understanding of student's problems and worked to address them.The best way to improve her teaching would be to improve her penmanship. Her class notes were nearly incomprehensible when you tried to look back through them to review. Taking notes in class was the only way to record what she was talking about. I understand that this is the point, and that everyone should make an effort to attend class, but why post the notes online if no one can decipher them?",

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus absolutely amazes me that she can be so unbelievably well know in her field and brilliant and can still teach an intro level biostatistics course that really is easy to understand for her students. She always broke down complicated topics and made it easy to understand. Her tests were always very fair.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I really liked Elizabeth Claus. She was easy to understand and helpful in her descriptions.I'm having difficulty leaving feedback for #8 because there is no drop-down menu. However, my TA was Michelle Deveaux and I really liked her! She was patient and helpful, even staying over an extra hour when we were struggling with the final lab. She wouldn't just give us the answers or the code, but was sensitive to our frustrations when were first introduced to new material. I hope we have her again!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The lectures moved very quickly and were not helpful in understanding how to do the homework problems. When I needed help, I was told that I was out of luck unless I could make it to office hours, which I couldn't because of my work schedule. The department would only provide a tutor if I failed the midterm, which seemed so unhelpful. I had to pay $25\/hour for a graduate student to tutor me.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Wonderful lady, she has a really nice personality and is witty. She is good at explaining things in a straigtfowrward way. I liked how approachable she was. Very realistic as well. She makes it easy to understand the practicality of what you are learning and makes you apply knowledge to real data, I like that. My only complaint of her is that she has THE WORST handwriting, and I'm not saying that to be mean or petty. It is incredibly hard to go back over her notes and I found myself constantly referring to other students to figure out what she wrote, even while in class. I attended every single class meeting, so I did not have to count on her pdf notes later because they were so sloppy. She has a habit of forgetting to cross her Ts so that they look like Ls, and her S and G look the same. I am sorry but it is a mess-- if you are going to choose the overhead projector as your primary teaching tool, students need to be able to decipher what you write. I really disliked that aspect of her, terrible orthography. Again, I apologize if this is rude, that is not the purpose. I just want to express how much of an issue her handwriting was at times. Otherwise I liked her a lot. She is a great teacher, bottom line.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus delivered the material in a very understandable way. I think that her use of examples, theory and SAS programming provided enough information to be successful in the homework and in the tests.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Rarely available and does not respond to email.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Strengths: Instructor is very clear in class and very willing to answer questions.Weaknesses: Provide more practice problems that are like the ones on the test. The ones in the book are easier and worded differently so they dont always translate perfectly.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The lectures could have been a lot clearer if the transparency slides were neater and more organized. I often did not know what the \"big picture\" of what we were learning was.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Strength: Dr. Claus covered all the material and followed the syllabusWeakness: Dr. Claus was a poor instructor. She jumps around too much during lectures and overcomplicates everything. I avoided going to class because she confused me. I had to teach myself.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus did a great job teaching this course",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0handwriting class notes so cann't see quite clearly",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus has a fantastic, dry wit that made class enjoyable. She was very clear about what we needed to know, and easily communicated those concepts. With that being said, her handwritten notes leave a lot to be desired.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is a caring professor who tries to make things clear for her students. Unfortunately, things were sometimes made more complicated due to her wording of things and her not-so-legible handwriting. I think that making aconcept map at the beginning of each section or lecture would really help to structure the discussion and keep people on track.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0coherent\u00ef\u00bc\u008cgive key points",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Professor Claus covers the material with thoroughness at a good pace. She conducts good review sessions. I did have some trouble contacting her outside of class via email. She mentioned something about a new spam filter, which may explain why I was unable to get an electronic response.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0-The instructor was very sweet, nice, and funny.-Her presentation of the material can be very confusing and I think that a smart board and presenting the statistical web\/chart in the beginning of the semester will help.--She was really invested in helping us do well: she provided many practice questions, her exams were very fair, and she made it open book.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr.Claus seemed very knowledgable and friendly. However I found her lecture style to be very disorganized. Her handwriting is impossible to read.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Compared to all of my other courses this semester, Professor Claus is the best teacher. Although her lecture style is monotonous, she can convey information in a clear way and uses examples to help us learn new concepts. Her handwriting is usually easy to read. Her method of using a screen projector is very effective, and I wish other professors would use that method when teaching quantitative concepts as well.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Instructor's handwriting was extremely difficult to comprehend during lecture. Powerpoint slides would have been helpful, as well as a more organized lecture.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Weakness: The lecture notes were not clear and adequate.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I was very happy with the instructor for the course. My only complaint was the legibility of the in-class notes. They were sometimes hard to read, and hard to study from after lectures (since they were hard to read).",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She obviously is well-versed in statistics and is very good in explaining rudimentary concepts. She is also responsive to student emails. I found no fault in Prof. Claus's instruction.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is very knowledgeable and was a good teacher overall.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Clear and straightforward",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Responsible",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Knowledgeable in the area of course content and very kind to her students.Improvement: it was a little bit hard to read her handwriting notes from the class",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Weaknesses: Professor Klaus's lecturing could be much improved if here notes were more legible and if they were easy to follow. The notes that she puts online are useless and are impossible to follow out of context. It's much more efficient to just read the book. Therefore, lecture for this course seems pointless in many ways.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Really knows the material and wants you to do well. Lectures can be a little monotonous at 8:30 AM, but that's more a function of the subject matter than anything else.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I had a very poor impression of Dr. Claus's teaching. She knew that much of the class had a poor math background, and basically lowered her teaching of the stats to fit the lowest common denominator, often glossing over explanations of the theory in favor of providing equations and the end results. This resulted in a teaching style that added nothing to my understanding of stats, and did little to help me understand how better to choose which tests where and when. In a couple of instances she actually provided incorrect instruction. I felt she did a disservice to the entire class in declining providing the class with the proofs and derivations, because she cheated us of any chance to even learn. She merely assumed that we would not learn.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Claus was very clear and concise.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very knowledgable about material which is appreciatedCould have given more examples in class",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very smart",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Instructor was knowledgable, yet hard to relate to. At 8:30 am, we need an energetic lecturer who can keep our attention and keep us awake. Also, the final was dropped off in 60 college on Friday after exams. There were maybe 3 students left in New Haven (obvious over exaggeration), so it seems like it would be better to have the scores sent out, perhaps via email.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Pretty great overall.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0For someone new to the subject (particularly using SAS), Biostats was very difficult at first. But Dr. Claus is such a great professor and explains things so clearly, that once you actually understands things, using SAS turned out to be very fun and interesting. Dr. Claus speaks very clearly and slowly, making sure everyone understands and is on the same page before proceeding. She always takes the time to answer students' questions and reexplain things. It was a great class primarily because of Dr. Claus' warmand patient personality and her teaching style!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Weakness: Terrible handwriting to catch up. Prefer textbook explanation most of the times.Strength: Patient and approachable.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She is not an easy person to talk to\/ask questions. She was a bit curt and I felt that when I did ask questions, she was not all too responsive.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is an excellent professor. Her examples are clear and the test questions are fair.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Although I enjoyed the instructor, and thought she did an excellent job teaching the course, I wish she gave us more examples that were similar to the ones she gave us on the homework, and also used powerpoint slides instead of projector slides, which were difficult to read and follow.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0strengths: professor was amazing at being able to articulate exactly what she wanted her students to learn\/take away. couldn't be more specific. made biostats as easy and bearable as possible.no weaknesses.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Good at explaining concepts in easily understandable ways.She seems to be soft on the outside, but appears inflexible when it comes to grades\/wanting specific aspects on an exam\/homework question.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She is extremely straightforward and taught the material in a way that allowed us to understand it without just knowing it for the test and then forgetting it.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Prof. Claus is approachable and reasonable, as well as clear in her instruction.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus covered the material well without rushing over anything, and effectively explained concepts. However, I didn't find her class notes very easy to follow without my own annotations. So even though she puts the notes online afterward, they were difficult to decipher if you missed a lecture. The homework assignments often didn't cover concepts we talked about in class, which could be frustrating, but Dr Claus and the TA's were helpful about addressing these questions. Overall, I felt doing the homework was a good way to practice and master the concepts.The SAS labs were fine for becoming familiar with SAS, but you certainly won't become proficient through this course.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I wish the lectures tied in more with the homework assignments and lectures.It was strange that she used permanent marker on overhead projector sheets with an elmo. She could just use regular pens\/pencils with regular paper with an elmo. The notes were hard to read\/follow afterwards. More structure would have been helpful.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She is personable, helpful, smart, very knowledgable on the subject.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Good",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is an approachable professor and explains the material well.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Professor Claus was great! I really enjoyed the pace of her instruction and her sense of humor. It is evident that she is a very intelligent biostatistician!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Engaging, Competent, thorough, fair, personable. No improvements necessary.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I found her lectures to be steady and organized. I approached her for help outside the class and she was quite lovely. She didn't really offer any additional solutions however, except to encourage me to keep doing what I was doing."

She would always stay late with our lab section to make sure that everyone was able to finish the lab with help. She started off the semester very shy and a bit meek, but I really felt like we were able to see her become much more confident as the semester progressed.",

    "Instructor: Kyaw Sint \u00a0Very nice guy, very helpful and accessible -- but was not always up to speed on the SAS material, and on a few occasions actually taught us the wrong way to code for an analysis. Perhaps the TAs should make their powerpoints together, ensuring that they all have the same understanding to pass on to students? Inconsistency with SAS is a recipe for disaster!",

    "Yes but Iwould advise them to read the book before every class, which I did not do. It is easy to fall behind and there is so much material that it is easily forgotten if one doesn't keep up with the readings and lab assignments.",
    "Biostatistics isn't my favorite subject, so unless someone was interested in the topic. I would not recommend it. However, Dr. Claus was enjoyable and I would recommend a course with her.",
    "Long problem sets and SAS labs. TAs are really helpful but office hours are packed and its hard to get a question in. Class notes are helpful for exams. Tests are fair representations of what was taught.",
    "I am personally not inclined towards biostats and I felt like I struggled more than the class. Many of the students had already taken statistics so I felt behind a lot of the time. I would say it is a good refresher course for those who have already taken biostats.",
    "Biostats, along with epi are probably the most helpful classes. If you keep up with the work its doable and you learn a lot",
    "Good foundation course, would recommend for another student to get a good base of statistics for future public health work.",
    "Great!",
    "Very important for public health. Not too difficult for a beginner in statistics.",
    "Learned a lot",
    "It's a class about descriptive statistics and tests of statistical significance. You learn to analyze data sets in order to determine what they mean in relation to a specific hypothesis.",
    "This course provided me valuable skills and knowledge on SAS and statistics. I learned quite a ton throughout the semester. I'm also pleased to say that I am familiar with SAS, which would help me when it comes to searching for jobs in academia.",
    "This is an intro level statistics course. It's well taught and I feel like I now have a solid understanding of SAS and statistics. I would highly recommend it.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student -- it was a good and thorough introduction to biostats. The use of SAS was particularly helpful (especially for those of us who want to work for the government). I would tell another student to make sure they have other sources of information, such as notes from a previous biostats class or another textbook, if they want to do well.",
    "I'd say only take it if it's required, which it generally is. The lack of application to the real public health world makes the course incredibly different to understand and learn from.",
    "Yes I would strongly recommend it because it teaches you how to critically examine data and see if things are significantly different. Also, before this class I did not know really anything about p-values or odds ratios, and now I understand how they are found and what they mean\/how they are interpreted. One of the most useful classes for me. It has helped me be able to read the data\/results sections of papers a lot more critically and know what is going on. Thank you.",
    "As far as a required core course goes, I think that this class was taught well. I don't particularly like statistics, but I think that the material was relevant and the homework\/tests were fair.",
    "Overall the class provided a good foundation for statistics and was at a good pace for all students' background levels. I would recommend this to another student.",
    "It taught me a lot of useful information about biostatistics; however I thought there is a lot that can be improved on in the lectures.",
    "No I would not recommend this course for a fellow student because of the instructor.",
    "Very good intro class, would definitely recommend.",
    "Yes, over all it is a fundamenal class for a MPH student. But it might be too easy for people for learned statistics before.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I like SAS and think that it is an important skill. I think that the lectures and labs where we focused on SAS were the most valuable.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "This is an excellent introduction to statistics for anyone going into the social sciences who hasn't yet been introduced to these concepts. The material is pretty basic, so if you have taken a statistics course before, it may be worth your time to try and pass out.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course because it is a good introduction to basic statistical procedures. However, I would warn the student about the great amount of work and effort in this course. The course material can be very challenging to follow due to Claus' presentation, but she is sweet and really cares about the students. You will have to put effort in understanding the organization of data and you will have to actively seek the help of ta's or other students.",
    "You have to take this course so really there is no option for the teacher. I would say most people leave this class with no idea what they did or why. They were just following their lecture notes\/ labs.",
    "If you have never taken a statistics course or learned SAS, you will learn very much in this course. What may seem like difficult quantitative subject will become clearer and simpler with practice and by paying attention to the lectures. I would recommend this course to those who want to boost their quantitative and SAS skills.",
    "Yes, good introductory course in biostatistics and SAS",
    "I would recommend this course for students who have no prior statistics experience. It is a good introduction.",
    "Very helpful course that emphasises the basics in statistics. Essential for not just public health professionals-to-be!",

    "It is a basic course for biostats, and you can get a big picture of what it is.",
    "Yes, good introductory course to health care professionals.",
    "I would recommend that if a student already knows anything about statistics, that they do anything they can to get out of this course. If you are qualitatively inclined and can teach yourself, you could teach yourself all of this out of a text book.",
    "This course is useful and necessary, but unlikely to be the highlight of your day just because it's statistics -- we do it because it's important and we have to, not because it sets the heart soaring. Both the professor and the TAs are eager to help everyone succeed, so if you attend lecture, stay on top of your homework, and ask questions whenever you don't get something, you should be fine.Very important to attend every lecture, or at least keep up with every lecture's material, because biostats is an incremental topic that is always building on the last class's material. Make sure to set your alarm and drink some coffee!",
    "I don't think this class is really an adequate introduction to stats. I learned very little as a result of this class that I didn't already know, and I was really hoping that at the graduate level, I would be provided the opportunity to develop my understanding of stats. Something I feel could really use development.",
    "Great introduction to stat and SAS",
    "TAs should get better at presenting the power points during lab session",
    "Yes- good stuff to know.",
    "it's required so yes i guess !",
    "Overall, it's a great course. It's a requirement for the MPH, but even if it wasn't required, I'd still take it, especially if you're in an Epi major. It's amazing how much you learn in one semester- you're able to read scientific journals and research papers and actually understand the methodology and analysis of results!",
    "Like TIm Duncan...solid fundamentals",
    "It's a basic core requirement for an MPH degree. The homework assignments take a lot of time and effort, but they prepare you for the exams. The exams are straight forward and fair.",
    "Lab skills will be helpful although self-teaching will be necessary. Lectures are not as organized. Self-study needed to prepare for exams. exams are fair.",
    "I would. Just know that you will have to do a lot of self-teaching, which may not in fact be a bad thing.",
    "It's a required class, but it's a worthwhile class regardless.",
    "I would say this was a good course, but I think the instructor needsto stop using the projector slides because they were very hard to understand. There also needs to be better communication between the instructor and the TA's about the how to do the homeworks and labs, because it was extremely frustrating to get an answer wrong on the homework when one of the TA's had checked it and told you it was correct.",
    "yes, recommend.",
    "I would recommend the course because it's useful to know Biostats and have a solid grasp of statistics. I'm sure the SAS lab portion would be more effective depending on the TF. The professor is good at explaining concepts in class, so it's worth attending lecture despite the early time.",
    "It's a required course.",
    "The course is a good foundation for biostats. I recommend it",
    "A lot of work. Start on the homework really early because getting the homework done is like having a full time job.The book doesn't seem to be helpful. I'd still suggest going to the lectures.",
    "Core course so it is required, we learned a lot of information in a short period of time but maybe I'm not used to a graduate level courses.",
    "Definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to work in the field of public health.",
    "Overall, I think Biostat 505 is a solid course. I would recommend it to another student as it is an important subject in thefield of public health.",
    "Yes",
    "I would certainly recommend this course, as it is a requirement for graduation. It is a great intro into biostatistics, and I think it will prove very useful as we start synthesizing data for internships and theses. SAS haunted me, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I have fewer nightmares about it, as I become more comfortable with coding!",
    "A good introduction\/foundation for stat analysis. Even as a refresher, can be quit worthwhile.",
    "I would absolutely recommend a student not take this class unless he\/she has or could quickly make friends. The nature of the class penalizes students who are on their own."
