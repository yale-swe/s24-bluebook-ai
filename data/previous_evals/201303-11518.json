   "comments": [
    "Yes, would definitely recommend the class.",
    "Decent course if you need a social science credit. Interesting enough, I suppose. International relations doesn't really get me all that excited, I've realized. In terms of the workload, quite easy. There are no papers to write; your grade is based entirely on 2 midterms, a final, and section.",
    "Good class. Lectures can be dry, but what you learn if really applicable to life and current events.",
    "its an easy class but you learn a lot from it so i really suggest taking it. I feel like a more well rounded student now because i can discuss current events and important historical events intelligently and with an opinion.workload: gut. two midterms which are pretty straight forward. one final. no papers. depending on the TA you'll probs have discussion points due at each section.",
    "Easy, interesting, and the material definitely makes you more well informed of international affairs.",
    "It was an interesting surface level course that explored theory for the first half and case studies for the second half. I would recommend it to anyone interested at all in the subject--it provided a valuable lens through which to perceive history and recent events. The readings were interesting, and the lectures were always enjoyable. The tests were fairly straightforward (although the grading was, of course, somewhat arbitrary).",
    "Recommend. It gave me an introductory understanding of many current and historical conflicts.",
    "The class was a good introduction to international relations theory. Howorth is a pretty good lecturer, and the course gave me a better perspective on some of the big international relations problems of today, from the Iranian nuclear bid to the Arab Spring conflicts. However, the class was incredibly cursory--only 50 minutes was allotted for the entire Arab-Israeli conflict! Sections were pretty disappointing, not going much deeper into the information. However, I did learn a fair amount of new information, and the midterms were pretty easy.",
    "I would recommend it just to get a background of political science theory and global affairs.",
    "Yes, especially if you want a good overview of IR before delving into more specific classes and seminars.",
    "Take this if you are interested in current events! Even if you aren't interested in politics, this course teaches you a lot about what's going on in the world!",
    "I would recommend it. It's a fairly easy social science credit in which you learn a lot and are forced to keep up with the news. Overall, good use of my time.",
    "Yes i would recommend this class. Interesting and not too difficult.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who is interested in understanding the basics of IR and wants to better understand current events.",
    "I really liked Intro to IR. I was looking for a class that would introduce many of the current events topics that I felt I didn't know enough about. This may be less interesting to a student who already keeps up with current events. I feel more knowledgeable about issues that everyone should be aware of. I get so much more out of reading the newspaper since I have taken this course. The key to really getting something out of thiscourse is attending lecture, which was great, and reading the articles assigned, which were incredibly interesting.",
    "Intro to IR is a great introduction to what is going on in the world, with a historical context, and provides different theories through which to evaluate the material. I enjoyed lectures, and Howorth was a wonderful professor! The class is entirely what you put into it. It's feasible to do few to none of the readings and do well in the class, but the readings really are interesting and chosen well. Work level would be \"same,\" but you really can do \"less.\"Everyone will learn something. If you know a topic well, it will probably feel oversimplified, but that's compensated for by the fact that you cover a lot of topics.Shop sections in the first week and get a good TA. They've made attendance a part of your grade, and it can either be a painful hour each week or really helpful. If you're really interested in IR, look at what each TA specializes in, because that frames a lot of the information that they teach in section.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested! You will finally understand what is happening in the world and it is fascinating. Professor Howorth is awesome and the workload really isn't bad at all.",
    "I would recommend international relations. Presents very current events and analyzes them from an academic perspective.",
    "good introduction to international relations, so take it if you want to learn the basics",
    "Very easy and pretty interesting. I had no background in IR and I learned a lot, but if you have any outside knowledge this will probably be entirely redundant. Tests are a joke.",
    "Great, easy, introduction to IR. Definitely take if you're interested in political science.",
    "I would say that this is a good intro class to get your feet wet in the subject of political science in general. I would recommend it",
    "worth taking",
    "Great intro class for anyone interested in IR, current events or 21st century history. Definitely recommend it.",
    "Great class. Take it.",
    "Definitely a great course for anyone looking to get a better base in the IR section of political science. For those not interested in poll sci, it is still very interesting and pretty intuitive.",
    "Intro to IR is a very broad overview of international relations as it is today, covering everything from Israel\/Palestine to Africa Rising to Nuclear Weapons to Civil War. Breadth means that depth is sometimes sacrificed. There's a lot of reading and it's often redundant (i.e. textbook 1 says something and textbook 2 says something similar but in different words.) Howorth is a good lecturer who usually keeps things interesting. The course contains more theory than I was expecting, but the theory is pretty interesting. There are a lot of guest lecturers, which is like ordering a sampler at a restaurant - some of its great and some of it you wouldn't order again. Take the class if you don't really know what's going on in the world. If you follow the news and current events, you should probably skip it.",
    "It was a solid course. The first half is theory which is not as interesting as the case studies in the second half.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. It's worth it! It inspired my interest in global affairs and international relations. I learned so much from this class. The reading isn't all necessary but it is worth it to do the readings because they are very interesting. I would recommend becoming knowledgable on current events as this will help a lot in the essays on the midterms and final.",
    "This is a really good class. The subject matter is really interesting and always relevant, which made sometimes dense or dull readings much more readable. Not too much work; you don't have to do all of the readings in order to do well on the exams, but they're worth doing. I would say make sure you do the readings on IR theory at the beginning of the semester, because you'll need to know that for the whole rest of the semester.",
    "Good intro level course that covers a lot of material. Gives you a taste for IR without diving too deep into any one subject. Interesting and not to much work.",
    "Great survey course, a must for those interested in or majoring in political science. Definitely not too difficult, but the lectures (which were only 50minutes) were engaging and manageable. If you go to lecture and pay attention, along with section, you won't need to do all the readings (there are quite a lot.) You move from international theory to case studies (learning about politics and relations between Russia, China, India, the Arab Spring, Iraq, Iran, etc) which I personally found very eye-opening and informative. I really enjoyed this class!",
    "Recommended. Important information for anyone to learn, no matter how much you already know about IR.",
    "Take this course if you like International Relations. It's a great introduction to the subject.",
    "This class taught gave me a general overview of world affairs. After taking this course, I can more easily handle a conversation with anyone about current events and the history behind them. I just feel like a more aware citizen of the world after completing this course.",
    "Take it. Not too much work and it teaches you some useful things that will allow you to participate in a sophisticated discussion of current affairs and global politics.",
    "Yep",
    "I would recommend this. It teaches a lot of things, even in current events, that one might not have known about. I came out of this class with a greater understanding of the world and how nations and states react with one another.",
    "For any one interested in global politics, or who merely wants to grasp a better understanding of international affairs, I would highly recommend taking this intro course. Even if you have never taken a political science course at Yale, or if you haven't the faintest knowledge of international affairs, TAKE THE COURSE. You'll come out of it with a large and comprehensive knowledge of the world and the various agents that affect its course of nature. The workload is pretty manageable as well and section is super useful.",
    "Strengths: Light coursework, most of your understanding will come from section. The section leaders are solid overall. Engaging lecturer. I found the topics to be more interesting than I expected. If you don't have an understanding of international relations very well, you will leave with a solid foundation of how nations might interact with one another.Weaknesses: Tempting to skip lectures, but you should still go. Joloyn is the man.",
    "Great, easy intro class. Also helps you understand foreign policy and the issues you read in the newspaper everyday a lot better.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone",
    "I highly recommend this class because you learn a lot about current news. It's also interesting because it links everything together.",
    "Pretty easy class if you take the time to study before each exam.",
    "Overall it was ok. I recommend it if you are somehow a person who is very interested in international relations yet knows little about it. Don't get me wrong, Howorth is good and I did learn a lot, just the class didn't really grab my attention. It didn't seem like the professor or most of the guest lecturers were really that passionate about the topics. I think you can find a more exciting political science class, though I hear this class is preferable to Gateway to Global Affairs. And some sections may be easy but not all are.",
    "Not too much work and a gives a good view of the world",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it does an amazing job in laying down a foundation inIR theory.",
    "Great introductory poli sci class",
    "PLSC 111 is a course that is heavily correlated with Politics and requires students that are very interested in politics. If the student is enthralled by politics then they should take the course if not then the course may be slightly challenging.",
    "IR is a good class. It is large, but the work load is light and the material is enjoyable. I recommend.",
    "Definitely take it. It is not too much work and you learn a lot.",
    "A really broad introduction to all things dealing with international politics. I would recommend to those who are interested in the international system but do not have a strong background in history. There is a lot of reading to help build your history knowledge base but the course can still be done without the reading (although it's the easiest way to learn about a variety of states and situations).",
    "I think the course is a great 5th class for upperclassmen and a great intro political science course for freshmen. You can't really go wrong unless you're not into doing the reading (which is reasonable, for the most part).",
    "Loved this class. Relevant info, good professor, no real work aside from the exams which are easy. Still teaches you a lot though.",
    "It\u00c2\u00b4s a great introductory course. Expect more theory if you\u00c2\u00b4re only expecting case studies, which I know I certainly was.I would definitely take this course again though.",
    "I would highly recommend Intro to IR. One of the best classes at Yale",
    "The class discusses current conflicts and different views on them. It's really rewarding and good to know about it. I would highly recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is interesting and well-taught with a manageable workload.",
    "Take this course if you are looking for something not too challenging yet interesting",
    "For an intro level understanding, definitely take it.",
    "Great class, very important especially as so many interesting things are happening in the world right now.",
    "Definitely take it. Super interesting and super easy.",
    "Definitely recommend!",
    "I would absolutely recommend it to another student. The class is manageable, interesting, and very relevant. Everyone should take it.",
    "This is a great fifth class. It's not too challenging, but you will end the semester having covered an impressive amount of different regional conflicts and issues. I can now pick up a newspaper and have a far better understanding of world affairs. Professor Howorth is great. Take it.",
    "It could be a really interesting course if it were taken serious, but unfortunately the lack of writing assignments or follow up on readings ruined the class for me. Not worth taking as a fifth class.",
    "It is a good, but basic introduction to how we understand international relations and how nations interact within a global context",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in global affairs or in learning about modern day topics.",
    "I would recommend it. It is a basic introduction to global affairs. Very useful!",
    "A great intro to international relations. I had never studied Indian politics before this, and because of how great the lecture was, I plan on taking a course next semester on politics in India.",
    "Easy introductory class that is interesting and not too much work.",
    "Take it as a fifth class. It's interesting and low-stress: two midterms and a final. You cover a lot of topics and don't go that deep into each one since it's a survey course, but you really do end up learning a lot.",
    "A great course if interested in politics as well as current events",
    "I recommend the course. It was very informative.",
    "Take it! One of the best intro courses at Yale.",
    "Great class",
    "I would recommend this if you want a general introduction of international relations theory and its role in past and current events. I enjoyed the lectures, but some are a bit dry at times. Section really helps focus on the main points, and I thought the material was interesting.",
    "PLSC111 is a great into IR course. As a non-PLSC major, I enjoyed it immensely. Lecture topics are interesting and contemporary, and Prof. Howorth is great.",
    "Highly recommended",
    "Intro to IR is a great foundation course for the realm of Political Science and International Relations.Professor J. Howorth is brilliant in providing an international view of global affairs.Strengths:Great guest lectures, and in-depth analysis on current political global issues.Weakness:Sections! Make sure to shop sections - TF's can be a hit or miss.",
    "It is a great intro course and you will learn a lot about current events and how it is pertinent to nations. I would recommend class. Easy A if put in work.",
    "If you are interested in global politics, definitely take this class. Howorth is a great professor.",
    "It's not as easy as advertised. Go to lecture and do the readings, you'll be fine.",
    "It is a pretty easy class.",
    "A very good intro lecture hall even if you do not plan on majoring in political science.",
    "If you're looking for specific and depth, don't take it. If yore looking for a general idea of multiple current courses, definitely take it.",
    "I would say it is a good class to take to get a feeling for international relations and political science in general. I would recommend it to anyone.",
    "I would definitely recommend Political Science 111 01 to another student. I would count this as a necessity to get the most out of the news of the current events of today and throughout history. The class broadened my horizons and would say this class should be a requirement to anyone who responsibly wants to do their best in the field of foreign affairs.",
    "Yes because it's a great course with a lot of important content that is good for common knowledge.",
    "It's a good class, and worth taking, especially if you are unfamiliar with the subject.",
    "An overview of global politics and the realm of international political motions. I would recommend this class to another student because it was a great way to learn theory within a real-world context.",
    "I think I would recommend Introduction to IR to a fellow student, if they were looking for an easier Political Science course. It was a good introduction to the fundamentals with a workload that was not too difficult. However, I think I would recommend for people more interested in the subject to take a more course with a more specific focus, as it might be easier."
