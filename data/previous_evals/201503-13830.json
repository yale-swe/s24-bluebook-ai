    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.",

    "A mix of intellectual and cultural historical approaches to the Enlightenment, with some key primary texts mixed in. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the period, but especially to those preparing to for orals fields in this subject or an adjacent area."

   "comments": [
    "This course deepened my knowledge of the historiography of the Enlightenment, especially since I hadn't read very deeply into it. I'm an undergraduate, so I can't speak to my dissertation and my research. But the class is a swift, sweeping overview of Enlightenment history and historiography, and in that sense it is quite useful to historians of the early modern period and such.",
    "Yes! I came in knowing very little, and despite my inexperience with the primary sources, I left feeling as though I had a strong sense of its historical treatment over time. It likely won't contribute directly to my dissertation, but i do believe it will be extremely useful for orals."
