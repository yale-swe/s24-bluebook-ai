   "comments": [
    "Required",
    "Absolutely.",
    "It's mandatory. sit through it and endure it like the rest of us.",
    "Summary:Do not plagiarize. Keep a good notebook. Sexual harassment is bad.",
    "Since it's required, yes.",
    "This course provides an overview of important ethics topics related to the field of scientific research.",
    "I would recommend the course if it was required.",
    "This course is required and talks about ethical issues in science ranging from politics, lab management, publishing papers and sexual harassment. I thought it was useful and I can see why it is required. Many of the PIs who lectured I thought did a really good job at being very honest with us which made the course much more interesting and useful.",
    "The course was a disappointment. Only a handful of the lectures were helpful. The class on what to include in a publication could be helpful for students who are unfamiliar with publishing. The first class on what we seek in a mentor was a touchy feely lecture which taught nothing new to anyone with common sense.",
    "I would summarize it by saying that it is a set of guidelines on how to responsibly and professionally conduct oneself in a research environment and information on where to seek help when encountering difficult scenarios. I would recommend the course because some of the information presented is not immediately obvious in the research environment and could potentially have serious consequences if one is not aware of them.",
    "It is a required course. You HAVE to take it.",
    "I will highly recommend this course to the fellow students."

   "comments": [
    "The most important things I learned concerned intellectual property during the OCR lecture.",
    "This will help my research just as other academic courses.",
    "I would have to agree that \"What is plagiarism?\" should be taught in this class. It is helpful. The other classes were interesting, but not things we haven't heard before in the years of science we have experienced already.",
    "The course brought up issues that I will definitely have to think about when collaborating with others and writing papers\/making figures\/keeping a lab notebook. It was particularly interesting to learn about the interaction between academiclabs and industry.",
    "Exposure to many topics that are important to graduate students and might not be discussed otherwise until it was too late.",
    "Was useful in suggesting ways to properly deal with key ethics issues in science.",
    "They were certain occasions that I found helpful, for example, the day we learned about writing publications by Professor Basserga.",
    "This course was useful for talking about practical issues in science. It will help our future careers as scientists both in graduate school and once we leave graduate school. It won't directly contribute to my dissertation research but it will help us navigate the scientific community and Yale.",
    "It did not teach me anything significant. Most of what is in the course is common sense material.",
    "The course has mainly been a recap of what is already known by students that have conducted research in the past. There have been some useful insights on grant review committees and handling difficult interpersonal conflict situations that might or might not be useful in the future.",
    "It did broaden my perspectives on the possible ways that ethical issues pervade our academic environment.",
    "This is very helpful.",
    "It highlighted many issues related to research ethics that I was not aware but will now be able to look out for."
