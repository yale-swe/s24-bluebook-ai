   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is trying to fulfill the language requirement and is looking for something interesting!",
    "I would say that Span 246 is a very broad survey class that tries to cover more than really feasible. I would also say that this class would be a lot better if you had a strong interest in history. However, it did make me excited about Spain!",
    "Take it. But do participate and care about the material. Otherwise, you're gonna make the class too quiet.",
    "Absolutely! It was a really lovely experience. The text was dry, but it isn't always necessary to read. The poetry and novels that Profesora Valis were good, and at a reasonable level of difficulty. Those were more important to stay on top of as far as reading is concerned. The midterm was fairly graded, as were the papers. The topics were very open-ended and given very well in advance of the due date. Also, if you have Diego as your TF, he is really helpful, and his lecturing style is very challenging and interesting. He's definitely a big part of the course.",
    "I would recommend SPAN 246 to another student. It was a great overview of Spanish history and culture, broad in some regards and detailed in others. The graded assignments were well spaced out and never too lengthy. Overall workload was not too bad.",
    "Span 246 is a great course for anyone with proficient Spanish knowledge and a deep interest in Spain. It's a wonderful overview class, and we read quite a lot of literature, looked at famous works of art, and also covered the broad historical strokes of basically all of Spain. The readings were not easy, especially the full books towards the end of the semester, and having spanish fluency and being able to read quickly is definitely a huge bonus.",
    "L5 Spanish course that focuses on the various cultures in Spain from the ancient era to modern Spain. While the course includes Spanish history, it uses poetry, literature, music and art to express the Spanish cultures.",
    "I would definitely recommend SPAN 246. It is a course that is both challenging and enjoyable."
