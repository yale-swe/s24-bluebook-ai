   "comments": [
    "It's actually a great class - it might seem hard at first but things will click in place. It is so very useful in all areas; econ papers will make more sense after this class. I can't imagine taking econometrics with another professor.",
    "Solid course with a good mix of theory and application. Not too difficult for those with a solid math background - tests are open note, and essentially mirror lecture. The material builds, however - keeping up throughout the year goes a long way to improving your understanding of statistics. I would have appreciated going much faster and covering more material in the course, though - doing OLS for three weeks is a bit much. Teacher was pretty clear, and funny too! (He also answered my questions rather gracefully, which I appreciated.)",
    "Very well taught compared to stats theory classes through the stats department. Not even comparable to my experiences in 241\/242..I learned so much more from Yuichi than I did in either of those classes combined. Clear lectures. Generally fair exams. Only bad thing is that the curve is not that great, since you have a bunch of smart econ\/math students in this class.",
    "Econ 136 is a cooking class in STATA, with a fair amount of dry theory thrown in. It's a good course if that is what you are looking for, and self-motivated learners may even get some intuition out of reading the book and doing the problem sets. But it's no great shakes - if you are a little weaker in math, or aren't planning on being an econometrician, or are more concerned with intuitions than nuts and bolts, it's likely that other statistics courses will be more helpful.",
    "recommend but only for students majoring in economics (and mathematics)",
    "Required for econ math. Take it.",
    "If you're considering taking this class, you probably don't have much of a choice in the matter. Still, try to take it with Yuichi-- he's very nice and a great lecturer. Probably more interesting than ECON 135.",
    "Kitamura is a great instructor. He really wants to make sure you understand the material; super approachable and friendly. Just make sure you don't blow off the tests because they're open book.",
    "A really interesting introduction to the tools of econometrics. I feel like I can finally read journal articles and actually understand what they're saying now, so that's a huge improvement. Definitely would recommend over 131; it seems like they don't get enough of a grasp of the tools that you need to be able to call yourself an economist. Workload not too heavy either. Would recommend if you're keen on economics!",
    "You should take it if have a chance, I think I wouldn't have enjoyed the less maths version of it (ECOn 132) as much.",
    "I'd avoid this class unless you KNOW that you love statistics or are doing it for the Econ\/Math major. It will be difficult, but paying attention during lecture and staying caught up in this class will pay HUGE dividends, more so than in most other classes.",
    "Definitely take it if you are interested in econ!!",
    "Class mainly focuses on the theory behind different econometric methods. Homework deals with this a bit but also lets you practice with Stata, which is a v useful econometric software. Most of the stuff can be learned from the textbook, which is good because even though I love Yuichi (he's super funny, down to earth, and really nice), he doesn't present the material in the clearest way. I mainly went to class to hear his cute anecdotes about how he want from like an 8-year musician to an econometrician. Exams were pretty fair, too - all open note. Grading wasn't too harsh on hw either.",
    "Definitely would recommend.",
    "I would recommend this class. The workload is not too high, and the material is very useful for research. In combination with Yuichi as the professor, this is definitely one of the best econ classes I have taken (although it's not really econ, more statistics).",
    "If a student is interested in learning about the techniques of Econometric analysis, ECON 136 is a need-to-take foundational course. I would recommend this class to a fellow student, especially if that student is interested in analyzing big data.",
    "I attend both 132 and 136. 136 has more theory.",
    "I would recommend it to other students who need it for their major, but wouldn't really recommend it to anyone else."
