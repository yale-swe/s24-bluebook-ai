   "comments": [
    "Strengths were the topics and the discussion atmosphere Dr. Forman provided. Weaknesses were that sometimes I got lost in the organization.",
    "Howie is a great teacher. The final project had nothing to do with the actual course and was a ton of work.",
    "Best class I have taken. The TA's should not write the test. They do not listen that well and it wasnt a good overview of the material.",
    "Great course. Somewhat fast paced",
    "The lectures have a lot of information, which is helpful if students pay attention. There wasn't much reinforcement of this information before the final exam.",
    "Needs to be more organized. Scale back on scope of topics and focus more on depth of topics.",
    "Fairly good course, Dr. Forman is amazing and incredible to learn from - lecture style can be very hard to follow and retain information, or identify what information is important versus which is less important",
    "Good",
    "An excellent introduction to the healthcare industry; I walked into the class not knowing almost anything about the topic and now feel empowered to have high-level conversations about the future of health care policy.",
    "Howie, why not ditch the slides, give readings with prompts, open up the floor, invite more speakers and...see what happens? Giving the same slides year after year is ultimately not good for anyone. When you add in narration about what other years' classes said... it's not only boring but seems unhealthy in some way. Or ask people to read the slides on their own and then have a discussion in class? Anything to make the class more substantive and more varied.",
    "Learned alot!",
    "Overall it was good. The slides provided an excellent overview of the healthcare industry, particularly for those who are not as familiar with the details. I think the problem might be that the class is marketed as a place to learn about the healthcare industry. It would be better to highlight that it will be a discussion of the topics in the slides and the readings --> students should already understand the material from the slides prior to attending class."

    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0One of the best instructors I've ever had.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0His industry expertise helps students acquire a solid understanding of what is happening in healthcare.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Please organize slides better.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Incredible professor - could benefit from making either slides more structured with fully articulated takeaways, or working to better articulate takehome points in class",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Good",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Excellent communicator, easy to talk to, very approachable, and engaging speaker.",

    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0The professor has first-hand knowledge of the subject matter.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0He is a good instructor. The problem is that the class is hard to follow if you don't already understand the slides because it is more of a discussion of the problems\/positive aspects of how the healthcare industry is set up rather than an explanation of how the healthcare industry is organized."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the healthcare industry, as the information is very important to understand.",
    "So awesome but go to class every day and pay attention or you'll be in trouble for the final.",
    "Take it, even if you do not want to be in health care... it gives you a good understanding in policy.",
    "Very rich course. I would definitely recommend to other students, as you learn a LOT.",
    "Great general introduction to the healthcare industry. Prepare to pay attention to avoid missing any crucial details.",
    "Might be hard to follow if you don't have any healthcare experience, as Howie goes VERY fast through topics.",
    "Good course and very helpful overall to learn about the healthcare industry, more policy focused than title suggests. TAs were a bit biased from knowing many of students which was not great",
    "Good",
    "Whether you know a lot about the healthcare industry or you don't know anything about it prior to starting the course, this is an excellent way to become well-versed in the relevant topics regarding policy and finance of healthcare.",
    "Basically a recap of similar core courses at YSPH but slower moving....many slides and little open discussion. Howie a good guy. Some SOM students can be a challenge for YSPH students to work with, on teams, but others great. (You'd have to experience it). Important to understand that this class is meant to be an easy elective for those in the SOM club.",
    "Any student who is interested in gaining a deeper understanding of Healthcare finances would benefit from this course. This course discussed healthcare economics from several angles.",
    "This is a discussion-based course focused on understanding the problems\/positive aspects of the US healthcare industry. In order to get the most out of the class, one should read through the slides beforehand. This class will not focus too much time on explaining how the healthcare industry is organized as much as it will explain the pros\/cons of its organization."
