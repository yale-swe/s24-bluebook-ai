   "comments": [
    "You have to take this. It's less painful second semester because they get rid of the occasional useless busywork that we had first semester.",
    "You're going to have to take it if you're an EVST student-it's a great time to bond with the people in your major. Our class got really tight; sometimes it wasn't the most useful way for us to spend our time, but it was great to hang out with the awesome kids in our major.",
    "The earlier deadline is actually great -- don't fall behind on research and writing, and you'll really appreciate the ability to just spend the last month editing.",
    "It's required so you have to take it.",
    "You have to do it. Start early. Take the lightest workload you possibly can spring semester. Hopefully they will restructure it so it is less unnecessarily time consuming",
    "Colloquium was mostly pretty fun. I liked everyone in the group and it was good to see them. It's really important to keep on top of your project though. Do as much as you can first semester!",
    "Thesis!",
    "The advising is great but it's a bummer to have to use a credit on this, since it's not real a class once you've handed in the essay. Or maybe that's a good thing.",
    "You gotta take it, and it will be fine. Ask for what you need fromthe advisors and try to make the assignments worthwhile \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0you'll be glad later.",
    "Weekly meetings where I had to show my face was a way to keep me accountable and honest about my progress.",
    "I can't exactly recommend this course to fellow students given that it is required for all EVST majors; instead, I request that the course is tailored to allow students ample time to construct their essays.",
    "I appreciated the opportunity to write a year-long senior essay. I also appreciated the colloquium faculty changing the colloquium a little bit in the second semester to allow for some encouraged \"study hall\" time to work on the senior essay. I didn't feel that most of the speakers we heard from were particularly relevant or engaging, though I did appreciate some of what they had to say. I think the mandatory preliminary deadlines (e.g., for first and second drafts) were frustrating in the moment, but very helpful in the long term...I would encourage the faculty to add a couple more preliminary deadlines, as that would remove some of the immense stress that falls on seniors in the days right before the due date. While I am grateful for the help the colloquium faculty provided, I also think the more help they can provide, the better -- the more one on one meetings with the faculty possible, the better! The more encouraging the faculty can be, the better.I did not particularly enjoy the process of writing this essay, nor did I feel particularly prepared to write upon the topic I had chosen. For the most part, I don't think that's the fault of the colloquium faculty, but as I said, the more encouragement and one-on-one help they can provide along the way, the better.To future students: I would advise you to not worry too much about making a perfect finished product, but instead to get as much done before winter break as possible, whatever its quality. Sara Smiley Smith (the EVST department assistant) also proved to be a very helpful resource and offered a very sympathetic and caring ear; she deserves many thank-you's!"
