    "An excellent, focused course that allows you to read important texts and examine the Spanish Civil War, which I find to be one of the most interesting conflicts in recent history. I would definitely recommend this course either as a Spanish course or a History course. You get the chance to improve your Spanish reading and writing as well as speaking through engaging classroom discussions.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. The subject matter is extremely interesting and the course challenges the student to read many texts in Spanish and consider the impact of bias on representations of the war.",
    "I would recommend this class for someone interested in Spanish literature within a particular historical context. The class is much more of a literature class than a history class, which I didn't necessarily expect at first. Still, it was very interesting and enjoyable.",
    "Yes, take it if you want to practice your Spanish or if you are interested in the Civil War, propaganda, totalitarianism, the intersection of literature and history, and\/or the modernist novel.",
    "yes definitely",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! If you're interested in looking at history through the lens of how it was interpreted and defined by participants and observers, and if you want to not only learn about the Spanish Civil War (which is really interesting, if depressing), but also become a better student of history in general, this is a great course! We really focused on looking at where fact, fiction, interpretation and propaganda intersect, and the role of interpretation in the conflict itself, and on our collective memory of it.",
    "Spanish 367 was a phenomenal class. With an emphasis on the representations of war, it covered history, literature, art, and film. The course first approaches the war from an internal perspective and then from an external perspective (i.e. reading the works of foreigners such as Hemingway and Orwell in English). The course then describes the role of women during the war, and it ends with a look at the post-war era. Grading consists of three two-three page papers on literary texts, a midterm, a ten page final research paper, and class participation, all of which is in Spanish but is very reasonable. However, there is a lot of reading. Some awesome aspects of the course: watching fascist propaganda in film that was later censored by the Franco government, watching Pan's Labyrinth, reading Homage to Catalonia (which is fascinating), comparing \"On the American Dead in Spain\" by Hemingway to Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, and analyzing Picasso's Guernica. This is much more than a traditional Spanish class and much more than a language credit if you are a non-major. Take it!",
    "Spanish Civil War: Words and Images is an incredible class. It covers the events leading up to the Spanish Civil War, the war itself, and the postwar era through literature, images, and film. The reading is diverse, ranging from books written in English during the war, to Spanish literature from the last decade. While there is a lot of reading, it is all very interesting, and the three short papers allow you to focus on one book at a time. Professor Valis is wonderful; she really cares about the topic and about the students in her class. By the end of the class, you gain a better understanding of how complex the Spanish Civil War really was, and how it is still being interpreted today."
