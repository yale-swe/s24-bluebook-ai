    "Chinese 150 is co-taught, so be prepared for the teachers to switch off every week. The homework is INTENSE!!!!!! I would not recommend taking this course unless learning Chinese is a part of your life's goal or future career plan. If you're taking Chinese just for fun or on a whim, this class is definitely not worth it. It was a struggle to make it though the daily quizzes, 6 essays, 2 presentations, and 4 tests. The students in the section really bonded because the workload was so intense. I will miss seeing these friends daily next term.",
    "Overall, I do not mean to give the impression that this class was a complete failure. I think there are some structural fallacies that should be improved upon, but it was definitely helpful to take the course--otherwise I am sure I would have lost significantly more proficiency in the language than I did. If you do decide to take this course, I would say that you should go into it knowing some of the things I mentioned above so that you can adjust your study habits accordingly. In order to get out ofthis class what a student just leaving a Light Fellowship program might expect to get, you have to put in extra effort outside of class and create some kind of additional expectations for yourself. (ie maybe you do extra character practice every week, go to Chinese table twice a week, watch Chinese films, etc.)I am going to copy and paste what I wrote for question 1 so that people reading this evaluation can see it:After coming back from the Light Fellowship in Beijing this summer, I found this class relatively disappointing. At the very beginning of the term, the professors warned us that we might feel like we had regressed in this course given the fact that we had spent the whole summer immersed in Chinese culture. But to this remark I would pose the question: How can you say that this class is effectively structured if one half or more of your students (since upwards of 100 of us studied abroad and completed L3\/4 this summer) regress over the course of the semester? I understand the difficulty of catering to a class filled with students of varying degrees of proficiency in Chinese, but I think it is the responsibility of the professors to at least attempt to create a class that at least makes it possible for students of varying degrees of skill to progress along their own individual tracks. It should not be so simplistically structured as an L1 Chinese course, for example, because there is no baseline of common experience among the students in these classes. Some are heritage speakers, some studied all summer in Beijing, some only studied in high school, some studied only at Yale, and still others have had a combination of experiences with several of the above. This must be taken into consideration in designing the course, and my impression was that it was not (or at least not to the degree that it should have been). I also think the class is sorely lacking in speaking experience. Students were rarely required to speak, and when we were required to speak it was often with the expectation that we wouldjust spit back grammar structures at our professors. Only once a week (and for a short 20 minutes at most) were we asked to discuss anything pertaining to our chapter study. My speaking ability has declined in a major way this semester, and it makes me rather frustrated given how much time and effort I put into my summer study and how much money Yale put into my study abroad experience. Similarly, I think the oral exams are designed in such a way that they enforce rote memorization of grammar structures and vocabulary throughout the chapters as opposed to actually encouraging a synthesis of the material and the capacity to formulate logical opinions. (And isn't that the point of speaking any language?)",
    "If you're coming back from Light Fellowship in China, particularly Princeton or Harvard, you'll be fine. It's a pretty standard schedule - small dictation on Monday from about twenty vocab words, quiz on Tuesday on about forty words from the first part of the lesson, quiz on Wednesday on about forty words from the second part of the lesson, written multiple choice due Thursday, and a 600 character essay due Friday. There's two (easy) oral tests and three (hard, but fair) written tests. The grade is split up into about ten different components - quizzes, homework, tests, orals, final exam, participation, tutorial, listening exercises, attendance, essays, 2 presentations - so it's good in the sense that your grade is spread out. In terms of workload - an hour or two a night tops. If you're coming back from China, your Chinese skills will drop and it'll feel like you're not really learning anything - at this point it doesn't really feel like we're learning characters or grammar, even though we are. Really, you have to go to China if you want your Chinese to get more fluent. This class more helps you to stay in a Chinese state of mind.",
    "Take the class to keep your Chinese skills afloat. If you are looking for an engaging class, I would say this is not it.",
    "The Chinese department at Yale is in general very well organized. If you want to learn Chinese efficiently and well, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Yes absolutely. This is a fantastic course; the professors are phenomenal. They wrote a fantastic textbook that tailors a good course that allows you to learn a lot without too much work. The grading system is reasonable and the professors are laid back but passionate. Another testament to Yale's amazing Chinese department. No real weaknesses in this course; very well-structured, rigorous but not stressful.",
    "If you just came back from China and want to keep up your Chinese, you don't have much choice. If you are worried that people from other summer programs will do better than you, I wouldn't worry about that at all; everything seemed to level out pretty soon. The biggest problem I had about this class was that the profs NEVER let us out on time. Usually, we were 5 mins late. One section was let out 12 minutes late at one point. This is absurd, and a cause for reservation. Try not to have class immediately after Chinese, otherwise you will almost definitely be late for it every week...",
    "yes!",
    "I would recommend this course as a means of maintaining your Chinese fluency, it is time consuming but if you are interested in the language then it is a must.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chinese 150. The class time can seem unproductive at times, but at least you can maintain your level of Chinese - by this I mean your vocabulary with greatly increase, but your fluency will remain about the same, especially if your coming off a Light Fellowship.",
    "I would recommend for the sole purpose of not forgetting Chinese.Class might be nice if you have a nice section (like I did), but might not be the case if otherwise.It's nice to have a not-so-stressful 50-minute class to start off the day; but then again, if it becomes stressful, that's a problem...",
    "Chinese 150 is a lot of work but the teachers are good and the class is worth it. If you want to learn the language, it's worth it.",
    "Yes take Chinese. This class improves fluency and gets you to express your opinion in more scholarly terms! Do it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is seriously interested in Chinese. The workload is not too unbearable and the teachers are wonderful.",
    "Yes - it is a good foundation for advanced level Chinese",
    "It's a great class. Lots of time-consuming nightly work, but it's never actually difficult. My writing and grammar definitely improved a lot, but my speaking didn't. I wish the teachers would correct tones more.",
    "If you want to continue into 3rd year Chinese, then you really have no choice other than Chinese 150. It's a well-taught class. You'll learn a lot of vocabulary, and your writing will improve, but if you spent the previous summer in China, you'll see your speaking ability go down quite a bit unless you make a very conscious effort to practice your Chinese. There are practically no opportunities to speak in class, so class feels practically like a lecture since the teachers have to go through so much material in just an hour a day. The homework can be pretty heavy on Mondays and Tuesdays since those are the days you have to read the text and memorize characters, but the other days are pretty relaxed in terms of homework. Overall a good course, but not one that will improve your spoken Chinese. You'll have to seek out those opportunities for yourself.",
    "If you are coming in off of a Light Fellowship program, it's nowhere near as intense. That said, it's still a rigorous class, and you get a lot out of it, it just feels less like that since a lesson isn't being drilled into your brain every day. It is subtly rigorous.",
    "If you did not just come from light you will find yourself behind in the beginning. However, by the end of the semester everyone is more or less on the same level. If the first few days of class are intimidating, don't worry you'll learn quickly!",
    "L5 Chinese. Take it if you'd like to continue studying Chinese--you don't really have any other options.",
    "I would recommend it only if you are serious about continuing Chinese. You will not like this course if you already are tired fo Chinese.",
    "A lot of work, unsurprisingly. Between 1 to 2 hours per night on average. Dictations on Mondays, reading comprehension and vocabulary quizzes on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, homework due Thursdays, and essays or presentations due Fridays. About 2\/3 of my class had just returned from Light (I had not), and while I felt my speaking skills weren't up to speed at first, I quickly caught up. Class is way less repetitive and drill-based than L3\/L4 Chinese- a nice change. Wang Laoshi and Li Laoshi have very different styles, but both are terrific.",
    "If you've made it this far in Chinese, and decide to continue, you know that it can at times be challenging and boring to learn it. But if you're willing and excited to put in the work, you will be fine.",
    "If you're reading this, you know you need to take it to continue studying. It is what it is, you'll get through and you'll learn a little.",
    "CHNS 150 is a nice continuation of Chinese grammar and vocabulary. The lessons are generally interesting if a bit odd. I would say it is easy compared to the Light Fellowship summer programs but I have no idea how it compares to Yale L3\/L4. I would recommend taking it if you're looking to get one step further on the long road to Chinese fluency.",
    "Good class. Take it if you plan to keep studying Chinese.",
    "It's a small seminar class that is a lot harder than chinese 130\/140. You have little quizzes everyday and have work to do on daily basis. If you wish to continue studying Chinese, it's a great continuation from chinese 140- but you will have to be ready for the harder homework, class discussion, quizzes, and tests. Everything will be harder, but much more interesting and broad topics in textbooks, and fun discussion in class.",
    "A very well structured class, but a bit less work compared to summer school or Chinese 110.",
    "Take Chinese 150 after doing the Light Fellowship (L3\/L4) in China. After PIB, HBA, or DSIC you will be fine in this class as long as you keep up with the work. You will find your Chinese level declining as the semester progresses. This is natural seeing as you won't be speaking it more than an hour a day.",
    "It's L5 Chinese, you know this isn't going to be a pleasure cruise. Wang Laoshi is a hoot, Li Laoshi a bit less so (although opinions vary). The material is sometimes interesting (loved listening to Chinese propaganda songs), sometimes not quite so stimulating (like the section about\u6210\u8bed).I recommend you take this if you're trying to keep up your level of Chinese. It's enough to keep widening your vocabulary and maintain a certain degree of fluency and comfort in speaking, but you certainly aren't going to make substantial progress.The fact it still meets 5 times a week (the only L5 language course to do so, to my knowledge) is a huge turn-off to me, but I wanted to make sure all my Chinese didn't disappear after fighting so hard to get to this level in China this summer on Light.",
    "I would recommend it, but be aware that it does not really improve your speaking skills at all. This is something you have to do on your own time.",
    "Keep your head up in class and you'll be fine. The professors know it's hard, they designed it to be hard. If you are engaged and make an effort you'll get a lot more out of them in class, though they are strict with the language rules. If you don't ask questions, they'll assume everyone gets it. This is a take-initiative level of Chinese.",
    "This was my first Chinese class at Yale. A lot of kids in the class had just finished a Light fellowship in China, so this class was easy for them, as the workload was light compared to what they had in Beijing. However, I thought that Chinese 150 was a lot of work. It took me a long time to get used to it, and even then I found that there was more work than I could actually finish. However, my Chinese improved a lot. I learned SO MUCH last semester, and I think it was worth it.",
    "I was coming off a summer at HBA, so the intensity of the course did not feel bad compared to my summer work. Still, by the end of the course I grew tired by how every day in class felt the exact same\u00a0\u0097\u00a0and really, every day was very similar in class (that's the nature of language learning). The teachers are very helpful, but the course is better for improving your character recognition than any other part of your language skills. Advice: don't be fooled by how easy it is at first \u0097\u00a0the tests quickly get more difficult.",
    "Take this class if you are motivated. It is quite hard, at least at the beginning, but if you do all your homework and arrive at class on time you will have great results.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It's hard work, but manageable. If you're a freshman though, be warned, it will be far more work than you're used to from high school."
