    "Great course. Italian is a really fun language. Especially with Chris.",
    "An excellent introductory class for italian. I would recommend it if someone was interested in learning a new language.",
    "Italian 110 was my favorite class at Yale thus far. The language is not difficult to learn, especially if you have any sort of background in a romance language, and the professor was very approachable, making the class environment much more relaxed and the learning process even easier.I would absolutely recommend this class. The workload is just enough to help you learn the language, but is not as much as that required by most language classes at Yale. Also, Chris Nixon is a great professor. He grades fairly and is a really nice, helpful teacher to put it simply.",
    "Definitely take this class. It is a great way to fulfill the language requirement, and I guarantee that you will be able to speak Italian fairly well by the end of the course.",
    "Professor Nixon's teaching made this section a joy; I'm amazed by the amount of Italian I learned.",
    "i'd definitely recommend it to another student. It provides a great chance to learn written&spoken italian to a certain extend in a very short time period. and it is really fun!"
