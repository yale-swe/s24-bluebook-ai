   "comments": [
    "Yes. English 120 was a good class because it forced me to write in different styles and be more flexible with how I approach a topic.",
    "Reading articles from the New York TImes and the like, turning in a short-ish essay about every 2 weeks.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student because it is an effective means to improving your writing once you're able to write at the college level. Fascinating course.",
    "English 120 is definitely a heavier workload than you expect initially, but it honestly depends on your abilities as a writer and revisor of your work. English 120 has taught me to be far more critical of my own work, and to also learn how to objectively analyze a piece of writing as terrible however much I may love it. Takethe course with a grain of salt, and make sure you like the people in your section before you go forth with the class! They will make the year and their opinions during workshop are fairly productive to listen to! Professor Spillane is very general about what she wants to see in the essays, but definitely grades towards a certain style or type of writing that follows the model essays that are assigned reading. The discussions also often stagnate and are very vague.",
    "I loved this course. It taught me to truly appreciate and more importantly ENJOY writing which is something I always found it be more of an assignment or hassle back in high school. I loved the readings we went through this year and the discussions in class were awesome. My writing improved a ton and this class makes me want to take more English classes in the future.Professor Spillane gave the MOST HELPFUL responses for writing assignments. She would give almost a half a page to a page worth of advice and comments which were extremely helpful for the second draft. She would always be open to helpful during office hours or simply through email. The discussions were great and I loved having the guest speaker Jack Hitt come to class and talk to us.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, and especially this section. Professor Spillane always provides a ton of comments which are amazingly helpful (though it may seem a little disheartening at first for people who are used to being praised as amazing writers in high school. Stick it out, though. It's worth it. You learn so much). And as long as you address her comments its not hard to do well. This section has the best syllabus by far, I always looked forward to the readings.",
    "YES! Though you might not be in such an awesome as mine. Take it anyway! I prefer this much more than my English 114 seminar."
