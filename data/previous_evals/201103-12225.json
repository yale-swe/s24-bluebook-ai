    "YES- a great way to know some rare things!",
    "This is a GREAT class.You will learn so much about your research topics.However, be prepared for quite a bit of work.Although there are no classes, you will be doing research for the entire semester and writing the two papers.All of the mentors and the professor are quite pleasant, and there is a project for everyone.I ended up with a project I wasn't really thrilled with, but I still learned quite a bit and ended up finding the topic interesting.If you get the chance, definitely try to take this class.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course to science and non-science students alike, if you can get in. However, because the format of this course is essentially two self-directed research projects (with support from mentors in the Peabody Museum), you'll only get out what you put in. You shouldn't take this course unless you are willing and able to commit a lot of time and effort to it; but I promise that if you do, it'll totally be worth it. The projects are all really cool, and quite varied, from anatomicalstudies of extinct South American mammals to examining flower-pollinator relationships. I really enjoyed learning about other students' projects during the presentations at the end of each half-term. I also found Professor Buss's comments on my papers to be incredibly helpful in improving my writing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class to another student. This was my first interaction with science at Yale, and it was amazing to just jump right in with real specimens and learn so much about them!",
    "I would definitely take it. This class gives you a feel of what it is like to do actual science. It requires a lot of independence, and you really must be self-directed to finish things on time. Doing your own project is great, and listening to everyone else present their projects is equally interesting. If you take it, get ready to work very hard, and produce something substantive.",
    "This class is great and really gives you a unique opportunity to explore the Peabody. Everyone who takes EEB 171 is passionate about science, and some very interesting projects are produced (including some that become the foundations for independent research). The curators are awesome and Dr. Buss, though he may seem a little stern, is a great professor and the perfect choice to lead this class. However, everything in this class depends on how much time you put into it, so only sign up if you have the time and the motivation to draft and complete your own research project (twice). This has been the hardest class I have taken at Yale, but it is definitely my favorite so far."
