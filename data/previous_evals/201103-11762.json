   "comments": [
    "Great class for developing French. Be warned, however, if your French class in high school was conducted primarily in English, it may take some time to adjust to an always-French-speaking class.",
    "Yes. Madame Koizim is very fun and makes learning easy!",
    "Yes! I really liked the class. It is a very useful foundation if you want to continue studying French and the movies and books we studied were very good.",
    "French 130 requires a substantial time investment in terms of class and doing the readings and homework, but you will learna proportionate amount of French. Considering that this is a 1.5 credit class, the workload and difficulty are more than reasonable. The class is well balanced among reading, watching movies, and doing listening and grammar exercises. The tests are not too difficult and are heavily based on the homework and class material.",
    "It's a good course to take after French 120 to further polish your language skills.",
    "French 130 is an intermediate French course that builds your command of the French language (reading, speaking, grammar, vocabulary, etc.) through the study of several books and movies. I would highly recommend this course to someone who places at this level. I had a lot of fun, and the small class setting was great. You might think that having a class everyday is annoying, but it greatly helps to strengthen your language skills.",
    "A vibrant, stimulating course. Enjoy this course. Savor it. Despite the fact that it meets every day of the week, it is over all too soon. Madame Koizim is energetic and humorous, and best of all teaches with purpose. You'll learn at a quick but comfortable pace, and engage equally with texts and with the tangles of French grammar. The texts themselves--Le Petit Nicolas, L'etranger, and M. Ibrahim et les Fleurs du Coran--bear considerable reflection, but are fairly easy reads in themselves. A good, fun, pithy course."
