   "comments": [
    "Incredibly relevant, especially given the prevalence of the model minority myth. Really situates the Asian American experience in the broader context of US history. Such a great class, definitely worth taking.",
    "A great course that covers a lot of interesting and relevant material that adds context to present-day politics. Prof Lui is engaging and uses a variety of source material effectively in lecture, and TFs were great.",
    "Definitely recommend",
    "Take this class.",
    "The popularity and excellence of this class is a huge testament to why we should have more Asian American history courses and professors. Such an interesting and thorough examination of the subject. A lot of reading at times (100-300 pages a week), a midterm, take home final, and oral history paper.",
    "A class that ought to be taken especially by Asian American students! It's so important that Asian Americans understand their history and how race relations stand today.",
    "Yes, take this class. Asian American history is too-often overlooked, and there's a lot of important material you should know. That being said, the workload is not particularly light. You will have to do a lot of reading every week, and things get especially busy around midterms and finals because you have both a midterm exam and paper, both a final oral history project and a final take home exam. If you're prepared to put a decent chunk of time into this class every week, you will certainly get a lot out of it. But it's not a gut, and it's not particularly easy, so know what you're signing up for.",
    "Enjoyed lectures during weeks 1-8, then became repetitive and disorganized. Take it to hear Mary Lui talk about some very relevant and interesting topics of race and immigration.",
    "Take this class - especially if you're not Asian American. I can't stress enough how important it is to understand how various Asian American groups were treated in America because they are otherwise neglected and ignored, especially in the classroom and in race relations discussions. And if you're Asian American, definitely take this class too. You should know your own history. Professor Lui is an amazing lecturer, and you'll learn so much. This is one of those must-take classes at Yale.",
    "Take it. Asian American history is a vital component of American history, yet it is typically glossed over in history textbooks. Every Yale student could benefit from this course. Whether you are Asian or not, you will learn a tremendous amount about Asian American migration and racial formation among other subjects. That said, It is a lot of work - a writing midterm, a 5 page midterm paper, heavy reading load, a 10 page oral history and an 8 page take home final. Also, Professor Lui lets class out late every time but it's understandable since there's so much material to cover.",
    "Take it. Reclaim your history. Get angry. Never forget.",
    "AMAZING CLASS. Lectures are so diverse, Mary Lui is really caring and tries to get lunch with everyone, and the assignments are all fun to do. IT'S NOT JUST FOR ASIANS AND ASIAN AMERICANS!!!!!!! A lot of reviews from earlier years say that it's a lot of work, but I didn't feel like it was... maybe it's because I enjoyed it so much? The midterm isn't bad -- just a couple ID's and an essay, the midterm paper was an analysis of a primary source, the final was a 6-8 page analysis of some primary sources, and the oral history projectwhich is amazingdoesn't take long to do. Trust me, you'll learn so much from this class and won't regret taking it. You learn so much about the historical patterns that brought Asians to the United States and how laws and social attitudes have dramatically shaped the lives of Asian Americans. You learn about resistance struggles by Asian Americans, and almost every lecture has a cool case study about a particular place or person or cultural artifact. This is the kind of class that really shapes and changes the way you look at things, especially the United States, and it forces you to think critically about your place at Yale and the country. I'm just going to copy and paste previous reviews that reflect how I feel about this class: \"PROFESSOR LUI IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH: THIS CLASS WAS AMAZING, IT MADE ME RETHINK EVERYTHING ABOUT MYSELF AND MY SURROUNDINGS, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!\" \"Yes. Somehow I was deprived of Asian American history for my entire life. It is relevant and important to understanding this country today. Recommend to all who care about learning about experiences of people from different backgrounds (everyone should).\" \"It is an absolutely wonderful class and a must take.\"",
    "I highly recommend Asian American History. As a non-Asian I was surprised at how relevant the content was to my worldview. I learned so much nuance in the basic story of American history. This class is delightfully interdisciplinary, combining legal history with cultural studies, oral histories, media studies, social movements, critical race theory, international politics. It's not too hard, but still a substantial AMST lecture. Definitely take it!",
    "YES! Whether you are or are not Asian American, I think it's an important subject to study and one that Yale frankly doesn't offer many options for. Fortunately, this class is lead by an amazing professor, and at least my TA was one of the best that I've ever had.",
    "I would absolutely recommend course. This course is so important to understanding and contextualizing many current issues.",
    "A must take! This was an amazing course that gives an overview of an untaught history. I recommend this for not only Asian Americans but anyone interested in American history in general. Professor Lui is absolutely phenomenal and you won't regret taking this course.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in a comprehensive approach to Asian American history that spans all the way back to the 1500's. You will definitely learn a lot of useful information, and you will look at racism and racial formation in a different way. If you do take this class, though, be sure to be prepared for long readings (100-150+ pages per week) and lots of papers.",
    "A history lecture with a section covering the readings. Weekly posting on classesv2, two questions about the readings.",
    "Yes. Take this class if you're Asian-American or not. The events on campus this year regarding race shouldn't given you any hesitation. Expect to see history in a new way.",
    "This is a must-take for any Asian American student, and Im so glad I was able to take it as a freshman. Before coming to Yale, I was unaware frankly, apathetic of the long and tumultuous history of Asians here in the U.S., and Im happy to say that Im walking away from this class with new modes of thought and the vocabulary to continue exploring ethnic studies and to observe current and past race relations with a more critical eye. The class was even more significant and relevant this semester than it usually is, coinciding with the wave of student activism at universities across the nation addressing racial discrimination on college campuses. Prof. Lui makes the course material accessible to all students, and shes such a fantastic lecturer. Ashanti was a fantastic TA and I enjoyed going to every class and section. There is a lot of reading (do all of it and take notes itll help so much for the midterm, final, and papers in between), but most of the selections are worthwhile. At first the class doesnt seem like a lot of work, but the workload really hits during midterm season (5-page historical analysis paper + in-class midterm) and finals (10-page oral history paper and 6-8 page take home final). Nevertheless, I loved all of the assignments, especially the oral history paper, and they all helped me understand a bit about who I am as an Asian American, how my family and I fit into AA history, struggles that the AA community still face today, and what my role should be in discussions of race. I am so grateful for this class, because up until this semester I havent taken the time to consider everything I just mentioned, nor to appreciate how special the dualism of a Chinese American identity is, nor to thank my parents and grandparents for the sacrifices they made in this country to give me opportunities like this. tl;dr TAKE AA HISTORY!",
    "YES. This class teaches an untold but very relevant history to America. I left the class feeling I better understood American culture and the identities of Asian Americans. Not coming from an Asian household, I feel this class was extremely informative and I have become a more knowledgable, insightful, and intentional person. Though the information from this course is only the tip of the iceberg, this class has given me rudimentary tools of analysis to better understand race in America and how it permeates literally every aspect of society.",
    "This class is very very very important. The content is so enriching and fulfilling. It was amazing to find out how little I actually knew about the history of Asian-Americans. Professor Lui is also very engaging and makes every lecture interesting. That said, be warned that she does tend to go overtime. The assessments were fun to do, but were also repetitive. It is a bit more work than a normal lecture class, but it was worth it just to learn about this history which is too often forgotten.",
    "Very important course. There's a lot of work, so if you're not in the major I would take it Cr\/D but I would still take it. You learn a lot about American and World History vis-a-vis Asian American History. I learned an incredible amount, as lectures and readings are super interesting and engaging.",
    "Great Credit\/D course if you're at all interested in the subject area or the study of minorities groups in the US.",
    "Take it if you want to learn a bit more about Asian American History, but be warned it's A LOT of work. (Maybe a little too much...)",
    "I highly recommend this course for the readings and the history.",
    "Definitely take! Especially if you are Asian American.",
    "Take it! A lot of reading, but you really develop a more comprehensive understanding of Asian American history",
    "Would highly recommend",
    "Amazing class! It's so cool to learn about immigration, WWII, the Vietnam War, etc. from an Asian American perspective because you can't get that in any other class. If you're interested at all in how Asians first immigrated to the US, or the parallels between Asian American history and African American history, definitely take this class!",
    "A fantastic overview and a different perspective on race relations in America. You learn a lot about racial formation in the US through a totally different lens, but you also learn about how racism interacts with Asianness. I'd absolutely recommend it.",
    "Students, only take this course if you are willing to put in the high amount of work to learn about Asian American History. Here are things I wish I had known and taken into full consideration before taking the class: 1.) The reading-load is HEAVY. The amount of readings assigned for some of the weeks for this Intro course was on par with some of the seminars I have taken. The most frustrating thing is that some of the readings are repetitive, and you never get to discuss the majority of them during your 50 minute sections. 2.) Lectures ALWAYS run over-time. Sometimes 5 minutes, sometimes 15, and even 20 minutes past lecture time. NOT ONCE did Prof. Lui end on time (except during shopping period). This is frustrating especially if you are tight for time. Yes the professor loves what she teaches and gets over excited, but she should be able to synthesize everything she wants to say within her lecture allotted time. 3.) Midterms + Finals are DOUBLE the work. ----MIDTERMS: You have an in-class midterm and a midterm paper to complete. The in-class midterm consists of IDs and an essay. You are expected to know EXACT DATES and EVERY SINGLE DETAIL for ID's and events. If you forget something--no matter how minor--they will take points off. (There are about 150 people, cases, and events to memorize). Not to mention that their expectation for the in-class essay is much more than what the average Yale student can produce and hand-write in 30 minutes. Some other classmates agree that the expectations for the in-class midterm were not fair given the 50 minute time-frame. ----FINALS: For a final, you have to write an oral history paper. It is 8-10 pages, contextualizing the life of a person within Asian-American history and themes. While this may not seem bad at first, once you get in the mist finals period,the divided 2 parts format is going to annoy you (One with history and the other intertwining the narrative with the history.) In addition to the Oral final paper, you have ANOTHER paper to complete! Yes. Another freaking paper (6-8 pages). This ones is a \"take-home\" exam-- and considered THE final paper. Realizing that you have 2 final assignments for this INTRO class along with final assignments for your other classes, you become frustrated. #regrets TLDR; A lot of work. Long lectures. In-class midterm PLUS midterm essay. 10-page final oral history paper PLUS another 8-page final paper. Frustrating. Annoying. Only take if you are super interested in Asian-American history and willing to do the work. Think of the class as a seminar rather than an intro course. You do learn a lot about Asian American history and Prof. Lui is a great person, but I prefer the general intro ethnic studies class.",
    "This is an interesting course that develops an aspect of history usually overlooked in most American history courses. It is well taught and engaging.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who's interested in understanding the place of Asian-Americans in the US; for me, at least, a lot of the interest I had in the class came out of the fact that I found it very personal. I enjoyed it, but it was more work than I expected and it definitely seems like it would have been much more difficult to get through if I hadn't had some interest in the subject matter. Overall, I would say that you should take this if you already have an interest in the topic and not just for an easy credit--the work will be uninteresting and there'll be a pretty good amount of it (or at least it'll seem that way) if you aren't already somewhat invested in it.",
    "Definitely take this course! It's excellent. Professor Lui is great, and the class material is incredibly important.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class for other students. The content was really interesting, and the material was really important for people to learn (especially for a Chinese American like myself). However, the class isn't without problems. Organization could definitely be improved; there were a few times when my friends and I didn't know what was going on. Basically everything before Japanese internment was pretty clear, and then the material became confusing and disorganized. Content is presented quickly so be ready to be furiously typing the entire 50+ (we would usually go over) minutes of class. A lot of the time it seemed like she was reading from a script as well, so it didn't feel like \"teaching\" as much. Honestly though, I'm pretty sure it's just because there's so much material to be covered. We really should have multiple AA history courses, and it's pretty obvious that Prof. Lui covers so much material because she knows that many of us won't get exposure to it otherwise, unfortunately. Section was A+++++, though.",
    "AMST 272 is an amazing course, and I highly recommend any student to take it. Brief disclaimer: it is NOT a course that will tell you about \"finding your identity,\" but it analyzes Asian American history with a fresh perspective. For one, it does not start with the California Gold Rush! Coming out of the course, I've learned so much about the discrimination that Asians face (and still face today!) and the tools that I've learned to look at history definitely apply outside of Asian American History. Professor Lui is a great lecturer who is able to take all of this material and breaks it down into just a few themes that seem to resonate throughout the course, and the Teaching Fellows are all really great too. There definitely is a rather heavy workload in this class, given all of the reading due each week--but it's definitely worth it. I will say, though, that this course mainly focuses on East Asian American history, and while there are a few lessons dedicated to South Asians and South East Asian, there isn't an equal balance. However, I would definitely say that this is a class to take even if you are remotely interested in Asian American History. You won't regret it.",
    "An incredible class about a very interesting and important yet oft-neglected piece of American history. It is quite a bit of work, especially since at midterm\/finals periods you end up having two assignments\/tests back to back, and there is a fair bit of reading. However, all the reading was super interesting and engaging, and it was easy to get through a large chunk of it quickly. Prof. Lui is incredibly engaging and funny. Absolutely take this class.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Take the course; it will broaden your perspective regardless of your personal identity.",
    "I would recommend this class to everyone. There can sometimes be a lot of reading, but even when there are lots of readings, they are usually engaging and interesting.",
    "Asian American History is a blast. Though there is a lot of reading, I have to emphasize that this work is completely worth it. Prof. Lui is an absolute boss, the TFs are all super helpful, and the lectures are engaging and organic. Outside of the nitty-gritty of academics, this class really opened my eyes to how Asian Americans grew to be today. I as an Asian American really learned a lot about how I am perceived and how my parents were perceived when they immigrated, and it was an extremely eye-opening experience. No one really knows anything about Asian American History, and it's about time people learned.",
    "This is the type of class that you go to Yale for. Really eye-opening. You have to be dedicated to pay attention in all the lectures, but it will be worth it. There is a midterm paper, a midterm exam, an oral history paper, and a take-home final exam that's an essay. Take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially an Asian American students who wants to think more about his\/her identity. It is a straightforward survey of Asian American history. I think the assignments, especially the oral history project, really made me think and reflect on my own Asian American experiences.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're looking for a relatively straightforward cultural studies\/history lecture. There was a deceivingly extensive amount of work, and the oral history final project was definitely challenging, but ultimately, it was worth it.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any student with no hesitation.",
    "Overall, an important class to take, especially because there are so few courses on the subject. Being an Asian-American, I was better able to understand the experiences my relatives had to go through but also got the chance to learn about the history of other Asian groups. While I came in with a small knowledge of Asian-American History, I certainly learned a lot more from this class. I especially enjoyed the oral history paper, because it forced me to ask my grandparents questions about race that I probably wouldn't otherwise have asked. Whether or not they were Asian, I would recommend this class to a fellow student."
