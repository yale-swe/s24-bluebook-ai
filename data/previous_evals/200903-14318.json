   "comments": [
    "The focus of this class is quite broad and very theoretical. If you're looking for a political philosophy course, this is a good one, covering classical, enlightenment, and contemporary ideas.",
    "This was a great survey class on constitutions--both the idea of what a constitution is\/how it plays a role in society as well as different ways of interpreting the American Constitution. I would definitely recommend it, as the class content stays fresh every week and the material lends itself to great discussion. Professor Stimson is also really nice and helpful.",
    "A pretty good course that gets into the philosophy behind constitutions. Towards the end we begin to discuss the American Constitution in light of real world questions. A solid course.",
    "This course will never be taught again at Yale, but yes.",
    "Excellent course. Concepts of Constitution had a diverse but coherent set of readings. Discussions were quite good. I think that the that required reading responses\/discussion questions helped make sure that everyone thought about the texts prior to class. Prof. Stimson guided discussion very well. She added insightful thoughts and comments of her own, and she was particularly helpful during the paper-writing process. Having several process deadlines while writing the paper helped me to write a more thoroughly researched and, I think, better paper than I otherwise would have.",
    "Concepts of Constitution was a really solid class that placed the American Constitution (particularly the debate about its interpretation) in the context of historical discussions about constitution. Assuming an interest in the American constitution, I would definitely recommend it to another student."
