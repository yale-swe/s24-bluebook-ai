    "Instructor: Robert Walter Buchkowski \u00a0I didn't interact with Rob too much throughout the course, but whenever I did he seemed incredibly helpful and very knowledgeable. One of the best TAs I've had.",
    "Instructor: Robert Walter Buchkowski \u00a0Rob was great. The only issue was not enough personalized office hours, especially towards the end of the semester.",
    "Instructor: Robert Walter Buchkowski \u00a0Rob was an exceptional TA. He made himself very available to students outside of the classroom and was able to provide clarification to concepts learned in class in a way that made the material more accessible to students. Rob also provided strong support when students were using R software and was able to help troubleshoot students projects with them. I undoubtedly gained much more from this class because of Robs ability to provide students with quality feedback and support.",
    "Instructor: Robert Walter Buchkowski \u00a0Rob was an extremely accessible TA, making himself readily available for homework help during office hours, while always being available to answer questions. He is a good lab lecturer, and was able to explain the technical aspects of modeling clearly. I have no major criticisms of his teaching.",
    "Instructor: Robert Walter Buchkowski \u00a0Very available and patient in explaining challenging material.",
    "Instructor: Robert Walter Buchkowski \u00a0Rob was a great TA-- he was very organized and helped us learn a lot. Given the level of the workload, it would have been good for him to have more scheduled office hours, or even a second TA. This was a really difficult class, and I think a second person to explain concepts would be helpful.",

    "The material of this course was incredibly interesting and useful, however the pace was a bit too fast for me and I think several other students in the class. Since I lacked experience using R - the assignments took 10x longer to complete than for someone with R experience. This made it very frustrating at times because assignments took way longer than they needed to be completed.",
    "To me, the real value of this course was as a theoretical ecology course. Given that it was taught in FES, I feel that the class in general was expecting more emphasis on the applications of the content to conservation. While there was effort to incorporate this material into the curriculum, I feel it may have been to the detriment of the scientific rigor of the information presented. Perhaps in the future it would be beneficial to teach this course jointly with EEB to encourage more students with strong interests in ecological modeling to take the course.",
    "The course was very fast paced and concepts were not always clear. Assignments were not straight forward, and required much more time than what students have available for a 3 credit class. This led to frustration.",
    "Question 11: The theory that provided the context to the dynamical equations was clearly taught but the mathematics behind the differential equations was not always clear. Question 15: The course is very valuable to students with similar interests as my own as it provides tools to understand ecological models and provides students the opportunity to experiment with building their own model, giving students a deeper level of understanding.",
    "The course was a solid introduction to modeling and theoretical thinking in ecology. No major criticisms.",
    "The instructor presented a wealth of useful and detailed knowledge about ecosystem modeling. The course is really an amazing trove of highly advanced information on current thinking in ecology. I really got a lot out of it. The instructor appears to be a bit frustrated however, and at times wasn't sensitive to the low level of mathematical rigor some students were familiar with. I think, for some students, some basic review of calculus at the beginning of the course could be fruitful - either in class or as a homework assignment to get people up to the point where they need to be.",
    "The layout of the course was a survey of modelling theories. Some theories were highly technical\/hard to understand with such a brief overview.",
    "This was a really good class, with great coverage of interesting ideas. However, the material could have been more clearly presented-- I didn't always have a good understanding of how all the different concepts related to one another, or how what we were learning in one week related to what we had previously learned. It also would have been helpful if we had moved more slowly through the material.",
    "An example. During the masters colloquium you sat in on five student presentations. After Lindas presentation you raised you hand to ask a question. You proceeded to belittle Linda, her study, her methods, and the discipline of social science in general. You didnt ask a question you only criticized the study and anyone associated with it. The take away; If only everyone was a smart as me the world would be a better place. To be clear I am not defending the presentation, which was poor. I wanted to point out that you are overly emotionally invested in your discipline. To the extent that you put down a masters student in front of a whole auditorium just to toot your horn. Everyone in attendance saw that you were acting like an insecure asshole. The problem of being overly invested in you discipline extends to this class. If your lecture ventured ever so slightly from your core subject area, the authors, the journal, and the general public are subject to a diatribe describing how wrong headed they are in comparison to you."

Learning about the history of ecological theory was also very useful in understanding how the field has grown into what it is today.",

    "More time spent on the mathematical methods such as stability analysis.",
    "I think the lab should be an actual lab in a computer room where we work through the R script for certain assignments or useful processes together. It would have made the labs much more productive and educational.",
    "The homework often times consisted of tweaking pre-written code, which I think led many students to be unprepared to actually write a program from scratch. I think the development of a project should b e incorporated into earlier assignments to make sure students are learning how to program from scratch.",
    "It might have been helpful to do a bit more instruction with R and use the language more extensively on the homeworks.",
    "Time-management, support for students, slower pace.",
    "I think the crossover of the material and the R software needs to be improved further. The lab section of the course was not very structured and I think that would be an ideal time to provide a more formal introduction to R and the ways that we will use it for the course. There was a wide range of skill levels in the class in terms of their familiarity with R and the accessibility of the math foundations for assignments. Any ways to even out students skill levels whether it is through having prerequisites or holding an R tutorial during the lab section would be very helpful.",
    "There could be more purposeful labs. Most labs were just there for time to work on homework with TA help. Using that time instead to tackle mini-projects would be useful.",
    "I think it would be helpful to students in the class if labs were used to work linearly through the textbook for modeling in R. Students not familiar with programming struggled a lot. A 'playing with models' approach is suggested in the course, but the course itself doesn't really live up to this kind of teaching approach. I do not believe the instructor programs in R, but that is fine - students could just read and follow with the textbook and essentially 'teach themselves' this way. This is of course the notion of the final project, but the final projects would probably be more advanced if the first 2\/3 of the course were more focused on the basics of modeling (it is conceptually, but some students need to learn how the programming happens - plus that can make it more fun). Also - the final project, in class final, and an additional paper all occurred within 5 days of each other - and before reading week. This seems an excessive amount of work for the last week of classes. Projects could just as easily have been due during reading week.",
    "Variations among students with regards to their ability to use R made it hard to gauge what was expected of us for the final assignment. I felt that my model was very simple compared to other students' because of my limited ability with the software."

    "The relationship between lab and lecture was quite effective, although I thought that the combination of homeworks and the final project was too much. The homework assignments were helpful to my learning of the material, but took a lot of time to do, and didn't leave enough time to focus properly on the project."
