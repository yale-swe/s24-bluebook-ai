   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class if you want to learn a couple things about Nigeria (mostly through the papers you get to write because you do all the topic choosing and research on your own) and have a somewhat easy class. Not for anyone who wants to become a Nigeria expert or write their dissertation",
    "Interesting course, easy workload (one reading response a week -- that's basically it), cool\/funny professor, and not strict on attendance. Take this course.",
    "Too superficial of an approach to Nigeria. You really don't learn that much. It's an easy class, but not very fulfilling. Coolest thing is the presentations and the cooking event at the end of the course.",
    "Relaxed class. No exams. Weekly reading responses. 2 short papers (6-10 pages) on topic of your choice. and a final presentation on a topic of your choice. had the most fun giving the presentation. great as a 5th class. Professor Seye is hilarious and you may learn the most completing your assignments.",
    "It's very topic specific. Make sure you read the syllabus before you decide to take the course.",
    "The course is very informative about Nigeria and an enjoyable class if you like History\/Political Science classes",
    "really great class that gives you a great perspective of Nigeria",
    "This was a chill and interesting class. It didn't require too much work besides the reading responses every week which aren't worth that many points. I did learn a lot about Nigeria that I didn't know before so I would recommend this class. Also the cooking at the end of the course was fun and delicious.",
    "I would recommend taking it and using the two short (7-page) papers and presentation as excuses to do research on Nigeria-related topics you're interested in. The actual lectures, while they offer tidbits of new information, are superficial and missable--and several students do miss them often.",
    "It's a good class if you're looking for an overview of Nigerian history past and present. The class itself might not be as engaging as one would hope, but you'll definitely learn a lot."
