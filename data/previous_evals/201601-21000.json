    "BENG 467 is a review of the field of systems biology, looking at several classic problems through fundamental mathematical concepts and basic computational tools. Take it, if you're considering the systems biology class, but earlier in your Yale career.",
    "BENG467 is an interesting course, though sometimes a little disorganized. Professor Levchenko and Miller-Jensen are both engaging and caring professors, but I felt like we would touch on a subject and then hop to another topic without placing it in context of the former subjects. It was oftentimes difficult to see the course's trajectory, and sometimes felt more like a survey course.",
    "It's about system biology and it's quite interesting in knowing many aspects of this topic."
