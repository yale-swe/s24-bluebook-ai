    "I think every psychology major should try to get involved in research at some point! It's such a unique experience and helps to solidify understanding of concepts.",
    "RESEARCH.",
    "An absolute must for all undergrads!",
    "Yes, definitely",
    "Do as much research as you can, Yale's resources are excellent.",
    "If you're taking this class, you're probably seeking a BS (perhaps with Distinction) in Psychology. You know what you're getting yourself into. You've got this.",
    "Working in a lab can be a great experience, but sometimes it can be very frustrating. Your experience can be shaped by a variety of factors: whether or not the studies at your lab interest you; the timeline of the studies (are they getting delayed?); your relationship with the lab professor and\/or graduate student mentor; etc. If you're depending on a certain amount of data to be collected by a certain date, in order to write your senior essay, make sure you check in regularly with your lab advisor to make sure the study is progressing on time. Unfortunately, many times seniors scramble at the last minute because there is not enough data to write up their senior essays!",
    "take it if there is a specific subtopic within psychology that you're really interested in exploring",
    "If you are working in a lab, definitely take this class and put enough time in to conduct independent research. You will learn more working in a lab than in any class.",
    "Great opportunity to learn how to conduct independent research; would definitely recommend",
    "This was an amazing experience. Researching and creating something that was I was passionate about was a tremendous opportunity.",
    "Yes. This is a great opportunity to get first-hand experience in empirical research. You can design whatever project you want, in whatever topic you want. One of the best parts about directed research is that you get to work closely with a faculty member throughout the semester.",
    "Take the opportunity to do research at Yale, mentored by Yale's incredible faculty members!",
    "Good course. The best Senior Requirement option in my opinion. I wish the requirements of the class were made clearer."
