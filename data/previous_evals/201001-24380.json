    "A great introduction to China's economy, with the focus on history and concepts and no math whatsoever. Politics was also a key theme. Class discussions posed interesting questions. Readings are helpful but mostly repeated\/reinforced by lectures.",

    "Yes, definitely take this course.",
    "ECON 180 is a survey lecture course of modern Chinese economic developments from the late 19th century (esp. post-1949) to the entry of China into the WTO.I would definitely recommend ECON 180 to a fellow student."
