   "comments": [
    "Yea, it's a good course. You'll learn some basic theory about how social movements work and will read a lot of interested ideas\/case studies.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would recommend this to a student interested in social movements, or even understanding what happened on campus from a sociological perspective, who just needs an in. It's an interesting course with a reasonable reading and work load.",
    "Great class overall! Readings were great, the professor is amazing at facilitating discussion and just a kind person overall. The class did a great job of incorporating current social movements into the curriculum and discussion. Discussions felt a bit long at times. But the workload is very manageable-- a reading response every week, a in-class midterm essay, and a 10-15 page final paper. The class is definitely a self-selecting group and many are personally involved in activism, which made discussions very fun!",
    "Ann introduction to social movement theory.",
    "I think social movements was a good class. I felt I got a fair amount out of it because the people in my class were engaged and contributed interesting thoughts. Sometimes I felt that I would have liked Professor Eyerman to direct the class a bit more, and I didn't get a ton out of some of the textbook readings, but overall if this is a subject you're interested in, I think it's worth taking.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, the workload is manageable and I learned a ton of really interesting stuff about social movements. If you don't have much experience with sociology, however, be aware that this is a sociology class and not a history class, so you will be learning through that lens.",
    "This was an overall very interesting and enjoyable course: professor Eyerman is great, the readings were fantastic, and the discussions were always engaging. The material was always relevant and people could always tie the topics into events they were interested in. Do not, however, take this course if you are not able or unwilling to put the time into reading all the assigned papers and really digest them. What you will get of this course comes from the readings, since you won't have anything to contribute or get out of discussions if you don't REALLY know that week's material. You also have a lot of freedom over choosing your final paper topic, which is really great, but can also lead to uncertainty at the same time. If you like the topic and want to put in the effort, there is definitely something to be gained from this course, and if you don't get behind it is very enjoyable.",
    "Ummmmmmmm.... Not fantastic. It's OK. Eyerman is a nice guy -- the readings and discussions were often dry and repetitive though. Who knows.... I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Great class - Professor Eyerman is SO kind and a wonderful teacher. Take it just for him.",
    "Take this class if you can get in!! You'll enjoy going every week and it won't turn you into a midterms month zombie (....because prof. Eyerman cares more that we learned than that we missed nights of sleep). And, indeed, I plan to use what I've learned on my thesis.",
    "An excellent class with compelling seminar format. This class is approachable for non-majors, yet operates on a high level. You will walk away with a new vocabulary and comfortability in the discipline of sociology.",
    "This is a course about social movements as a sociological concept not about historical social movements. however from a sociological perspective it is a great class that really starts you thinking and allows you to engage with the politics of organizing."
