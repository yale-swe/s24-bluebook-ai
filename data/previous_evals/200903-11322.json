   "comments": [
    "Wrightson is a great and well organized lecturer. His classes are engaging and he structures his course so as to allow flexibility. Students can pursue their interests by writing on what ever topic they desire. The final too is incredibly flexible, there are 20 topics and you need to write on two of them. In all, I enjoyed the class very much!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course. Professor Wrightson is a great lecturer. The course material is interesting, and the readings are not bad.",
    "Take it! The final was fairly easy because you get to choose two out of TWENTY essay questions, and the whole final was composed of these two essays. The 5-page and 10-page papers were not that difficult either.",
    "it's a good class, and I would definitely recommend it. workload isnt too intensive and it's fairly easy",
    "I would recommend this course if you are willing to go to class and do at least a large part of the reading. You definitely don't need to do all of the reading to do well in the class, and actually you don't even need to go to class to do well in the class. Even so I really recommend attending the lectures and doing as much of the reading as you can because Wrightson makes the material really interesting!",
    "History 251: Early Modern England was a very interesting look at an interesting time period. I would take it if you are interested in the time period. It is not all political history...so don't expect the Tudors like the tv show. There is a lot of reading but its managable and you can miss one or two. The grades are just two papers of your choice and an essay final so its not too bad. I would definitely take it if you are looking for an interesting history course.",
    "This is a wonderful course. I took it as my first history course at Yale, and it was informative and engaging. Writing the papers was fun because you can write about whatever you want; it really keeps you happy about the course.",
    "Relatively easy workload. You cover an interesting period in English history. If you want to learn about this time period, like history, or just need a humanities take it.",
    "Excellent class. Very well organized, lectures are straightforward and paper topics are broad enough that you get to select a topic of your interest and write something meaningful. Prof Wrightson is a really nice guy, excellent lecturer and very willing to meet with students to discuss paper topics and how to write a good history paper. Definitely a professor that you want to meet during your time at Yale - inspiring!",
    "I love the way this class is structured (2 papers on any topic you want and a final where you can choose what material to learn), and Keith Wrightson is a great professor. He is a great lecturer, and he also is very accessible and eager to help students. My only complaint is that this class focuses rather heavily on social history, which I don't find very interesting. However, it is perfectly feasible to write both of your papers about political history and study only those topics in preparation for the exam.",
    "Yes take it! It represents the way learning should be. You have the chance to dive into topics that interest you, without being forced to memorize a bunch of random facts. You will definitely take something away from this course, and the workload is 100% manageable.",
    "An overview of society in 16th and 17th century England.",
    "HIST 251 is a solid overview of the social and economic history of early modern England; however, although it covers political history, the speed with which we review the Tudor and Stuart rulers glosses through it rather quickly, and remembering key events from these periods is somewhat difficult. That said, you have great freedom in the essays you write (read: whatever you're interested in) and the final exam is quite fair.",
    "This was a great lecture, focusing mostly on broad social changes of the era. It doesn't delve very deeply into a lot of the big personalities of the era (ex: Shakespeare, Henry VIII, etc), but it does give a very firm foundation for the period. You can write the paper topics on whatever you want, though, which I was very grateful for.",
    "Like most of the History Department's lectures, the professor makes this course as good as it is. Keith Wrightson is a social historian who still respects that individuals do matter in history, and he balances politics with social dynamics very effectively in all of his lectures. A great course with interesting paper topics: what could be better?",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you're interested in the topic. It was wonderful. There is an extensive amount of reading, but you aren't necessarily required to do all of it. Overall, I think it was a pretty decent workload. Also, Professor Wrightson is great. You should make an effort to talk with him outside of lecture.",
    "This was an interesting class. As a social history, do not expect to study the battle plans for the Spanish Armada. But the sotries were interesting and the work was not heavy.",
    "Yes. Early Modern England is an interesting class with a great professor and a very manageable workload.",
    "Yes, take this course if you are looking for an easy fifth class or just a nice, interesting history class. The workload is not heavy, and not really necessary to complete if you are in a crunch. Professor Wrightson is also a wonderful professor that you will learn to look at with appreciation and a great amount of respect at the end of the course.",
    "Great survey course in Early Modern England. Professor Wrightson is an entertaining lecturer and the material is great. Lots of reading if you do it all.",
    "This was a great class about the formative years of England, which is also important for understanding the founding of the United States. Professor Wrightson was a great lecturer who presented the material in an organized fashion, with much analysis. You will be able to learn about both the social history and political history of the time.The class has about 150 pages of reading every week. The two essays are not bad and will give you practice writing a good history paper. Plus, the final is not that hard.I would recommend the class to students who are interested in the time period, though be warned the course has a lot of social history (which prevents a clear understanding the political events of the time).Also, I would suggest approaching Professor Wrightson if you have any questions about the material. He is a caring guy (e.g. he led a section my year) and will be more than happy to help you with a paper of yours.",
    "Absolutely; this is an incredibly good course. Professor Wrightson converted me to a History major without actively trying to do so, and he gave me a respect for social history, which I had not had before. Sit in on onelecture and you'll be hooked; this is the sort of lecture you expected when you came to Yale.Take advantage of the opportunities for research provided by the papers. All of the recommended topics are worth looking into, but I can tell you from experience that if something particular captures your interest in the readings - go for it. On that note, do the reading and go to lecture; you'll get out of this class in proportion to what you put in.",
    "A very good class, but perhaps only worthwhile if one is interested in the period (or at least some specific dimensions of it). Professor Wrightson's lectures were impeccably organized, and he delivered them with quiet passion, British charm and (occasionally) wry wit. But the lectures were a bit inconsistent: the classes on social and economic history were fascinating, but the classes on politics and war sometimes seemed more blow-by-blow timelines than sophisticated narratives. I would suggest that the balance of course topics be tilted more toward the social history--obviously what Wrightson is most passionate about.The readings tend to be dry but can be worthwhile.",
    "Good class, take it.",
    "Yes! it is not too much work and professor Wrightson makes the subject matter very interesting. It is not difficult information to understand and it is presented really well.",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend this class unless you're very interested in the subject matter.",
    "I think this is a great course to round out one's schedule. It has a relatively easy workload, while also covering some pretty neat material.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. The reading isn't too stressful, and you can write about anything you want for the two papers and final, so you can really tailor the class to your own interests and learn more about the things you like most (political history, social history, etc.) The two papers are 5 and 10 pages, and for the final you pick 2 out of 20 essay topics (and many of them are similar to the paper topics). My TA, Lucy, gave good feedback on my writing. Also, it's great to take a class from a professor who is a leading expert on the subject.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! The time period studied is fascinating and the teacher and TFs are all very well informed on the subject which makes them great resources. Its an amazing history class with balanced readings and assignments. The final is also very fair.",
    "The format is pretty good, but it wont rock your socks.",
    "Early Modern England covers a broad scope of British history from the War of the Roses through the early 18th Century. Special attention is paid to social and economic conditions during the era, especially the roles in society of women and the poor.The material is thoroughly interesting, even if one is not a particular fan of British history. Prof. Wrightson is an engaging lecturer, and the sections are more helpful than most in gaining a solid understanding of the readings.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "A solid lecture course that provides an interesting overview of early modern English history. Wrightson is a great lecturer who really knows his stuff, so class meetings tend to be engaging. I'd definitely recommend the class to fellow students."
