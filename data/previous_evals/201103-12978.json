    "A great spanish teacher and a class not too overbearing but with a good amount of homework but easily done in 15-30 minutes a night.",
    "Its intense but I think the world load is manageable.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn Spanish. I took this as senior when I had already fulfilled my language requirement and thought it was lots of fun. If you are going to take this class, I'd definitely recommend it with Professor Lomask. She's clear and easy to understand, and she's also the nicest person ever, so speaking Spanish in class is never scary. It's not very much work either. You'll have a bit of homework each night, but unless I was studying for a test or oral exam I don't think the homework ever took longer than a half hour.",
    "I would describe it as an introductory level language corse that proved to still be quite challenging. I would recommend it to anyone looking to learn a new language.",
    "Take it with laurie!!! trust me",
    "Yes, I would recommend it because one will learn a lot about the language, which can be very useful in life.",
    "This is a great course. Not difficult to handle and enjoyable as well. And I learned more Spanish than I thought I would. It is designed in a nice, effective way. Plus, as far as I've heard, all of the teachers are amazing, so if you want to learn Spanish, definitely take it."
