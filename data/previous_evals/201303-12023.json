    "Amazing seminar. Top-notch professor. Engaging peers and an unrivaled reading list. These are the issues we come to college to think about, and it's an honor to have someone like Professor Huyssen, who will clearly contribute volume and expertise to American labor and class history, guide the way.",
    "A truly excellently structured, highly thought-provoking course! I really enjoyed it and feel like I learned a ton! This class literally changed the way I see many things, including the populists, the New Deal, public schools, and especially universities. Most of the readings were amazing, and, when they weren't, Prof. Huyssen would acknowledge it even before we would complain, so I am confident he will change those in the future. The essay allowed us the opportunity to look at pretty much anything we wanted in an intense way. Prof. Huyssen genuinely cares and is a very nice guy, though at times he can be quite intense. A really inventive, innovative class. So good!",
    "Covers a new kind of reform (going chronologically) every week, which keeps things fresh but also makes the class feel a little bit disconnected from week to week - yes, we kept coming back to the idea of the \"politics of reform,\" but we talked about topics as disparate as labor reform in the 1890s, new conservatism in the 1950s and 60s and education policy in the 2000s. Sort of a grab bag, but an interesting one. If you get bored talking about one specific thing in a seminar for an entire semester, this would probably be a good choice for you. Standard amount of work for a history junior seminar - 200-250pages of reading a week, a 5-6 page paper, and an open-ended 20-22 pager at the end.",
    "Definitely take it. Professor Huyssen is the best. You'll learn lots, and be engaged\/interested\/having fun the entire time.",
    "It's a good class that gives you an overview of several interesting reform movements in the U.S. Professor Huyssen is extremely nice and he keeps class fun, but productive.",
    "The course looks at major social and legislative movements in the Progressive Era to the present. As a whole, this course focuses on reform itself - from the definition of reform and politics and looking at it from a critical lens. The subject matter is extremely interesting if you like the Progressive Era, politics, and reform, of course. However, if Prof. Huyssen teaches it again by any chance, DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",
    "I found some of the readings too theoretical and, frankly, not very interesting. To really feel like this course is worth the time, you have to be willing to schlep through hundreds of pages a week. Also, if you're thinking about taking this course to better understand how we bring about reform today, look somewhere else. This course is mostly about the past (although Huyssen does try at times to bring in contemporary analogies) and about the theoretical framework and structure in which reforms are occurring. In other words, in our intellectual ponderings, the class seemed very removed from the urgency of the issues themselves."
