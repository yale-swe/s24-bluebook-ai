   "comments": [
    "Yes, a great alternative to 115. You get to use your notebooks on exams because prof. Frame is \"not interested in seeing how much you can memorize, but rather in how you can apply knowledge.\" Prof. Frame is also just so kind, warm, encouraging, and available.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, if anything just to have Frame as a professor! I'm not pre-med or a biology major but I didn't like calc 120 or 115 because of the way they were taught, so this was an interesting alternative to either of those. I'm not sure how this will affect future math classes but I think we've covered all of the same material but with complicated applications.",
    "If your looking to get your math requirement knocked out, take this course, you won't regret it. Be prepared to work, but you'll come out having learned so much.",
    "If you need a math credit, especially for pre-med, take this class! First of all, it's really nice that you don't have to spend hundreds of dollars on a textbook, because Professor Frame wrote his own course notes that are online. Second of all, Professor Frame is a great lecturer. He explains everything very clearly, and his jokes halfway through class are a great way to break up the session. Third of all, Professor Frame is very accessible. If you take this class, go to his office hours before the PSET is due, because he will help you with anything you don't understand. But one of the most awesome things about this class is that you get to use your notes on the midterm and the final! So as long as you take good notes all semester, you really don't have an excuse to get anything less than a B.Seriously, take this class!",
    "Great alternative to Math 115. Good class size. Frame is an awesome teacher to have. Psets each week, a mid-term, and final (both open notes). Very doable. Yes I would recommend.",
    "Michael Frame is SUCH a sweetheart. He's so genuinely nice, and was a pleasure to learn from. And he tells jokes! The material isn't the most interesting, partially because it is so easy. This class is so easy. It's basic calculus (we spend a few weeks relearning u-sub...) with lots of basic differential equations applications, tossed with some more-or-less random biological applications--the best premed mix for an easy math class. Kind of wish I had learned more substantial stuff this semester. Frame gives away answers at office hours, and tests are open note. But honestly, this class reaffirmed my confidence in my admission to Yale. And my conviction that premeds really are not smart creatures.",
    "A great course, with a wonderful professor. Professor Frame is hilarious, helpful and clearly cares about both the material and his students very much. The material of the course is a bit scattered, but always interesting, and the applications of the math gave me a new appreciation for the concepts.",
    "Mathematics 116 is a course that allows one to view biology through a mathematical lens. It is an interesting way to learn math, although it does not force one to memorize things such as integration rules, or any of the theorems that people learn in math 115. As a result, this is a fun class to take, but it is all applications and models, not so much solving equations and integrating. As a result, I would recommend it to another student, but only if that student was not going to go on to a very advanced calculus class the next semester because he or she might not feel grounded enough.",
    "Great class if you're looking to fulfill a math credit as a pre-med. Great class in general for non pre-med students too. The professor is both a great lecturer (clear voice, legible writing, great pace) but is funny and approachable. Take advantage of office hours for homework, which are (necessarily) more challenging than class examples. The tests are open-note and he never looks to deny you a bettergrade just because he can.",
    "This course is reasonable. There are some concepts that you would worry you would not quite understand, but overall the work is manageable. There's weekly psets and 1 midterm and 1 finals. The professor cares more that you know how to apply your knowledge rather than memorizing random equations. Take this class over MATH 115!!!",
    "This was an interesting and fun class. It taught me that calculus can be fun and applied to biology. Michael Frame was an amazing teacher and such a helpful professor! The problem sets took a long time to complete.",
    "Math 116 is a fantastic course, take it if possible. The material is very interesting and Professor Frame is a fantastic instructor. A great alternative to 115.",
    "A fantastic course in mathematics with a great professor. It will change the way you define what math is.",
    "If you're pre-med and need to fulfill a math requirement, Math 116 is a good way to do that, only if you've taken calculus in high school. Some of the topics covered are pretty complex, and can be very difficult to understand, so you have to be willing to put in the work to understand it. Also, Michael Frame is a legend, an amazing professor who knows what he's doing and is willing to be patient with his students.",
    "It is a really great alternative to Math 115 or Math 120 and especially good for those who are interested in taking the pre-med route. A really well taught class and truly enjoyed it.",
    "This class was excellent. Michael Frame is an excellent teacher, who actually understands how students learn and think and takes this into account when teaching. It was wonderful to have a class that applied typical second semester calculus to concrete, real-world examples, exactly what I was looking for to escape the drudgeries of typical calculus classes (I was torn between Math 115 and this class: enough said, take this class, especially if it's been a few semesters since you have had a calculus class).Prof. Frame is possibly one of the best the teachers I have had. Not only does he actually understand how students learn and think and then takes this into account with teaching, he also strives to have his students be excited about the material they are learning. In addition to that, he tells jokes midway during each class to lighten the mood and let us think about \"something other than math.\" But what I think I appreciated the most were the small lessons about life I learned from him during office hours and the like. I can't imagine the situation he is in now but being so open about his frustrations definitely put many of my worries into perspective. Prof. Frame is one of those few professors that makes his students want to learn for the sheer enjoyment of it.P-sets were fair (although the graders often mis-graded and\/or were arbitrary in their grading), midterm was just like his practice ones, as was the final. I think beyond a good Math class, you get a bit of perspective on life so I would say, yes, take this course.",
    "MATH 116 is definitely an... \"interesting\" course. I WILL say it's different from the standard calculus most have come to love or hate.It's important, though, to separate the course from the professor. Professor Frame is wonderful, and is usually clear. He has worked with Mandelbrot for several years before and is brilliant.He's been able to outlive his metastatic cancer and Alzheimer's for more years than what a miracle would entail already. He's such a sweet man, much like a very sweet grandpa or uncle. He tells jokes from the website Garrison-Keeler @ prairiehome.org during EVERY class.So all in all, he himself is a great professor.In terms of the actual content of the course, that's a different story.The course is grounded in biological applications. However, almost all of the applications are completely esoteric and irrelevant to most premeds and doctors.No doctor that you go see when you have a bad fever and need an antipyretic and analgesic like acetaminophen or acetylsalicylic acid will go to a dark backroom and calculate voltages of your heart's sinoatrial node through convoluted graphical iteration. Nor would he\/she go into his office, taking out a piece of paper from his desk, and calculate the chances of a random population of people getting the flu, and then multiply that fraction by the chances that a person has a suppressed immune system, and then give you a percentage that will tell YOU, the patient, the chances that your symptoms are because you have the flu.In essence, there really is not pragmatic use for the information you learn in this class. It won't help you with the MCATs, it won't help you when you become a dermatologist, or pediatrician, or surgeon, or researcher. The information is only good as a theoretical brain stimulator.However, professor Frame is really good at teaching it, he gives plenty of practice midterms and practice finals for students, and ALL EXAMS ARE OPEN BOOK...which is great.He's marvelous, but I don't believe he'll be teaching this course ever again in the history of Yale University because of his illness, which may cause him to stop teaching by this year's end. We shall all miss him...especially me, who went to each and every office hours of his and got to speak to him and get to know him.But I would STILL recommend that you take this course, just because it takes an interesting spin on calculus. Although I will warn you: this class is still quite challenging. Stick with it, even if it seems impossible at the beginning--it may very well be worthwhile.",
    "Yes, please take it if you like math (calc) and want a challenge but not Math 115.",
    "I definitely recommend this class to any student who is looking for an alternative to the math 115 class.",
    "Yes, definitely! Math 116 is a great course, very informative and interesting, and a chance to learn under Professor Frame, one of the universities best teachers.",
    "Take this if you are pre med and need calc. Frame is fantastic, and the course is actually fascinating and great and interesting. Calculus is made super relevant to biological sciences, which I never could've expected.",
    "The lecture can be a bit much at times but if you go through your notes after and go to Frame when you have questions then the material is totally manageable! I would definitely recommend this class!"
