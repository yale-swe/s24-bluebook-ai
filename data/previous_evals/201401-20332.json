   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely reccommend this class to another student. Islam and Modernity is a great freshman seminar. Though I don't have too much seminar experience, it wasn't a ridiculous amount of work (though more than a big lecture class) and Professor Griffel is wonderful. I think the course's topic is increedibly relevant today and fascinating, and I may have learned the most in this class out of all my classes.",
    "Wonderful, informative freshman seminar. It really is a great opportunity to be able to learn with Griffel. He's knowledgable and he cares about your work. Sometimes grading seemed a bit arbitrary, but that's the way essays go. I would recommend the class strongly.",
    "It is the perfect way to expand your cultural horizons and learn a lot about something that seems very esoteric to the West. I would recommend this course--especially as a choice amongst the other freshman seminars.",
    "MMES 050 is an introduction to Islamic authors and other scholars on Islamic history, values, ideals, etc. It provides a new perspective on different issues in contemporary Islam and in the development of Islam that Yale students, especially non-Muslim students, have probably not read about or understood before. The class consists of 80-120 pages of reading per week, sometimes less, but it is all interesting. I would recommend this class because it provides freshman to understand seminar-style classrooms and provides you with a professor that is willing to take the time to talk about your research papers and explain the texts.",
    "Definitely take this class. You will learn so much. Workload depends on you really: you can choose to do all the readings closely or, like me, skim them in half an hour before class. What really matters is how critically you can think about the discussion that happens in the class based on the readings.",
    "This course's syllabus features a great range of primary texts that represent both modern and fundamentalist Islamic thinkers' reactions to Western presence in the Middle East. With this, students become very familiar with writers such as Sayyid Ahmad Khan and Sayyid Qutb. I was surprised by the narrower focus of the course, which I felt focused primarily on the ramifications of Imperialism, as I had expected a broader, more philosophical discussion of Islam's status in the contemporary world. But the focus on writers' experiences and beliefs led to a more detailed grasp of Muslim's reactions to Western presence. Class discussions were good, and Professor Griffel came with a set of points to review which lent to an ordered progression to the discussion. Although a prior knowledge of Islam was not required, I imagine it would be useful in forming personal opinions. Because you will be reading another person's interpretation of Islamic texts, it would be useful to enter the class with a previous awareness of what is being evaluated. The workload of the course is light, with only four 500 word essays and an end of term research paper. While I liked the freedom afforded by the paper, I did find the openness of the assignment a bit overwhelming. I do feel as though, given the ordered, methodical presentation of information in the course, the style might be more suited to an examination than a paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student. Honestly any student could benefit from it. Also it's very good for improving your writing."
