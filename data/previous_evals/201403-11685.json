    "This is a fabulous class! Professor Thomasson is a gem - a professional screenwriter yet a tremendous educator. I have never felt so cared for by a professor. You're familiarized with canonical works & screenwriting tools (not rules!), while working on the beginning of an original, full-length screenplay. It's really meaningful to see what you learn in class about the craft play out on the screen. The work you're expected to produce is totally reasonable, & Professor Thomasson organizes group sessions in class as well as several one-on-one meetings outside of class to make sure you're on track. Everyone explores their own themes, genres, hearts in conflict with themselves. This is not a traditional workshop: we never read each other's writing, we don't have that opportunity to criticize each other; we aren't pretentious; & we don't stay in our seats. It's a flexible space for creative learning & growing. There should be more classes like this at Yale.",
    "Take this class, I guarantee you will love it.",
    "A great intro into screenwriting. All of my classmates left feeling like we wanted to write more and finish our screenplays. I would DEFINITELY recommend it.",
    "You will love it. Take it. This class was the highlight of my week every week, The work is manageable and always interesting. There wasn't a single assignment that bored me. The class is designed to get you thinking and seeing the world like a writer. By the end of it, you'll have a new appreciation for the art of film and will think in scenes and images. It's incredible. Take it. Take it. Take it.",
    "Definitely take this class. My favorite at Yale so far. The workload isn't too much but you end up learning so much. Your final piece truly becomes important to you in life - whether you're interested in film or not.",
    "Crazy and fun. Not for the faint of heart, but if you steel yourself to the silly bits you'll come out on the other end glad that you did. This class is equal parts strange exercises and performance, film viewing, and writing workshop: you'll spend a few meetings getting into character and being ridiculous, a few more watching clips with the professor, and a few more actually discussing your written screenplay (15 pages of which are due at the end of the term). Professor Thomasson believes in her students absolutely, and expects the same belief from them.",
    "If you can get into the class, absolutely take it! This shouldn't even be a maybe, just do it. Prof. Thomasson has been one of the best professors I've ever had at Yale. This entire course was like Dead Poets Society. As a science major especially, this class was like a breath of fresh air. You, as a class, bond by doing a rendition of Iphigenia; you learn to get in the head space of your character by learning body language and walking, talking, and acting like them. You have really interesting discussions with each other and with Prof. Thomasson about how story is set up and how story generally works. This is all within a group that is very supportive and non-judgmental which is so important for producing meaningful work. Prof. Thomasson is also one of the most supportive professors I've ever had period. She's willing to meet with you to discuss any point of your screenplay and gives you great feedback so you really know what you should work on. The workload for the class was very relaxed as well, since Prof. Thomasson was always willing to help us out during busy times of the semester. I honestly can't think of a negative point for the class beyond the fact that for the final, you have to write 15 pages. You'll have so many ideas and a better understanding of story that you'll end up wanting to write more and (while of course you can) the semester will seem to go by much too quickly. Again, if you can get it, absolutely take it.",
    "This class was absolutely phenomenal and the highlight of my week every single week. We learned so much about the power of supported yet flexible structure and about writing and storytelling with heart. It almost seemed like too much fun, until I thought about how much I came away with after every class and how Camille pushed me to go further and interrogate every small detail of my story. I am a better writer because of this class. It should absolutely be given again, and I can't imagine anyone other than Camille at the helm. She is brilliant. No matter who you are, take this class.",
    "Best class that I have taken at Yale by far. Stop reading evaluations and apply for this course.",
    "Incredible. But take it if you really care about writing and film.",
    "If you want to learn how to write, to tell stories, or just understand yourself a little better, this class is for you. Seriously. I'm a science major, I don't normally talk like that, but this was one of my all time favorite classes and I feel like I've learned a lot about me, as a person, as a human being. Take this course if it looks at all interesting.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are at all interested in screenwriting. One of the best and funnest classes I have taken at Yale."
