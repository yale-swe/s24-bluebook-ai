   "comments": [
    "A beautiful survey of graph theory and network science. Dan is the most intuitive lecturer I have encountered here. Grade is determined entirely by problem sets with theoretical and experimental components, which are very interesting and thoughtfully constructed. The course was harder than previous reviews suggested, so don't trust these reviews about difficulty either; he mentioned that he will probably make it easier next time. Only elementary linear algebra, combinatorics, and calculus are required as background knowledge, but it does take quite a bit of mathematical maturity to get the most out of the course.",
    "Problem sets are fairly hard and you should know this, but this is an excellent class and you should take it. And when you figure out the problems 1-3 ,4-4, and 6-3 of the universe (see the 2013 course webpage if you want to know what these are), you will have genuinely made yourself a better mathematical problem solver.",
    "If you're lucky enough to be qualified on the rare occasion he teaches this class, THEN TAKE IT! There are no tests (there's no way he could test this material, really), only six problem sets (be warned: they are hard), and his encouragement of collaboration (unlike in Algorithms) introduced me to a bunch of new friends I'd never have met otherwise.",
    "AMTH\/CPSC 462 is a class I would recommend to anyone who is seriously enjoys proofs or is looking to greatly improve their analytical thinking and proof writing skills. The class covers a very broad range of topics, and is therefore shifting gears quite often. The only assignments in this class were 6 problem sets, on average consisting of 3 theoretical questions and one experimental problem. The experimental problems always proved significantly easier than the theoretical - and most could be done with a variety of programming languages and packages. Don't be deceived by the small number of assignments or problems - the work required is intense, but ultimately very rewarding. Professor Spielman started the semester with a disclaimer that he wasn't fully confident on all the material he would cover - but that was his modest way of stating that the course draws from brand new and ongoing research in the field.",
    "Yes, if you like math and programming and have taken a class with Dan before then you will love this. Be prepared to be completely stumped on a good number of problems and to spend a lot of time every other week on the psets.",
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. It was an experience to take the class and struggle through it and meet new friends. The material is very interesting but quite theoretical - don't take it unless you love math",
    "A friend described this class as \u00e2\u0080\u009cclose enough to the cutting edge that everything is still a bit bloody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is a pretty accurate description. Spielman is actively researching Graph Theory and this course is essentially a summary of important Graph Theory research papers, some of which were published only a few years ago. I learnt a number of really cool things, but it was by no means an easy class.",
    "Problem sets every 2 weeks are tough but not absurd, and the lectures are pretty standard. The material from one week to the next might be completely unrelated and the math isn't exactly pretty, though.",
    "Another class Spielman class. Exceptionally well-organized, with broad focus on the analysis of graphs. Some of the applications were very interesting. Definitely harder than algorithms but probably an easier grade curve.",
    "This course covers a ton of topics but not in great depth. If you're the type of person that prefers breadth to depth and are interested in the material, take this class. If you would be frustrated by learning very little about a lot of topics, do not take it. Also if you don't know matlab, it can be tricky.",
    "Course with no exams and really hard problem sets. The topics covered in lectures are really interesting. Take the course if you enjoy the subject and if you are willing to work long hours on challenging math questions.",
    "I would recommend it. The class is very difficult. Nonetheless, you learn quite a great deal.",
    "This class was extremely challenging this year - 50+ people started and we were dow nto 20 by year's end. Of those 20, maybe 60-70% were either graduate students or undergrads taking the class CR\/D\/Fail. This is due to the problem sets (of which there were only 6) being very very difficult. Not \"there are so many questions, this is going to take forever\" difficult, but \"I've been staring at this one problem for 8 hours and have gotten absolutely no where\" difficult. If you're going to take this class, take it with friends, go alone at your own peril. That being said, you do learn some pretty cool, cutting edge material. So my advice is to take this class CR\/Fail, by all means.",
    "This class has a steep learning curve but with the excellent help that is available, it can be surmounted. Both the professors and the TAs were extremely helpful in trying to foster a sense of understanding about the material, and were willing to explain concepts repetitively until students understood them. Furthermore, the material covered in this class is simply beautiful and should definitely be attempted by those that have the prerequisite skills. Grading is very fair so with hard work it is entirely possible to get a great grade. Furthermore, working late into the night with a group of people is an excellent way to foster a sense of friendship with peers. This was definitely one of my favorite aspects of the course."
