   "comments": [
    "I think providing papers to read alongside the lectures would be useful since there is no textbook. I would have liked a more thorough section on experimental methods to study viruses.",
    "The class was great in that we got to hear from experts on different viral families who really had in depth knowledge. I also greatly enjoyed the small size of the class and the encouragement to engage in discussion and questions. I do, however, think the class would benefit greatly from paper discussions. These need not be weekly, as in the other two microbiology courses, however, being able to work through the literature with virologists is an extremely useful skill, especially for graduate students. It allows us to see the potential pitfalls of techniques and learn how to evaluate their validity. I also think that some professors would greatly benefit from trying to fit less into their lectures. While going through 100s of slides in a 90 minute class may be beneficial to undergraduates, the ability to think on our own and ask pertinent questions is vital to the education of graduate students. Plus, the small size of the class allows the PIs to ask questions and actually get responses from the students.",
    "Very interesting and pretty well organized. I think the exams, overall, were fair evaluations of what was learned in class. Could probably benefit from some discussion of primary literature or a little more focus on lab methods to give the level of learning a bit more depth."

    "Yes, I would. I wish it was advertised a little more outside of the bacterial department and to other departments (for example, I was from the EMD department at YSPH, which this course is very relevant for) - could it be cross registered? I think bringing in more people from other fields would enhance discussion as well. In my experience, team taught classes can be disorganized and not very cohesive, but I did not find this the case for this class. The range of professors were great which provided for a very diverse syllabus. There were a few problems where due to profs' schedules, things were in a bit of a weird order, but in the end, I didn't find that to be a problem.",
    "Yeah, it's a great class for both aspiring virologists as well as all microbiology students. I really think that students benefit from learning broadly about different subject matter, which would not occur if one only took the other two microbiology courses.",
    "Yes - anyone with interest in viruses should enjoy this course and I learned a lot!"
