    "It's a gem of a course that brings together an incredibly diverse group of people with different ideas of what the body is and should be used for. I recommend it because it is one of the few classes to build an intellectual community around the coursework: we discuss the readings but also our lives and the intersection of our varying experiences. Moving in class is also a unique experience: it's not theater studies, or dance, or like anything else for that matter.",
