    "This course needs to be 4 credits. I got a lot out of it, but I had to arrange an incomplete in another class because of the workload in this one. All of the extra labwork required for each class project was very helpful--I'm glad this component was incorporated--but there was no warning ahead of time that this was a requirement, or of the extra time commitment involved. There were a few weeks when I was spending 6 hours\/week IN CLASS, in addition to outside reading and working on my independent project. Maybe this is normal for an EEB field\/lab based course, but it was extremely difficult for FES students to juggle.",

   "comments": [
    "Maybe a little better planning of the syllabus to line up with actual due dates. Or adjusting the projects rather than pushing back due dates. It ended up not being as front loaded as supposed to be, which made time management more difficult.",
    "This should be at least a 4 credit course given the workload.",
    "The labs were extremely frustrating at times--it would be helpful to spend some time talking about stats and handling large quantities of data.",
    "Better structure, better explanation of theory behind concepts (or brief reviews, as we are meant to have had this background already, although many people didn't), better explanation of experimental design or sampling before going into the field. More clarity about what exactly is required for each lab write-up.Also, students should be given a clearer picture up front of what kinds of lab analyses are available for the independent projects, what kind of a time commitment they involve, and where they can be done so that students can better plan their time.I reiterate, the course needs to be 4 credits!",
