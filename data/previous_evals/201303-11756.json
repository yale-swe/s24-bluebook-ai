   "comments": [
    "Wouldn't recommend this class as it's currently set up, no \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0all we really did was read a few research papers per class and talk about them, without any useful overarching structure, themes, or even understanding of the quantitative aspects of the papers.",
    "It is an excellent class on empirical political economy. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "yeah, seems like the typical senior seminar.",
    "chill senior seminar. I took it cuz I needed an extra class and thought the syllabus was very compelling",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes--not too time consuming, but very interesting and relevant material. You read the stuff that economists need to know how to read.",
    "Political Economics is a fascinating subject. This course exposes you to many elements about it. If you think in a mathematical way about the incentives and reactions to incentives about various elements of politics, you'll be thrilled with the papers to find that some incredible, rigorous work has formalized interesting ideas. Ruben will help guide you through the tougher to understand papers. This class is based around reading the papers, however, and I wouldn't expect to learn significantly more than if you were able to work through the syllabus on your own.",
    "ECON 486 is a great course for all of you interested in both politics and economics. Prof. Durante is a great teacher and it was truly a pleasure to be in his classroom! The course requires 3 reading responses over the course of the semester, one presentation, and one research proposal (instead of a final paper). The workload was reasonable. The syllabus provided a list of readings for every lecture. We had to choose 3 of them to read every week."
