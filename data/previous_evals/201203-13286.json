   "comments": [
    "Required for BME students. Not enjoyable, graded assignments are completely untaught.",
    "Its required for the BME major, so you have to take it. Lecture is not really related to any of the papers or presentations, but there are a ton of papers and presentations to do. It was interesting to see so many guest lecturers and it was cool to hear about a lot of different BME fields of research, but there was also a deceptively large amount of work to do throughout the semester and a lot of outside of class time scheduling.",
    "Senior seminar for all BENG majors; if you're looking at this you're taking it. It's a pretty easy class but has a lot of busywork. If you're set on a senior project it makes the final project a lot easier. Be prepared to spend a lot of time dozing off in class or cramming to finish a paper but the class is relatively easy overall.",
    "This class is mandatory for BME majors, but it's actually pretty helpful. The guest lecturers present their research to the class, which can help any students who have not yet found a lab for their senior project. The topics were always interesting, but it's still sitting through 2 hours of presentations, so that's a bit tiring. The workload for the class is actually a lot. We had 4 small papers to write (2 pages, single spaced), 2 group presentations, and then this long series of presentations and drafts in preparation for our final paper. And it was mandatory spend time outside of class time to watch other students give presentations, and do peer reviews of papers. A lot of time will be devoted to this class.",
    "If you're in BME, you'll have to take this class. If you're not in BME, stay away from it. There's so much tedious busywork - multiple short papers, long papers, reviews, presentations, that it's not worth it.",
    "The class is required for the major. You get out of the class what you put into it. If you are trying to crank out of the assignments as quickly and with as little effort as possible, you won't get much out of the class.",
    "Good opportunity to get to know a lot of the professors and researchers at Yale, as well as your own peers who you may not know well but who you'll work with closely on a lot of the projects. This class does require a lot of work, as there are a lot of papers and presentations you'll have to produce in addition to the weekly presentations by professors, but you do get a lot of writing and presentation skills out of it.",
    "I recommend.",
    "This class is a lot of busy work, but I have to say that I have become a much better scientific writer, and the opportunity to learn how to write a grant proposal is great preparation. The professor is really great with coordinating and meeting with everyone in the class.",
    "Weekly required seminar for BME majors. Kind of boring, kind of long (like 2.5 hours per week) + all the time you have to put into making the presentations and then going to see the other presentations. Ends up being kind of a time sink. But your writing improves and you get to know the other BME majors quite well.",
    "N\/A since it's mandatory.",
    "This class ended up being a lot more work than I expected without being particularly rewarding. There were 3 presentations, 4 short papers and 1 longer paper, and everything except the final paper seemed like busy work. Class consisted of two one-hour lectures, so it was really hard to pay attention most days, but some were quite interesting and if you don't already have a senior project this would be a great place to find one. Overall, it was relatively painless for an engineering class, and consisted of a lot of pretty easy but tedious work.",
    "If you're shopping this class, you probably have to take it. Just take each assignment seriously and you'll do fine.",
    "You have to take it so just make the most of it and try to learn as much as possible despite the tedious and boring parts."
