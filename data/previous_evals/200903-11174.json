    "This course gave me a firm grasp on the work of the most widely discussed thinker in my sub-field of interest. Very helpful.",
    "This course was extremely important to me, it will allows me to engage Rawls in my future work in political theory. I don't think I will ever be doing pure analytical political philosophy, but it is still incredibly important to be able to be in dialogue with and engage with this material. It's Rawls, afterall."
