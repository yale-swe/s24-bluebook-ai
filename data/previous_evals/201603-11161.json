   "comments": [
    "This was definitely a strong class because there was a great environment that made learning the language enjoyable. I would have liked some more literature but maybe 140 will have more of that.",
    "The class was manageable in terms of pacing and the in class activities were fun and informative. However, by the time the class ended and we began studying for the final, I realized I had forgotten a lot of the things covered in the beginning of the class. I would suggest making the tests and activities more cumulative, to help keep the earlier concepts fresh.",
    "I wish there were less reliance on the textbook and more focus on grammar through reading, as I saw with some of my friends in French L3. Secondly, I wish there was more focus on conversation.",
    "The greatest strength of the course was the welcoming and friendly environment of the classroom, in which did not feel like one was constantly being evaluated for everything one said."

    "It's a wonderful setting to learn\/reinforce italian grammar and still get to watch some movies. What other Yale class can you play Jeopardy in??",
    "I would recommend this class to other students; the pace is manageable and the in class activities are fun and informative.",
    "Yes! Italian is a great department. You will learn a lot. You are probably doing this for the requirements but consider staying on to L4!",
    "Yes, beyond a doubt. The Yale Italian department is fantastic and you won't believe how quickly you make progress.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class for anyone looking to fill a language requirement. It was not too difficult and the only downside is that it meets every day."
