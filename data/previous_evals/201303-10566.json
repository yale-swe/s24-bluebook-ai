    "Yes! Professor Koelle is great and makes the material very understandable and interesting. The weekly quizzes are actually great because they force you to keep up with the material but aren't a ton of pressure every week, especially because you get to drop one.",
    "I would recommend biology 101 it's a good intro to bio chem and phys",
    "I would not recommend it. Super boring and unnecessary except to get to BIOL102 so you can get to BIOL103 and so forth. Only take if you have to.",
    "Although BIOL 101 is not necessarily the most exciting of courses, it provides a good foundation for the rest of the intro bio sequence. I would recommend this course to any student interested in pursuing a biology-related major (it is, after all, a requirement) but I would caution anyone that has had no prior biology experience that the pace may be a bit overwhelming.",
    "This is a very good introductory course to biochemistry. I would recommend it to anyone who has or has not taken biology in high school.",
    "I would not recommend Bio 101. However, it is a required prerequisite for other biology courses, in which case I would tell them that they will unfortunately have to bear it.",
    "I would recommend it for pre-med students who don't need a thorough biology background and want an easy credit.",
    "One of the better if not best bio module",
    "This class reviews a lot of concepts from high school biology, but in a way that's more in depth than most high schools. There's a very protein-heavy focus, and you'll learn a lot about the biochemical drivers behind biology. It's totally a doable course--just make sure to keep up with the homework and the quizzes and you'll be fine.",
    "Only take it if you need to.",
    "I look at this class as a requirement to get to other classes in Biology, and wouldn't recommend it to someone who isn't interested in the field. If you are interested, you don't have much choice.",
    "You may be bored in lectures, but the information is organized and not too hard to learn. The weekly quizzes actually really help when the tests come around the the homework's don't take much time atall. It's not a spectacular class, but all in all it's pretty good.",
    "BIOL 101 is a difficult course. Getting a 5 on AP biology exam will generally give you a grade in the range of a B-A, however, it is extremely difficult to get an A or A- in the course. I you've had no background with AP Bio I would not recommend taking this class.",
    "Biology 101 was a great intro to biophysics and biochemistry. It reviewed some concepts, and went a lot deeper into how molecules work in cells than my high school classes had. Definitely worth taking.",
    "Basic, introductory level course. Manageable and fair.",
    "This is a decent course. It's informative and really solidifies basic biochemistry that you may or may not have learned in high school. Take it if you need bio 101 for premed\/req or to refresh etc. BUT DO NOT TAKE BIO 102 if you don't have to. Try to place out of 102.",
    "Fine intro bio course. If you need it for a requirement, don't worry about it. It's very organized, straightforward presentation of material that's not too bad. You do need to study, but if you put in some time, you'll be totally fine. If you don't need it for a requirement, I wouldn't take it as it isn't exactly captivating material.",
    "I would summarize BIOL 101 as a course that is not for everyone. They need to know that they are going to one day use biology to take this course. It is not for everyone because it was not as captivating as a typical introductory course.",
    "I would recommend this class for any student looking to continue with Biology. The material is clearly presented and quick to learn.",
    "Biology 101 was definitely a struggle for me, even though I took AP Bio (albeit in sophomore year of HS). I had to relearn much of the material, for many things were new. However, if you persistently study very hard, you still may not do so well on the quizzes, but ultimately on the final, you will get a good grade!",
    "Straightforward first concepts approach to biochemistry and biophysics. If you are at all worried about being prepared for a more advanced bio course, you should (and will have to) take the course. Make sure you read the textbook before class so you are familiar with the concepts. And try to go over notes right after lecture because there will be a lot of them. Also go to enrichment if you are having trouble!",
    "I cannot stress enough how amazing this module structure is. Each professor brought in to teach his unit is incredibly passionate about what he does and transmits that energy to the classroomin such a wonderful way\u00e2\u0080\u0094science becomes FUN. If you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t looking for that premed stress factor, please consider CR\/D\/Failing this one!",
    "Good introduction to biology - builds the foundations\/ key ideas that will carry through all the modules. If you've taken AP Biology, most of the material is review.",
    "If you're considering this class, it's probably a mandatory stepping stone to the classes you actually want to take. The material's not particularly difficult, and while the grading on the quizzes feels a bit arbitrary, none of the work was an undue burden. For those who come into this class with AP Bio under their belts, the last few weeks may be novel material, but everything else will probably be some sort of review.",
    "A useless class that you have to take as a requirement. Definitely don't take it for fun...",
    "If you've ever taken AP Bio, you're going to be bored as all hell. The weekly quizzes are still difficult enough to be a pain. Koelle is not the most stimulating lecturer. Section is also very boring, unless you have a decent TA. In summary, the course is both irritating and pointless.",
    "I would say that it is an excellent intro biology course. They really hold your hand every step of the way and don't expect you to have any prior knowledge. However, I would recommend a more specialized science course if you are just looking for a science credit and liked bio in high school. I am pre-med so I had to take this class, but if I had my choice, I would probably take one that wasn't intro and was more focused.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. This is an extremely dense course and if you haven't done AP BIo and you're a freshman, you're going to have a really tough time. The professor knows what hes talking about and the overall framework is pretty well thought out. However, it's too much for a .5 credit course.",
    "Must take this class for BIO majors. Very basic bio concepts are taught in a short span of time.",
    "Yes. BIOL 101 01 is what you would expect for an intro bio course. Everything is very well organized, which makes studying fairly hassle-free.",
    "Decant intro bio course.",
    "Great introductory course!",
    "Very much like AP biology; a lot of material covered, and rather challenging.",
    "Basic intro bio course.",
    "Biology 101 01 is a good foundational biology course.",
    "Biology 101 introduced concepts of biochemistry and biophysics as a part of the next 4 modules. I would recommend this course only if they need it for their major or future courses.",
    "I wouldn't take this class if you're not going to be pre-med or a bio major, because it isn't very interesting.",
    "It's a good class. It gives you a good basic background for biology, and I would recommend the class.",
    "If you're thinking of taking 101, you probably have a good reason to be doing so. I didn't take AP Bio before I took 101, so it was tough for me, but I definitely felt like I learned a lot during the half semester. The weekly quizzes can seem really annoying, but they're actually the best way to study for the final. My best advice would be to find\/make friends in the class or your section and study with them because sometimes (especially if you haven't taken bio since ninth grade) you just can't figure some of this stuff out on your own.",
    "101 is a great intro biology course and Koelle is a good lecturer. His lectures are well organized, with key points he wants you to remember highlighted on his slides. The weekly quizzes are manageable and force you to keep up with the material, which means that you won't have to study too much for the final.",
    "Biology 101 is a decent class but I wouldn't recommend it to people who don't have to take it. It's mostly full of overly ambitious premeds and people who have had a ton of previous biology experience (AP bio, research, etc.)",
    "BIOL 101 is a good intro bio course. Prof Koelle is a very clear and helpful professor, and his slides are very organized and easy to understand. The problem sets are fairly easy, and studying for the weekly quizzes is a good checkpoint to make sure that you understand the material each week. The class is not incredibly engaging, since it's a large lecture, but it's a fair and standard class if you're entering the biological sciences.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it unless you have to take it for premed requirements or your major.",
    "Are you pre-med? Take it, this course was made for you. You unfortunately now have to take the course if you are any type of biology major. Psychology majors can easily avoid this horror story of an introductory sequence by placing out of the 101 module (not difficult) and taking 102 (worth it, in a sense), and then taking another MCDB that can be taken if it only has 101 and\/or 102 as its prereq(s). If you want rudimentary knowledge of biology, take it with a grain of salt.",
    "Biology 101 is a great survey intro biology course. It covers a lot of the key concepts covered in AP Biology in probably less depth (our school didn't have AP Bio so I don't have a comparison). Definitely do the readings in the book (it's not necessary to get the newest version), and LOOK OVER THE SLIDES A LOT. There are weekly quizzes in this course, and if you know the slides really well you will be able to do well on the quizzes, even if you think you're not doing great. I would recommend the course, but remember that it is a decent amount of work outside of class, and be familiar with everything from the lectures.",
    "I would recommend taking Bio 101 because it introduces you to the basics of biology that will be needed for the rest of the other modules. However, the material is uninspiring, and it may sway some students away from the pre-med route.",
    "Very structured, intro to topics in biochem and biophysics. Solid class, easy to follow and know what to study, hence easy to do pretty well in.",
    "BIOL101 was a good introduction to biology I suppose. It is misleading because you think that the material is jut at a basic level but you actually have to know a lot of very small details towards the end. This definitely was not an introductory biology course though, especially just because of the sheer amount of information that must be learned, and how we had to take it further and apply it to design experiments.This class really could be organized better.",
    "Basic intro Bio class. Prof. Koelle's teaching is fine. Take it if you must. Avoid it if it is not necessary.",
    "Gotta take it, straightforward but remember that everyone think so, and the class is graded on a curve so...",
    "Bio 101 is a good class if you want to be a Bio-related Science Major or Pre-Med. If not, I think there are other courses that could be taken that would teach you a more complete picture (i.e. you would not need to take 5 classes to get the big picture)",
    "This is a fairly straightforward intro bio class. Great for anyone who is pre-med\/a bio major.",
    "so much better than when it was divided into two semesters! great organizing. if you're looking to take bio, chem, and physics, I strongly recommend you take bio last. physics and chemistry background comes in very handy.",
    "This is a basic biology class, a repeat of information from AP Biology in high school. The information is synthesized in an HIV example, which shows students how to apply the information learned in class. Even students without a background in biology should be able to fairly quickly pick up the information, especially as they are held accountable for the previous two lectures in weekly quizzes.",
    "Biology 101 covers many topics covered by the AP Biology sequence. However, I believe that while it may be \"tedious\" to take, it gives one a strong foundation needed to tackle Biology 102. Many of the experimental methods, and basic processes we discussed in 101 came back with more in-depth explanation in 102. I really enjoyed 102, and think that without 101, I would not have been as successful.",
    "A standard introduction to biology as it occurs at the molecular and atomic level. (Not really biochemistry since topics concerning organic chemistry are avoided because it is an introductory course.)",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. Stay on top of the material for the quizzes and you'll learn a lot.",
    "A required class for lots of people, so it's possible that you'll have to take it regardless of the reviews. If you don't have to take it, I would actually recommend going for it anyway -- Koelle is an excellent lecturer, and he provides a great overview of introductory topics in biology. It's rare to find a professor as dedicated to teaching as he is. I wouldn't pass this one up.",
    "I took Bio 101 and 102 as a Sophomore in the Fall of 2013. I didn't take AP biology in high school and I am not pre-med. This course is very difficult for an intro-level class, and I have some tips for any student who is in a similar situation as I was.Bio 101 is excellent. Biophysics and Biochemistry. The lectures are very straight forward and the study guides given out by professor Koelle are concise, and understandable. There are weekly quizzes, and they force you to keep up on the material throughout the course. There are 5 quizzes (maybe 6, I can't remember) and a Final. Section is pretty chill in 101 and you just reinforce topics that were covered in lecture. 101 lasts about 6 weeks, and then 102 starts after your 101 Final.Biology 102 was a nightmare. You change professors halfway through the term (Koelle to Mooseker). There are no weekly quizzes in 102, instead there is a midterm and a Final. Section gets much more difficult. You read fundamental\/breakthrough Cell Biology papers to prepare, and then you must answer questions about the paper during section. In 102 you are graded on section participation. Mooseker's organization on Classes v2 is horrendous. Instead of labeling each lecture as a different lecture (lecture 1, lecture 2, lecture 3, etc.), Mooseker combines lectures into units, so Unit 1 might have 3.5 lectures in it. He also adds and changes slides after he uploads them to Classes v2, so the students slides are different than his lecture slides. His lecture outlines are not clear, and they're much harder to understand than Koelle's outlines. Mooseker mumbles somewhat, and his sentences die off at the end so it's hard to understand. All in all, it's a messy, confusing and frustrating system of organization that takes away from the class.My advice for a student taking this class:Read the textbook before each lecture. Seriously, it's worth it. Readings took me about 2-3 hours for 35-40 pages. It sucks, but it'sso helpful. The next day in class, you take away so much more from the lecture and it pays off.Sign up for Enrichment. Surjit is the crown jewel of the Intro Bio Modules. Each week she holds an extra review session and you can ask her to re-explain topics that Koelle or Mooseker didn't cover completely, or went to quickly over.Take notes on your computer. Koelle recommends you print out the slides and write notes on them, but it's much more efficient to type your notes on the slides, you can type more quickly than you can hand-write. Mooseker adds and changes slides all the time, so it's easier to download the new slides than it is to print them out.Get a study group. Find some smart premeds who can help you on the Problem Sets.In sum, Bio 101 and 102 are good classes and I recommend them to anyone interested in Biology. But be careful, the material can get out of hand, and the don't count on 102's structure\/organization to be as good as 101.",
    "Biology 101 is a good course.",
    "BIOL 101 is your standard, run-of-the-mill introductory biology survey course. The module covers a lot of topics in shallow depth. The problem sets are relatively straight forward and do not require too much critical thinking. The quizzes and exams are reasonable, although the grading seems to be based on keyword regurgitation\/memorization rather than applying lecture concepts to a novel question. If you tested out of BIOL 101 there is definitely no reason to take it again. If you feel like you are well versed in Biology or did well on AP Biology there is really no reason to take this module. The module is not difficult but the class is generally filled with premed students who will try very hard to outcompete each other, making scores high and it very easy to drop a letter grade.",
    "Bio 101 was a very well designed and well taught course. THe material was difficult and fast-paced, but there were always resources available for enrichment and help if needed. The sections were really cool because we were able to read and understand real research papers, something that gave context and relevance to whatever we were studying at the time. I would recommend the course if you are interested in Biology, even if you aren't looking to be Pre-med or a Bio major but just want a real science course.",
    "Professor Koelle is very organized and, though at first the material may seem too dense, it is actually very accessible even to people who haven't taken biology before. I would recommend attending enrichment section if you are worried about doing well because you don't feel prepared. The quizzes seem like a pain at first, but they actually help a lot. Studying for a quiz every week made studying for the final a lot easier.",
    "The syllabus is very accurate to the reality of the course. It was a great introduction to the fundamental concepts of biophysics and biochemistry. If you haven't taken AP Bio or something equivalent, it will seem overwhelming, take advantage of the enrichment offered and talk to your classmates. I can't emphasize enough how important it is engage with your peers outside the classroom about the concepts you go over in lecture.",
    "I would recommend BIO 101 to another student. It's a good class to get acquainted with the basics of biochemistry if you've never had a biology course before, and it's also challenging enough to satisfy those who've had lots of experience with biology. You're allowed to drop a quiz and a problem set which is very helpful and Professor Koelle is an amazing lecturer. The grading on the homework and quizzes can be a bit nitpicky, but hopefully they'll change next year. There's also plenty of resources available for those who need extra help (such as Piazza and enrichment sessions) and those who want more (the enrichment II sessions). The AIDS unit at the end was also very very eye opening and really, for me, beautifully integrated all the important subjects of biochemistry that we studied into one very important real life application. Take it, it's worth your time.",
    "Biol 101 was a challenging introduction into basic concepts on biology. It is definitely helpful if you have a solid understanding of high school biology and\/or have excelled in AP Biology. If not, however, take advantage of Enrichment! This course offers several resources to succeed, and Professor Koelle is an articulate lecturer. I would it recommend to any student who is considering majoring in the sciences.",
    "Great class--you learn so much that is needed for working in Bio wet labs at the Medical School--you'll start to understand the concepts in these labs and realize just how important this class is to your continued studies of biology\/research\/medicine.Don't skip it--it's really good. The Professor is AMAZING!Tests are kinda hard though...",
    "If you're considering Bio 101, you probably need it for a major requirement, so take it. It's really not that bad, and actually can be pretty enjoyable. Oddly enough, after 4+ years of nottaking bio, it re-sparked my love for biology. As for other modules in this sequence, I cannot say the same, but Bio 102 is a good course.",
    "A condescended version of AP Bio where no relevant background information is given, and the information is presented in an illogical, haphazard order.",
    "Bio 101 is a pretty typical introductory science course. Huge lecture, lots of memorization, but generally interesting material. Take it if you need a foundation for the study of biology.",
    "I wouldn't recommend Biology 101 to another student if they have already taken AP Biology, but if they haven't placed out of the module and they are required to take the class because of pre-med or Biology major requirements, it isn't really a matter of choice.I didn't find the class particularly engaging in the way that it was taught. My AP Biology class was spectacular; my teacher was engaging, it was taught with only 27 kids in the class, and we did not use powerpoints. Instead, my teacher wrote on the board, drew pictures, and kept us engaged.Biology 101 can't possible offer you this experience. For some reason, the Biology departments don't want to teach this class like a math class (with many sections in a seminar-style) which makes it really difficult for students to stay engaged. I personally don't find powerpoints loaded with small font words a very compelling way to present information, but if you do, this class is probably a good fit for you.",
    "If you have taken AP this class is easy, if you havent' it looks like you might have to put in a lot more work. Interesting and organized and not overly work intensive.",
    "The epitome of why Yale fails at Science.",
    "It's required for a lot of things, so you probably don't have a choice.",
    "Take it if you have to. If you don't, save yourself the trouble. You're going to think the course is bad, but BIOL 102 is going to make this look like heaven. I would say BIOL 101 is an okay course. Basically a review of AP\/IB bio. There are weekly quizzes. Professor Koelle is okay. His notes are helpful, he's easy to understand if you focus. Would I recommend this course? Not at all. But if you have to take it, you have no other option. Just take advantage of the easy material before 102 hits.",
    "Biology 101 was not the most interesting course, but there is much more to expect from an introductory biology course. While I cannot enthusiastically recommend it to another student, it's pretty much a requirement formost biology-related fields so there's no getting around it. The course emphasizes the bare minimum amount of key concepts, but if you do the readings you will be able to learn more detailed and interesting things. Also, the grading was very picky, and it seemed like they were sometimes grading just so they could force the grades into a distribution.",
    "The difficulty of this module has less to do with the subject and topics in the class (since Prof Koelle does a fantastic job lecturing on the material) and more to do with the precision the graders are expecting in your quizzes\/homework\/exams.",
    "Only take it if you have to. I wasn't required to take it but I thought it would be good background info for my major- poor choice, not worth it.",
    "If you have to take it, do it. If not, then it will be fine for you",
    "YEs",
    "I did not enjoy Biology 101 in part because of Professor Keolle's lecturing style, and also because the subject matter of this module was the least compelling for me.",
    "Tough class, but necessary information to learn in order to understand greater concepts in biology. The quizzes were great in terms of making us stay on top of the information, but they were graded far too harshly.",
    "You have to take it anyways, but I'll just say they really improved things from last year.",
    "I would recommend Bio 101 to another student. Koelle teaches things very straight forwardly, and the course is simple if you have taken AP Bio.",
    "Probably too hard to take for fun",
    "BIOL 101 is the first course of the BIOL introductory sequence. Although the overall course is 'introductory' even 101 seems to assume some prior knowledge. Professor Koelle provides great resources to study from and makes it very clear what it is to be studied.",
    "I would recommend Biology 101 to anyone simply because I find the material extremely interesting, particularly because it delves into what's behind the way the body functions.",
    "This class is actually a really interesting course. Prof Koelle structures it in such a way that the material is easily digestible. Recommend taking this class (even if you're not pre-med). The grading is also pretty fair.",
    "I would recommend it to students using this course for their major. Otherwise, I think the student would be unnecessarily stressed and would be better off taking a lighter bio course.",
    "No. Don't take this class. It is painful.",
    "A good course. If you took AP biology, you'll be fine. Just do the readings and look over lecture slides for the weekly quizzes (every Wednesday) and the final. Everyone is a crazy pre-med\/science major so there is the problem of having a very high average on most of the assessments. Very manageable course though. You can take this course with 2\/3 other Sc\/QR and still do very well.",
    "Would recommend, well taught",
    "It's not a bad course, but it's hard. You learn a lot, but it's hard. I had AP Bio and AP Chem, and I still thought it was hard. You learn a ton about the experimental methods, though, which I think is helpful in the long run.",
    "No one is taking this for fun -- you gotta take it.",
    "You pretty much have to take it if you're premed, but it's a great class with a thorough introduction to biology; very helpful for people with little\/no background in the subject.",
    "Definitely recommend for bio\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you will learn A LOT",
    "Bio 101 is a great introduction to basic biology, and for students who have taken AP or IB Bio in high school, it seemed to be a breeze. For those who did not, join the enrichment section!! It is extremely helpful. Overall, I would recommend this course, although it probably should be semester long rather than only half a semester.",
    "Slide 1, slide 2, slide 344, etc.",
    "If you go to class and keep up on materials, you can do well in this class. The content is very similar to ap bio, so expect it to be easier if you have that background",
    "Yes - if you are interested in the material and need to take this course, it's actually kinda cool!",
    "It is a good class for students who are interested in science or biology.",
    "Solid intro bio class. Take it because you have to. No real complaints; it's not that hard. Koelle's lectures are pretty straightforward and the exams and HWs aren't too hard, although they're graded in a somewhat picky manner. The weekly quizzes are pretty tough.",
    "Bio 101 is a fairly boring but not overly painful course. Definitely take if you are considering a Bio major, but probably don't take if you are just looking for a science credit.",
    "BIOL 101 is an okay class. The material learned is relatively interesting and professor Koelle is a good lecturer. The grading can often be too harsh (unnecessarily so). The final exam was much better than the weekly quizzes. The homework was fair but sometimes repetitive and tedious.",
    "I would recommend Biology 101 01 to another student because it's a good intro to biology and the instructors made the material easy to understand.",
    "Not super interesting, but not too hard either. The problem sets are short. I definitely recommend working off of the lecture slides for tests. I didn't use the textbook at all.",
    "A good course about an overview of general biology.",
    "Recommended, if you like Biology. The professor is good.",
    "Bio 101 is a general overview of the basic functions (proteins synthesis, DNA replication) and structures of biology. I would recommend this class to another student if they enjoy studying biological processes.",
    "Biology 101 is a useful general review of biological concepts. It is a traditional science class and there's not much else to it.",
    "Professor Koelle's lectures are really well organized and engaging, which is great for this first module in the sequence. The quizzes make you keep up with the information you should be learning, and the lecture slides are straightforward to study from, especially if you annotate them with good notes from lecture.",
    "It's a well organized survey course of biochem, I recommend it especially if you're planning on taking MB&B 300. Koelle is a GREAT lecturer and very well organized.",
    "Biology 101 is a very basic introduction to biochemistry and biophysics. If you have taken AP Bio or another high school biology course, it will mostly be a review. The class is extremely organized and quite easy to follow, but it is also pretty boring (class mostly consists of reviewing exactly what is already written on the powerpoint slides). The grading is fair, though, and the workload is manageable.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Bio 101. It is a good introductory course for biology without being simplified or slow. I would say that it is a serious science course, and should only be taken if you have a genuine interest in the subject.",
    "Intro bio class; pretty much what you'd expect. Study the slides and the study guides and you'll do fine.",
    "Standard introductory biochem\/biophys course with a clear instructor and syllabus. Will solidify your understanding of biology even if you arean advanced student and ground it in a more logical framework than is typical for the science. Take it for major\/pre-professional requirements or if you love biology.",
    "I would only recommend Bio 101 if a student can't place out of it. The quality of the lecture and section just doesn't match up to the quality of the lectures and sections of Bio 102. So if you already know the material, just place out! Start with Bio 102.",
    "As aforementioned, I would recommend this course to a fellow student, but I would go to lengths to ensure that the student understands the rigor and necessary time commitment that go with this course. This course is much more difficult than other introductory classes that I've taken at Yale. It's perhaps best to not even think of it as an intro class, but rather as a higher-level biology course.",
    "The class is great, but beware of the way the grade the quizes and exams. You may be forced to memorize rather than understand. Sometimes memorization leads to understanding but not all the time. Seriously spend the time to learn every single powerpoint page. Practice summarizing processes and systems with as few sentences as you can as study---but also as preparation for the answers you'll have to write on the tests. These answers have to be as concise and short as possible. It's very frustrating.But, overall great course.",
    "If they want to major in science, or like it then i would recommend it. If not then no.",
    "I actually really enjoyed it! The material is not something that really is central to what I'm interested in, but the structure and professors could not have been better!"
