   "comments": [
    "The readings are great, and not time-consuming. The class consists of five essays, each with one rewrite. Basically it's discussing the essays in class with other students. Professor Hopkins helps steering the conversation towards key points in each of the readings, and provides key context when the reading needs it. He is also great at conveying his interest and giving tools to students to start thinking critically about the essays right from the beginning.",
    "Good class to push your writing outside of the boundaries of purely academic writing. I wouldn't say this course is in any way essential to having a liberal arts experience, as some Yalies have said before. It is a good class, but if you've had a solid creative non fiction writing class before I don't think you'll get all that much out of this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student! Literary nonfiction is a super interesting genre so you learn a lot just from the readings. Expect to spend several hours on each essay though; it was difficult for me to figure out exactly how to revise my essays in order to convey my point more clearly.",
    "Challenges you to learn and write different in different styles and topics. Very interesting. Good readings for the course.",
    "English 120 is a course dedicated to literary nonfiction, a genre that emerged in the 20th century and evolved through movements like the New Journalism. The class is separated into units, and you write an essay for each one. Essays are not very long, but they are graded very harshly. Workshops are helpful, but not fantastic. They lagged at times. 120 reading never took longer than an hour--you're basically reading the New Yorker for homework. Readings were always enjoyable.",
    "An AP-language class with very minimal work and a good classroom experience.",
    "Great course. You learn writing skills that you will use for the rest of your life. Definitely a must take at Yale. If you want a fun and not stressful section, sign up with Professor Hopkins. Each section has a similar work load but I think the organization and spacing of his essays made the course really easy to do the work for.",
    "ENGL 120 is a good introductory class to writing narrative nonfiction. Depending on professor, it can be an easy writing credit, or a strenuous writing crash course, so shop around and know what you want from the class.",
    "It was ok. Some of the writing topics are fun, such as culture and satire, but it's difficult to get a good grade.",
    "The class is organized into five units, each with a different subject. You'll be doing a lot of readings every night and writing an essay every couple of weeks, but the workload is definitely manageable if you enjoy writing. Overall, this was a great course for mastering creative nonfiction. Tom is a wonderful professor and the workshops definitely improved my writing significantly. The class's effectiveness really depends on the motivation of your classmates, because so much of what we learn is through discussion, but I loved my class and I think it was very well-taught.",
    "Definitely but take it in a semester where you will not be loaded with work. The strength of the course is that it forces you to sit down and write, but that requires time and effort."
