    "Learned a lot about Native Americans in the US.",
    "This course aided me in analyzing and discussing historical concepts while actively trying to integrate and understand their effects in the present. I also was given the ability to learn another side of history, one that is often left untaught.",
    "This course covers a period of history often overlooked by many when studying Native American history. It was very informative, with a lot of different primary sources and documentaries featuring many different tribes during the 1900s.",
    "I learned a lot about the legal and activist history of Native Nations.",
    "I solidified my prior knowledge from Intro to American History with Professor Blackhawk and engaged with new texts that made me rethink major themes like AIM and casinos.",
    "This class was amazing and definitely a great introduction to Native American\/Federal govt relations. A must take class to learn about the terrible actions of the US govt."

   "comments": [
    "Good course",
    "I think some of the readings could be more focused on a specific topic, rather than reading entire books throughout the course of the semester. I also think the discussion could have been a bit more focused and that it seemed kind of odd to have a power-point lecture style class occasionally in this seminar.",
    "The only weakness was that maybe the class videos could have been watched outside of class discussion, although seeing it fresh did have its advantages."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are interested in the subject",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I enjoyed it and felt that I gained a lot from my experience. Also, I felt that it was an in depth look at Native American history that was not limiting, or when limitations did arise they were announced and discussed. Students would enjoy this class because it brings a unique look at United States History that is thought provoking.",
    "If you have any interest in Native American history, this would be an integral course to take to understand why contemporary native society has developed the way it has.",
    "Yes, this is a must take class for every United States citizen since most school systems do a poor job of teaching Native American history to students. They also do a poor job of making the students realize that Native American issues are not just done and in the past."
