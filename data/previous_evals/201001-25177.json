    "Lots of self-discipline and time management. Do not take this course if you are not able to do those things. Also - it is intensive, so make sure you like the topic that you choose. If you do - you are golden and it can be one of the most fulfilling courses you take at Yale.",
    "Independent research was one of the best decisions I made at Yale.",
    "Yes. Well, it is required, and it is a great way to bring together your research and writing abilities gained over the course of your Yale education.",
    "The year-long senior essay in political science is not only longer but fundamentally different from a shorter seminar paper. In order to ensure that you have enough original data (whether qualitative or quantitative) to merit a year-long essay, you ought to begin research over the summer (or in previous summers\/years). Also, I would strongly encourage you to find an advisor who matches not only your topic area of interest but also your temperament, as regards initiative\/procrastination. Finally, begin writing before you feel you have a coherent essay to churn out - it will help immensely in refining your ideas.",
    "I recommend Political Science 491 to a fellow student only if you are determined to work one on one with an advisor for a full year (if you're doing the yearlong senior thesis) and have a pre-established relationship with your advisor. I, for one, definitely recommend it!"
