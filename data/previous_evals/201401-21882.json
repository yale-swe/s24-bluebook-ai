   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're interested in the topic. Not too much work (3 6-7 page papers, 1 final exam). Wasn't life changing but feel like I left knowing a lot about Lincoln, which is pretty cool.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class because you don't know anything about Lincoln, and the more you learn the more you'll love him. Professor Smith does an excellent job with the lectures and the text.",
    "A thorough summary of Lincoln's speeches and correspondence from his early years in the public sphere through the civil war. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except Lincoln enthusiasts willing to dedicate the time to reading all these speeches.",
    "Overall, this class was a solid \"meh.\" Professor Smith is a wonderful lecturer (who loved Lincoln quite a lot), but the course assignments--papers and the exam--seemed unfocused or did not adhere to the timeline established by the syllabus at the outset. The course provided a great opportunity to learn much more about the thought of America's most storied president and to apply the principles of political philosophy to a real historical situation. However, the class seemed to drag on at times on the same topics and themes.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you are willing to do the Lincoln readings. They're not that long though because many are speeches.",
    "If you're interested in Lincoln, take this course! If you're interested in political philosophy, consider straying away from it. It really is about Lincoln, and less about broad themes concerning statecraft and rhetoric. Steven Smith gives great lectures, always fielding questions at the end, and sections aren't too bad. I'd definitely recommend it!",
    "If Shawn is not the TA then yes 100%. Smith's lectures are amazing. You get to do American history and oratory in the same breath. Loved it.",
    "I took it credit\/D, and I think it's a perfect credit\/D class.",
    "This is a class on Lincoln's thought, NOT a historical overview. However, if you're interested in how Lincoln's political philosophy developed over his career, definitely take this class!",
    "This is a WONDERFUL class! The lectures are insightful, the sections turned into fun debates, and the readings, oh, the readings! Well, you basically spend a semester reading Abraham Lincoln's speeches, so OF COURSE it's heavenly. I never felt like the readings were too much. There were three essays, all 6-7 pages, where you dissected one of the passages from Lincoln's speeches. There was also a final, but you'll do fine if you study a little. Seriously, this is among the top two best classes I've taken at Yale!",
    "Great course, one of my favorites at Yale. An essentially cover-to-cover reading of all of Lincoln's great and lesser works, with a complementing biography and readings from contemporaries. Thoughtful lectures and sometimes boring but sometimes interesting sections. A chance for full immersion into Lincoln's mind. If you find Lincoln a compelling figure now, it will multiply five fold after this class.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Take it if you want to gain an understanding of the man I have come to see as our greatest president.",
    "Great class. Reading Lincoln's speeches were always interesting and thought provoking. I had a little trouble keeping up in the Charnwood biography and the Battle Cry of Freedom. Lectures were fabulous. This would be an amazing class to read the speeches and audit the lectures. THy should also put this class on open Yale courses. I thought the final exam didn't do a great job of allowing students to show off what they had learned, but everything else was pretty fairly graded."
