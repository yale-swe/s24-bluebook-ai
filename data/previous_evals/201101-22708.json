   "comments": [
    "You should take it if you like the idea of writing a theme every day :)Be aware, the English department does look for a very particular type of literary realism, and that is what you'll be learning how to do in this course.",
    "Take Daily Themes! It was so much fun! I think my writing regressed -- in the sense that I came in thinking that I was a decent writer and now I realize that I'm totally not -- but I very much enjoyed the experience anyway. Topics are interesting and not that hard, and Professor Hammer totally rocks!",
    "No need to go to lecture really if you are just thinking about the grade. However, you shouldn't take this class if you are not genuinely interested in improving your own writing (kind of a no brainer). The workload may seem intimidating at first, but you settle into a rhythm pretty quickly.",
    "The Era of Your Life During Which You Took Daily Themes: you will look back on it with fondness. It would be better if they were actually daily (it's 5 per week), because thenthose two days wouldn't remind you of how easy it is never to write anything, but still the exercise is so wildly worth it. You'll figure out how to JUST DO IT, when it comes to writing, and you'll create a few things you actually like over the course of the semester. The TAs are a mixed bag, so proceed with great caution. The lectures are perfect and adorable. Hammer is my idol. He is so vague. And so right. About everything.",
    "Absolutely. Daily Themes was one of those \"experience\" courses. Example: I started crying after I finished my last theme (of 65), just because I could not believe that I'd written so much. My tutor was great, and so was Professor Hammer. Reading the themes of my peers also made me reevaluate the intellectutual quality at Yale overall. People here are brilliant!",
    "It's wonderful! Take it! Write themes!",
    "Do not aim to get into X Themes. That is my one piece of advice for you. Other than that, go crazy in this class. Really push yourself to the limit. Would definitely recommend to other students, should they get in. I found writing 300 words to be a nice change from my other classes, which were the usual load of read half a book, write a reading response\/paper\/discuss in class, repeat, repeat, repeat ad nauseum. Very stress-relieving, too.",
    "Definitely take this class. I took it as a second semester senior, in the midst of writing my senior essay, and rather than being an overload, I feel the class actually helped me focus on the writing that lay before me. Your writing will improve, and I definitely needed the discipline to get over my inhibitions.One word of caution, who your tutor is will make or break this class. My tutor, Megan, was truly phenomenal. If you get her consider yourself blessed -- she's great. And I think most of the tutors are probably very good, but if you don't click with yours it will be a long semester.",
    "I enjoyed the freedom in Daily Themes to explore my own writing, but felt that the actual exercise of writing almost daily was not very helpful. The quantity of what you are required to write makes it difficult to really explore your own voice and learn to write well. This is a class that will teach you to get your writing done, and begin to make you think about different aspects of how to do it, but will not teach you to write well.",
    "If youtake it, be ready and prepared for the immense amount of writing you have to do. It doesn't sound like much, but it really is. I was in two other lab courses this term and could not make my Themes as good as I wanted because I was burned out of writing in general. Know what you're getting yourself into.",
    "You will write 250-350 (sometimes more) words per day based on a prompt.",
    "Everyone should take Daily Themes. No matter what kind of writing you're interested in, you'll have the opportunity to explore it in greater depth than ever before while trying out other genres and forms. I really enjoyed the opportunity to work personally with a reader, her feedback has definitely improved my writing.",
    "Yes I would recommend the course -- it is great to get you in the habit of writing every day! It is also a good way to experiment with different forms of writing.",
    "If you want to push yourself creatively, take this course!",
    "Take this class, but try to get a good tutor. Lecture's not helpful.",
    "It's great! You write a short creative piece five days out of the week, and it's so much fun! The tutors give you really great feedback to help you improve, too!",
    "You write everyday. It sounds daunting (not going to lie, I was scared at first), but I promise it is so worth it. Best class at Yale.",
    "Daily Themes is unlike any other course at Yale, and it's a great chance to experiment with your writing in a way that few other courses will allow. If you think you'd enjoy the challenge of writing every day, you probably will. My tutor was very helpful and friendly. Daily Themes is a fascinating experience that you can form into pretty much whatever you want, and I'd recommend it to anyone--science major, English major, whatever--who thinks it would be intriguing. Also, take note that the days off from writing themes are not the weekends, but Monday and Tuesday nights.",
    "This was advice I got before taking Daily Themes and didn't take, but which I am going to offer: if you've already taken a lot of creative writing classes, I wouldn't highly recommend taking this class. It's not that it isn't challenging--writing 300 words for a daily deadline, even when you are uninspired by the prompt, is a challenge indeed, and a good exercise. But if you've grown accustomed to the small group, workshop format of most of Yale's creative writing courses, you may find Daily Themes jarring. It's a weekly lecture complemented by a weekly one-on-one tutorial. The lecture is mostly just Professor Hammer reading engaging literary quotations and talking about the topic for the week, and both the content of his lectures and his soothing reading voice make this enjoyable. Tutorial can be helpful or tedious, depending on who is assigned as your tutor. Take the class if you don't have another creative writing class to take and you want to keep your flow going or whatever--but be prepared to exhaust yourself of every idea\/topic you've saved up to write about. There are 60 pages worth of writing in store for you.",
    "Take it! You learn so much as a writer. Chance to do all the experimental writing you don't have time to take the risks to do in other classes here.",
    "Take this, even if you have little writing experience. Lecture is boring and mostly irrelevant, but just trade off going with some friends and put your focus into spending an hour or two each day writing your themes. It's a great environment to take risks and find a voice and get specific feedback on everything you've written, every week. Some tutors are better than others, but just the experience of writing a theme every day will greatly improve your prose.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class! It never gets easier writing 300 words a day, but at the end of the semester, it's great to just have a lot of little works that you can go back and expand onin the future.",
    "You write a lot. The class has been around forever. If you don't handle daily assignments well w\/o a daily meeting to cram for you'll be buried. Any given theme can expand to consume hours.It'sfun, but honestly a bit much to expect your writing to improve markedly over the course of the term.",
    "Daily Themes is a lot more work than it seems, and sometimes the prompts are kind of annoying, but it's a great experience and definitely helped me try new things with my writing and also helped me learn to write with less rigidity and more speed. I would definitely recommend Daily Themes if you have any interest in writing, and it's really what you make of it, since you have such freedom within the prompts.",
    "The assignments are almost always fun, but lecture is very dull. Take it pass\/fail and enjoy getting to do creative writing every night.",
    "it's a wonderful class that allows you to experiment with many of the issues involved in writing - gets your mind engaged with many of the things one should be thinking about when approaching creative writing.",
    "Yes but just be aware that you need to keep on top of things. There will definitely be times when you won't be able to go out until you write a theme. In the end the class is definitely worth the work though and your writing will improve.",
    "If you have ever thought that you might want to write, but haven't gotten around to it at Yale, you should take Daily Themes. Writing five days a week, if youtake it seriously, will make you a more observant and thoughtful person, and you won't be as afraid of getting started. By the end of the semester, I found that writing a theme was often one of the highlights of my day. You'll like some prompts better than others, but being comfortable with your writing, even when it's not your best work, is such a blessing. Professor Hammer is wonderful to listen to, and having a tutor to read your themes every week and discuss them with you is a real privilege.",
    "Daily Themes is a pretty intense writing class so you should be careful that you can commit to the workload when you sign up for it. It will improve your writing and will introduce you to multiple writing styles.",
    "Take it only if you have enough time in your schedule--don't underestimate how much work it is, because there are days you really won't want to write your 300 words or you won't feel any connection to the prompt. At that point, you just need to power through.",
    "A way to completely change the way you write. Makes you more professional in your habits and outlook toward your writing. If you join this class you're basically treated like a professional writer, as you have your own personal tutor who will work specifically with you to help you become a better writer. I would absolutely recommend this to another student, for the reasons stated above.",
    "If you like to write, this is a wonderful class. You will love it. If you don't like to write, it will be torture.I like to write, so this was my favorite class for the semester. Writing every day DOES make you get better. Luckily, the assignments are all short, so you don't have time to get attached or hung up on any single one. Running out of obvious ideas will also force you to try new\/daring things, which more often than not turn out very well.Professor Hammer is engaging and very kind. My tutor was excellent, both constructive and postive.",
    "YES! YES! DO IT YES! It's worth it to get the writing experience! And fun!",
    "Yes, take it. One of my favorite courses at Yale. Different from anything else.",
    "Good class if you want to experiment. This is more about you looking for your own weaknesses and figuring out how to become better. More self-taught than anything. Recommended if you like to write and if you can keep up with the writing everyday idea.",
    "Daily Themes is an intensive writing class that combines lectures with individual workshop-style meetings. If you put in the work and the effort, it will vastly improve your writing. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Take this course ONLY if you have the time to dedicate to it. It's really fun, the quality of the lectures vary, but you WILL LEARN about writing, and your skills will get better even if you don't notice the improvement along the way. In hindsight, this class has made me more conscious about my writing, and I'm extremely grateful for that.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. TAKE IT. Even if you aren't an English major, even if you don't want to become a professional writer. Through this class I learned a lot about writing, but I also learned about myself (cliche as it sounds). If you're looking for a class that will be a great creative outlet, this is it. The workload is significant, but it was really nice to have a class where I never had to worry about papers or exams. The amount of work was exactly the same every week, which I really liked.",
    "Great class! Professor Hammer's lectures are always great! Really interesting guests too! Meeting with your tutor is also a great way to improve your writing.",
    "Yes. A good class to take in your senior year second semester for various reasons, including the fact that this class gives you ample opportunities to reflect on one's life, thought process, and identity. It is surely a worthy class to take, though time-consuming. For non-English majors like myself who love writing\/keeping journals, Daily Themes has really grown me as a writer. Writing every day, experimenting with various prompts and styles and kinds of writing, and revising previous themes were key. I do think that writing every day (5 days\/week) can get quite burdensome, if you have hard time getting into a disciplined routine. Also I enjoyed meeting with my tutor very much and having a constructive conversation, but only because my tutor was incredibly encouraging and understanding in her feedback.",
    "Take this class if you like creative writing.",
    "Take. This class. go into knowing the lectures suck, but build a good relationship with your TF and you'll have the time of your life. It can be a LOT of time, depending on how much you put into your 300 words. It's also kind of a creativity suck- you keep seeing things in terms of potential themes.but even if I spent six hours on a theme, it never felt like work. it felt like dancing. loved every minute. brought joy back into my collegecareer.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It's annoying at times - those DAILY DEADLINES - but it will ultimately improve you as a writer. If you really want to learn to think about how you write, it's a good course.",
    "Take this class if you like to write and if you want to be a better writer. It will certainly push you and encourage you. Professor Hammer is excellent, and Carolyn is a great TF! I know that all the other TF's were enthusiastic and experienced as well; so, take this class for experience and growth. It is fun! One of my favorite classes last semester!",
    "I would recommend this course--but I would also caution that the course isa highly individual experience for each person, in part determined by one's relationship with one's tutor. While your overall experience is largely determined by your own level of participation, your tutor inevitably plays into your overall impression of the experience.Writing five times a week becomes easier over the course. My writing certainly improved. While it may seem daunting, you don't have exams or papers, so I don't feel the work is that much more than for other courses, though it is more spread out.",
    "Do it for yourself. Writing every day, and then analyzing it will reveal things that you never even realized your mind was preoccupied with. The insight I built in Daily Themes is priceless to me.",
    "Daily Themes will make you improve as a writer, hands down. It is an especially rewarding experience because by the end you start to believe in your own abilities. It's a lot of work, especially remembering to sit down and write every day, but it's completely worth it. And lectures are two hours long, once a week, but they're not really necessary to fulfill the week's assignment.",
    "Daily Themes is great. If you like writing, there is no better course to do a lot of it in. Great to feel writing becoming easier over the course of the semester - it helped me loosen up about getting my ideas onto paper. I also learned so much about writing as a profession, from guest lectures especially, which I really appreciated. Do it - great to have a compilation of short works at the end of the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It was a fantastic class that I looked forward to every week.",
    "It's a class that everyone should take, or at least try, if they can. Getting in the habit of writing short pieces on a daily basis is good. It will help your writing a lot,",
    "You definitely should take this class. My writing has never improved this much before. It was also a lot of fun.",
    "Daily Themes is a course in three parts: writing, lectures and tutorial. Writing happens 5 times a week (not necessarily on weekdays, mine were Tuesday through Sunday); lectures once a week and tutorial once a week.Writing everyday, in the beginning, was agonizing. I would take 3 hours each day to write, get super self-conscious and not be able to finish any of my other homework. Then, as the semester progressed, I stopped caring so much, ended up writing much more freely (which may have been better, even) and had time left over to watch Youtube. I got better acquainted with how I write; more importantly, I got better acquainted with how to make writing less painful.Lectures consist of listening toquotes being read out loud by people who write well. That's fun for a while. It wears off though.Tutorial is great, but it depends crucially on who your tutor is. Mine was wonderful! But even with a great tutor, I couldn't expect her to do everything for me. Most of my writing revelations were self-realized; the line-edits she made were small (understandably, because anything larger than that gets very personal -- crossing that line is hard when you are strangers).Bottom line: great class, but can be simulated by someone disciplined enough to write every day.",
    "Daily Themes is a great concept which, this semester at least, felt poorly executed. Lectures (except guest lectures) were painful, and I didn't really connect well with my tutor. I took this class to have an excuse to write regularly, and in this regard the course was successful. Beyond this criterion, I'm not sure how highly I could recommend the course: Prof. Hammer was often dull or heavy handed in his lectures and the only reason many people seemed to show up was because the assignments were held hostage. I was hoping for more out of this course, and perhaps I romanticized it, but so be it. I did well in the course but didn't know until the midterm what the grading policies etc were, which felt vague throughout; I had no real understanding what merited what kind of grade. It was always fun to see other students' work and I appreciated the sharing of exemplary themes, though more when I would read them myself than just hearing them read. Anyway, it's a good course if you want a chance to write more, but it's not the end all be all of things.",
    "This is a course that requires a bit of daily work and discipline and it will quickly roll over you and keep going if you aren't fully in it, but with enough buy-in it can be a really great way to workshop your writing and, more importantly, figure out what the process of writing means to you and what you want out of it.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. Students write 250-300 words, five days a week according to weekly themes and daily prompts. The workload is steady and I found the experience of writing consistently to be extremely valuable. But the lecture is awful. Professor Hammer spends most of the class period reading aloud to the class (aka boring) and I felt that I never learned much of anything during class. The learning comes from the significant writing and the weekly sessions with your tutor. You are best off skipping class (except the guest lectures which are fabulous) and finding someone to pick up the writing prompts for you. Experiences with tutors are very variable, so you\u0092ll have the best experience if you have a good tutor, but tutor assignments are random, so good luck!I\u0092d bet that this class has been MUCH better in years past when another professor was the lecturer.",
    "This class is amazing. I loved it (and hated it at times) but overall thought the experience is totally worth having. Its difficult to write every day and the class is relentless in that way, but it teaches you so, so much about writing, reading, literature. It really changed the way I think\/read\/write\/interact with the world.",
    "Daily themes is all about learning to write short pieces fast, and relatively well. It is a class for serious writing, or humor writing that falls into a very narrow category. Switch tutors early on if yours is bad.",
    "Yes. This class gets you writing, it keeps you writing (for a time) and has the potential to be immensely rewarding. It is good paired off with other creative writing classes, and maybe less helpful on its own.",
    "If you enjoy creative writing and can let someone potentially rip you to shreds or praise you over your work, then take it. I've learned a lot about my writing styles and what needed to be fixed. Other than that, there were times when I felt the class was a chore, but there were also times where I felt it was a great escape.",
    "Daily Themes is a wonderful class to take if you have any interest in writing fiction. After taking this class, I was so much more comfortable writing on a regular basis, and much more confident in my writing. However, I had never taken another fiction class. I also had a wonderful wonderful tutor, and that makes all the difference in how good your experience with the class is.",
    "Very fun and challenging. It's a great Cr\/D\/F course - you'll get more out of it the more time you put in, BUT not all of the prompts are going to excite you and it's nice to be able to focus more on some than on others. Lectures are hit or miss - some great guest speakers and Langdon Hammer has some good things to say but a lot of the time is wasted reading aloud handouts that don't necessarily need to be read aloud. Weekly tutorial can also be hit or miss - probably best to come with something specific you want to focus on. Biggest advice: take risks with your writing; really use this as an opportunity to challenge yourself and try out as many new forms\/styles\/techniques as possible...sometimes that means stretching the interpretation of a few prompts for themes, butreally just have as much fun with this as you can!"
