   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it. You get to explore different playwrights and grasp an understanding of why drama is the way it is todya.",
    "highly recommend, especially if you want a good introduction to modern drama and modernism in general through the lens of theatre. if you put in the work, you will get a lot from this course.",
    "English 223 is an introduction to some of works (often somewhat obscure ones) by the major playwrights of the late 19th and early 20th centuries: Ibsen, Strindberg, Chekhov, Shaw, O'Neill, Pirandello, Brecht. The workload is about average for this type of class; you read one fairly short play for each class meeting, and there are a two short papers, a midterm and a final, as well as discussion section.",
    "Great course, but catching up on plays before exams will be tough so stay on top of your readings. That being said, take advantage of the exam format if you need to. The most relaxing and purely interesting course I took all semester.",
    "The course is an excellent introduction into Modern Drama. If that subject interests you, then this course is a great way to learn more on that topic. Despite its multiple listings, this course is ran as an english course, so be aware of that going in.",
    "The course is like theatre 110\/111 on steroids. If you liked that class, you will definitely like Modern Drama. If you hated it, you will hate this. If you were somewhere in between (like me) you will probably like this more than the Survey Course.",
    "If you like the reading list, take the class.",
    "It's not super exciting but it is a way to read a lot of plays.",
    "Foundations of Modern drama is an interesting and worthwhile class, especially if you know very little about theater. It's difficult to keep up with all the lectures and all the reading but its not strictly necessary to do well, so in that way its hard to force yourself to get everything out of this class that you could.",
    "Modern Drama is a good overview of the playwrights studied and Professor Biggs does a good job of fitting all the readings into a larger framework. The exams were challenging in light of the volume of the material covered, but I definitely felt like the class gave me an increased appreciation for the particular subject matter and drama in general.",
    "If you need to fulfill your foreign-language requirement, go for it. If you want a good, enjoyable lecture with a relatively minimal workload and an awesome (if familiar) reading list, go for it. If you haven't read the plays to be discussed yet, definitely go for it. Otherwise, your credit and time is probably best spent elsewhere.",
    "Not the best lecture class. Maybe it was simply too early in the morning, but Bigg's dry lectures didn't help either. I took the class to read the plays, since they seem like mandatory knowledge for a thst major and I really wanted to read them. If that's why you're taking this, just read the plays. Take a different theory class; there are better ones out there.",
    "Don't take it unless you really really want to read the plays"
