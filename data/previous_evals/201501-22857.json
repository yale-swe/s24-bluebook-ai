    "Libretto Writing is a great intro into an often-misunderstood job. Perhaps if it were structured a little more clearly in the future it would be a more worthwhile experience. It also depends a lot on who's in the class, since it's a workshop-style seminar.",
    "If you're interested in musical theater writing, take this course. If you don't know if you're interested in musical theater writing, take this course. If you heard a musical one time and liked it, take this course. Professor Sheinkin is an immensely gifted artist, and a highly approachable and supportive teacher. She is excited about student work and is always thrilled to share her musical theater know-how in the classroom. You will leave with skills you didn't have before, and with a real understanding of the libretto writing process."
