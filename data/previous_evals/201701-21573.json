    "I learned about the current state of nuclear politics in the world and the history of nuclear negotiations and motivations",
    "It was very interesting to learn about nuclear proliferation and the theoretical framework behind it. I learned how to analyze different country cases using theory.",
    "The ability to view an issue from the opposite side and understand the concepts that uphold that side, as well as oppose the other side.",
    "History and theory of nuclear weapons.",
    "hu",
    "A general knowledge of the history of nuclear weapons as well as nuclear political theory.",
    "This is a great general introduction to nuclear politics. It covers most of the important topics in the field, and given that most students know very little about nuclear politics when taking the class, the learning curve is mostly steep.",
    "In this class, we learned about the reasons for proliferation, including supply and demand side reasons, then we developed the framework for strategic proliferation using willingness and opportunities.",
    "Great course. Debs is very knowledgeable in the subject and makes lecture very engaging.",
    "By taking this course, I gained knowledge concerning the history and development of nuclear weapons, how affairs related to these weapons have shaped international relations, debates concerning nuclear weapons such as the proposition of \"Global Zero\", and future outlooks, although the full range of topics covered was much greater.",
    "More than the significant knowledge I obtained concerning the interconnectedness of our modern world, I gained a deeper understanding of how to view, analyze, and move forward from scholarly articles.",
    "The course introduced me to various debates and topics on nuclear politics, ranging from history surrounding nuclear weapons and nuclear proliferation.",
    "Learned history of nuclear weapons.",
    "Gained a much deeper insight on the background of nuclear politics, including the reasons as to why states proliferate."

   "comments": [
    "The course is well structured and does a good job of giving students the full picture of the nuclear revolution. However, it is very oriented towards Cold War history, far too US-centric and frankly is need of readings by authors who don't necessarily agree with everything the West believes. Without them, the class just becomes an echo chamber in which students never really understand why the issues at hand are so deep-rooted.",
    "This course had phenomenal readings and good in class discussion. I would improve it by having more debates and grading students on their debate performance.",
    "This course provides a great overview of Nuclear Politics. One of the strengths is that Professor Debs is an amazing professor and the fact that we read and discuss his book really makes the class more interesting. S",
    "Strength in depth of discussion and analysis Not many holes",
    "The student part of the class should be improved or removed. Professor Debs should push back harder and ask follow up questions so that it's really a back and forth. As it is, I think it could be completely eliminated, since at least 80% of comments are people just repeating back exactly what Professor Debs (more eloquently and clearly) just said. There is very little inter-student interaction, and since the professsor doesn't usually force people to back up their ideas, I think the time would be better used if Professor Debs continued lecturing or took questions, or even if each class was shorter.",
    "There was very little useful feedback. Points were taken off for \"writing style\" on nearly every assignment without any explanation of what aspect of writing style was lacking or how it could be improved.",
    "The theories and histories are useful, but some of the course material\/studies presented are too mathematical. I think more time should be spent going over case-by-case, qualitative examples of nuclear politics. In addition, I think a final essay would have been more applicable than a final test.",
    "Overall, this was a great class. If I were to change one thing, it would be to either shorten the discussion sessions at the end of each class. They might be a great way for the speakers to learn or address some questions, but in my opinion, few students were at a level where they were truly contributing to the class - especially for the first month or two. Many of the students in this class are freshmen, and this is their first IR class. I believe that I would have been better off listening to Professor Debs for 15 more minutes. Alternatively, Professor Debs could have stuck to each question a little longer and provided us with his answers to the questions. We often went from question to question, but none of them were really addressed in depth. This should not be a distraction from the fact that this class",
    "The atrength is that the course was structured very clearly. One weakness was that the TFs could've been better utilized to facilitate learning. ;",
    "Offers a variety of theoretical and empirical perspectives that both support and refute the professor's own views",
    "I felt the best parts of the course were the three debates we had over the course of the semester; they allowed us to more intensively think about what we'd been learning. Additionally, each class period ended with a discussion which allowed us to consider the implications of what we were reading. Additionally, the weekly readings always presented multiple viewpoints, which helped us to gain a more holistic understanding of the topics at hand.",
    "This was a fantastic course!",
    "The course made efforts to show both sides of the debate in the topics discussed, and encouraged the students themselves to consider the topic and come up with their own arguments as well.Sometimes, however, it was difficult to come up with my own argument without going through the material in class, which seemed to be an expectation the class had on students.",
    "Lectures can be a little repetitive, but the discussion at the end helps."

   "comments": [
    "Recommended for an easy GLBL\/PLSC class. Debs is great at his job and the course material only gets better as it goes. Pretty relaxed in terms of workload, and you can miss a reading or two. Low-stress and class participation is interesting in lecture. Loved the class and love Debs.",
    "Only if you're really interested in Cold war history, otherwise watching debates at the Oxford Union (on Youtube) would give a much better, more entertaining and more nuanced image of the challenges at hand.",
    "I would. It was a fascinating class with not a lot of work.",
    "A great class and a must if you are interested in international politics",
    "Professor Debs is such an amazing professor. It is very interesting that we discuss his book and if you are interested to learn the theoretical framework to understand what is happening today with nuclear weapons.",
    "Great course - Debs is both a notable scholar in the field's recent literature and a skilled teacher of the course material",
    "Lecture is fine, not super exciting. The material is good. Debs also knows his stuff, and you'll have a pretty good grasp on nuclear politics by the time you've finished this class. You'll never get your mind blown, but you will learn a good amount. Grading might have been a little harsher than I would have liked.",
    "Debs is brilliant and the course is very well structured. Establishes a great foundation for approaching game theory, nuclear politics, and the influence of nuclear weapons on international relations",
    "I would recommend this class if students are willing to look at theories rather than nuclear politics on a case-by-case basis.",
    "This is an awesome IR class! Professor Debs is a great teacher, and he has structured the class in a way that makes it very easy to be a student in his class. Also, it is not a higher-level class, so if you are a first-year student or a sophomore who is interested in international relations but doesn't really know if it is your think, this might be a class for you. You develop a better understand of nuclear politics but also of international relations. Professor Debs draws from historic and current cases, and the readings are often very interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! If any student wanted to get more knowledge out of why nuclear weapons are so important in IR, this would be great! The Prof. is very knowledgeable.",
    "Definitely. Super interesting and practical.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was probably the most engaging political science\/global affairs oriented course I've taken to this point. The professor was great at facilitating discussion, and you are given ample opportunities to demonstrate your knowledge.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. More than the significant knowledge I obtained concerning the interconnectedness of our modern world, I gained a deeper understanding of how to view and analyze scholarship. Professor Debs is both brilliant and approachable, and willing to offer advice and help regardless of the question you have. The work is interesting but not too demanding- there is just one paper throughout the semester as a group, biweekly responses, and reasonable tests.",
    "Good course, lots of reading, Professor Debs is a brilliant person!",
    "Yes. For those with an interest in nuclear politics, this would be a great course to be able to discuss such topics in a classroom setting. Past and current issues are discussed, that can lend a hand in being able to understand future relations with nuclear powers."
