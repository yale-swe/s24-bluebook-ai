   "comments": [
    "Given the fact the Algerian War rarely (if ever) comes up in French history or literature courses, this topic is definitely worth exploring. That said, this course would be improved with some more introductory material\/background - I felt I could have gotten much more out of the course if I had had a better sense of the political and social context. Readings are lengthy and almost entirely in French, so be prepared to brush up on your French reading skills and do some skimming. Weekly reading responses and a final paper make for a fair workload. You'll get out of this class what you put into it -- although you could probably skip some of the workload, you'll learn a lot more if you really engage with the material.",
    "I recommend it HANDS DOWN.",
    "Very interesting class. Tamalet is extremely intelligent and a great professor.The readings are often long-- but be aware that Prof. Tamalet (due to her genuine interest in what you have to say) will not simply accept BS-y comments in class. So doing at least some of the readings is necessary, or discussions will be painful.Weekly reading responses (1-2 pages), a 20 min-ish presentation, and a 10-15 page paper.The end of the class can get pretty poli-sci ish and abstract (post colonial theory kind of stuff), but overall a good class. Take it.",
    "One of the most eye-opening classes I've taken at Yale. Knew next to nothing going in, never got bored. The Algerian War is so complex and fascinating--you will be intrigued. The professor is also an awesome seminar leader; don't be intimidated by her. My class was quiet, but she more than makes up for it.",
    "This was an enlightening and fascinating peek into the historical and literary setting of the Algerian war of Independence. Highly recommended if you are committed to getting the work done (there's a lot) and really engaging with the material. A hard class, but worthwhile.",
    "It's set up like a political science or history seminar about the Algerian war, which just happens to be taught in French. I would recommend it if you're interested in the topic and want to be taught be a native French speaking professor, but if you're looking for a French literature course like most others offered in the major, then this isn't it.",
    "Yes. Courses that address French involvement abroad create a more whole cultural picture, particularly for students considering or declared as French majors. This course specifically was also a great experience, given the varied types of materials studied in class."
