   "comments": [
    "The course was interesting but the lectures were very hard to understand. I would not recommend this course unless you have a strong background in the subject",
    "A good class. The content is interesting, but the marking is quiet harsh. There is a lot to learn for the exams, so don't be deceived by the 'dinosaur class' nametag. The paper topic was very vague - make sure you talk to your TA to find out exactly what is required, before you start writing. The workload is light throughout the semester and the power points are thorough and helpful - an enjoyable class on the whole.",
    "This is a very nice way to broaden your sense of the wide variety of possible life forms, because you get to see what life was like over millions of years, different geological periods. It also gives you a sense of how things developed and got to be the way they are now, which is nice, but along the way some really strange and exciting organisms came in and out. Discussion of the nature and causes of mass extinctions and how theories about them developed were also interesting. Definitely an enjoyable class. As for work, there are no real homework assignments besides a paper, but there are occasional sections that meet irregularly where you have to complete someassignments.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. It can be a bit hard to study for because of the lack of specific reading on the syllabus, but I loved going to lecture every week and I think the exams were generally pretty fair.",
    "A survey of evolution through the geological record. Really cool if you like anything from human evolution, to dinosaurs, to extinctions.",
    "History of Life is a really fun class - the lectures are quite interesting and there is almost no work, besides a term paper. However, the midterm and final are not terribly easy - this is a good class if you are looking for a class with no work, but it isn't necessarily a class you will get a good grade in.",
    "Mixture of tedious information about geological processes and actual interesting facts about species.",
    "This is a great choice for non-science majors looking for a distribution requirement. The lectures are fun and interesting, and there is very little work. If you go to lecture and take notes, the exams end up being pretty doable.",
    "Interesting material that is not presented that well. It requires a lot of independent work to figure out the larger picture of what is going on, but not a bad science credit.",
    "I would say only take it if you have to.",
    "I liked this class! I am not a science major but I like studying fascinating scientific concepts in a broad base manner. This class was easy to understand and interesting. I was happy.Professor Briggs spoke in a clear manner and was easy to understand. Professor Longrich was very enthusiastic and brought in personal anecdotes which livened up the lectures. Also Professor Longritch had the added advantage of having the more interesting material to cover. Also, his slides contained more information making it much easier to study for the final exam. The information on the slides helped me figure out what I should study.",
    "I don't know what to say about History of Life. It's probably the worst class I have taken at Yale. I will say that the second half of the course, taught by Professor Longrich, is worlds above Briggs's portion. It was unclear what we were supposed to take away from lecture for the exams. The paper was a pain to write. Avoid this class if you can.",
    "If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever been a paleo nut, this is the course for you. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of fun and you get a nice introduction to the field. I would definitely suggest you take the accompanying lab; it really helps in terms of better learning the material for the tests, and is also just a lot of fun crawling through the depths of the Peabody looking at fossils."
