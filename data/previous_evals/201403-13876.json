   "comments": [
    "Would highly recommend for anyone interested in studying the history of imperialist and diplomatic relations between the west and Iran and Afghanistan. Also, if you would like to study these two areas from the point of view of a native, this is the course.",
    "Definitely recommend! Especially if you've never taken a class on the region before. I hadn't, and learned more than I've ever learned from a history class. Readings are not too long and definitely engaging, and Prof. Amanat is great at leading discussion and making sure everyone gets a complete picture of Iran and Afghanistan from the 18th c onwards. Central Asia is discussed less in detail, probably because there's so much to cover in Iran and Afghanistan during that time, and events in those countries had much more of an effect on world order than did events in Central Asia.",
    "Amazing class, especially for anyone interested in Iran or Central Asia, or history majors who need to fill a requirement. Professor Amanat is awesome and runs the timeline of the seminar really well, making it easy to get assignments and reading done. I felt like I learned a ton of stuff in this seminar, and I definitely recommend it."
