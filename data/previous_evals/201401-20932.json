    "Never take this class. It is unbelievably horrendous. I wanted to kill myself every day in this class and the textbook is the worst ever written. Professors are reallllllly bad too. By far the worst I have ever had at my 2 years at Yale and probably the worst I've ever had. Just don't bother.",
    "It's a pretty good class.",
    "Take 171 if you can, or take 181 with Fleming. Maruyama's lectures will not help you at all and it will be a miserable experience.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you REALLY love E&M.",
    "Take PHYS 181. The curve might not be great because of all of the students with prior physics backgrounds, but it's a good class to take.",
    "You probably have to take this class as a pre-req, but I would suggest you look into 170 or 200 first and see if they are any better.",
    "I would recommend this class\/material as long as it would be taught by a different professor. I would actively try to stop any student trying to take this class with this professor.",
    "You probably have to take this as a requirement anyhow, so yes. If you have Bonnie Fleming you will actually enjoy the course.",
    "Being completely honest and with no intention for disrespect, this class has been the worst class I have taken in my entire life (that includes the classes I took at my public elementary school and middle school in Los Angeles). This class was a tremendous waste of money. Most of us learned nothing in lecture. I learned everything from smartphysics which in itself is not a good instructor either. Smartphysics costed $30, tuition for this class was about $10,000. Why should we have to pay $10,000 and receive no knowledge when we receive the same for $30 from smartpysics? Classes like these disappoint me, especially because this is what's offered at Yale. I am not upset; I am disappointed. There was no effort in teaching this class. The professor used powerpoints that were obviously made by smartphysics. To the reader, YOU'RE BETTER OFF TAKING ANY OTHER CLASS. THE OPPORTUNITY COST IS EXTREMELY LARGER THAN THE BENEFIT. I WOULD HAVE MUCH RATHER LEARNED SOMETHING, PHILOSOPHY, LITERATURE, HISTORY, THAN BE IN PHYSICS. THIS IS PERHAPS, ONE OF MY BIGGEST REGRETS AT YALE.",
    "As a premed who had to take this class, to fellow premeds: it's one hell of a hurdle, not because it's hard, but because it's annoying. This is one of the most poorly taught classes I've taken at Yale (and that's after having taken intro econ and bio classes), and you learn barely anything from the class itself. If you're the kind of person who does other things in class all the time and catch up later, this is probably the class for you.",
    "Absolutely the best way to get the physics requirement out of the way. Phys 181 is now taught by a really well designed website called smart physics. That website is such a better way to learn than lecture. Especially this lecture. This lecture was fairly useless, but I didn't care because Smart Physics made the course so easy. You are forded to stay on top of the work, the online lectures are perfectly clear, and so much better than a book. Be aware, there is a lot of homework, but like I said it's spread very well and never piles up. The midterms are pretty easy and the class averages were low. But since HW counts for so much you have to remember to do it because everyone else in the class is getting perfect marks on the hw. Overall, really learned physics, never got stressed. I took 170, which is a mess, and this course is much neater.",
    "If you have to take it, take it.",
    "This class was kind of tough. the material isn't too bad and you can do well but smartphysics is a little annoying and lecture was the least helpful thing ever but you have to go for attendance",
    "Everything you learn is from an online program called SmartPhysics",
    "Not terrible but pretty bad. Hopefully this will be better in later years after they iron it out but the professors were really scattered and not prepared. Take it if you have to. 201 is supposed to be more difficult but much better.",
    "A lot of work-- a lot of time commitment. Overall, I would not recommend this class and would expect more from Yale. And this is coming from someone who actually found electricity and magnetism interesting.",
    "Only take it if it is required for your major. If you can take a different level of physics, take that.",
    "I can't really compare it to the other physics classes, but I would just steer away from it if you don't absolutely need to take it. It's a pretty ordinary physics class like you'd expect, but it's also essentially an online class with smartPhysics. Lectures are useless and the curve is pretty awful.",
    "Not a particularly good class. Weekly online and written hw, two midterms, a final, and online prelecture videos. The lectures were rather boring and repetitive of the online prelectures we had to watch. Professor Maruyama was not great, but Professor Flemming substituted a few times and was very good--if you are choosing between sections, I would go with Prof. Flemming for sure.",
    "I had a much poorer experience in Phys 181 compared to Phys 180. This was the first year they used Smartphysics, which I actually appreciated because I ended up mostly self-teaching myself from the book and online material. The actual in-class lectures contributed almost nothing to my experience, but I still had to go because of points for clicker questions - which were also almost useless, because 90% of the clicker questions were literally exactly the same as the checkpoints we had just done in Smartphysics anyway. The midterms were also a little weird; the first one was surprisingly easy, and then everyone was caught off-guard by the second one, which was much much more difficult. The inconsistencies may come from the fact that both professors (I think) were teaching this course for the first time, so if they teach it again, hopefully that aspect will improve in the future.",
    "A good class with a lot of resources if you don't feel that you understand the material. But if you don't actively engage you are in danger of not getting very much out of it.",
    "Physics 181 is the second half of introductory physics. I would recommend students to shop it during reading period and see how it is structured. The professors will probably be restructuring the course, so while it may not have been very well taught this semester, it will likely improve. Give it a chance!",
    "I would not recommend taking phys 181 as it is a poorly taught and organized course. It's not a completely miserable experience and it is possible to do well in the class, but I would avoid the smartphysics program if possible.",
    "A typical introductory course to Electricity and Magnetism. You will benefit from the structure of the class if you have the self discipline to keep up with all of the assignments. Take advantage of all of the TA resources. My guess is that students looking to take this class are either required to or doing it to fulfill a pre-med requirement, in which case a recommendation won't really matter. The class is bearable at worst, pretty interesting at best.",
    "This is a good class for someone who needs a physics prerequisite but isn't prepared for the depth of 201 or 261. I would not recommend to someone who has only a mild interest in physics but it is a good way to fill your physics prerequisite for many majors.",
    "Only take 181 if you have to. Also, if Reina is teaching it, just find a door knob to teach you instead. Reina is a horrendous \"teacher\". I put teacher in quotes because Reina Maruyama is not a teacher. She is not worthy of being called a teacher. I understand that this was her first time teaching and she was nervous, BUT she would never come to class prepared. Every time she put an example\/problem up on the board she would realize that the answer on the powerpoint slide was incorrect and then say:\"I'm sorry I didn't work this out before class.\" Then WHAT DID SHE DO BEFORE CLASS? If we have to watch prelectures, then she should at least have the decency to look over the pre-prepared smartphysics slides. She only teaches this one class, and it's her first class so shouldn't she at least TRY to prepare before class? She is an absolutely awful \"teacher\" - I've never had such an awful \"teacher\" in my entire life. She may be a wonderful person, but I have zero respect for her. ZERO. I am a very tolerant and patient person, but I lost my patience for Reina in this class. I really hope the administration never allows her to teach an intro course ever again. It's just a very poorly taught class. Intro Physics at Yale is generally poorly taught though.",
    "Not well organized if Professor Maruyama is teaching it. You'll have to learn a lot by yourself, and SmartPhysics isn't very helpful. Professor Fleming substitute lectured a few times and she was really great.",
    "Professor Maruyama is a terrible lecturer, but Professor Fleming is pretty engaging. I found Smartphysics to be a lot of work, but there's a new video series on Youtube that went up around March that works through a lot of the more difficult problems. (The TAs were also really helpful for figuring things out.) Overall, I found the material engaging but the presentation lacking. The curve sucks. If you haven't seen E&M before, be prepared to get a terrible grade even if you work your ass off. If you want to actually apply multivariable calculus, don't take this course. I've heard PHYS 201 is basically just a review of ENAS 151...",
    "I would not recommend it- it was not taught well, and the work was more tedious than anything else.",
    "Phys 181 is an okay class. It requires a decent amount of work with various subsets of homework such as prelectures, checkpoints, and online and written homework. It felt like the material was not very engaging as it was focused on a lot of formulas and not that much conceptual comprehension of the material. It's possible this reaction is just a result of comparing with PHYS 180, where mechanics are tangible and easy to think about the big-pictures ideas. The lectures were also not very engaging and difficult to understand. There were times when students got up and left class early because they gave up trying to comprehend what was happening, which is never a good sign. Despite the lectures, there are plenty of resources in this class to learn the material, which is awesome.",
    "Not too hard if you've taken it in HS",
    "NO. No. No. No. No. A thousand times, NO-- if Reina Maruyama or Bonnie Fleming is teaching the course. Horribly taught, waste of time, and definitely among the worst classes at Yale.",
    "Half the class never paid attention in lecture. Very easy hws, tests, everything. Great for premeds I suppose, but not for learning.",
    "SmartPhysics, although extremely tedious, was really useful for learning the material. Lecture, on the other hand, was not.",
    "A necessary physics class. Try to take it with Fleming if possible.",
    "Lectures seemed fairly pointless. I don't think the way they tried to teach physics in lecture was entirely useful. We used smartPhysics again, and I think it's okay. Professor Maruyama never seemed entirely confident in what she was saying, which made me doubtful of what I was being taught. Sometimes, she would teach us the wrong thing and follow up in an email what was right. There are weekly written psets, weekly online psets, prelectures and checkpoints before each class, two midterms, and a final. There's also attendance, which is taken with clicker questions during lecture.",
    "If you have to take it, I guess it's fine. Much easier than Physics 200, although it is taught much worse.",
    "A survey through EM. Be prepared for a lot of tedious smartphysics, that will often leave you more confused than before the prelecture. If you have Professor Maruyama, don't count on lecture to clarify anything. Go to the TEAL homework sessions, they are very helpful.",
    "I would recommend it for students who enjoy physics, and don't expect spectacular lecturers.",
    "phys 181 is HARD. while phys 180 was easier than 170, 181 is definitely harder than 171. you really need to have a strong grasp of all concepts and problems that are covered by the prelectures, lectures, and homework assignments. Also, DO THE SMALL STUFF. each midterm is only like 15% of the grade or something like that. with pre-lectures, checkpoints, online homework, written homework, and clicker participation all counting toward your grade, doing well on these small assignments can be the difference between a good and bad grade",
    "DO NOT TAKE IT (esp. with Reina). Please do yourself a favor if you're pre-med and take 170\/171.",
    "I don't care what everyone else says, but smart physics is really helpful. I took AP physics in high school, but smart physics helped me to finally actually understand the concepts. Lectures are basically a repetition of smartphysics. No need to read the book. Problem sets can be challenging - I wish I had gone to study hall hours to talk them through with the TFs. Midterms are fair, should be easy if you study, no tricky problems",
    "I would not recommend this class. It was not well run, it had a lot of work that was not adequately explained beforehand, and it had little help for confusing concepts.",
    "This class is a never ending stream of work, lecture is boring and has no added advantage as you do not learn anything from the actual professor. Do not take it just as a science credit, this is a horrible class that made many of my friends completely change their majors. It is classes like this one that helps students understand why Yale is not known for STEM.",
    "Physics 181 is an introductory level physics lecture which focuses on the fundamentals of Electricity and Magnetism related topics. I would definitely recommend taking this class over the 260 and 200 level courses, if you are not a 100% sound in physics. Make sure to take this course with Bonnie Flemming; while she is not the greatest teacher, Fleming is hands-down a better instructor than Reina. She is much, much more helpful.",
    "clearly, if you're reading this review, you're trying to decide between professors or perhaps even physics sections (because god knows no one would take this class for funsies). i do not recommend Reina's section. while I have no doubt that she is a highly qualified researcher, she lack the teaching ability necessary to provide you with a strong foundation in physics. and since you have to attend class (there are clickers), it's only worthwhile to do other physics homework with the background noise of her teaching. if you can't work with noise in the background, you're out of luck. you're looking at 2 hours of wasted time each week, since the amount you'll get out of lecture is very little. often times, i found that paying attention in lecture confused me more than it taught me. she wouldn't work out the examples beforehand (let's hope this changes) and would contradict herself several times per lecture. it was so frustrating. if you must take this class, i wish you the best of luck. attend studyhall if you need help and reach out to your TFs.",
    "You're probably taking this course because you have to. It's either a requirement or pre-req for dozens or majors. I wouldn't rate this half as badly, as introductory courses have to cover a lot of material in a short time, but unlike most courses I've taken in this category, attendance is compulsory and part of your grade. Generally with required intro courses, you already know most of the material, and are taking it because either you don't have proof or you need to fill in gaps. My normal approach, therefore, is to show up only for the classes which cover material that I'm less familiar with. The whole \"clicker\" \/ \"prelecture\" idea moves learning from an intrinsic motivation to fill gaps in understanding to an extrinsic motivation to tick the boxes. I would show up because I was required to, never figuring out if I should be listening or not, because my only motivation for being there was my clicker credit. I'm not going to start on smart physics, which I'm sure the other reviewers have covered thoroughly.",
    "Alright. Let's be real here. One should not take PHYS 181 unless they need it for their major. If you do not need it for your major, find something else. Anything else. Maybe physics and astronomy! It will be undoubtedly more interesting than this class. For those that do need it for their major, I understand. I was in that boat. I can speak more on deciding between PHYS 181 and PHYS 201. I took PHYS 200 last semester and barely made it out alive. I decided to take PHYS 181 because I wanted a lighter workload and a more basic introduction to E&M. I did get both of these things; however, the material was pretty dull. At least SmartPhysics, the online program, made the learning process smoother. Talking to my PHYS 201 friends, the professor was great, but the material and workload still was rough. Also if you do take this course, try to not take it with Maruyama. She was very dull and sometimes seemed to be confused by the material. If I did not have a scheduling conflict, I would have gone with the other professor. The decision is up to you. If you really like physics, I would advise you to go upwards to PHYS 201 or, if you really love it, PHYS 261. If you just need it for your major and want to get out of physics later, take PHYS 181.",
    "Only take it if you have to",
    "Do not take this class, unless you enjoy teaching yourself Physics E and M. Going to class does not teach you much of anything, just have to learn it using smart physics and on your own. This is doable, since I never took any E and M previously and was able to keep up with the course.",
    "I would say to take this if you want a relatively chill (compared to the other physics classes) class that's comparable to AP Physics.",
    "If you're taking this, you probably have to. It was a poorly taught class and the curve is horribly bad. I suggest doing 171 if you can. Some majors require 181, but you can get away with taking 171. I strongly suggest going that route.",
    "Don't take this class unless you absolutely have to. I would recommend 201 or 171. Unless they get rid of Smart Physics.",
    "Not a good class, but try to take it with Prof. Flemming.",
    "Its a good straight forward class, albeit difficult",
    "Take it with a different prof. You will be teaching yourself everything with her",
    "This class is your standard 2nd semester physics. If you have a choice of instructors, avoid Maruyama at all costs and go for Fleming. Smartphysics continues in 181, so brace yourself. Generally harder. If you took 180, did ok-ish and are premed, spare yourself the trouble and just take 171.",
    "If you've taken Physics C in high school, take PHYS 201 or 261 instead. Seriously. PHYS 181 truly is an introductory course, and with 181 you won't leave with a better understanding of E&M at all. In fact, you'll probably just be frustrated by the clicker requirements and the abomination that is SmartPhysics. I took this course thinking that it'd be an easy review of high school physics, but it's annoyingly work-intensive. You have to keep up with clicker points, double-duty online AND written homework, and a surprise grade cutoff at the end of the semester. I left wishing that I had taken a more challenging class that gave me a better appreciation of E&M.",
    "It depends on Your teacher - I heard the other section's teacher was much more easy to follow but I didn't really get much from the lectures and learned this class from smartphysics, other students and myself.",
    "Physics 181 is an introduction to electricity and magnetism. This year we did it with this online program called Smart physics and basically it made the lectures obsolete because it provides online lectures that are mandatory for the class. The class has a lot of work. Sometimes up to three online lectures a week plus up to 3 online homeworks a week plus a written homework.",
    "Take it if you have to, otherwise I did not really enjoy this class and felt that it dampened my interest in physics. The smartphysics system does not really help you learn the material and is incredibly tedious. The exams were ok, but without any practice questions with similar difficulty, I felt that I was sometimes under-prepared for the exams.",
    "Hard class definitely.",
    "This class was nothing but a disappointment. Reina Maruyama had never taught a class before and to have such an unqualified instructor was a very poor reflection on Yale and further, hinders Yale's progress in STEM. This type of experience breaks the spirit of STEM majors. Any attempts to learn were met with Reina's incompetence, as she never prepared for lecture. During almost every class, she would incorrectly solve a problem and after students would point out a mistake, she would be unable to figure them out. Although this is only an introductory level course, the approximately 200 students who take it deserve an experienced professor. Some of the TAs were helpful but they avoided Sunday night study hall, the night students needed the most help. During, weeknights very few students attended the study halls, with each being run by about 3 TAs. Over 40 students would attend Sunday night study halls, again only staffed by 3 TAs. The students would benefit much more if there were enough TAs when they were needed. The entire course relied too heavily on the smartPhysics resources. While it is a very valuable supplement, it should not be the sole material of the class. I hope that this summer, the Physics Department makes a serious effort to redesign this course.",
    ".. This course is a true travesty of a physics course. To think that an elite institution like Yale is unable to produce its own physics curriculum that can fit between the rigor of Phys 201\/261 and the less-intense Phys 171 without resorting to SmartPhysics is absolutely absurd. The only purpose for attending lecture was to press the buttons of my clicker, which had no purpose since half the time, they were checkpoints we already did beforehand, and the other half the time, the questions had wrong answers labeled. Unfortunately, when you have no choice but to take either 181 or 201, and you know that you cannot handle the intensity of 201 without getting a terrible grade due to the rigor of your other courses, then you\u2019re stuck with this course. I would still recommend this course, but ONLY if you are required to take a physics course equivalent to or higher in difficulty than 181 AND do not have the time to invest in 201 or 261. If you do take this course, do not take with Prof. Maruyama, so long as it is within your control. While it is evident that she is bound by the Smartphysics format (and that is a huge boundary), the least Prof. Maruyama could do is look over the slides Smartphysics made for her before presenting them to the class. Multiple times throughout the semester, there were many incorrect answers on the lecture slides, creating some confusion. While that might not be the biggest concern, what is alarming is that when students attempted to correct these mistakes, on multiple occasions, Prof. Maruyama was not able to work through the problem on her own and had to wait until later to post clarifications to the incorrect answers on the lecture slides.",
    "Do not take this with Reina. It is painful.",
    "I would recommend PHYS 181 to another student as an easy way to get their physics requirements done. The lectures were practically useless, but if you put in the out-of-class busy-work, you'll learn some E&M. However, avoid taking this course with Maruyama.",
    "I feel like I learned almost nothing and that it took so much time and a lot of outside effort to learn that almost nothing. No way I would have gotten through this class without my friends (solidarity I'm struggling) and TAs\/science tutors",
    "Physics 181 is a very bland and poorly taught intro course. If they are still using the awful smartphysics system steer clear of it like the plague, I'm not joking.",
    "I cannot recommend this course as it was taught this year. Lectures were frustrating due to a host of issues from tiny font and errors in the slides and example problems. The quality of 181 vs 171 seems to vary across years (since you likely have to take one of these two) so shopping both might help one choose the lesser of two evils. Shopping both sections of 181 might also help in this respect. On the plus side, 181 is pretty standard now with smartphysics, so you usually have a good idea of what you're expected to learn. The work is non-trivial but you will probably end up learning at least something. That said, not a very inspiring class.",
    "Overall, this was a pretty poorly taught physics class. We didn't have a textbook, the online learning\/homework program was pretty bad, lectures were generally a waste of time, the per tutors were not very helpful, and countless other things. I basically self-studied for this class and just stuck it out through the semester. If you are genuinely interested in physics, take one of the other introductory courses. If you are just taking physics as a premed and want to do standard physics (not biologically-focused physics like 171), you might want to consider taking this class as it basically covers AP level physics and goes a tad bit beyond. If you are willing to put in the extra effort from your own side, and\/or were pretty comfortable with AP level physics, it shouldn't be too difficult.",
    "Only take if necessary.",
    "The course could be really great, especially with it's recent move to SmartPhysics, but check the professors first. It does matter which one you choose.",
    "Don't take this class unless you absolutely have to. It was my least favorite class this year. Lectures are boring and unhelpful, and the SmartPhysics system that 180\/181 now uses is a pain. If you're actually interested in physics, I'd recommend taking 260\/261. The intro physics class at Yale are just generally horrible. If you have to take this class, make sure you are diligent about completing the tedious online checkpoints and lectures, and about taking your clicker to lectures. Yeah, it makes you feel like a high school student to have such arbitrary requirements, but it's a frustratingly easy way to lose points if you don't complete them.",
