    "Absolutely! I love DS!",

    "Take second semester DS. It's worth it. You really start to feel that things are coming together. You get a grasp of the Western tradition, which is the reason why you started DS. Finish it out; you got this. Also, take it with Professor Grigoryan if you can. Professor Grigoryan is such a wonderful human being. I loved having her this semester. She really knows her stuff and cares about her students. She is scholar of War and Peace and Anna Karenina, so whichever you do, you'll have an expert guiding you through the work. She also knows French, so Madame Bovary and Proust are especially delightful. Overall, though, she's a great literary mind. She has a knack for unravelling these texts. You won't be disappointed. Just so you know, however, she has you post on a student forum before every meeting. At first, this was annoying, but I appreciated its value as the semester went on, because it helps you develop your thoughts on the texts. The more you write about them, the more you understand them. Best of luck! PS -- Second semester DS Lit reading doubles...",
    "Yes. You learn more in a year in DS than I feel some Yale students learn in their whole time here.",
    "I would definitely if you have the time to read all the works.",
    "I definitely would. It's a lot of work, but it feels like a true accomplishment.",
    "I would definitely encourage another student to take this course if they were interested in literature. Of course, this is a directed studies course and therefore comes with the other directed studies courses, but I would recommend the program to anyone who was even vaguely interested in the humanities."
