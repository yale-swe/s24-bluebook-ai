    "This course is great if you want an introduction to India's modern era history, specifically its path to democracy. Many of the topics discussed in this course can be applied to other developing countries and aspiring democracies too, so the content extends beyond its immediate sphere. Professor Palshikar is very approachable and a good teacher. Take it if you can!",
    "good intro to indian politics. professor makes honest effort to get the material across to the class. seminar setting.",
    "Yes. Great way to learn about modern India",
    "A nice cover of Indian political history from independence to the present day. I would definitely recommend this class because it is well structured, the professor is brilliant, and the readings are wonderful. It's also not a joke class- you must be prepared to do the readings in advance and study for the midterm. If you can stay on top of the work, you will get a lot from the class and succeed.",
    "Yes - you learn about the history behind how India obtained its Independence. For the 2nd half you do a presentation on an election post independence and then write a final paper on a recent election&a political party. The course is broad is not focused on a narrow time span. You don't go much into political theory either - it's more of a history\/ what do these election results imply type of course."
