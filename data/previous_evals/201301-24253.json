   "comments": [
    "The readings are great. Laura Wexler is extremely smart and caring and at the forefront of the field. The photographs you look at are next level, but all that being said, this class is what you make of it. You can slack off or you can pull off an awesome research project. Both photography and memory are really interesting fields in the humanities right now, especially with the rise of digitization and new technology. Being in the gallery and the Beinecke all the time was also pretty awesome - you get to see a lot of work that isn't normally displayed.",
    "Yes. Its fun.",
    "Yes. A really excellent class that gives you the freedom to study what you want to study.",
    "This class was fantastic. Professor Wexler obviously cares a lot about the topic and she puts a lot of time into the syllabus. The class is basically an analysis of many pieces of philosophical work on the relationship between memory and Photography, so if you don't find the topic appealing then definitely do not take it. However, if you do then I definitely recommended. There is a lot of room for personal research in the final project and you can approach it from your own angle. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in photography as an influential medium, or anyone interested in the philosophy behind memory.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "Great opportunity to dive into a set of family photographs of your own, or any set of images your've ever been curious about. Conversations in section were great, and we watched some cool movies too. Only class I felt very compelled to go to this semester.",
    "A good survey class of several large literatures. Prof Wexler can be somewhat unorganized so you need to figure out what the readings and assignments are for each class by yourself. It gives you an excuse to hang out in the YUAG which is a real privilege. I'd say, if you're interested in the subject matter, take it!",
    "A class where you explore the intersection of history, memory, and photography. You read some pretty dense theoretical texts that are interesting and rewarding. The class is very open-ended, and the main project is a 15 page paper where you read a \"set\" of photographs (any group you want) against a text (either one we've read or haven't). If you're at all interested in photography in a way that isn't art history but social\/cultural history, definitely take it. You read some great stuff."
