    "It will all be over soon.",
    "The first half is speedy econ and the second is the largest literature review of your undergraduate years, known as your senior ChemE project.",
    "The project is proposing a company that, using metabolic engineering, makes biofuels (the groups were terpenes, higher alcohols, and fatty acids) from second generation type sources. Get in a good group - not necessarily your friends but people who will work hard. It helps to have one person with an economics, and maybe one with an environmental background was well. The groups were big. Our class was 21 (19 ChemEs, 2 EnvEs) so we had three groups of seven. It sounds like a lot of people and it is. It helps with splitting the tasks up, but paper writing with that many people is surprisingly hard. Just try not to kill each other. Just because someone doesn't agree with you doesn't mean they are stupid or that they think you are stupid. Act like adults, you are nearly there.",
    "The first half is a fairly interesting foray into economics (unless you already know economics). The second half is a group project for which the topic is assigned but groups are not. This class teaches skills that could be very handy working as a chemical engineer (process diagrams, cost analysis, how to write a proposal, etc.). My only complaint is that it is not very fun to spend half a semester researching if you aren't interested in the assigned topic.",
    "It's interesting that you sort of review and tie together a lot of the concepts you learned throughout the major. However, it's not executed very well. Specifically, the focus on a bio-heavy final design project is not useful for most of us. I did learn a lot of new things about metabolic engineering, but that is because we had to entirely teach it to ourselves, as usual. Good luck, you have to take it so as with everything else just get through it.",
    "Not a bad culmination of the chemical engineering program of study. Both van Tassel and Wilson are great.",
    "I don't think this class makes any sense. Half a semester is used for random exploration of Chemical Engineering related topics and the remainder of a senior project that you do not even get to select.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The lectures at the beginning of the course are interesting and teach important concepts related to designing a plant process. These lectures definitely compliment and add to material taught in previous engineering classes. The senior design component of the class can be hit or miss, depending on the assigned topic. The topic wasn't revealed until halfway through the class, and it ended up being on second generation biofuels which very few people in the class had a background in. That said, it was a lot of fun to work with a group and felt like a nice, collaborative way to finish engineering coursework. Further, the workload for this class is very manageable.",
    "Better senior requirement than a thesis, but the final project can be a drag if your group is struggling.",
    "Encourage the professors to change the way the project is set up. Right now, it is a disappointment and definitely not a capstone to your undergraduate Chemical Engineering career. The first half of the class is not a work and is fairly interesting.",
    "This course was an underwhelming capstone for the chemical engineering major. Our final project (on biofuels) required a background in biology, which most students didn't have. Also, the guidelines for the final project were sort of unclear."
