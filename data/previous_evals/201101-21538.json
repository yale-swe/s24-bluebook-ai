    "You need to take it, but I wouldn't recommend you take it with Calinescu if possible. Don't get the wrong idea; she certainly isn't a bad instructor, but I felt that her lectures just rehashed the book and didn't add much. For instance, she often uses the example problems in the book, so if you read the book, it was boring and not helpful. I decided to just learn from the (very well-written) book instead, but if you're the type of person that needs a lecture to learn, Calinescu's lectures will absolutely help, and you should take it with her.",
    "exactly what did in BC calc or 115, but in more dimensions. did you like BC or 115...?",
    "I would recommend Math 120 if you genuinely like math or need this class for your major or pre-med requirements. To be honest, some of the material in this course made me rethink my perception of myself as someone who is \"good at math.\" That being said, however,I do feel that I learned a lot from this course. I think that overall, Professor Calinescu is a good teacher to take the class with, as she gave clear explanations and was always prepared for class and willing to help. However, she wasn't personally invested in or excited by the material (not that I can blame her for that), so sometimes if we asked a question about the derivation or application of a concept, she wouldn't be able to answer unless the syllabus required it. Be aware that even if you do well on the homework, the midterms and final are not to be taken lightly; you have to have a genuinely strong, holistic conceptual understanding of all of the material. The exams really test problem-solving skills, not just rote application of formulas.",
    "I'd definitely recommend students take math120, but I'd recommend a different instructor. Calinescu was a sub-par teacher (for the reasons given above).",
    "MATH 120 is a very straight forward math course. If you go to class (or read the book), do all the homework, and study the practice exams, you will do well. It did not require too much time, but you could not blow it off either. The Midterms and Final are graded particularly harshly, so that can be an issue.I recommend this course if you're looking for multivariable.From what I've heard, the quality of your teacher will determine your enjoyment of this class. Finding a good teacher is crucial. I had Calinescu, and she was pretty good.If you have a bad teacher, you're probably better off just reading the book.",
    "I would only take this class if you absolutely need it for a credit and are truly interested in math.",
    "Not if you can avoid it, even if you think you are good at math."
