    "If you are interested in journalism in any way TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Brill is tough, but he genuinely wants to help you improve and WILL help you improve. He is a great resource and always makes himself available. Be prepared to work hard and have some things you write get shot down, but trust me, it's worth it.",
    "Great",
    "Yes. This course is a gem. While I came to the class with a political science background and little journalistic experience (many students in the class are inevitably on staff for campus publications), I found the class to be wonderful. I learned a lot and my writing improved tremendously. This class is demanding, though. It will take over your semester and sometimes you will be frustrated with Brill. At the end of the day though, he is working in your best interests and you will thank him for it. Take this class! It's one of the best I've taken at Yale.",
    "Take it!",
    "He will make you work hard, and you will suffer going to class THAT early in the morning. He will be brutally honest with you, and he'll put you on the spot. He'll teach you more than a lot of other classes teach you, and he will make your writing better. He is tough, but fair, and you get the sense that is really giving you a glimpse behind the scenes the journalism world. Take it!",
    "It makes you so much better at writing. But only take it of you're thinking about journalism as a proffession.",
    "Take it if you can, especially if you want to be a journalist.",
    "Great introduction to practices of journalism. Prepare to work hard and have what you take for granted in the news called into question. Enjoyable reading and class times, good variety of exercises. I would definitely recommend it, especially with this instructor.",
    "TAKE IT. Prof Brill is tough, but that's ultimately much more helpful than having a professor who never offers real criticism.",
    "Definitely a worthwhile seminar if you're interested in journalism or are considering pursuing a career in it. It will sharpen the way you consume news and the way you think about your journalistic pursuits. Don't ever show up or turn in anything even a minute late, though.",
    "If you are interested in the media, journalism, or becoming a journalist, this class is the ultimate introduction -- \"How to Be a Reporter 101.\" Its strengths are in Brill's extensive experience and adeptness. He can read a classroom really well; the assignments are both challenging and fun; and he has connections that allowed us to take an amazing field trip to the New York Times, to meet Gay Talese, and to tele-conference with Bob Woodward. I now feel like I have the knowledge and the skills to understand the production of news, to critique it, and to produce it myself with ethical and technical confidence. Best of all, Brill is an awesome character and can prove an amazing mentor."
