    "It is a fun class, that covers a lot of grammar, but also includes good stories and movies.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in improving your Italian skills,this is a great way to do it without focusing too much on grammar.",
    "L3 is essentially a review of the grammar from L1 and L2, so it's a great way to cement what you've already learned and that also means it's not terribly difficult. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to get a firmer grasp on Italian. Writing a 400-450 word composition every week is very time consuming on the weekend, but there is rarely any work during the week beyond studying for the 5 tests over the course of the semester."
