    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in environmental issues at any level. I think it's critical to understanding the issues - even if you do disagree with some of the views expressed!",
    "Good for a basic understanding of environmental\/natural resources. You will learn to think about issues in a new light.",
    "I strongly recommend the course. It provides an essential foundation of how to manage environmental issues though an economics perspective. The workload is average and the exams and quizzes are fair. The instructor is outstanding.",
    "I would highly recommend the class whether or not you have an economics background. You will learn a lot and stretch your thinking.",
    "I would recommend the course to other students, as a useful introduction to the economics of natural resources. I would however suggest that it is important to be proactive with the the paper requirement.The course gives a thorough overview of the economics of climate change and natural resources, at an undergraduate, intermediate level. The graduate requirement to produce a paper then enables the student to take an aspect of the courseto a greater depth."

   "comments": [
    "See above. My understanding of the issues thus far was science-based. Understanding the social science analysis is critical to creating solutions that address both the science AND the implications from a cost\/social perspective.",
    "I did not know much about this subject before. This course has changed many basic views I have about environment\/natural resources.",
    "This course was absolutely critical for my career and research in environmental economics. The class gave me a very solid foundation that I can build on now with more advanced courses. The class helped me develop a research proposal in the environmental economics field so it was well integrated into my research plans. The class was also critical to deepen my understanding about climate change and help me plan my future career and research.",
    "Having no background in natural resource economics the second half of the course was particularly useful in deepening my knowledge of this area. Since I already had a decent knowledge of the economics of climate change, the first half of the course was content I was already familiar with, but coming from an essay-based background the problem sets for this part ensured I gained a more technical understanding of the theory."
