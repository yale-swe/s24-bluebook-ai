    "A course discussing the importance of moral emotions like empathy and disgust in our daily lives and whether they are worth trying to hold on to. I would recommend this class if you are interested in somewhat philosophical discussions and also perhaps have some background in psychology. If you're looking for a more hardcore psychology course in which you'll learn about a lot of new empirical findings, however, this probably isn't the class for you.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "This class addressed some of the oldest and most difficult questions in philosophy using tons of new data that really bear on modern ethics. I would highly recommend the class.",

    "Not too much, just because it's a little outside my realm of interest, but it was still a very fun course.",
    "It exposed me to research I would not otherwise look at. Very interesting class that has impacted the course of my own research.",
    "A significant portion of my research is in the evolution of moral emotions and how those bear on behavior. This class addressed those topics in great detail and helped to refine my thinking. The material in this class will be highly relevant to my future research and likely my dissertation."
