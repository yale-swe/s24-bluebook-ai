    "The material is very interesting and this is the first class where everything you've been learning for chemical engineering really comes together. That being said, the class is poorly structured and Pfefferle does a bad job of making the material as interesting and engaging as it should be. The textbook is really good, and I would definitely recommend reading it. However, it can sometimes be difficult to motivate yourself to do that because of how the class is taught.",
    "UC Boulder created a series of videos that correspond to the textbook this class uses. Find them and watch them if you want to learn reactor design problems.",
    "It's a fundamental course in the major and is required as well.",
    "One of the most important topics in the Chemical Engineering curriculum. Sadly, it is not done justice. The hundreds of pages of packets given out are extremely disorganized and most learning will be done through the book. However, if I wanted to learn Chemical Kinetics from a book, I would not need to be at Yale to do it.",
    "This is a required course for chemical engineering, and it won't be your hardest class junior year but it won't necessarily be your easiest. Do the practice tests!"
