   "comments": [
    "This course was interesting and I think very helpful for those who will be making policy in their careers. I did not feel that everything we talked about was relevant for me as someone who is going into hospital administration, though it is a capstone for the Health Policy& Administration track. The readings, though, were interesting and the papers were thought-provoking.",
    "strengths: really well organized class. Always know what to expect with discussion. The Prof. is incredibly knowledgable and engaging.Weaknesses: I did not feel as though this course was truly a culmination of the things that I have learned at YSPH in the health policy track. The subject matter seemed geared towards someone who is writing policy (which is certainly a part of health policy). However, I would have been more excited to learn about how to evaluate current health policy more, as that will be what 95% of the students will be doing for the foreseeable future. I also felt like we talked about issues like sex education, and obesity disproportionately more than things like payment reform or the implementation of insurance exchanges - things that in my personal opinion are a little more germane to current health policy conversations.",
    "I did not feel as if the material taught in this course was appropriate for a Health Policy Capstone. It assumed that every student in the department wanted to be a policy analyst and work on the hill. The majority of students in the department are actually interested professionally in administration and consulting, so this course, though interesting, is not really relevant. This course was primarily a political science course, with some health policy. I really think the HPA faculty need to completely reorganize this course. Professor Schlesinger is a great professor, but the course was very disappointing.",
    "Excellent review of methods of policy development.",
    "This course is very well thought out the way it is. However, there were too many people in the course. It was difficult to have a small group discussion.",
    "The course content is good but seems inappropriate to be a capstone, as it caters to mostly the policy but not the administration component of our program.It could be improved by making it more of the administration, even more global (good job for this year's content compared to last year. Also, the readings are so much but enjoyable. However, the volume dissuades one from even attempting to read. I think highlighting the most relevant pages of a reading would be helpful.",
    "Compared to a thesis, the capstone course is much much more work. Three papers all at least 15 pages. Tons of weekly reading (that people usually don't do until it's necessary for the projects, and even then their utility is questionable). Mark is very critical in his paper comments, which sets high expectations. That's good to a certain extent, but be careful not to drive yourself too crazy trying to write the perfect paper for him, because it doesn't exist. Sometimes the material in the course seems a bit pie-in-the-sky \"mental massaging,\" which can be frustrating if you prefer the concrete.",
    "I am still not clear what I was supposed to get out of this course. I understand that health policy students should understand the process of getting policy legistated and implemented at the federal\/state\/local levels. However, for students who do not want to have careers that are really politically oriented, this class (and the first year class) are really too long, too drawn-out, and too in-depth. It is not clear to me that having two quite similar courses that are taught by Professor Schlesinger required for the health policy students is really necessary. It seems that the first year course and the Capstone course could be combined into a one semester course. The topics could be covered more quickly, with possibly some topics delved into more deeply, but not all of them. Also the style of teaching, which seems very Socratic, with two hours spent in a question-answer session - was interesting and helpful at times, however, in other ways it made the class very slow and plodding. Most of the students seemed quite zoned out (on their computers reading email and looking on the web) and didn't participate in the discussion. For policy students interested in taking other classes thatoffered other important and interesting skills and perspectives, spending two semesters (rather than one very efficient semester) on this material was frustrating.",
    "Strengths- instructor's commitment and knowledgeWeakness- Group assignment can be better structured",
    "This is an excellent class, overall. I'm so happy that I've had the opportunity to take two of mark's classes at ysph. I feel like I learned a new way of thinking about policy analysis and other various health policy topics\/issues. I liked the format of the class , with the more theoretical readings and then the case based application. I do think some of the assignments could be changed for the better though. I think the first assignment is great and wouldn't change it. The second assignment though could be changed to a more relevant topic. I understand what the motivation behind the prohibition topic is, but I think the assignment would be more relevant and easier to approach if the topic were something like abortion. I also think the second assignment needs to be pushed up a week or two because I felt that there wasn't enough time between that and the third assignment. The third assignment is a really great brain exercise, but I wish we had more \"check in\" assignments, like an annotated bibliography or a small class presentation a few weeks before the final paper was due, to help us stay on track\/task.I also wish we had at least one small assignment, like a 2-3 page one, that we could use as a writing sample for jobs. Overall though, I enjoyed this class, it was my favorite of the semester.",
    "The information is interesting and the instructor is very knowledgeable. Though I don't think there's a lot that can be directly applicable to the work that most students want to do, I will say that the class is a good exercise for self-evaluation and thinking about the theory behind being a professional in the policy world.",
    "Great course. Very interesting substantively and useful.",
    "Nice capstone of policy study",
    "The course is fantastic. It addresses key issues and ideas that are relevant for understanding US health policy and its pathologies.",
    "Strengths: breadth& depth of theoretical& academic health policy topics, exploration of complexities of health policyWeaknesses: lack of practical applications (aside from optional media assignment), lack of opportunity to analyze \"live\" health policy happenings (e.g., watching a relevant debate or hearing and reflecting upon it), orientation toward job readiness in field (e.g., lack of easily digestible deliverables that would be used on-the-job or presented alongside a job application), needs more content on PPACA, needs to better coordinate Capstone assignment due dates with that of other Capstone given sheer complexity of assignments, students who write theses shouldn't be required to complete final paper in Capstone!, if assignments remain as is, Capstone should count for 1.5 credits",
    "Susan Whalen forced me to take this class when a scheduling conflict for another required class was discovered AFTER Spring semester began. I read the syllabus and read as many of the articles as I could. It was difficult to read 20-30 articles per week for six classes in the semester. I'm not sure what I was supposed to learn. I certainly don't feel prepared to be a policy analyst.The professor's emails were voluminous and verbose. I had trouble figuring out the point of them, because they were so long. One email to the class stated, with regard to the ABIM, \"examine what lessons it holds for getting health care professionals to look past their wallets.\" This is an outrageous and offensive comment.The group project was a waste of time. I had 3 other group projects to complete in the semester. It is nearly impossible to get all group members to meet outside of class. I rushed to turn in my portion of the paper by deadline. As a result, I didn't learn much at all.Not really sure why composing press releases was so important.Don't buy the textbooks by Marone and Ciadini are a waste of money.The best part of the course was the explanation of the 3 policy paradigms, and how the media affects the framing of public health policy."

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Professor Schlesinger knows the subject matter so well and is a really wonderful lecturer. He takes everyone's comments and ensures that they make sense, and is always able and willing to provide help whenever students ask for it.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0One of my favorite instructors at YSPH. probably the most skilled lecturer I have ever seen. Always so engaging and facilitates conversation really well. Deeply knowledgeable about all subjects we discuss in class.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Very thoughtful and stimulating in discussions. Has broad knowledge and experience. Very good detailed feedback.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is an amazing professor, one of the best at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a great teacher. It is clear that he puts a great deal of effort in his teaching.I think he can improve on getting to know the students better, as he has called students by names of the other lookalike. It does not come off well, if these students are ethnic minorities.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Professor Schlesinger is clearly extremely knowledgeable in this subject area. He is very nice and accessible. He clearly cares about students learning about this area. He asked us to think about interesting issues.However, Dr. Schlesinger's method of teaching, which appears to be Socratic, is very slow and plodding. Having the whole class taught in a method of asking question after question after question becomes very tedious. It seemed that we could have covered the material in the Capstone course and the first year course much more quickly (I think combining them into one course) if this method were used in a more targeted manner.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0friendly, approachable and covers wide array of topics",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a fantastic professor. I feel so lucky to have taken two of his classes. He has helped me expand my thinking and made me much stronger in the area of policy analysis. I don't think I have much to say as far as improving teaching style - I responded well to it.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is great. Very open to any comments or feedback in class, welcoming to class discussion. Very good at facilitating discussion even when students struggled to keep up with readings.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0I did poorly in this class, I guess, but about Mark, I always think he is the most remarkable teacher, and the most suitable for this class. I feel lucky to have him as my instructor.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Dr. Schlesinger draws students out in a unique way, while at the same time requiring them to process new concepts.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Strengths: sheer knowledge and expertise in health policy, thoughtful instruction, recognition and sharing of complexities of health policy, flexibility and willingness to meet and provide feedback or a listening ear to difficult questionsWeaknesses: number of unanswered questions in class, overly complex questioning around subject matter - should convey complexities one layer at a time versus concurrent blanketing",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Think before you email comments that will offend your students.Use a TA to help you grade assignments. Grading took so long that I had already started the next paper that was due without comments from the previous assignments to guide me.Assign fewer readings."

    "This course goes through three paradigms of policy analysis and builds on them to discuss how to overcome policy-making challenges, whether media coverage, bringing together diverse stakeholders, etc. It requires students to do readings in preparation for discussion each week and there are three main papers throughout the course. I would recommend this course to a student interested in policy-making and political science.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student - but i would not frame it as truly a capstone course. My personal feeling on a capstone is that it would serve as the bridge between what we have learned in the classroom and how to apply it to the real world once you leave. I feel like this was a really good course on developing policy, and thinking about analyzing policy through theoretical frameworks.",

    "Great policy course. Changes your perspective of policy decision making",

    "An agonizing experience but when you look back, you will be glad you were here",
    "I would not recommend this course. Take Dr Nembhard's Health Care Management Capstone."
