    "This course covers basic convective, conductive, and radiative heat transfer in a variety of applications. While the topic is mildly interesting, I can safely say that I learned very little this semester due to the poor quality of instruction. I feel that I now understand conceptually how some of these problems are approached, however, I don't believe I would be able to actually solve a problem in real life after taking this class and get a meaningful result.",
    "I gained a pretty basic understanding of how different forms of heat transfer work and how energy is modeled in different systems.",
    "I learned that non-dimensional numbers are related through some voodoo magic. There is no theory that explains heat transfer and so the only thing to learn is - someone, somewhere, sometime has recorded some data that you need and plotted some fit to it. Find that graph and you have the answer.",
    "Honestly, not sure I gained a single bit of knowledge, even a tiny skill, or bit of insight from this course. It was definitely the most poorly taught course I have ever taken in my life - the instructor didn't teach well, gave instructions that were so confusing I think I actively unlearned things, randomly added things to assignments without notifying the rest of the class, and was just overall not there to support us. The material is hard, it's part of the course, but it was infinitely harder when we were given no assistance from any member of the teaching staff.",
    "This class is centered around three forms of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation. I feel that I gained a pretty good handle on the three types of radiation, particularly convection. More importantly, I learned how to make accurate approximations and assumptions, so that I can use the mathematic modeling of this class to address real life and real industry challenges.",
    "I learned how to approach and model heat transfer problems",
    "I learned about the principles behind the way heat is transferred in convection, conduction and radiation. I also developed an understanding for how the heat flow changes with respect to the varying degrees of resistance different mediums present.",
    "This course was useful in that it taught how to make assumptions and make approximations in order to simplify a problem.",
    "How to model simple conductive, convective, and radiative heat flows. Dimensional analysis as a tool for approximating solutions to more complex differential equations."

   "comments": [
    "The content of this course is not an issue---it covers a variety of topics that are relevant to many engineering applications. That said, there were many issues with the teaching (described in my feedback on the instructor).",
    "It's a hard course and hard material. There's no getting past the pure difficulty of this class. However, I thought it was very good at helping us to develop a basic sense of intuition for certain situations and making assumptions for different scenarios. But the most prevalent weakness was the lack of standardized problem solving. I didn't really get a good sense of what procedures I should do to solve certain problems.",
    "Heat transfer is not required by the ABET board. Yale SEAS would be wise to consider why and to further consider removing this class. It was a waste of a Yale credit.",
    "Everything was a weakness of this course. I cannot stress enough how bad it is. It could be improved by completely destroying it and starting from scratch, nothing is salvageable.",
    "Dr. P is an excellent one on one teacher who really knows the material. I learned so much from working through problems with him and highly recommend that all students meet with him at least once a week. I found this class to be very rigorous and very useful. That said, Dr. P's lecturing could be a little bit more clear and the class would benefit from periodic signposting during solutions and derivations, so the class can better follow why Dr. P is writing what he is writing.",
    "This course deals in very complicated material and the textbook gives very few example problems. That sucks. In terms of interest, the material is very polarizing. Some find it fascinating others (read: I) find it mostly tedious.",
    "The weaknesses of the course can be summarized in two categories I think. The first category is the weaknesses of the instructor, which I will talk more about in the appropriate field. The second category is perhaps the way support and help is offered in the course and how lectures are structured vis a vis the textbook. Dr P organized weekly help sessions, but those were not that different from the lectures themselves. And the problem with that is, the lectures were incredibly hard to follow unless you had a very good understanding of what the book was talking about for that particular chapter, and the lectures were usually dominated by the few people who understood the material and carried the class. And the weekly help sessions were thus not very helpful to those who were behind or unclear on the material. They were only useful for those who had already understood the material and wanted to get done with the homework. The strength of the course was Dr P's willingness to meet 1-1 outside the class time to help out. However, the meetings usually were not very helpful because Dr P did not have a very structured way of explaining things. But he genuinely cared.",
    "I was not a fan of the textbook used.",
    "Course needs to focus more on the decisions that are considered when modeling heat flows and what assumptions are valid."

   "comments": [
    "Under no circumstances should anyone ever consider taking this course if it is still taught by Kailas and it is not required for your major. It was an all around miserable experience that I would not wish on anyone. If literally anyone else were teaching it, however, I suspect it would be comparable to MENG 361 in terms of interest and usefulness, so therefore I would slightly recommend it.",
    "If you're an ABET Mechanical Engineering major you have to take this class. There is no avoiding it, it is probably one of the hardest classes at Yale let alone within the engineering department. There are a couple things that make this class so hard, one, heat transfer has some very difficult subject matter. It's not something you can easily understand just based on intuition. Secondly was the organization of the class, sometimes the communication was confusing and a lot of things were left unclear. Honestly, unless you're an ABET Mechanical Engineering major or you're just really interested in heat transfer you'd probably come out best not taking this class.",
    "Avoid taking a class with Kailas at all costs. Delay requirements, beg the DUS, take a leave of absence instead. Heat transfer doesn't really make any sense because no one knows why certain molecules or setups do the things they do. There are two equations that govern everything in the entire class - there are unknown constants that change depending on the particulars on the question. A monkey could look up these values if, you know, there was a textbook that was useful (there was not). This class is a bonding experience for the students - Kailas' blatant incapacity to teach (though he is probably a good person?) really forces students to teach themselves everything. One plus - if you do a good job on the first two homeworks you will be set. Kailas was once handing back quizzes so we could study for the final and he literally just looked at us, wrote down a number on the top of the page, recorded the score, and handed us the quiz. Incorrect answers were given complete scores and pages with the correct answer and fewer written lines were given low scores. This is patently absurd.",
    "NO. Under no circumstances should anyone who is not an ABET Mechanical Engineer take this course, it is so so bad. And if you're an ABET Mechanical Engineer - consider switching majors.",
    "I would not recommend this class to someone who was not a Mechanical Engineering major. This class pulls material from previous mechanical engineering classes, such as thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and differential equations. That said, I would definitely recommend all Mechanical Engineering majors to take this class. Our A-BET program is accredited with a focus on fluid mechanics and heat transfer, and after taking this class I see why. Very rigorous, very practical, very in-depth. However, this is a class where you have to take your learning into your own hands. Meeting one on one with Dr. P is a must, as is stopping the lecture to ask questions.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE AS AN ELECTIVE. It is not worth the effort. Only take this course as an ABET mechanical engineer who has no choice in the matter. I recommend taking this course IN YOUR SENIOR SPRING because it really will not help you with your senior design project (MENG 489) in the slightest. Mechatronics and Computer Aided Engineering are **much** more helpful to actually build something. As for the course itself, the material is important, yes, but highly convoluted; Dr. P's lectures are excruciating to follow without meeting him about the material outside of class; and the problem sets are time-consuming and nigh on impossible to complete on your own.",
    "No. It is extremely poorly taught."
