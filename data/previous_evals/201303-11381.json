    "Don't take it. Professor Pinango is very knowledgeable in linguistics, and extremely sociable, but lacks basic teaching skills. She attempts to implement some sort of Socratic style of teaching, where she asks students a series of questions until they eventually reach the answer themselves. However, this method is highly time-consuming and frustrating for students. There were entire class periods where she spent most of the time trying to answer someone's question. By the time the student finally got the answer to his original question, we had hardly any time left for what was supposed to be taught in lecture that day. So if you ask her a question in class, be ready to answer several of her questions in return. Year after year Professor Pinango utilizes this method, and it never ceases to fail (see evaluations from previous years).Also, she is wishy-washy and hard to pin down on just about every topic (although admittedly many linguistics professors are). At times, she would rant for a half hour on the same point, and never really get anywhere in explaining it. Also, section was led by the professor, not by our attractive TA. It was basically just another hour of the class.Oh and she fixed the flaw in her exams where there were more points possible than there were total number of points. Consequently, the exams are a bit tougher now.Take \"Cognitive Science of Language\" instead. For those of you who disregard my advice and take this course anyway- good luck.",
    "If you don't have prior exposure to linguistics or neuroscience and want to learn a little of both, this is a good class; it goes at an easy pace and the workload is light, but you learn some interesting material. Pinango is very nice and cares a lot, but sometimes gets sidetracked for long periods of time during lecture, which is frustrating. The readings are interesting and not too long, but occasionally technical.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who's even mildly interested in linguistics or language. The course caters itself to your interest."
