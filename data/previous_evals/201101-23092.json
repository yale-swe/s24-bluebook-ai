    "Take it. Even if you're done with your language credits this class is enjoyable, pretty easy, and a great way to get closer to Marta who gladly writes recommendations to anything.",

    "Practice makes perfect. This class is a great opportunity to improve your language skills in portuguese by speaking a lot every day.",
    "It's an easy credit, but your Portuguese is not going to get much better.",
    "Yes, Marta is a very patient teacher and you will learn a lot."
