    "Very good course. Lots of info.",
    "Great class. Work load is manageable and you'll actually want to do the work and go to lecture. Take it!",
    "This is a survey course grounded in economics about various issues China will face in the future. The central lens through which the issues are tackled is that domestic commerce is necessary for Chinese future. It does explore issues from clean energy, to currency regulation etc.",
    "Good survey course to take if you're really interested in the subject. If this isn't your particular area of interest you might be a little bored.",
    "Yes. It would be a good class to credit\/d\/fail though",
    "I would recommend this class",
    "Definitely a must take. It provides you with a different way to look at China and the future of the country. Often times the media shapes our outlook of certain countries, but Roach does a great job of looking at China's past and what it need to do in the future to continue its prominence. Also not a lot of pressure in the class. Open notes midterm, take home final and a final paper on basically anything forward looking. Dont need to do all the reading but it helps.Definitely take the class.",
    "take it",
    "Take it if you want to learn the basics about China's economy. It's not a lot of work and it's interesting",
    "very interesting class. helps you really understand the chinese economy and global markets as a whole. not a lot of work, would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in china or macroeconomics in general",
    "take it",
    "Good survey course on current issues in China. Not difficult - take it for interest.",
    "An interesting course that is not too difficult but extremely repetitive. I hear this year the class was less repetitive than last year, so hopefully it will continue to improve. The most interesting material was from the readings, which were almost never discussed in lecture or in section, and are not necessary for the tests or essay. If you were really interested, you could learn the basic ideas of the course by reading the first ten pages of Roach's book.",
    "Yes I strongly recommend the class.",
    "The reading material makes for an excellent political-economic take on modern China. However, Roach gives the most boring and unproductive lectures I've ever encountered at Yale, so I definitely suggest taking treating this class as directed reading (and there will be a lot of it, especially if you do the optional reading or take it at the grad level).In terms of your ability to understand\/engage with some of the material, mostly the September stuff, it's best to have an intro macro\/finance background; but you can also pick some of that stuff up as you go along, or just get help from a friend who's taken macro.",
    "I would recommend The Next China to another student, albeit with caution. Understanding the economics behind the rise of China and where the country is headed (in the short term, as long term predictions are next to useless) is extremely important for any student at Yale, but I found I did not get as much out of the course as I would have wished (granted I took the class Credit\/D\/Fail, even though it was pretty easy). Although I did not do many of the readings, the lectures were often very repetitive (at least you get the key points drilled in). The class has a mid-term, paper proposal, final paper (10-5 pages) and a final exam. The final exam was at an inconvenient time for me (you have 48 hours to write about 2500 words right in the middle of exam period). If your looking for a less than rigorous economics course, this is for you - but if you want an really in-depth understanding of the rise of China, you'll need to look in other places.",
    "Great class as it is forward looking and applicable to general understanding of global economics.",
    "I would recommend this to a student who is introduced in US-China relations, particularly with respect to economic models. It's a great introduction into the overarching differences between the two nations, and specifically, the way China is changing.",
    "The class really has fascinating subject matter - it just needs to be taught a bit better. Roach is a bit repetitive but such a cool guy. Workload is not bad at all and the material is incredibly relevant. I'd highly recommend it provided that he livens up lectures a bit next year.",
    "If you like macro, take this class. It's a great overview to the next stage of China's development and it links with the future of many other nations. Lectures are interesting and the workload is light. Especially recommended for econ majors as quant-free course.",
    "GREAT!!",
    "Yes, China and its future growth is very important on the global scene.",
    "I would not recommend this class.",
    "Really really solid class. Open book midterm, term paper and take home final. The lectures are interesting, the material is stimulating and the sections are mandatory, but very relaxed and enjoyable.Great class to take whether you are an econ major or not.",
    "The material is interesting and relevant, and I definitely feel like a more educated person after taking it. There is a midterm exam, final exam, paper proposal, final paper, and weekly section.Some people find Professor Roach's lectures a bit dry, but I found the content interesting, so it was never an issue. It was always easy to pay attention.It's not very econ-heavy so anyone can take it.",
    "I would recommend it.You can gain much insight into China from a very different point of view.",
    "This is a great class for an introduction to the economics of China of the past 50 years. Prof. Roach is very knowledgeable and insightful. The class is focused on where China will go in the next 20 years, but you will learn a lot about where China came from and where it is now in order to better analyze the future.Workload is rather easy. Reading is definitely optional. I would recommend skimming prior to section in order to make a few insightful contributions.",
    "I would recommend this class to any econ major or anyone interested in China. I went into the class with no knowledge of the subject, but I was never lost. Professor Roach made sure everyone understood what was going on and was always very clear. I leave with a good understanding not only of China's economy, but also how the international population fits into it.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to anyone. China and its economy are on the news so much thesedays that it is really important to have an understanding of both. The class provides just the right level of depth to be knowledgeable about China's economic, political, and social problems without getting overwhelmed with the details.",
    "straightforward class that teaches a lot about the macro trends of china but covers too much to go into depth on any one subject",
    "Yes, it's a good chance to learn more about the other major power of the world.",
    "Great course, manageable work, take it!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, with some reservations. First, the course focuses on China\u0092s economy, namely its transition from an export-led model to a domestic consumption-based one; if you would like a course on China\u0092s politics or environment, look elsewhere. With that said, Professor Roach gives several good lectures on the prospects for democracy in China, environmental reform, and rural-urban migration. My second admonition is that the class is redundant. Professor Roach frequently repeats slides and graphs, and he describes the new consumption model dozens of times.Nonetheless, I am happy I took the class. I learned something invaluable about where China is headed, and I believe I understand better how China works internally. The course provides a history from Mao to the present, and the reading is very rich. I enjoyed the forward-looking research paper, and section never was too demanding.",
    "Yes. Interesting and important subject matter",
    "Great overview of China. If you take one class on China (which you should\u0096 since it will be the biggest economy in 20 years), take this one. Almost all the readings were really interesting, and there aren't too many classes at Yale that are \"forward-looking.\"Take the class",
    "This year we had a midterm, a paper, and a take-home final. the readings are extremely good but the exams, especially the take-home final is not a good test how how much you have learned at all. So if you take it, take it credit\/D.",
    "Take it if you don't know much about China and would like to know where it stands in the world right now.",
    "You learn about China and its transition model -- if this interests you, take it. Even if you don't find it enthralling, the framework is useful and it's always good to know a little bit about China.",
    "Great class! Professor Roach is hilarious and does a great job teaching. Yale is very lucky to have him as a professor. He is practical, insightful, and a great lecturer. I only wish he had been around earlier in my undergraduate career so I could take more of his courses. The workload for this course was very manageable, but most of the work comes at the end of the course so be aware of that. Overall, I would definitely recommend students to take it.",
    "The course gets very repetitive after certain point, but I'd still recommend this course to anyone who wants to know more about China, one of the most important countries in today's world. You don't need any prior knowledge on China--he starts from the very basic.",
    "Yes take it! The work load is managable and roach is a great lecturer. It can be a bit repetitive in terms of the content but the messages are clear and straightfoward.",
    "This is a very interesting course, and you learn a lot about China. However, lectures do get a repetitive.",
    "An economic survey of the steps China will have to take to maintain its economic prosperity in the future.",
    "You'll learn a lot from this course simply by going to lectures. The readings are really detailed, but good, so you definitely will take a lot from this course if you do most of them too.",
    "Fascinating, but slightly repetitive. Would definitely recommend.",
    "Econ 338 is a great course that gives an overview of the present and future state of China. The course touches on social, political and economic issues, and connects these very well in the broader context.Prof. Roach did a good job in presenting the material from a balanced perspective, while also giving his own opinions about China. The course load is reasonable, and the midterm and final are fair. Great class if you want an overview of the current and future China!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to understand the China of today and the challenges\/opportunities that it faces.",
    "Great course for anyone looking to really understand the structural problems and imbalances faced by the Chinese economy, and what's needed and being done to correct them.",
    "Yes. It is a very interesting look at China's transition. The workload is very manageable. There is a lot of readings, but many can be skimmed.",
    "Yes--the Next China is an exciting, very relevant course at the cutting edge of current events; assignments are generally quite do-able; the lectures repeat the overall thesis a little too often; there is a mismatch between the long, detailed readings and the very general lectures; you should be fine regardless of your major, as long as you have some background knowledge on macroeconomics (a working knowledge from current business news should be fine)",
    "Great class if you want to find out whats going on over seas with CHina and its economy. Also a good econ credit if you want a break from number crunching as it doesnt require much math.",
    "Definitely would recommend it.",
    "The Next China was a great introduction to the rise of China and the problems faced by its current leadership for someone who hasn't studied it before. Keep in mind that this a macroeconomics course. Therefore, you'll look through the eyes of a Chinese policymaker much more often than the eyes of an average citizen.",
    "The class is very topical and the professor is very engaging; however the class material is VERY repetitive.",
    "Take it. Best econ credit you can earn. Interesting, fairly graded, and you will definitely learn something about China.",
    "I would recommend the class for a student who is interested in a class that is not econ-intense which covers a broad issues concerning China. Students looking for an analytic discussionof China's economy will be frustrated.",
    "Yes. Very good economics and history course to take.",
    "Yes. i would definitely recommend EAS 338 to a fellow student because it is a great introductory class on the economy of China."
