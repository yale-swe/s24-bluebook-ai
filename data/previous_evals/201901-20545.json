    "This course is one in which you learn much about the technology of film making, though mainly on your own. You must be self motivated for sure.",
    "I learned what it meant and what it takes to be a director.",
    "This course teaches you how hard it is to make a moviebut in a good way. You learn how to solve problems faced on set, how to balance every aspect of filmmaking (is a reshoot worth it? Are people available? What does your editor need?).",
    "I gained knowledge in the approaches, techniques and processes of directing films. I learned not only how to convey stories, but also how to operate on a set and collaborate with other students to make films.",
    "How to tell a story with the core emotion in focus",
    "I learned the basics of filmmaking. I learned how to work hard for the creation of films and how to work in teams."

   "comments": [
    "The course could be improved by spending more class time workshopping or learning about film techniques.",
    "It was really good, would have liked more creatively free projects. Understood the value of the projects that we did fully, they were all good, just a personal wish.",
    "This class can be hard because it really puts you in the situation and leaves you to figure it out. Its scary, but it pays off in the end. The readings can be long, but the interesting ones (the Lumet book) are worth it.",
    "I think this course is much stronger than the intro documentary course. Not because I think the documentary course is doing things poorly, but I think this course is more successful because the projects usually only utilize other class memebrs rather than consistently needing outside volunteers for the documentary course. I think this course has a lot of strengths-- we learn how to talk to actors and get to spend the time practicing (in the class with instructor supervision and outside the class on our own). The readings of this class, for the most part, were helpful (though, some can be repetitive). One thing I would change about this course is that I wish it was broken into topics slightly more. The most successful project of the year was the one that really focused on actors and directors (the ordinary people assignment). I also think the editing assignment was helpful and well done. When lots of aspects are expected to be completed by the intro level students, often a lot of the details fall through the cracks and students walk away with not a great understanding. I think I saw this the most with sound, as it would have been nice to spend more time with it as a focus, rather than an added expectation of assignments.",
    "A strength of this course was the hands-on experience. The projects took a lot of time, and required dedication. There was a lot of outside work though this was key in furthering my understanding of this work and I got a lot out of it. I enjoyed the readings, however I felt that there was some times too much reading assigned that it became overwhelming. I also think that every student should at some point do every job, as opposed to some people doing the same job as part of the crew over and again.",
    "Organization on the part of canvas assignments and more actual doing in class rather than sitting",
    "I enjoyed the rigid structure, but I think it was too rigid. I was not really allowed to exercise my creative side while taking this course. The assignments were very strict and we weren't really allowed to experiment. I would appreciate if were had some assignments where we were allowed more freedom. I enjoyed the discussions we had during class time. The strengths were the dedication to the course from both the other students and the professor.",
    "Not clear enough directions."

   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn the basics of film making, yes! But you must be self motivated and not afraid to take risks and be critiqued.",
    "If you think you want to go into film at all, take this course. You will decide.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is serious about learning how to make films and who is willing to put in a lot of time to do so. This is not the class for someone who is just mildly interested in film and wants to test it out, unless they are willing to put in time and effort. For someone who is very dedicated to the work, they will get a lot out of this class.",
    "Yes, will be a lot more work and time than expected, but will learn so much about teachwork, storytelling, etc",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is dedicated to going into film. This is not a class you can dip a toe in: you need to be utterly dedicated to do well in. I enjoyed it, but it was a lot of hard work and a lot of time.",
    "Yes."
