   "comments": [
    "Obviously I learned a lot about Indian national security, but that topic touches on military strategy, politics, history, religion, ethnicity, governance, economics, and diplomacy. It was a broad overview of a big topic, yet we were able to focus on specific issues in great detail.",
    "I gained an extensive understanding of strategy in national security, India's foreign policy, and South Asia's modern political affairs. Professor Singh covers a history of each topic before going into the modern political context, and provides a solid theoretical understanding of the issues that are discussed as well. While this is an excellent class for someone interested in India and National Security, I also recommend it for anyone who is interested in learning about global affairs, as the discussions can be as broad as the class would like them to be, and help the students learn to think about a broad range of political and social issues. This class embodied everything that a liberal arts seminar should be, as it left students with a deep understanding of the subject while also improving are writing and argumentation skills in ways that will be beneficial for all our future work. Professor Singh is a Deputy Editor of reputable newspaper, and will really work with his students on their writing and thinking skills as well as helping them understand complex issues related to foreign policy and national security in India.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about India's national security. Professor Singh was incredibly organized, and picked clear and detailed readings related to each issue. The syllabus was arranged by a topic important to India's national security; these included Pakistan, Kashmir, China, Civil-Military relations, nuclear weapons, etc. Then there would be a considerable amount of readings related to each to prepare for class, and the lecture\/discussion in class would explain both big picture and some key nuances of the issue. Professor Singh has a tremendous amount of experience and knowledge, both within the Indian military and as a journalist writing about these issues in India and South Asia. It is a tremendous privilege to be able to learn from someone who has the degree of lived experience and is organized and skillful about teaching as well.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about how the Indian military, government, and state apparatus is structured. Professor Singh structured the course incredibly thoughtfully, and you come away with an enriched perspective of a history, a state, and a people. I learned how to read more closely, how to engage more thoughtfully, and how to participate more collaboratively. I also learned a tremendous amount about the subject material, and I am a better person\/student having taken this course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The assignments were great, the readings were great, the class discussions were strong, and the teaching and presentations were great.",
    "The strength of this course is Professor Singh, who is a very smart, experienced, and kind practitioner that really puts time into making the class a good experience for all his students. Professor Singh not only guides the discussions towards what the seminar is most interested in, but will also make an effort to hear out the opinions and ideas of everyone in the class. I think the class really benefitted from being a small seminar of 6 students, but I also believe that so many Yalies would benefit from learning the material Professor Singh teaches. The class could be improved if it were larger, so that a broader range of opinions and voices were brought into the weekly discussions. Overall, I think the assignments were all relevant and received extensive feedback, and the readings were interesting (and Professor Singh kept the work engaging each week by including media like YouTube videos or new footage in the course syllabus as well).",
    "Professor Singh is incredibly knowledgable about the topic, both as a military professional and as a respected journalist. I did not have much experience with the topic, so the clarity of the syllabus and the detailed readings helped me gain a solid baseline for which to come to class and learn as much as possible from Professor Singh's discussion. Truthfully, I wish I had had more time to dedicate to this class; there is always more I could have done or could have learned, and Professor Singh really is an expert. Any fault or shortcoming is entirely my own, and I would love to have the opportunity to take another course with him. If Professor Singh returns to Yale, I will commit to taking his course.",
    "This was a phenomenal course that had interesting readings, the right balance of informational teaching with collaborative discussion, a manageable course load, and truly the best professor in the world. The only thing that could be improved is more students to add more perspectives into the class the next time it is offered!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "If the topic is at all interesting, even if you know very little about national security or India, take it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who either has an interest in South Asia, an interest in National Security\/ Civ-Mil relations, or just wants to take a seminar where they can have engaging and in-depth discussions with their professor. This class was by far one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale. Professor Singh is so knowledgeable about the material he is teaching, but is also the kind of humble and kind academic who is always open to his students' feedback and opinions. He makes a real effort to make sure that his students are understanding the material and are engaged, and his passion for the subject will make you excited about it as well. Plus, given that he has so much first-hand experience in both military and journalism in India, his own anecdotes and stories will add a lot of context to what you're learning (as well as making the class very fun!). Professor Singh makes an effort to get to know his students, understand their interests and shape the class to what discussions are most exciting, and give extensive feedback on all written work so that you can always be clear on what you are doing well on or need to improve. As a professor, he is just very kind and helpful, and if you make an effort to get to know him, can be a great resource within the South Asian Studies department to guide your studies beyond the class itself as well. He is a visiting professor, so if you get the chance to take his class, I would highly recommend taking it while it is still an option! It's a 10\/10 experience that I looked forward to every week.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. Professor Singh is incredibly knowledgablehe has considerable experience serving as an officer for 20 years in the Indian military and as a respected journalist covering topics related to national security; there is no topic we covered or asked about that Professor Singh did now know about and have considerable personal lived experience with. Combine this with how organized Professor Singh is as a professora highly structured syllabus, with a clear organization and supporting readings, and powerpoints in class that tie everything together and facilitate learning for those with and without prior experience in these topics. He also took advantage of opportunities at Yale, creating space for the class to engage with guest speakers discussing topics related to the course. This course was a fantastic opportunity and I only hope that Professor Singh will return to Yale to teach another course; if he does before I graduate, I will be taking it.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone\/anyone! The rise of India as a superpower in the context of national security is shifting the world order, so this material could not be more pertinent. This course gives an incredible look into the realities of the military in India -- and the surrounding geopolitical realities. You will learn from a brilliant professor learning so much -- take this course!"
