    "I feel sorry for you if you take this class. It's a drag. The teachers are horrible, the material is tedious, and you will reach the lowest of the low in terms of irresponsibility. All due to hubris. Yes, this could potentially be an easy A. But it won't be. No matter what you say or do. I don't know how other \"easy\" QRs at Yale compare, but this probably isn't the lesser of two evils. Take another class. And do not, under any circumstances, come into this class with little or no calculus experience.",
    "If you're taking this class, it is probably because you have to. Midterms and final is what you'd expect. It's a straightforward class, but by no means fun or engaging.",
    "Pretty good introduction to Calculus.",
    "Math 112 is a pretty easy way to get the Mathematics credit required by some other major programs (such as Economics). However, if you've taken any Calculus prior to Yale, you will likely find yourself bored to tears during lectures. This bodes well for people who are looking to go to as little class as possible and still get a good grade.",
    "It's a great course if you don't have that much experience with calculus. Just know that it moves quickly and you have to keep up. You can pretty much teach everything to yourself through the textbook though, and the tests are very fair.",
    "It is a fair course. You can be successful through it if you have a good TA.",
    "Don't take this class unless you're required to. It's frustrating and poorly taught.",
    "Easy class with very little work. Review all the material right before the midterms\/final and it is not hard to do well.",
    "if you need to fulfill a Qr requirement I definitely suggest taking another course, if it is prerequisite fora major just take it and study on your own!"
