    "The material can be difficult, but Professor Howe is a very good teacher. He gives review sessions all the time in addition to his office hours so you have many opportunities to solidify concepts you may not have understood. Professor Howe is conscious of how much time we spend on problem sets and tries to adjust them to make them more bearable (it's still quite a lot of work though) and the tests are not too difficult. This course is probably less work than 230, as there is a smaller emphasis on the art of constructing proofs, but you still get a lot of practice with it.",
    "This is a horrible class. It is completely not structured, you don't learn what you need to know for the psets, and they end up taking you about 17 hours. Prof Howe is a nice person, but I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone in the world.",
    "Highly recommend it. It just shows the beauty of the subject mathematics. This class ties together Math 120 and Math 225, and I am so glad that I have taken this class. Based on this class, I have decided to take more math courses in the future. This class makes you like the subject matter.Often you may feel his lectures are all over, but they all nicely fit together (if you think harder) within a bigger picture. His problem sections are very helpful and he is very helpful as well during office hours.The problem sets are hard (5 to 15 hours), but they are manageable if you think through (and having a group of friends to check your answer& work together help a lot). Totally worth it, as I look back although at the moment they sometime made me wanting to cry. It's a love\/hate relationship that eventually gets redeemed in your appreciation of the course at the very end, as you look back upon how much you have learned more and how much mathematical intuition you've gained.",
    "Amazing course. Definitely take it if you like Math. It can be very difficult, but it is at the same time very enjoyable.",
    "If you didn't take Math 230\/231 this class is a necessity for a lot of majors. At the end of the class, once you've put in all the work, you should feel prepared to take higher level classes. Take it but be prepared to put in a lot of work.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Though most students come in with a pretty strong calculus background, Math250 gets you to look at calc from the bottom up, which is pretty cool.",
    "Yes!!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is very strong at Math. If you want to understand the theory behind Vector Calculus, this is the course to take, and it is an unbelievably beautiful and elegant theory.That being said the course is quite difficult, and you need to put in a ton of work to do well - problem sets take around 15 hours or more a week, and you often have to go to review sessions (which Roger Howe himself taught, so his dedication is quite apparent). If you are willing to work very hard, it is well worth your time, if not, then definitely don't take the course.Take it with Roger Howe too if you have the chance because he knows how to teach the material so well, and you will be blown away by the Mathematical mastery he shows. He can prove everything in the course from memory on the spot. It's quite impressive.",
    "Don't take this course. True, the tests are easy and Professor Howe is a lovely man who devotes a lot of time and energy to his teaching. But he's not a very good teacher, and as a result the class lacks a clear narrative. I couldn't really tell you what it was about or what I learned from it. The problem sets were unnecessarily difficult, had little to do with course material, and took 10+ hours. They say it's a prereq for analysis, but people who have taken both say that you learn nothing in 250 that is useful for analysis. I'm not sure this course should exist.",
    "Definitely! OK, so the problem sets are long. The first few problem sets took more than 10 hours, but eventually the ended up being in the 4-6 hour range. The material (basically a generalization of multivariable calculus) is interesting, and Professor Howe is the best professor I've had at Yale.",
    "Math 250 is a fairly difficult class, but definitely worth it in the end. Expect to do a lot of work, but you will be prepared in the end for future analysis courses.",
    "This course is intimidating in its subject material, but the exams are extremely fair and nothing on them is unexpected. Take it with Roger Howe if at all possible.",
    "Take it if you want to learn A LOT about math. Also, be prepared, if you haven't taken any proof based math classes (aka have only taken applied math courses), to be really swamped your first few weeks. That being said, the problem sets are the hardest part of class--the tests are really not that bad. In the midst of the class it's easy to say that it was way too difficult and had too much work, but looking back I think the class was definitely worth the work, because you really do learn a lot in a very short period.",
    "Math 250 is an overview of single- and multi-variable calculus applied to vectors and presented in a more abstract, proof-based format. You will learn to see concepts like continuity, invertibility, and the derivative in a very different way. It's a good stepping stone to proof-based math courses (like Math 300), and Professor Howe is excellent and extremely helpful.",
    "I would recommend Math 250 to another student only if they are serious about continuing on to higher level math. For me, I needed this class to show me that higher levels of math weren't in my future. This is a great \"trial by fire\" kind of class.",
    "In some sense, it seems to build upon Math 120, so if you like that class you are bound to enjoy this one! I would recommend it if you like to learn the theory behind many of the formulas and concepts that are so familiar to us. Be prepared to work VERY hard though!",
    "Take it if you need it. It isn't fun, but it teaches you discipline.",
    "Math 250 is difficult and very time-consuming, and not to mention not required for econ\/math majors, but this class opened my eyes to an aspect of math that I've never encountered at Yale or any other institution. I feel it'll be greatly beneficial when I take Math 300 next semester.",
    "The best math course I have taken at yale. Take this course. Howe is the best.",
    "It's really tough.",
    "Great material and enthusiastic professor! A gentle introduction to more proof-based math. Beware: this course is a lot of work towards the end of the semester (problem sets over Thanksgiving and reading week, a final project and a final exam).",
    "A fantastic math course.The class is a lot of work, but Professor Howe's review sessions make the psets much more manageable.Recommended with Professor Howe.",
    "It's a class that will completely change how you think about math, if you've never taken a more analytical math class before. I would recommend it if you're interested in Econ and Math or another comparable major and are ready to work really hard at a math class. The problem sets take an average of 12-15 hours each, so be forewarned. The exams however are not terrible if you've spent a lot of time preparing.",
    "MATH250 is definitely a lot of hard work, but because of that, it's a really rewarding class. If you are coming into Vector from a very computationds-based background (MATH120\/MATH22) expect to struggle in the beginning. There really is no transition into proof-based lectures and you sort of dive into it. However, using proofs really pushes you mentally and changes the way you approach problems. It gives you tools to solve problems in a more rigorous way.The pace of the class is pretty slow, but the problem sets generally take 12-20 hours a week. In the beginning, I took around 20 hours, but it slowly went down to about 8-10 by the end. The problems are generally worded poorly, so mostof the time, you are just confused on how to approach the problem and what to do. This is why you should attend most of the problem sessions Professor Howe offers. They are extremely useful and Professor Howe will answer any question. The questions on the tests are a lot easier than the those on the problem sets so do not be afraid of struggling on the psets.All in all, I definitely recommend this class (especially if you're going into MATH300\/301). Professor Howe is a caring teacher who puts a lot of effort into this class. The material is also interesting as it blends MATH120 and MATH222 material.Note that there is no transparency in grading."
