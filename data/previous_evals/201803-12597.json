   "comments": [
    "I learned very little basic of perspective of the anthropocene.",
    "Briefly got to learn about systems thinking and causal loop diagrams - but mainly from discussion section, rather than lecture.",
    "I didn't learn much of anything new through the course of this class.",
    "Good overview of environmental issues. Karen Seto's lecture on urban issues was particularly illuminating as was Paul Anasta's on Green Chemistry\/Industrial Ecology",
    "I was introduced to the concept of systems thinking.",
    "Almost nothing. I came in to FES basic understanding about most environmental topics, which is all that this class provided.",
    "Barely any.",
    "The biggest takeaway from the course was about the concept of systems thinking and the anthropocene. Two terms I had previously been unaware of.",
    "I honestly do not believe I learned anything from this course that I did not know beforehand. I believe the course covered a variety of environmental topics that I had prior knowledge of due to the fact that I majored in environmental sciences in undergrad. I feel like the course is only useful for those with no prior environmental sciences education, which is a small minority of students at F&ES.",
    "I felt I developed relatively little. However, I did gain some knowledge and insight relating to urban environments, business, and public health. I also began my development within the systems thinking framework and paradigm, which I value highly.",
    "While I enjoyed listening to guest lecturers, I didn't feel like this course drastically improved my understanding of any topic.",
    "I learned the wide range of disciplines and specialities that exist at Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. I learned that environmental issues are complicated and that resolving them requires intense dialogue and often tradeoffs.",
    "Few.",
    "I found this course unhelpful. There were a couple things my classmates said in discussion sections that I thought were really interesting\/taught me something new.",
    "I learned about what several professors in this school is working on in their research. I have a background in environmental studies which is interdisciplinary in nature, so the class was nothing new to me.",
    "It was great to get exposed to professors I would consider taking courses with, and to get a sense of both their work and their style.",
    "Basic concepts from about a dozen \"perspectives,\" which were not really perspectives. They were mostly just the environmental perspective in the context of different academic disciplines.",
    "Some insights, but highly theoretical. Not much in terms of applicable knowledge or skills.",
    "I learned a bit about some different subjects taught by FES professors. Some more insight on what I consider to be a \"perspective\"",
    "Systems thinking, communication and conversation skills, environmental sustainability in a wider sense.",
    "Learned what some professors are teaching at FES",
    "Virtually nothing.",
    "I learned about systems thinking and some environmental topics that I didn't know as much about before, like water.",
    "I gained an insight into the multiple ways in which environmental issues can be approached. I found the lecture on systems thinking and political ecology particularly engaging while others were less relevant or applicable to my interests.",
    "This course gave me a strong sense of the breadth of the field of environmental studies.",
    "I gained exposure to various professors and their disciplines.",
    "Honestly, not a ton, considering none of the topics were ever explore in depth.",
    "I learned about system thinking.",
    "I think the biggest knowledge gain was in systems thinking and the process of causal loop diagraming. Our TA Maria was instrumental in really bringing this to life though as it wasn't really a skill that was developed during the lecture series. Secondly, I found that I learned a lot about what other professors at F&ES outside of my specialization are focusing their research on. This was helpful because I know who to go to with questions about the various disciplines etc.",
    "It gave me a good survey of what's available at FES. I don't think I gained any skills or knowledge, though perhaps I gained a few insights from fellow students during discussion.",
    "I received a \"101\"-level overview of several distinct fields of environmental management, and enjoyed the deeper discussions that went on in our breakout section. It was nice to get a better sense of who faculty are at FES and their specialties.",
    "I do not feel that I developed significant knowledge, skills, or insights in this course.",
    "The knowledge conveyed during lectures was quite surface level, the course barely skimmed the surface of systems-thinking and certainly didn't equip us with skills to practice the approach, and insights gleaned from discussions were also not new.",
    "Lots, but I feel most of my learning occurred in the discussion section.",
    "Very few if any.",
    "-an ability to talk to people that have views different from my own -an ability to quickly formulate a coherent response to my peers thoughts and engage in productive discourse online",
    "I did not come away with many skills or new knowledge, but appreciated the refresher format for this course!",
    "This class offered me a broader view of all aspects of global environmental issues, which is super helpful for me to become an environmental manager in the future.",
    "I learned about aspects of climate change and how people are affected that were new to me. I practiced discussing these new concepts with other students during discussion section. I learned to think about the larger system in which a problem is embedded, and to think about potential consequences of actions that are supposed to solve the problem, or identifying places where one can implement a solution. The class was also an overview of course offerings at FES and helped me narrow in on the approaches that interest me most.",
    "I did not gain much insight, from this class, that I did not already have. The discussion section did allow for ideas to be more fully fleshed out and expanded which was the major benefit of this class.",
    "I got a broad overview of the different disciplines we can study at F&ES, but not much else.",
    "I got some insight into different FES subjects that I may want to study. Some of the lectures were quite interesting, but the form of the class is not always effective.",
    "I learned about the different subject areas of focus within FES.",
    "Was exposed to a wide-breadth of different lenses through which to view the current environmental landscape and professions.",
    "New Perspectives about topics related to sustainability and environment",
    "The introduction to systems thinking was the most useful part of this course since it is widely applicable.",
    "I got perspectives on different aspects of environmental sciences. I really enjoyed hearing professors talk about their areas of focus and interest.",
    "not sure.",
    "I don't know where to begin! I loved this course. If it weren't required, I would have taken it anyway. I upgraded my critical thinking skills and gained a new window into how to interpret, assess and engage in environmental issues. I'm not a scientist, so the lectures on Industrial Ecology, Materials and Industry, and Systems Thinking have allowed me entree into a new, relevant and critical viewpoint about my major in Environmental Management. I learned to 'think' like a social scientist and a scientific practitioner in new areas, especially climate change and energy.",
    "This course is very helpful to learn to different perspectives from a particular professor every week. Not only particular specialization in MEM but also helps to look over other aspects and understand the needs to know about the interconnection of different sectors being an environmental manager.",
    "An introduction to systems thinking across a range of disciplines.",
    "I got a sense for what some of the faculty members at FES work on, but besides that, I felt that I did not learn a lot in this course.",
    "A general idea of what professors at the university are working on",
    "Communication skills from the discussion section and an overview of the specialization themes.",
    "I did not develop knowledge or skills that I did not already have from previous courses and experience. An insight I did value, however, was related to ecology during the ecosystems perspective lecture. I have been a traditional ecologist based on my undergraduate ecology studies and was challenged by a new perspective incorporating coupling ideas.",
    "Not much. Basic introductory lectures from a variety of different environmental angles, but most of the content were ideas and theories that I've already studied.",
    "None.",
    "Broad overview of subject matter does not lend to thoughtful conversation or engagement. Good to be introduced to FES faculty, but do not need to waste 3 credits (expensive education) on this course. Would be effective as lunch time lectures. Best part of Perspectives was meeting up as a class once a week. That can still happen and spur dialogue.",
    "Not many, although I must admit it did make me realize that I need to take more humanities courses.",
    "I gained some challenging, different perspectives particularly from my fellow colleagues in the discussion sections",
    "I gained insight into what other MEM students think about a range of environmental issues through the discussion group. I had the opportunity to think critically about my future and career through the final paper. I learned what systems thinking is and I gained a very broad overview of the material that some of the faculty at FES teach.",
    "I learned about the areas of focus of some academic fields, although I didn't learn something new in all the lectures; about a third of them were already familiar to me or repeated content from other classes. I didn't gain any new skills from the course. As far as insights, I felt a bit cynical before the course was even completed because not one of the lectures addressed the subjects that I believe are at the core of any sustainability or human-environment concerns - our culture, values, economic structures, and power dynamics between one population and another. The avoidance of these core subjects made the lectures seem superficial and I felt sad and disappointed: whether the speakers simply don't care about these topics, or whether they do care, but felt it was inappropriate to address them in this forum, it seemed to indicate what the priorities of the fields they represent really are - or even what the priorities of the school really are."

   "comments": [
    "Far below my expectation",
    "They did not align with my expectations very much. This class was not able to delve deep enough into these concepts for much knowledge to be gained.",
    "I had high hopes for this class in terms of what could have been an interesting and in-depth exploration of solving environmental problems from a number of different environmental foci. I felt like instead, it was a bunch of disjointed and high-level overviews of professors' research with little insight into how these different perspectives could actually work together.",
    "The class was what I expected.",
    "I thought this class was going to offer different perspectives, however, I felt that perspectives presented, overall seemed to be the same. The topics presented differed, therefore, this course seemed like a topics course, not a perspectives course.",
    "Not at all. I was excited about the class, but it did not deliver.",
    "Not aligned at all.",
    "The course was a general introduction to concepts and was more focused on readings rather than practical application. I was expecting something along the lines of application of the concepts learned to everyday problems.",
    "I was very disappointed in the course. I assumed that at the graduate level we would be covering these issues in more depth and not just receive a high level overview.",
    "I was hoping to get a lot more out of it; each perspective given felt too shallow for what the instructors initially stated we could expect. There were no big 'aha!' moments or moments of disagreement. Instead, it was a series of surface coverings of different topics.",
    "Expectations were met.",
    "I was expecting the weekly lectures to dive more deeply into topics. I was also hoping that there would be a more coherent structure to the class. It seemed very unorganized at times.",
    "I was very disappointed.",
    "I was disappointed by the structure of the course, the content of the lectures, and the structure of the discussion sections.",
    "Given that this was a required and experimental course I didn't have many expectations. Some lectures were awesome, and some fell a little flat. The discussion section was good because my classmates are so interesting and engaged.",
    "It was a little more of a waste of time than I expected.",
    "This class was disappointing, and certainly not worthy of 3 credits. With such an impressive arsenal of brains at Yale, it was a bummer to not get a deeper dive into any of their research or actual perspectives. Instead, it felt like many weeks of very superficial topic intros.",
    "I expected much more from the class than what I experienced. The actual course was more of a series of academic lectures when I had expected to be much more engaged in the actual \"perspectives\" of it, whether that was through case studies or hearing from different stakeholders or the like. I was pretty disappointed by the course.",
    "The experiences from the course were very diverse and eye-opening. It was a great course.",
    "I expected more flow from topic to topic, not enough time to truly engage with material being taught",
    "I had low expectations, and these were met - this class was a waste of time.",
    "I think the class aligned pretty well with my expectations.",
    "It did not align well with my expectations. I expected to learn different perspectives but was disappointed with the way the class was set up. I felt like I received a lot of disparate knowledge about different fields but I'm unsure how to move forward with the material I've learned.",
    "I would say they fell a little below my expectations. The course felt like a superficial survey of topics that I already had at least passing familiarity with, without the depth that I would have hoped for. It felt like a very strong course for undergrads majoring in environmental studies, but the lack of a common thread connecting the lectures and the limited opportunities to think critically about the ideas presented meant that it didn't fully feel like it fit with the FES curriculum.",
    "I expected to learn more about different perspectives on environmental issues. I also expected to learn more about the lecturers' research and work in their fields.",
    "Poorly. I thought it was merely a surface level scratch, compared to the deep-dive I want out of grad school .",
    "Noy very much. The class was very superficial and although the information on the Monday sessions was interesting, none of them was deep enough to really understand a problematic.",
    "This felt like a survey course. It was kind of what I expected.",
    "I came in expecting much more from Yale.",
    "I was hoping for more active discussion to flesh out advantages to one's \"perspective\" and challenges. A more engaging style of lecture, or more overlap from week to week, would facilitate more engagement.",
    "The class did not meet my expectations.",
    "I actually expected to learn a little more. I think part of this miss match came from the necessary structure of course where professors only had time to broadly cover their respective fields.",
    "I thought this class had a lot of untapped potential. I thought it would be an introduction to how to think about issues from different angles--instead it felt like one long steady stream of the different disciplines offered at FES (something that I could have easily read online).",
    "It met my expectations. I was hoping that this course would expose me to the different disciplines at FES and it successfully did so. However, I wish we had more time to cover other disciplines, especially methodologies.",
    "I was a bit dissapointed with the depth of most lectures, but enjoyed my discussion section.",
    "I believe this class has successfully achieved its goal to present all aspects of environmental issues to us and fulfilled my expectations.",
    "Sometimes the assigned reading was more than expected. I expected a survey of topics, like there was, but I also thought there would be a more noticeable common thread among the weeks.",
    "They aligned decently with my expectations however they did not go beyond. I had rather low expectations for what was apparently a lecture series, the reality turned out to almost meet my prediction.",
    "Not well - I didnt feel like I got truly different perspectives but more of a selection of topics, and little real investigation of the anthropocene as a concept.",
    "This class was more helpful in helping me gain a sense of what classes to take, but we got less far into each topic than I expected.",
    "I enjoyed some of the readings and the discussion section. I did not come away with any new skills from this class.",
    "I had no prior expectations.",
    "I did not know what to expect since the class is so broad, but ended up getting a nice bit of background on a wide range of topics.",
    "I had high hopes for a course that convened all MEMs on Mondays, but the sessions were often disappointing.",
    "My expectations were exceeded. I didn't know anything about Systems Thinking, but now I can see pathways to integrate this social science into my work as a land trust executive. I knew nothing, really, about Materials & Industry, such as, for example, how plastics are disposed, now I have a better understanding which will complement my strategies as a land trust executive focusing on a healthy environment. I've upgraded my skills in 'awareness' so now I'm able to think about environmental management more comprehensively! To me this is very important.",
    "Weekly discussion with classmates is the best part of this course. It was a great advantage to share thoughts and ideas for linkages between the weekly topic of an environmental issue and exceeded my expectations.",
    "The knowledge and skills gained in the class did not align with my expectations very well. Given the very first class of the semester, I was anticipating being introduced to broad themes related to a range of environmental issues and being asked to wrestle with provocative ideas. Instead, it seemed like many of the lectures were relatively straightforward summaries of the professors' work and did not include much new information. If the class had been billed as a brief introduction to a range of disciplines, rather than a relatively provocative look at many different perspectives across fields, I might have had different and more realistic expectations.",
    "I had higher expectations for the course.",
    "The did not. When I heard perspectives I though about different points of view, not different areas of study",
    "To me, the hour allotted for lectures was not necessary. I think they could have been better done in online required videos. I enjoyed the discussion sections but I also would not have wanted that to prevent me from taking other courses. All that being said, the lectures were interesting and informative but not that effectual in changing my specialization choice.",
    "Very poorly. I was expecting broader \"perspectives\" to be introduced in the lectures, such as feminist, queer, and non-Western perspectives. Most, if not all, perspectives were from FES faculty. We have access to these perspectives through means such as coursework, Wednesday noon lectures, and office hours. People of color and women were dismally underrepresented. The questions asked during this course did not sufficiently challenge the concept of the anthropocene through different perspectives.",
    "I feel I was disappointed by the class. I understand its intended purpose, but the lectures and discussion sections did not meet that purpose. Lectures were often by older, white men who still seem to have flawed, biased perspectives. The environmental health lecture particularly demonstrated that issue. Discussion sections led by second year students were not productive because the students did not have adequate experience or perspective to lead such discussions. Lectures could be interesting, and it was valuable to learn what F&ES faculty are doing and thinking, but overall the class felt a bit like a waste of time.",
    "Not well. All of the so-called \"perspectives\" were from academics. The perspectives I hoped to be exposed to would have been from a variety of backgrounds -- rich and poor, academic and practitioner, advantaged and disadvantaged, liberal and conservative. The perspectives presented over the course of the class were extremely one-sided.",
    "I didn't know what to expect from this class, but based on the name, I thought that PERSPECTIVES would be offered. Instead, it was merely a selection of topics that were covered, and the coverage was so surface-level that I don't feel I really learned anything new; the level of material covered in this course was not sufficient for a graduate level course. It also was presented to us that this course would help us to gain insight about what career path we intend to follow, and which specialization we want to choose, but I found it to be absolutely no help on either front.",
    "Poorly.",
    "This course did not meet my expectations. It felt like a course for an incoming freshman class in college, not a graduate school course.",
    "I would have expected it to be more interconnected and case based",
    "I think I was expecting lectures that connected somehow with one another and to learn a lot from each lecturer. In some lectures, these expectations were met and in others they were not.",
    "The class did not meet my expectations. I was expecting a course that would dive deep into real perspectives on the challenges of our era - not a survey course on different academic research areas. I regularly attend the Wednesday research seminars and it was sometimes hard to tell the difference between a Perspectives lecture and a Wednesday lecture."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I was very frustrated with the discussion session, where students with very different perspectives are forced to talk on different topic every week. Discussion session should be restructured.",
    "Strengths: the TFs of this course put in a lot of work and effort to try and make sure discussion was facilitated well, I applaud them for their efforts Weaknesses: the lecture component of this course was completely unnecessary; students often times didn't pay attention and much of what was being taught in lecture was not able to be challenged or discussed by students because of the small one-hour window Improvements: restructure the lecture component - having professors discuss different viewpoints is great, but it would be more interesting to potentially see this done in a panel where they discuss or debate about certain topics each week",
    "I enjoyed my discussion group, but I don't feel like the material was in-depth enough for us to really engage meaningfully in any useful discussions. I felt that so many of the lectures were incredibly vague and high-level and didn't give any sense of what it looked like to apply any of the different perspectives to a real life problem. I think something that could have made the course much more interesting would have been to look at a case study through the lens of all the different disciplines highlighted in the course. Then perhaps we could have more engaging discussions and actually see the strengths and weaknesses of different environmental perspectives.",
    "I found discussion sections more useful than the lectures. Many of the topics I already had a baseline knowledge but I was fascinated to hear my classmate's perspectives on these topics. I wish I wasn't just limited to my discussion section but had a rotating schedule to listen in on other people's thoughts.",
    "I think the course could be structured differently, for example, having more panels and allowing for adequate time for questions. I think there were only presentations, but no room for discussion or challenging a 'perspective.'",
    "I did like having weekly small group discussions. However, I think that the course content needs to be completely reworked. Not only were the lectures very basic, but most of them were also very theoretical. I would have liked to hear about real life examples, case studies, etc. for each topic. It would be even better if there was one specific case study that was looked at from a different perspective each week.",
    "The discussion sessions are a strength of the course as they allow students to engage in dialogue over the main takeaways from the lectures, however the course has great room for improvement as it could be made more specific and practical. e.g. perhaps the students could first be introduced to all the different specializations and the fields that F&ES has to offer, and then they could choose one of them and work on a specific case study to have a concrete deliverable at the end.",
    "The discussion section was incredibly useful, I believe the class could benefit from being a 1.5 hour course where after the lecture there is an opportunity for a longer Q&A section and student participation and discussion.",
    "The strengths are that I got to spend time around students I likely wouldn't otherwise see at all; hearing their interpretation on things was refreshing and valuable. The weakness was the structure; in my opinion, the course doesn't need to exist. Instead, I think it would be prudent to offer a somewhat comprehensive introduction to the different subjects studied and taught here at Yale FES via a booklet. Let students go through it on their own time before coming in, which would conflict less with scheduling and give a clearer start from the first step.",
    "The speakers for this course were incredible. I think think the class could have been stronger if all the sessions had a common topic or theme. For example: Natural disasters through many lenses.",
    "The strength of the course is the discussion section in which I got to know my classmates well. Weakness of the course is that it lacked structure and coherence.",
    "Lectures were useless.",
    "The two strengths of this course are that a) it gave me a nice opportunity to meet Amity Doolittle and b) it allowed me to meet a couple new classmates.",
    "The strength of the course was the discussion sessions. It was a great way to really parse out different ideas and work through how interdisciplinary this field is. It also provided for bonding as a a group as well. Maria was a great TA. I find that the weakness in the course was its lack of environmental justice focus. Especially if we are supposed to be future leaders then this is a subject we all need to know well and learn to be critical of the different environmental institutions that come from and still commit environmental injustices. It may not be personal to many of those who come through this school, but there are those, including me, my family, and friends, who have had to deal with it. We cannot just briefly discuss it and then move on or refuse to acknowledge when a professor completely dismisses it in their research.",
    "Strengths: - Seeing friends and classmates each Monday - When the lectures were good, being exposed to new ideas and professors that I otherwise wouldn't come across - Building a little community of my peers in the discussion section Weaknesses: - Different aspects of the course were disjointed--doing the readings didn't really matter for discussion sections and wasn't necessary to listen to and enjoy Monday lectures. With a busy course load, it often simply wasn't worth it to do the readings - Blog posts were a major pain and also were disjointed from the rest of the course. They didn't really improve discussion in discussion sections, didn't really require you to have done the reading, and felt burdensome, often falling to the very bottom of my priority list",
    "This whole class was a mistake, especially in light of all the other new requirements that are already using up our credits. We should be excused from some other requirement for having to spend credits on this. First of all, if this is going to be a class about perspectives, then let's bring out some disagreements among the faculty about how to solve environmental problems. I'm not sure I can name one disagreement that was featured all semester long, even though the class was pitched as helping us deal with contrasting perspectives. Instead, we saw a parade of environmentalists who applied seemingly the same perspective to a variety of issues. The actual lectures were probably the best part, there needs to be more supervision of what people are going to talk about so that their \"perspective\" comes out; instead, people mostly shared elementary concepts from their field. And the reading selections were especially poor, especially the unnecessarily long and extremely boring review articles. I stopped reading them halfway through the class because they were rarely discussed in the lectures, and they were way too long. This is just an awful genre of writing. People need to think more about assigning actually interesting pieces, rather than long summaries. This is especially true because long summaries give you almost nothing to debate in section. What are you going to do, disagree with the summary? No, you just go around and repeat random parts of the summary.",
    "Great, ambitious concept, but could use some major adjustments for year two. Would be interesting to continue with the idea of a panel explored in the final class, perhaps through a format of various experts debate a single topic or methodology through the lens of their field of practice. Additionally, the class should take the format of a Professional Skills Module (swipe into 8 of 10, etc.), or be a one-credit class. To prohibit\/dissuade a tuition-paying student from taking another professionally useful class by posing Perspectives as a 3-credit requirement is beyond ridiculous.",
    "The class did allow us to hear from a number of professors, some of whom I could be interested in taking a class with. However, the course did not adequately present \"perspectives\" I think, because we only got to hear one view from each subject rather than a wide view, and only from the academic lens. I also think the discussion groups often lacked a purpose and the discussions there sometimes centered on ill-informed discussion questions. I think bringing in multiple stakeholders to actually provide a number of different perspectives would be extremely beneficial. Going back to the case study component in some way would also help bring some much-needed focus to the course. In addition, the lectures left almost no room for student involvement in any way, since there was barely ever time for questions of engagement.",
    "The instructors had the unenviable task of providing an overview class to the wide range of disciplinary approaches within FES. Their vision was a bit slipshod but they executed it faithfully. I'm looking forward to seeing future iterations of this class.",
    "The topics were too many and as such, going broadly over too many areas may not be very effective. Some sort of convergence is needed.",
    "strength: it was a time every week to meetup with other MEMs, and learn what FES professors are teaching\/researching weakness: too short, not enough engagement with material being taught not enough guidance in discussion sections",
    "Strengths: I thought three of the lecturers were good - Karen, Shimi, and Dan Esty.",
    "The strength of the course was the discussion section and the wide variety of topics that were covered by the lecturers over the course of the semester. The weakness was a lack of cohesion and lack of guidance in how to draw real analytical comparisons between the speakers.",
    "Fifty minutes is too short of a time for us to learn much about different fields. I also thought that 3 credits was too much to assign to this course. The blog posts seemed obligatory, which came through in the posts in certain weeks. I think that there should be more of a panel style discussion or more consistent lecturing styles\/material for the professors. It seems like the professors only discussed what was relevant in their field and didn't try to connect it more to other fields.",
    "It was great to be exposed to so many different topics but at the same time they were all somewhat superficial given the limited time we had for lecture\/discussions. Perhaps it could be improved by focusing on one particular case study or environmental issue and then looking at it from different angles.",
    "The course's core strength is the variety of professors it draws in. I think it can be improved with more intentionality about how those professors are ordered; there was no cohesive flow throughout the semester. The course would also benefit immensely from a more coordinated discussion section plan. Rather than relying on the teaching fellows to determine how to spend each week in discussion without any oversight, I think the discussion sections should be more integrated into the planned syllabus. It felt very ad hoc from week to week, making it difficult to get a hold of what the course meant to teach me.",
    "One weakness of the course was that it did not add much value for students who majored in environmental studies in college. None of the topics were particularly novel for anyone with a background in environmental studies. The course should not be required for all students, or the topic should be changed. Additionally, joint degree students and mid-career students should not have to take this course.",
    "Strengths is that it covered a wide range of material; however the weakness is the same.",
    "S: the Monday lectures were interesting W: the canvas discussion posts. It was redundant to have such posts if we already had the discussion sessions. It was not necessary, nor interesting.",
    "Strength: Getting lots of different lecturers from across campus was great and honestly I wouldn't have known what they do otherwise.The discussion group was good\/fair however the redundancy with the online forum was very frustrating. I think the online forum should be axed. The real dialogue and back and forth happens with your peers. We are paying for a full time residence based graduate program. Lets stay away from online as much as possible please. Weaknesses: I didn't really learn that much in this course and certainly not enough to merit the 3 credits it took in my schedule. This should either be a lunch seminar at one or zero credits, or it should be kept at three and structured like science to solutions was last year with actual skill building like systems thinking and casual loop diagramming and tabulation. I gained very few skills in this course. I can see how someone with less direction who hadn't focused on a specialization yet could have gained from the way this course was structured, but as someone with focus and direction, I felt like this wasn't a big value add for me. Also - some of the presentators didn't seem to know what was going on. They were surprised about the timing limitations etc. This just looks bad and uncoordinated. Summary: This was fair\/ok as a seminar course but needs some refining and should be a 1 credit course given the material covered. I think alot of folks felt like they didn't' have the opportunity to really study much of what they wanted because of how big the core was. making this 1 credit would allow students to be more engaged with it rather than feel like it was a burden. Also - I get that this was a breadth over depth course. However, I didn't come here just to hear buzz words about whats happening in the environmental space. I want real skills and an action plan for making real progress. I've spent a decade thinking about these things. I don't want to just keep hearing the problems again and again. I want some skills to help untangle them and move forward, however humble and small steps those might be. I am still fully excited for F&ES and feel like I'm going to get those skills but this wasn't very illustrative of that.",
    "Strengths: Mixing of students Weaknesses: The classes were disjointed and shallow, leaving nothing to talk about during discussion (which was poorly run and awkward)",
    "More panels, more reference to preceding lectures to build a more robust lens of knowledge.",
    "Strengths: FES has many interesting professors that the course rightly endeavored to showcase for incoming students. Weaknesses and Proposed Improvements: This course did not feel like a course, and I am not convinced that it *should* be a course. It is a sensible goal to expose incoming students to the diversity of academic perspectives involved in environmental research and problem solving. But it seems like that goal could have been achieved without an official course that detracts from students' freedom to explore topics more deeply in other courses. I believe that Perspectives should be an optional (or perhaps mandatory) lecture series where professors discuss *their* current research and how it fits into their field. Lunch or even just coffee could be offered to give students an extra nudge to attend, but I honestly believe that most students would be interested in attending regardless. We all want to learn more about what professors are working on at FES (even outside of our planned specializations), but I think many students became frustrated by how forced and watered down the course felt.",
    "I have taken classes before that use this approach of having different professors give a lecture each week followed by a smaller discussion group, and they have been excellent. So I think that the concept of the class is one of its strengths. At the same time, I feel like I did not really learn anything new. Material covered was introductory at best, and my discussion group focused on justice issues that, for anyone who has taken some social science, also felt too basic for graduate-level studies. I also did not enjoy the final paper. I defended my specialization and intended area of study when I applied to graduate school, and it remains unchanged. Nothing from this course has altered that pathway for me. And the final paper felt like a repeated exercise. Overall, I really do appreciate the effort to create a space for students to challenge one another, hear perspectives that may challenge their own world views, and reflect on their own careers. But I think that this course fell short of meeting those expectations. I did not feel challenged in any lecture or discussion group, and I was frustrated that some of these conversations around privilege and power are still so stunted. I am ready and willing to engage in difficult ethical questions, but the ones asked of me were questions that I've been answering for the past 9 years in both undergrad and as a working professional. I shouldn't have to use one of my 16 courses here at FES to review these issues and subject material.",
    "Weakness: Systems thinking. Please remove this section. I don't feel this added anything to the course and wasted a lot of time. The \"systems thinking\" section could be called \"thinking\". The main take away from the systems thinking section was \"things are connected\", which seems pretty intuitive.",
    "Strengths: Allows for a common shared experience among the new class of MEMs. The discussion sections have the ability to foster dialogue among peers that may not talk to one another otherwise. -The goal, to foster systemic thinking, is a worthy one to pursue. Weaknesses & Suggested Improvements: -Lectures should not be 50 minute crammed overviews of different subjects at FES. It would be more beneficial if a single problem or set of cases were examined from different lenses throughout the course. For example, pick a problem around urban and rural development. Then have each professor come in and frame their lesson around the interconnected problems\/solutions evident from their view (communication, business, energy, water, etc.). -Discussion leader facilitators should be much better trained. My own TA was not very good at facilitating a discussion and instead interjected with her own opinions and interrupted others. She wasn't the only TA that did this; others I have talked to felt like they were judged for what they said and were often talked over by TAs. -Perspectives should foster the difficult conversations and dig into them more. People who have a fundamental view of certain things should be challenged in a constructive way, but that constructive method of challenging needs to be taught. -The discussion posts on Canvas were unnecessary and felt like busy work for the sake of meeting the 3-credit requirements. They didn't help foster engagement with the material. Instead, questions should be put up right before lecture on a slide and students should be asked to consider those questions throughout the lecture and then bring up their ideas in discussion.",
    "-WEAKNESS: Some of the lecturers assigned too many readings given that the lecture was only an hour long. -STRENGTH: The group discussions were useful and my TA did a good job in facilitating the discussions and also assigning discussion questions -STRENGTH: the lecturers were open to meeting with students after the lectures to continue the discussions",
    "The greatest weakness of this course was the depth of the course lectures; this could be improved by more pinpointed readings and a 90 minute lecture with concrete expected learning outcomes!",
    "I think this class has successfully achieved its goal to offer a broader perspective of global environmental issues.",
    "Strengths: Bringing in top lecturers from across FES, discussion sections allowed for good conversations with peers, offered students a lot of talking points for discussing climate change Weaknesses: Including mostly academic perspectives (Consider bringing in professionals from related fields too), it sounded like the topics varied a lot across the different sections (maybe ask the TAs to meet and plan together more often), didn't give much guidance as to how to discuss these topics with non-academics (Maybe include a field trip with an applied focus)",
    "The strength was having a great discussion section leader. The weakness was a boring lecture series. This class could be greatly improved if, instead of simply having lectures, industry actors and interest groups could each speak to how a topic affects them. The lectures we were presented with were generally surface level introductions to subjects most if not all of us were already aware of. Finding ways of going deeper into a topic in ways that are applicable beyond academic life is so important.",
    "I think having more of a through line, like a case study or more attention to the idea of the anthropocene, could help tie together the subjects and build on each other more - or getting different perspectives on the same case to better understand different ways of approaching the same topic.",
    "I appreciated the objectives set forth for this course, but I feel that it could have been organized more effectively. The course seemed to be a series of independent lectures summarizing distinct fields of study, rather than showcasing a variety of \"perspectives.\" I think that it would have been helpful if the class focused instead on a single case study that each speaker discussed in the context of his or her own area of expertise. In addition, I feel that the course would have been more valuable if the lectures each week delved more deeply into contemporary environmental challenges and the potential solutions and problem-solving skills that we could apply to our work at F&ES and in our future careers as environmental managers.",
    "The biggest strength is that they did get some great lecturers. The biggest weakness was the format. Having it mostly done in lectures in which no dialogue is established and then having a loose discussion was not effective.",
    "The speakers could have been better prepared to talk to the class. Some of them were disappointing and did not share anything new beyond what they had us read or did not keep us engaged.",
    "The strengths of the course lay in the exposure to a myriad of other forms and processes in which to engage the world and environmental practices. Which I feel would serve better as a series of lunchtime lectures that could be held the first few weeks as a better means of exposing students to the various disciplines\/tracts at the school than one rapid fire day of running to office hours to speak with Professors. As well, there was a wide distribution in the students response to the learning groups that we were forced to participate in. Depending entirely on the moderator, some students loved or hated it. I found the position to be difficult as it seemed that the expectations for facilitating a conversation for our teaching fellow weren't made clear for her (or many in our group for that matter), which resulted in a somewhat awkward and not very engaging class discussion. I would recommend bringing back the prior incarnation of the course, and splitting the current into two separate entities, one that is devoted to in-depth analysis of a topical environmental issue and the other a series of lectures to expose the students to possible areas of interest. The sum of the parts here unfortunately pales in comparison to their components.",
    "The course should either be condensed into a 6 week half semester course and in order to enhance discussions create panel discussions with different professors or professionals in the same realm to make the topics more engaging. Also no need for discussions sections AND comments online!",
    "The discussion section was always great as a chance to solicit honest thoughts about the lectures. We usually came back to a couple of major themes which helped us see all the ways in which these topics are connected. The readings were also a big help since the lectures were short. That said, the class seemed simply too broad. You really had to work hard to see how one lecture related to another. The information a professor could fit into a 50 minute slot did not include anything besides a very general background. I understand there are nearly 100 students to cater to and so you cant oick a specific focus, but maybe that means that there should not be a mandatory class. The class itself was fine for what it was, it was just the opportunity cost that made it unpopular. Perhaps by lightening the workload and making it a 1 credit class would be more amenable.",
    "it felt repetitive to participate in both a written forum discussion as well as in-class conversation that covered the same subject matter",
    "This course should be taught as a seminar course based on attendance. It allows for all these perspectives, which is great, but it eats up credits and adds a lot of reading on some weeks. I mostly benefited from the lectures.",
    "anthropocene is too theoretical of a topic to be a strong unifying theme. not the same as looking at various angles on a real-world problem (i.e. toxics).",
    "I can't see any weaknesses! Emma was our TA and she was great. As an older student, I have a wary eye on my time, and every lecture was worth my time and energy. I do know that there were only so many slots that Julie and Paul could extend to guest lecturers, and I wish there were more weeks in the semester to do so. I wasn't thrilled that the class was on a Monday at Noon---which meant I couldn't take any morning courses I had wanted, but other than that I have no negative comments about Perspectives. I do think that Julie and Paul worked very hard to make this course a success. Theresa B.",
    "Generally, the course is good for MEM students. But it could be improved by giving a case study in each lecture instead of talking broadly.",
    "The lectures themselves were very mixed in terms of quality and applicability. Some of them, such as Karen Seto's, did a great job of introducing us to really important and far-reaching issues in a unique way. For others, it seemed like the professors had different ideas about what they were supposed to be speaking to. For example, I was really looking forward to Ken Gillingham's lecture and I think it could have been a great chance to introduce to people to the scale and importance of global energy issues, but was disappointed to see that he spent most of the time discussing the intricacies of his research which I don't think was as exciting or interesting for the group of students as a whole. I think the goals of the class are really important, and I was really excited about this class, but it will take some tweaking to get it right. As it's currently designed, all of the perspectives offered in the class are from an academic lens. From what I've heard about a similar course two years ago, that one brought in people from outside academia in a way that actually introduced different perspectives to the issues we're studying. The best part of this course for me was the discussion section, which is due in large part to the facilitation by AJ. From speaking to other students, I was lucky to be in a discussion group of people who got along well, and AJ did a great job of bringing in topics that he thought would be interesting and relevant and was not afraid to let the conversations go where they wanted to (but still in a productive way), and to move away from the prompts given to him if necessary, which we were grateful for. I enjoyed the discussion group as a way to continue many of the conversations started during MODs, and without it, it would have seemed like those conversations before school started didn't really go anywhere. Also, why is this class only required for MEM students?",
    "The course spent a lot of time trying to convince us that we need to appreciate the vast number of perspectives on environmental issues, and while I understand the importance of taking a wide view of these issues, the MEM program is by nature interdisciplinary and I felt that the course was wasting its time preaching to the choir. I also think that the course could have demanded more from the students, or else it should be replaced with a distribution requirement so that MEM students can get a broader perspective while also being intellectually challenged. I think this class (whether it needs to exist at all or in its current form) needs to be reconsidered, especially considering how short this program is.",
    "Speakers are very good, they could share something more insightful than just a brief summary of their work. The discussion sessions were really good.",
    "Put it online or during orientation month.",
    "Does not need to be 3 credits. 1 credit is enough. Too broad and did not dive deep enough into issues of environmentalism and the anthropocene. Did not sufficiently cover the ethical questions surrounding human impact upon the environment and society. Instead of having FES specialists as singular lecturers, this course should bring in a cross section of scholars working at the intersection of environmental issues. Some scholars include Carolyn Finney, Robin Kimmerer, Donna Haraway, Anna Tsing, Dorceta Taylor, Jake Kosek.",
    "The course could be improved by brining it truly different perspectives and introducing environmental topics in a more open way. Additionally, if weekly discussions are to be held, discussion sections need to be structured in a way that really fosters student interaction. I think the course should be limited to meeting once weekly with a discussion post online without requiring further engagement. Many of us already have knowledge of different perspectives and in greater depth than the way those were presented during Monday classes.",
    "This class would have been more helpful as a mandatory lecture series. Perhaps four meetings throughout the semester where a panel (like the final class) discuss a major theme with multiple perspectives. I think the structure of the lecture portion affected how discussion sections went. I didn't get very much out of the discussion section, because conversations were fragmented and there was no clear direction. I think that could have been made better through a more dynamic presentation of perspectives.",
    "The course's sole strength is that it exposes students to what FES currently is as a school. I would recommend changing the format so that it is not a required class that negatively eats away at students' opportunities to try their hand at the classes for which they chose to attend FES. It should be an optional weekly lunch lecture, with discussion sections for those students who want to engage. Credit could be offered on a pass\/fail basis for students who want to engage and attend everything and perhaps write the final paper. It is ironic that the course is meant to give students a sampling of what FES offers so that they could choose their specialization, but the current set-up actually inhibits students from trying out these other classes before it is too late.",
    "This course was a complete and total waste of my time. I wish that I could be refunded for this class, because it prevented me from taking another class which would have actually benefited my education and my career. It did a disservice to the material and to the speakers to force it into a 50-minute space. I seriously doubt that anyone who has any experience or education in the environmental sector learned anything in this class. The discussion section was extremely lackluster, and did not significantly enhance my learning. The online discussion posts were repetitive of the discussion section; it seems like only one of them was necessary. I was extremely disappointed with this course, and got very little out of it. If this class must continue to be offered (and I don't see any reason that it should), I would recommend that it be continued as a 1-credit lecture series with a final paper. Or, even better, it should not be for credit at all, but should be a required lunch time lecture series for first-year MEMs.",
    "Perhaps it could be improved by allowing each professor to lecture on one specific aspect of their work or research. If tasked with making that accessible to all - business students, lawyers, scientists - the result could be really fascinating. The 10,000' overview week after week was not conducive to engaged learning.",
    "I cannot think of any strengths. The weaknesses include being too elementary and too broad. Each lecture was a broad overview of a topic, which many of us were already familiar with given our interests in environmental science and work experience in these fields. I expected the lectures to go in more depth. Also, the discussion section felt forced.",
    "This is going to be thoughts on the overall core curriculum built around this course: 1. I think it is fundamentally useful (and to some extent necessary) 2. I think it is also very upsetting that it 'steals' one 8th of my degree, when I came here with clear objectives of what I wanted to learn in those two years, and would need every last second of it (if not more) 3. I feel like I would feel more delighted and less upset about the core, if I felt like all courses were absolutely amazing and I could not have spent my time learning more or better content, but I felt like even within the given content I could have learnt more given the effort I had to put in Overall suggestion on how to structure the core: 1. It should be a case based core curriculum 2. Students should have to learn fundamental content like physical science, economics and a stripped down versions of ecology and social science foundations online beforhand over the summer 2.2 students can 'test out' of these as we could do now, and only do the ones where they have no experience 3. Then there should be a single core course worth 4.5 credits (1.5 classes) that is compulsory for everyone. This core course should have the following content and structure: 1. 3 regular length classes per week (M,W,Th) 2. The first 2 weeks should be advanced topics in the 4 foundation areas: Economics, ecology, physical science, social science, to bring everyone up to speed, and teach a few additional things compared to the summer courses that are more advanced (and therefore also interesting\/new\/at least a helpful refresher for even those who didn't have to take the summer online courses), maybe physical science doesn't need it and so each of the 3 areas would have 2 full classes to use 3. The remaining 10 weeks should be completely case based in the following way: 4. 5 cases to be discussed 5. Each case explores a contemporary topic, that has a different mainstream narrative and we use this class to explore alternative perspectives on it. For example for the mainstream narrative of \"business\", we would use the palm oil case and explore the ecological, physical and social science aspects of it too. By having everyone read the case and then have 4 lectures on the case, by the relevant 4 teachers (Oz, Ben, Shimi, etc.) highlighting crucial aspects of their field of expertise on it and how those should play a role in dealing with it. This is what would truly be useful and teach us how to think as good environmental managers. 6. The 5 cases to explore could be: (mainstream perspective in brackets) 1. Caribou in canada: (ecology) Ben Cashore, Oz already use it - could bring in economics perspective top and teach us some ecosystem valuation and current regular economics' as well as physical science 2. Palm oil: (Business) 3. Paris tall & IPCC (policy) * Ben talks about it * Physical science talks about it -> lets get all the perspectives, also business and also ecology 4. there should be a justice one 5. the 5th case would always be an upcoming news topic during the semester to be highly actual 7. Each of the 5 cases would be on for 2 weeks, thereby making up the remaining 10 weeks. Each perspective would take 1 lecture, per case, thereby making it 4 lectures and the additional 2 lectures would be invited guest lecturers from industry, or relevant organizations for the topics and\/or including podium discussions with them, with students submitting good questions based on their learnings of the case to them. This would also be critical in bridging the gap to us feeling more like we are also learning from industry practitioners and not just academics. All of this together would truly make for an integrated, eye opening, mind-stretching, well-structured, helpful curriculum for future environmental managers.",
    "A strength of the course was the discussion section, which I usually felt was a good opportunity to hear other students (although maybe a more defined objective or goal of a discussion group would've been useful). Another strength was the final paper, which forced me to think critically about my academic and career future. A weakness that is not endemic to Perspectives is the lack of representation of the nine guest lecturers. Only two out of the nine lecturers were women, and I don't think there were any people of color. I wasn't interested in taking a \"perspectives\" class from a group of white men. In addition, the lectures (with some notable exceptions) felt rather disjointed and isolated. Some I learned from, others I definitely did not. I like the idea of having a class that all MEM students take together, but I think that this class needs to tie the lectures together with something other than the idea of \"differing perspectives\".",
    "I think that fewer different speakers and more in-depth exploration of certain issues would improve the course. A greater exploration of environmental ethics might be useful for students regardless of their area of concentration. Specific case studies might also be useful. If there are guest speakers, I hope they would be better prepared for the specific goals of this course, as some of the guest lecturers this semester seemed to have very different ideas about the goals of their talks."
