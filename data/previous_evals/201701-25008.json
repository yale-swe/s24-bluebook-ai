   "comments": [
    "I learned about how to articulately assess and discuss movement. I became a critical thinker about bodies and their capacity to be tools of political and religious definition and negotiation. I developed my skills as a writer, especially when it comes to describing and engaging with performance, both quotidian and staged.",
    "Knowledge of Santeria religious practices, Afro-Cuban history, and the ways that dance and music have been a part of that. Also engaged in critical analysis of dance and movement performances.",
    "This course actually was not what I expected it to be and I learned way more than I imagined. Not only did I learn new dance technique but also about a prominent Afro Cuba religion and other important social and historical material related to Cuba. I also learned an extreme amount from the opportunity to interact with the guest artists and speakers.",
    "Through this course, I further developed and refined my critical analysis skills of scholarly literature, ethnography, and performances. By engaging with a variety of platforms ranging from ethnographic accounts to video performances to live performances, the course enabled me to learn how to engage with these sorts of forums in a thoughtful and meaningful way. I also gained much insight into Afro-Cuban culture, politics, and religion, an area of study that had never crossed my paths in any of my subsequent coursework at Yale. We also of course developed much new dance skills.",
    "This class helps disrupt the marginalization that is inherent with normal modes of teaching anthropology. I learned how to think critically about the roles gender, race, and culture are described and taught in society.",
    "I learned how to think more critically at every term when engaging with academic material and others."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved the incorporation of movement and dance into the class itself. It was the perfect mix of theory and practice. The chance to meet artists was so special. I think that the student presentations were the weakest link of the class. I would've loved to hear more of Dr. Berry's thoughts and lectures actually! The context and history and theory was important for my understanding, so I would've loved even more of that.",
    "The combination of academics and dance was really cool. I do think that some of our academic engagement could have been deeper.",
    "The course was very strong in that it was a great combination of teaching, dancing, reading and guest visits. I think some of the readings were a bit out of scope or not as interesting as others.",
    "The strength of the course is definitely Professor Berry's ability to seamlessly integrate text\/scholarship and movement to create a streamlined framework for the course that connects the two. Within this, the text covered a variety of perspectives on the subject matter of afro-cubans\/dance\/orisha\/Yoruba. Another strength I really appreciated was the way in which insights gleamed from readings or from dancing were drawn out to have broader implications on a political, social, and\/or religious level, making sure we understood the gravity and importance of it all. The weakness of the course is that it benefits very much from student engagement and participation and sometimes I felt that wasn't as high as it could be during reading discussions especially at the start of the semester.",
    "This course was fun, engaging, and allowed me to move and learn with my body as well as my mind. The only weakness is that I didn't have more time.",
    "This was one of the best classes I've ever had at Yale--the interdiscplinary approach of movement practice WITH academic\/critical engagement was a true success and a treat. I learned so much in this course: how to better engage\/learn from my classmates through conversation, how to express myself better and more critically, how to move\/be in my body in stronger ways. The Afro-Cuban history we engaged with always came from an understanding of our own positionality and subjectivity, which felt like the most honest and truthful approach in an academic environment that I've had yet. The class was exciting and hard\/challenging--I learned so much."

   "comments": [
    "Yes yes yes! Absolutely. This was a life changing course for me. Professor Berry is a phenomenal teacher and mentor. She puts so much care into her students and her classes. It is subject matter that will be hard to find in any other class, so you will learn a lot of novel history while also experiencing a completely new form of scholarship.",
    "This class was one of the greatest educational experiences I have ever had in my life.",
    "I 100% would recommend this to another student although Dr Berry is leaving so unclear if the course will be offered.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. It has been one of the top academic highlights of my entire Yale career.",
    "Yes. Not only is the material fun and engaging, it is important to learn in a university that usually focuses on the white, European perspective of world culture. It brings diversity of thought to the campus.",
    "THIS CLASS WAS AMAZING and I am so sad Dr. Berry is leaving us next year. I've never had a professor like her before and it was truly an honor to learn from her."
