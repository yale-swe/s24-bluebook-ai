    "TAKE IT! If you want to perform Shakespeare, it's a FANTASTIC COURSE. Depends on having a good class, though. No fun to do Shakespeare with bad actors. BUT AN AMAZING CLASS, TAKE IT",
    "Good and essential for actors looking for light audition training and a general expansion of Shakespeare knowledge, in application.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who wants a firm foundation for Shakespearean acting, especially if she plans on auditioning professionally. The class is fun, with minimal out of class requirements other than scene preparation and memorization, which for a Theater Studies minded person should be natural and enjoyable.",
    "Definitely take this class. It is more in line with a scene study class. It also will prep you well to audition with the monologues you perform in class. Professor Biggs is excellent at giving criticism and will actually tell you what he liked AND what he didn't like.",
    "Worth taking for any actor interested in having some Shakespeare material in his portfolio - scenework, monologues, sonnets. Worthwhile for all actors I'd say, actually.",
    "Yes absolutely. It is one of the few classes in the Yale Theatre Studies Department that provides technical training for an actor. It is demanding, but it helped increase my confidence with Shakespearean text and acting in general.",
    "It is an opportunity to familiarize oneself with the language, repertoire, and practice of modern Shakespearean acting. You learn a lot of text and are exposed to a huge range of material. I would and have recommended it."
