   "comments": [
    "i had high hopes for this class b\/c i loved AP chem SO MUCH!it was quite boring, unfortunately. professor yan is a great person, just i didn't click with her lecture style.class was at 9am which was tough.plus professor yan wrote on this tiny projector screen thing and it was hard to read. good thing i moved closer to it after the first test!also tests are so easy that the curve becomes really steep. no fair!in short, take it if you have to. don't expect a lot.",
    "I would NOT recommend CHEM 328. I have learned nothing and going to lectures felt like a waste of time. The course gives an extremely basic overview of pchem (easy, but useless) and although Professor Yan is friendly and approachable, her lectures and help do not offer anything that the textbook does not already have.",
    "Only take this course if you have to. It's not really new material, the class is early and boring and on the top of science hill.",
    "It's not remarkable either way. Most people taking it are MB&B majors for whom it is required. Some of the material is relevant and interesting, some less so. Lectures are well attended even though they are mostly straight from the textbook.",
    "The material isn't really that hard, but there's a lot of it and it's pretty dry. The textbook is not very helpful. Don't put off your studying until the night before the midterms. Also, keep in mind that homework determines as much of your grade as the midterms do.",
    "This is a great premed physical chemistry course because it connects sometime abstract concepts to real life biological processes. It is also a lot less intense than the physical sciences version.",
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in doing the MB&B major, but don't want an intense physical chemistry background. It does teach quite a bit and helps you understand the thermodynamics and kinetics of a lot of processes which is useful.",
    "This class is the physical chemistry course required for MB&B majors, so students are probably taking it to fulfill a requirement. It is pretty easy (3 midterms (drop the lowest score), problem sets due on the day of each midterm, and a final exam), but required so little effort that it was hard to take seriously. Much of the material was review from previously courses. The lecture and section parroted the textbook, and the exam questions were very similar to examples we had already reviewed. I would recommend that a student interested in learning physical chemistry on a deeper level consider taking the higher-level physical chemistry course.",
    "I would recommend this to a pre-med student or a chem major with a biological interest. An enjoyable experience in spite of the large volume of material",
    "I liked the format of the course. Great instructor and TA's. The subject matter is fairly dry, but the instructors did the best they could with the material. I thought the course was fair for students.",
    "Chem328 is a course required for the MBB major, but it is not particularly rigorous or challenging. Much of it is based off thermodynamics\/kinetics from general\/AP chemistry, with some calculus and more variables built in. Lectures will be pretty dry, but the workload is quite light (four total problem sets) and the tests certainly are not that difficult. The tests are application based and do not test an understanding of proofs or derivations. If you want a real, mathematical treatment of physical chemistry, this course isn't going to be what you're looking for. This course will get you the credit needed for MBB and slightly enhance your knowledge of general kinetic\/thermodynamic concepts.",
    "If you don't want to go too in depth on the chemistry side and don't like remembering derivations, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Chemistry 328 is a requirement for certain majors, and often used as to fulfill requirements for other majors. If you do not have to take this course, I suggest you avoid it. The chemistry version may be more stimulating, and the professor is likely to be more spirited. If you want to learn, go elsewhere. If you want to bemoan your existence twice a week and partake in something that feels meaningless, than this course is definitely for you.",
    "I have mixed feelings about PChem with Bio Apps. It's deceptively easy and somewhat uninteresting as a subject, which makes it very easy to not study for and to blow off, which winds up biting you in the butt in the end. However, even when I did put in the time and effort, it felt like nothing but a glorified version of Chem 118 with another few subject areas -- the difficulty level wasn't increased, and the class enthusiasm had decreased. I would not take this class again -- I think I would have preferred to challenge myself with a pchem course that involves calculus and actual learning than taking a course that I felt required minimal effort, but where even that effort was asking a bit too much since I found the subject material so unexciting.That being said, as an MB&B major I took this course because I was already taking biochem, physics,&physics lab this semester, and I didn't want to kill myself with the chemistry pchem. In that respect, it was a good choice.",
    "Sure, I'd recommend it, especially over the other pchem course.",
    "If you have to take Physical Chemistry then take this class. The problem sets are due the day of the exam so you need to do them ahead of time if you want to do well.",
    "I would recommend this class with great reservations. The class was poorly taught, the text was unhelpful. Overall, it was a bad experience",
    "You learn a lot of PChem without the spectroscopy stuff, which is what I hate... It felt sometimes as if you were being tested on dimensional analysis and your general problem solving skills more than your knowledge of the specific material.",
    "Take it if its a requirement, i hear its less work than the other PChem, but I wouldn't take this if I didn't need it, its just not as interesting as upper level bio classes or maybe other chemistry classes",
    "Incredibly boring, but you don't have to go to lecture because the powerpoints are online and thats all you need for the exams. Do not buy the book, I didn't buy it and went to maybe 6 classes the whole semester and aced the exams.",
    "Yes, take it. It is required for the MBB majors anyways, and Chem 332 is really difficult if you're not math-oriented.",
    "If you are looking for an easy Pchem class take this one; if you feel you really want to know Pchem, take the chem 332 one",
    "Do it. It was not too challenging, but interesting, and basically takes everything you already know about chemistry but tells you why all those equations are true and are what they are.",
    "I would recommend this class a good overview of the basic concepts in physical chemistry, with a few biological applications - thermodynamics, physical and chemical equilibria, molecular kinetics theory, and enzyme kinetics. It was very straightforward and the math not too difficult. From what I hear, it is definitely easier than CHEM332. Elsa Yan is a straightforward teacher, a bit dry but that is mostly due to the material covered.",
    "Chem 328 is physical chemistry was a limited number of biological applications. It should be seen as a slightly more rigorous and mathematical version of AP Chemistry or perhaps Chem 118 (although I cannot say for sure). It is my understanding that it is considerably easier and less demanding than Chem 332, although it is likely less intellectually stimulating. Altogether, this class will not be the most educational, enjoyable, or memorable, but it is a solid and professionally taught course and one that should not break an academic schedule."
