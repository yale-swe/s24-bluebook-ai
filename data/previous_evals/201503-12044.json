   "comments": [
    "Good class. French is overall stressful, and the tests this semester are a huge change-of-pace from L1\/L2. You learn a lot, but I was challenged a lot more with my speaking and listening. Over half of the tests are listening-based (vocabulary, dictation, oral response, story quotes), which was my biggest downfall, but thankfully even if you do mediocre or poorly on tests, there are other grade opportunities to prove your strengths (quizzes, class participation, writing composition, and grammar exercises). Take it with Ruth Koizim..she is tough and will make sure you know French, but she is very empathetic with a heart of gold. Also hear Vanessa and Prof. Burton are solid choices as well. With French, the professor makes all of the difference.",
    "Not as good I had hoped. If you've taken 110 and 120, 130 will be mainly review (seriously, most of the material was also covered in 120). The homework alternates between being too easy and too hard; rarely does it strike the right balance. The curriculum is dated; most of the tapes and recordings have painfully long pauses and are poorly paced (what often took 1.5 hrs could easily be done in 20-30 minutes if the tapes were improved). As in 110 and 120, tests at the CLS suck, since the computers never seem to work (luckily, they're every other week during class instead of every week outside of class). While I enjoyed the films and my French definitely improved, I think this was mainly due to exposure (reading and listening to books on tape, watching the films) and studying hard outside of class. I had hoped that I would want to continue on with French after this course, but after this semester, I'm relieved to be done with the department.",
    "A lot of work, but so worth it if you truly want to learn French.",
    "A lot of busy work. A lot of French. The occasion really cool discussion on the texts and films you study. Probably worth it if you need it for the language requirement. Just make sure you actually study your vocabulary and memorize the songs for the tests, and everything should work out.",
    "French 130 is a difficult class, but you learn a lot. I think it was a larger jump from 121.",
    "Would recommend, but do not underestimate the amount of work it entails.",
    "This class is definitely a lot of work if you take it with Koizim. This is because you have no idea what is going on in the class if you don't do the homework, and you feel super guilty when she finds out too! However, I think it is worth all the work because you definitely do well on the exams and your French writing improves significantly. This course is heavily vocabulary focused and you end up reading some amazing novels throughout the term! I definitely recommend the course.",
    "Madam Koizim is as good as it gets for French. She's tough and at times tough on individual students but you will get better at French. That said, this is a standard French class and you're probably taking it because you have to, but since you do, take it with Madam K.",
    "I would recommend the course for students who want to improve their french and are willing to cope with the workload and 5 classes per week.",
    "If you have a genuine passion for French, then you already know whether or not to take this course. If you are fascinated by languages and want an excuse to take a language course, it is a fine language course. If you don't fall into the first two categories, there are so many fascinating subjects to study that will expand your view of the world in a way you didn't expect that I would strongly encourage you to look into places that you aren't looking yet, like sociology, math, or computational linguistics."
