    "Most of what I anticipated was covered. I expected more emphasis on analysis of qualitative data.",
    "This class was what I expected.",
    "I took the qualitative methods class because I had relatively more quantitative training in my earlier education, and I wished to fill in my knowledge gaps. I'd never taken a proper sociology or anthropology class before and felt that \"threshold\" kept me from conducting research properly using those methods. At the end of this class, I feel like the imposter syndrome preventing me from calling myself a user of qualitative methods hasn't completely disappeared but has significantly lessened, which is a big win in my book!",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths -- gives students an opportunity to develop a useful research proposal. Weaknesses -- Some of the initial content felt very introductory for a graduate course.",
    "One strength of this course is that it is linked to a project that the student is interested in. Throughout the course, there are small group discussions alternating with lectures. Small group discussions focus on developing the theme, research questions and methods of the project - and you get advice from other students as well as TAs and professor - i found that to be the best feature of the course, it was very helpful. Lectures were comprehensive, but sometimes felt like a laundry list of topics that we needed to get through.",
    "Strengths: Dedicating class time to small-group discussion of our thesis topics was SUPER helpful. I was forced to clarify exactly what I was interested in, in words, when explaining it to a peer. Also, scattering time for discussion throughout the semester made me feel motivated to keep refining my topic. In addition, these conversations made me feel supported by my classmate cohort and I had \"eureka moments\" about my own work due to regularly hearing about other people's research questions and approaches. The instructor's teaching style and structure of the class period (lectures filled with interjections and student ideas, really practical guest speakers about funding and field work) reinforced that this was a space for us to develop ourselves and our ideas in a relatively-low stakes way. I looked forward to attending this class every morning. Weaknesses: Though we submitted many assignments throughout the semester, we got no instructor or TA feedback on anything we submitted. Small group discussion about our research topics doesn't replace receiving feedback and grades on assignments. For example, based on my participant observation notes, was I going about that method correctly? What could I do better next time when it counts? Was I completely off-base in the methods I thought Condon was using after reading his paper, because that could impact my future ability to comprehend papers for my own research? Lastly, I would have appreciated feedback on written work because as a first-semester graduate student, I'm still figuring out what suitable graduate-level writing looks like and wish to know if I'm on track.",
    "The discussions were not always as productive and the lectures were too hasty sometimes"

   "comments": [
    "It's a good introduction to qualitative research methods",
    "Take the small assignments seriously! They are called \"building assignments\" for a reason and are for your own benefit later. Pay attention to the methods section of the peer-reviewed papers you read in this class. They are concrete examples of what your approach during the summer could look like. Don't skip the theoretical (Creswell) readings entirely, but don't be afraid to skim them for the main takeaways\/headings. I found reading about concrete examples of people's qual methods more enlightening. Don't skim\/skip anything covered in the syllabus dedicated to research questions--this is all SUPER helpful to refining your thesis topic.",
