   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course only to a musically inclined person or a music major who enjoys jazz and music that pushes sonic limits. It can be a lot of work and reading, so be prepared to read a lot about this topic.",
    "Yes. I loved jazz before taking this class and it was wonderful to be able to learn more about a prominent jazz trumpeter such as Davis.",
    "If you are interested in the electric period of Miles Davis or fusion music in general, this class is a must. Prof. Veal is great, and the readings are all engaging. As a PLSC major, I wasn't planning on taking this class, but after shopping it for one week I made it fit into my schedule and it turned out to be my favorite class of the semester. That being said, there is some pretty wild and \"abrasive\" music that we listen to during the semester, so if you don't dig Miles 1968-1975, I wouldn't recommend this class."
