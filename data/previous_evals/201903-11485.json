   "comments": [
    "I established a great foundation for understanding this beautiful language",
    "Elementary Hebrew speaking, reading, writing",
    "This course covers a lot of elementary Hebrew. I learned a lot more in one semester than I thought was possible. At the end of the semester, we had a small oral interview, and I was surprised by the extend to which I was able to converse.",
    "My speaking, writing, and listening skills in Hebrew have improved immensely while taking this class!",
    "Woah. What a question! I learned so much about this Hebrew language in this course. Having some prior familiarity with Biblical (and some Modern) Hebrew, I felt right at home in class and was able to gain basic language skills in Hebrew. By the end of this first semester, we were listening to real clips from Israeli television (not understanding them entirely\/mostly) and could read short social media posts. Professor Roginsky incorporated many authentic sources that kept the learning real and fun. We learned A LOT of Hebrew this semester, and seem to have made a real dent in the language. While we don't know past or future tense, and only about half the verb families, this course gave me a foundation in many aspects of Modern Hebrew grammar and word choice. We constantly were using Hebrew to express our lives, like writing weekly Yomanim (journals), to sending messages in our class' WhatsApp group.",
    "This class offered a great introduction to Hebrew. We learned how to speak, write, and read, and the class environment was fun and engaging.",
    "I learned basic Hebrew from a standing start. I can navigate, hold basic conversations, and understand parts of more complicated discussions through reading, writing, and speaking. The class surpassed all of my expectations in the amount of Hebrew I would learn, despite the language having a different character set than English and no shared roots.",
    "The course is an intense introduction to modern hebrew."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength = it wasn't that hard\/time consuming relative to the amount we learned Weakness = meeting\/doing hw everyday ain't fun, weekend writing assignments were tedious and time-consuming additions to studying for the quizzes",
    "There are so many opportunities to really immerse yourself in Hebrew in this course. The weekly personal conversations help with this a lot, as well as the weekly quizzes and the journal entries. Dina and Anat were so helpful, understanding, and accessible. However, I didn't really get much out of the Hebrew tables. Also, some of the grading on the tests\/journals were unclear.",
    "Strengths: great tests and quizzes that accurately reflected how much I understood the material, fair grading, nice level of homework--it actually helped me learn the material. Weaknesses: some of the class discussions can get off-track, may not be the most sensitive to other cultures.",
    "Loved this course! I really loved all the authentic sources of texts and clips, the rapid pace of the class, small group conversations, creative final project, etc., and I am excited to continue taking higher level Hebrew courses in the department. One weakness of the course in my section was definitely the size. While we had prompts at the beginning of most classes to facilitate discussion in Hebrew, I do think that a smaller class size would allow for more instances of students speaking directly to the one native speaker in the class, the professor. However, language tables, small group discussions, etc., make up for this gap, the more times we can practice language skills the more second nature they become.",
    "The course is very carefully designed to teach certain concepts at certain stages in the learning so as not to confuse students and to lay the foundation for more Hebrew study. The amount of preparation that went into the course is evident. You will be in good hands should you take this course. Dina will help you do well -- she wants you to succeed -- and offers support if needed. I would suggest to the instructor that more assignments be made optional. Some of the assignments that were added to the homework for fun or enrichment would be best left to the choice of students since they are not as instrumental to learning as the actual homework. On some nights, the amount of homework would be 3x more than on other nights. Making more assignments optional would reduce variability in the nightly homework and increase students' visibility of their workload for the week. I was also surprised that the final presentation script was graded, as I was under the impression that the feedback we would get on this would inform the presentation itself. I should have sought clarification, but I do know that I was not the only one taken by surprise.",
    "Many of the students who sign up for this course already have significant background in Hebrew, and are taking the class for an easy A. That makes it difficult for other students to get a chance to participate in class and learn. The course could be less assessment-heavy and focus more on individual student learning. The course is also writing heavy, but students get few chances to practice their spoken-language skills."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely, it was such an organized course and clearly well-thought out.",
    "Yes, we should all learn Hebrew. But even if you don't think so and you're just looking for a language class, L1 Hebrew is way more chill than all the other language classes I've heard anything about\/taken.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. You learn so much and form a really great community with your peers. If you are unsure of what language you want to take, Hebrew is a fantastic bet.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who truly wants to learn the Hebrew language and the culture behind the language.",
    "Definitely! If you want to learn Hebrew and are willing to do the daily homework, then this class is great for you. Work is paced and pretty consistent, so you always feel ready to work, but never daunted to continuehopefully. This is not a language gut, however. Hebrew is an elegant and simplistic language with a different alphabet, 3-letter roots, verb families, etc., which make it very different than English; if you want an easy language class, maybe take Spanish or another language more directly connected to English.",
    "Yes! The class is fun and engaging, and you really feel like you develop a nice community.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course. You will be in good hands if you take this course. An enormous amount of preparation went into it to carefully lay the foundation for learning throughout the current semester and future semesters. It will not be overwhelming, but at times will require diligence. You can get an A if you are diligent in learning the vocab with a moderate but not extreme amount of work. Be clear about grading expectations and which assignments are graded and which are not. You are best to assume that everything is graded for accuracy (except nightly homework, which is only graded for completion). Proofread your weekly journals as if they were essays. An A is possible.",
    "Yes, to any student with a specific interest in learning Hebrew. You will gain some of the skills you need, but you may not enjoy yourself in the process."
