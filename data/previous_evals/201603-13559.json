    "Great!! Covers a wide range of issues relevant to aging health. Very different from other courses offered at YSPH....glad that there is one that focuses specficically on aging!",
    "The ideas discussed in the this class were very interesting, but the way the material was presented was poor. For a small class with a knowledgeable instructor, I was looking forward to learning more from Becca herself. Instead, students or guest lecturers gave nearly every lecture, and I feel substantive discussion suffered as a result. There are also a lot of readings each week, and it's hard to cover them all in class. Quality over quantity should perhaps be emphasized more.",
    "I thought this course was wonderful! I loved the guest speakers, and the student-lead class discussion structure. I thought each week's topics were worthwhile, and I appreciated the order very much. Overall, I learned a lot from this class and I am not sure how it could have been improved!",
    "Great course that gave me a thorough overview of research for elderly folk.",
    "I loved it. I think that this was my favorite course this semester.",
    "Overall, the material was diverse and the discussion was fascinating. It was just tough to keep up sometimes.",
    "excellent introduction to the field of aging and the scientific methods pertinent to the field",
    "Great"

    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Great! Knowledgable, clearly passionate about the subject matter, selects good readings, knows the literature well, willing to help students 1-on-1",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Professor Levy is incredibly knowledgeable and very clearly interested in her subject, and it was a pleasure learning from her. She was very receptive to ideas and did a great job of guiding class discussion while allowing students to form their own opinions on certain topics. Although class was structured in a way that allowed students to lead discussions, Professor Levy added meaningful input, and her patient work with the students before the day of their class allowed for smooth sailing. She was also very available for one-on-one discussions and for work on our proposals. I would take another class with Professor Levy in a heartbeat.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0She was very passionate about the course and has a lot of expertise on this subject!",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Dr. Levy is one of the most caring, genuine, and amazing professors I've had this semester. I really enjoyed her course, and I can tell that she cares about students. I highly recommend her class. Dr. Levy is very inspirational for students.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Dr. Levy is fantastic. She was understanding and reasonably accommodating towards students, which is such a relief when things come up. She's so knowledge, and it was a pleasure to learn from her. I do wish that she was more active in the discussion though.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0I had a great experience, highly relevant to those with interest in aging and psychology as well as those wanting to pursue research in aging The instructor was extremely effective never taking over and always encouraging the whole class driven discussions on the given topic",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0She is very experienced and extremely knowledgable in the area."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely would recommend, given that it highlights an area of research that is not often discussed in other courses. At least for me, I have not had exposed to aging research in my undergraduate career so this course was eye-opening!",
    "Would definitely recommend.",
    "You read 5-6 articles or book chapters per week, and then you discuss them with each other. It's a seminar, but not in the same way the CDE\/SBS seminars are. I was a bit mislead there. I recommend it for anyone interested in aging.",
    "Great!"
