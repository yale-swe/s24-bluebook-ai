   "comments": [
    "Given its focus on literature and philosophy, I thought this class did a fairly good job inculcating skills that are often particular to those fields, and that do not always overlap. On the one hand, the class helpfully distinguished among different philosophical theories, schools, and movements in the 18th century, with rigorous and sharp logical acuity. On the other hand, its focus on literature enjoined the importance of close reading and a certain kind of formalism (even if \"formalism\" itself became a rather thorny issue over the course of the semester). And, moving beyond both of these two skill-sets, it was a helpful demonstration of how one might go about trying to think across disciplinary divides, while remaining faithful to the practices and protocols of each.",
    "I spent a longer time thinking through this evaluation than my other course evaluations this term, because I can honestly say that this was, in my opinion, the best course I have ever taken. The thorough introduction to both the philosophical and literary changes in the 18th century as well as the current literary critical debates that concern those changes was not only thorough but presented in such a way as to seem endlessly fresh and immediately accessible. I come out of this course not only better informed as a developing literary historian but also much more aware of the diverse field of theoretical arguments that I might make, and I have strategies to make them that I did not before have. Furthermore, I feel that the focus upon aesthetic thinking in this course was necessary and refreshing, given the shaky standing of aesthetics within the current academic climate and some of the inspiring work being done to revive aesthetics as a critically salient mode of analysis."

   "comments": [
    "I have already mentioned what I took to be its chief strengths, and to those I would also add that it did a good job -- and certainly a better job than most graduate seminars -- connecting each week's discussions with broader theoretical or meta-critical problems in the field of literary studies. Sometimes these were illuminating, sometimes they felt slightly like distractions -- but in any case, they served the necessary and important function of simply giving us a sense of where the conversation has been going for the last few decades, and where it might be going in the future. Even though this sometimes meant that we had to do a lot of reading, it was undoubtedly useful. One way in which this class might have been improved, in my opinion, is by focusing in slightly more depth, and probably at the very beginning of the semester, on Locke and Hume. Above I said that a strength of this class was the way in which it married philosophical and literary concerns; and I think that is no small accomplishment. Yet there were moments, particularly early on, when our attempt to study literature and philosophy alongside each other, without having fully clarified difficult aspects of the philosophy itself, made the interdisciplinary project a little bit more difficult than we could all manage. It might have helped to just spend a session or two on Locke or Hume alone. There were good reasons not to do that, I'm sure. But for what it's worth, as someone who was occasionally confused, I would have appreciated it.",
    "I surprise myself by having no improvements to suggest."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, and for the three reasons I've already mentioned. First, it was a very good survey of 18th century literature and philosophy. Second, it demonstrated how to engage in an interdisciplinary study of both --which would presumably be relevant for anyone working in that vein, regardless of period. And third, because it was remarkably attuned to developments in the field, and usefully connected concerns that arose in the classroom with questions that ramify across literary studies -- if not the humanities in general.",
    "Absolutely. I think that students, particularly students like myself, who are in a moment of indecision and trying to identify as-of-yet untapped avenues for making arguments that matter to them, will find great resources in this course whether or not they are committed to the study of the English Enlightenment."
