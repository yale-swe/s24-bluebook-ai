    "A very demanding course, but very very rewarding.",
    "The course definitely improves your Chinese skills a lot. It's overall a good course that I'd recommend to anyone interested in learning Chinese. My biggest complaint however is that the overall workload was disproportionally high compared to other Yale courses and also languages courses. I think that the learning efficiency (amount learned per time spent) would be higher if the workload was lower. The course feels extremely rushed and one has little time for the much needed repetition of the vocabulary. Without that repetition, one quickly forgets previous characters, vocabulary and grammar structures. My other complaint lies in the teaching method. The teachers seem overly focused on memorization. For example, roughly once per week we have to memorize entire texts from the textbook and recount them in front of the class. Even more, one of the final projects of the class is to write a short text of at least 500 words. That's great! But then we also have to memorize it word by word and recount it without any notes. Similarly, tests, homework and class participation mainly consist of translating sentences or answering questions using a very specific set of vocabulary or grammar. Freely speaking is almost never practiced. Also, the amount of time spent on testing the students is too high in my opinion. The course has 4-5 written tests per week, 5 homeworks per week, 5 exams per semester, 2 oral exams per semester and 11 oral presentations per semester. For example, all the 11 oral presentations are done in class. That normally takes 50 minutes per oral presentation. But most of the time is spent just listening to other students recounting the text one has already memorized. That is completely wasted time. I don't mind the amount of testing being done, but that it takes so much time away from the actual class time.",
    "Strengths: good organization and availability of help. Weaknesses: although the fast pace of the course was bearable, lack of review of review sessions of past material was noticeable.",
    "Strengths: -Even though the daily quizzes were a pain, they were a good motivation to thoroughly learn the new vocab\/grammar before each class. -All three teachers are wonderful. Weaknesses: -Although the memorized weekly presentations helped with my pronunciation, I feel like there wasn't enough emphasis on casual speaking to practice pronunciation (i.e., using the grammar\/vocab out of context from the textbook dialogue.) As a result, I found the two oral exams to be very challenging.",
    "I liked the three-teacher system. It gave us a nice change of pace every week. I think the daily quizzes are given in the wrong order. I think the first quiz of a new chapter\/dialogue should have the translation be from chinese characters to pinyin \/ english and the second have the translation be from english to pinyin, since that is much more difficult. It would allow students to spread review time out more evenly across days, instead of doing the vast majority of learning\/review on one night and much less on the next.",
    "The strengths are the daily quizzes that keep the student on track with the rapidly moving class. The quizzes enforce the amount of studying outside of class and thus the amount of characters the students will learn. The curriculum could encompass more creative writing that allows students to apply what they learn with a broader view."

    "Absolutely, if you want to learn Chinese or have any interest in learning Chinese, this course is fantastic. You will learn so much and notice your own improvement.",
    "If you are truly interested in learning Chinese, then take this class. However, if you have any form of doubt as to if you want to learn the language or not DO NOT take Chinese. The class requires lots of time and dedication.",
    "Yes. Chns 120 is a lot of work, but if you have genuine interest in learning Chinese, it is rewarding.",
    "Yes. I would say that it's a lot of work, but I enjoyed it and I think learning Chinese can be very useful.",
    "A great elementary Chinese course that thoroughly improves your reading\/writing\/speaking skills with a significant focus on tone marks. All three teachers are great and understanding."
