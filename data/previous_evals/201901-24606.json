   "comments": [
    "Taking this course allowed me to further develop my understanding of colonialism and its various, interconnected manifestations throughout time and space. Especially enlightening were our discussions of method and genre, and of how the ways in which we study and write about colonialism necessarily shape our conceptions of them.",
    "How the coils of American power and colonial power ravel and unravel",
    "I learned the academic art of comparison. This was the first time I'd ever been exposed to critically thinking about the act of comparison and its implications and consequences. Seriously, \"Comparative Colonialisms\" does not just cover a bunch of topics in colonialism that are somewhat historically related - it forces you to critically reevaluate the way you learn about colonialisms\/colonial processes and the way you think about them together. I gained a lot of insight into one of the most brilliant minds in the field of ethnic studies, Lisa Lowe, which was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I learned SO much about colonialisms in America!",
    "Critical thinking, comparative thinking. Constantly linking between topics fhat seem disparate. Alternating thought through literary and academic text",
    "A little more insight into the processes of settler colonialism and slavery. Some more discussion as to how colonialism has taken modern forms. However, the course flowed loosely and felt scattered most of the time.",
    "This course will offer an excellent introduction to various types of colonialism: settler, transatlantic slave trade, and modern colonialism as evidenced by worldwide military basing. This class will push you to think expansively about de\/colonialism as a project and the limits that accompany decolonial strategies.",
    "Tracing colonialism across time and place through interdisciplinary methodologies including literary analysis, theory, historical analysis, ethnography, and anthropology.",
    "I learned how to analyze academic text, literature, and art simultaneously and cohesively to support an argument. In regards to insights, I gained so many new perspectives on the history of colonialism and its modern implications today. I also learned specific approaches that have promising results to improve the lives of those formally or currently subjugated by colonial institutions of power."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved that each unit closed with a novel relating to that unit's themes. It allowed us to look at other forms of expression relating to the relevant topics, beyond just scholarly works.",
    "I think Professor Lowe should feel free to add a little more reading to the syllabus. For an upper-level seminar like this, some weeks of reading seemed a little light (particularly Weeks 3, 4, and 7). There's a lot to cover, and beefing up the syllabus could help students gain an even more comprehensive understanding of colonialism.",
    "Could have gone into more specifics",
    "I didn't love the mandatory student responses to other students' questions. I would have preferred a rotating blog\/discussion post schedule wherein we were only required to post our responses to the reading. I struggled with posing questions that were good enough for other students to write responses to and I found that a lot of my classmates' posed questions seemed to have this same problem. Also, I would have preferred to meet twice a week instead of once a week. Biggest strength of this course, though: LISA LOWE.",
    "Wouldnt say anything needed to be changed! Thought it was perfect the way it was Should assign intimacies of four continents as one of the readings maybe",
    "The class should meet more than once a week. Because of the awkward scheduling, few people spoke because most forgot to do the reading. Because it met once a week, a lot of people forgot to keep up with the reading responses. Lowe also was not very engaging, basically talking at the class the entire time, rather than fostering discussion. She would also purposefully waste time in the beginning because the conversation would taper out towards the end, as the class was such a long block that everyone lost focus. I also did not appreciate how often she cut people off and played favorites so blatantly. The class seemed more like Lowe talking time than the actual subject matter at hand.",
    "Strengths - variety in disciplines \/ methodologies, attention to the framework of comparison that does not elide specificity, great balance of primary (literature \/ art) and secondary (history \/ theory) texts. Weaknesses - I think in the future this course should enroll only juniors and seniors, as the varying levels of students sometimes made it difficult to have a cohesive discussion.",
    "This course could be improved in how it asks students to participate. A possible strategy to engage more student voices would be to integrate a turn-and-talk section or small groups. Overall though, the course worked to provide a comprehensive introduction to colonial studies across a variety of media, ranging from scholarly journal articles, to contemporary news articles, to a variety of novels, to visual art.",
    "The interdisciplinarity of the course is great and allows for us to engage with the histories and legacies of colonialism from many different entry points. I think that the incorporation of fiction in particular was really enjoyable. However, I think it would be better for discussion in future years if everyone had similar backgrounds, or at least, some elementary understanding of settler colonialism and racial slavery before taking the class.",
    "What you take from the seminar really depends on the people around you. This course features great material led by an even more excellent professor, but this first iteration fell flat.",
    "One of the strengths of the course was the diverse range of reading (from academic works to literature to film to art) as such gave the students a broad range of perspectives on the specific colonial topics at hand. Additionally, I enjoyed having the discussion circles on Canvas and the structure of such as it gave the students certain weeks to extensively reflect on the reading while the schedule also took the students' heavy coursework into account as such a deep reflection was not expected on a weekly basis. I thought the length of both papers was appropriate and I enjoyed having one week to lead class discussion. The discussion portion was especially fruitful because while a small group of students guided the weekly discussion, it was not conducted in a way that made students not leading the discussion disengage. Rather, Professor Lowe continuously bolstered the discussion and helped students stay engaged throughout the course of the seminar. One minor downside was that the first paper was due the Monday after spring break. This timing was not ideal not only in regards to the break but also that students did not have any formal feedback before the credit\/d\/fail drop date and thus had to make that decision without such information."

   "comments": [
    "This is a PHENOMENAL course taught by a WONDERFUL professor. I would recommend it especially for upper-level students who have spent some time studying colonialism, but who wish to enrich their understanding further with a comparative framework. Professor Lowe strikes the perfect balance of rigor and generosity, and is, in sum, a joy to work with.",
    "Yes for Lisa Lowe shes fabulous",
    "Absolutely. Just do the readings, otherwise seminar discussion will be so dry and Prof. Lowe will be put in an awkward position; she'll fill the silence herself, which is great since she's so brilliant, but that's not the point of a seminar class.",
    "Yes! Professor lowe is incredibly kind and generous with her time and a huge supporter to student activism. She is also incredibly patient with students. Be prepared to get your mind blown.",
    "No. Did not gain much from the course. My other ERM courses were more productive and informative.",
    "Yes!!! Absolutely take this course if you have any interest in colonialism and imperialism, both in historical and contemporary contexts. Professor Lisa Lowe is fantastic. It would be a mistake not to take this course with her.",
    "Yes! I think even if you think you might have a solid understanding of colonialism, you will learn so much from this class! Take it even just for Lisa Lowe or any of her classes. She will challenge you to engage with these texts in a way, most likely, previously unimaginable. I think it's important for anyone and everyone who are citizens of the modern world to understand the histories and legacies of colonialism.",
    "Definitely. The topic is salient, and the material is rich and insightful. Keep in mind that the course does have weekly Canvas discussion posts (though, they are not bad at all).",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. As a second semester senior, I was in awe of the sheer level of intellectualism in this classroom over the semester. Professor Lowe drove students to contribute meaningfully to the conversations and I felt as though I learned something new every class. The reading list is enjoyable and enlightening, and the nature of the assignments made me excited to further engage with the material. One of the most intellectually stimulating courses I took at Yale and feel very grateful I decided to take this seminar."
