    "great overview of linguistics",
    "If you want to find out more about linguistics with zero academic background in the subject, it serves as an excellent general eyeopener. Otherwise, if you are more experienced, the seminar may not be for you.",
    "Take it if you want a broad survey about many language topics (starting from the basics, like how many languages there are in the world, to what makes up a language, to how children acquire it, to how languages die out) - there's a lot that is covered but the format of this class makes it low key and I feel like I always got something out of each class!",
    "This class will teach you a lot about linguistics and allow for you to engage a language that you've never heard of in a very interesting way. You will do research and write reports but the workload is not terrible. There is a large final project but it is interesting to complete and doesn't take too much time. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Go for it. Great class, really interesting material, light workload. Whether you've never thought about linguistics or want to major in it, this is a fun class to be in.",
    "TAKE THE CLASS! It was my favorite class at Yale (I'm not even into linguistics) and I learned so many things. The final project was very difficult but other than that it does not require a lot of work.",
    "Ling 006 is a great introductory course to linguistics in a small discussion-based setting with a group of diverse classmates. I would highly recommend it to another student who has never taken a linguistics course before because it was simultaneously instructive and fun - there is a wide variety of activities, ranging from the standard problem sets and readings to the more imaginative inventions of languages to the more self-initiated adoption of a language. If a student has any interest whatsoever in linguistics, this is a great course because the course is structured on the many foundational tenets of linguistics, and uses the languages of the world as examples.",
    "An interesting course. It's pretty easy so don't sweat too much about it. Honestly, it's a pretty basic overview and you probably won't leave the class with any deep knowledge. In fact, most of what you learn is common sense. Don't drop a class to take this, but if you need a credit and are interested in linguistics, might as well.",
    "Languages of the World was a good survey intro course in linguistics. It covered a wide variety of topics, everything from ancient scripts to tense markings, and utilized examples and fun activities to teach concepts. The class is very free with regards to structure, and students get to decide much of the subject material that will be taught. Professor Bowern is very nice and knowledgeable in the subject. The class was sometimes dry, and the readings were at times very complex and difficult to digest. The class also has a hard time engaging everybody and many days only two or three people participated. The small size of the class helps foster class discussion though. Originally I went into the class thinking I was very interested in linguistics, but the class taught me the opposite. I learned that an interest in learning languages and a fascination with languages does not transfer over to linguistics. However, I still felt like the class was interesting and a good introduction to linguistics."
