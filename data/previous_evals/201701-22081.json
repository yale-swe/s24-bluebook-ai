   "comments": [
    "As an undergraduate enrolling in this course, I truly felt pushed to elevate the level and standard of my engagement to match the graduate students in the class, and thrived from the experience. The course gives you an incredibly opportunity to synthesize iconic dramatic texts, with fascinating literary, social, and performance theories, all integrated across the backdrop of different theatrical traditions and cultural histories.",
    "Through this course I was introduced to a body of plays primarily from the Anglophone postcolonial world. Having never read any of these plays, I was fascinated to learn about the historical conditions they each responded to, about the critical essays that responded to them, and about the dramatic conventions they chose to adopt."

   "comments": [
    "This class was superb overall. An excellent level of discussion and teaching; Prof. Roach is perhaps the most edifying instructor I've had at Yale. The assignments formed a cohesive framework for developing a specific field of enquiry over the course of the semester, and the syllabus was carefully crafted to be balanced in its themes and focuses, in addition to eminently manageable every week.",
    "The class was small but devoted to the material, which made for an amazing community. The readings were phenomenal; I can't say that I've been in a class where I've found every single text to be such a rewarding experience. The only thing I will add is that it would perhaps have been beneficial to read more secondary sources."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course. There aren't enough classes taught about post-colonial eras and especially post-colonial art. I am not a history person and I found this mixture of art, literature, and post-colonial theory to be an incredibly enriching one. Also, Professor Roach is one of the most intelligent, passionate, and wonderful teachers at Yale.",
    "Absolutely, and without any reservation -- especially to undergraduates looking to push themselves and explore themes that are only beginning to be examined in an intersectional light in the Yale English department.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is either interested in reading postcolonial theater, or who is a lover of theater but does not know much about the postcolonial world."
