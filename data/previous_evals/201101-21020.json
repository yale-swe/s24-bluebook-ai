    "Yes. Would recommend for students of Latin American history and anyone interested in comparative European empires.",
    "This class offers readings in the development of the Portuguese Empire from the formation of Portugal to the independence of Brazil in the 19th century.I would only recommend this class to students with working knowledge of Portuguese or familiarity with European\/African\/Latin American colonialism.",
    "See above.",
    "History 809 is a great class that touches on each part and several important aspects of the Empire and makes one want to learn more (in a good way). Discussion is always interesting and even invigorating. I would recommend the course and the professor to another student."

   "comments": [
    "The final paper helped me reconsider some ideas about my area of study and understand the global impacts of colonialism, but did little for my overall trajectory.",
    "This course and the understanding I gained from it will make its way into my dissertation in a number of ways. It is both an important comparative case for me, and an important part of the story itself. I don't know if I will have a chance to learn Portuguese or conduct any primary research on Portugal, but I will certainly incorporate the secondary literature into my analysis.This course took me from a position of complete ignorance of the field of Portuguese history to what I consider a solid understanding of the field for a non-specialist. Thanks for a great course.",
    "The course allowed me to widen my knowledge base in an area I was not very familiar with beforehand. The course may have contributed to my major paper, but I'm not sure yet to what extent."
