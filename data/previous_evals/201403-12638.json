    "I would very much recommend this course. Professor Auld is fantastic, and he made the 9am course very worth it. I think this course could succeed as either a lecture or seminar. I feel that I am leaving this course with knowledge extended far beyond just resource management and Canada; however I feel very well-informed on that front as well.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in Canada and its econ, poli aspects, take this course. I knew nothing about Canada, but walked away with a greater interest in the country.",
    "Yes. The Canadian case studies offer an interesting counterpoint to the US, making the class very interesting.",
    "A general overview of resource management in the Canadian context followed by case studies in: Oil & Gas, Fisheries, Water, Forestry and Mining. The issues discussed are unique to Canada but there is some integration of US-relevant themes."
