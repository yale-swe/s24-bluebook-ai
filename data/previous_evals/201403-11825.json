   "comments": [
    "An amazing course if you're interested in cities at all. The term \"urban public spaces\" is taken really broadly and we discussed everything from parks to homelessness to neoliberalism to Internet spaces. Professor Barraclough is so down to earth and helpful and makes everyone so excited to learn. There's a huge essay at the end and sometimes there's a lot of reading, but it's all really cool material. One of my favorite courses I've taken.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. Professor Barraclough was an incredibly thoughtful, engaging, and easy-going seminar leader. I looked forward to class every week, because the conversations about the readings were never constrained to just the readings. We always tried to talk about them in terms of real life, our own lives and interests, or how they applied to other classes we've taken. Professor B's seminar was a stimulating space in which to truly exercise our own ideas and thoughts, and that space was extended to the freedom we had in the two projects, as well. It was the most conversational, engaging, and thought-provoking seminar I have taken at Yale.",
    "Take it! Professor Barraclough is an incredible discussion leader, a great selection of readings from various time periods that all still feel very urgent to contemporary questions about how power operates in public spaces. The papers and assignments are an incredible opportunity for students to tap into community life in New Haven if they so choose, or into their own cities."
