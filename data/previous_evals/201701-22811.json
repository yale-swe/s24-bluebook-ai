    "Good, and necessary. Maybe a different time of day would be best. Though I did like the snacks.",
    "Since it's mandatory, I'm not sure how to make it better. Susan was super kind to us by providing cookies.",
    "The professors that cared did a great job. I liked how Chuck and his partner went over some real gray areas in conflict of interest. Other people cared less. I felt like the section on how to deal with conflict with your advisor and switching labs could have been done better. Joan did a great job with some of the plagiarism issues. Nikil obviously cared a lot about his section and put a ton of work into it. It was a great example. But since it was from physics and their experiments\/collaboration work differently, I think we spent more time asking about the details of the experiment than talking about the fabrication. The story of using acid to make skin cells pluripotent would be a great example though. The one on IP was fascinating.",

    "Well, I think they have to take it anyways. But it was good to learn about and discuss different problems we might face (plagiarism, scientific writing, falsifying data, etc)",
    "Yes. I think the ethic code is slightly different from my original idea, therefore, I think it's important to know some basic idea. Especially what is a proper reaction to the cases in the materials."
