    "I strongly recommend it. My knowledge of macroeconomics has improved tremendously after taking the class.",
    "Difficult and not helpful, but somewhat counterbalanced by the fact that the instruction is really excellent. Avoid if possible.",
    "This class is absolutely essential for economics graduate students. I took a lot from the course in the way of preparation for my professional career, but I also found the course extremely intellectually satisfying.",
    "Yes I would recommend it because the contents covered are interesting.",
    "ECON 510 is a challenging course in macro theory, but you get out of it knowing a ton of information. The problem sets are very time consuming, so people who are electing this course (i.e. not econ phd students) should take this into account when making their course schedule for the semester."

    "As I mentioned before, most of the topics that we covered were brand new for me, and now I am opened to a new branch of research material. I feel this course has prepared me with tools to solve some research question that I may have in the future.",
    "This course is absolutely essential for my profession. Since I am considering specializing in macro, the course made a major contribution to my research."
