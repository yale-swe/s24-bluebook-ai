    "I have heard this had been good in the past with other teachers. Don't take it with Gerle.",
    "I would recommend this class but perhaps with another professor. Make sure to know what you're signing up for before enrolling in this class as it will not be a gut. It takes at much or more time than traditionally difficult classes and is not for people who do not care about the performance they are putting up every week.",
    "This is primarily a performance class focused on the individual with some writing exercises thrown in to ensure you are doing the right emotional exercises out of class. The midterm paper and performance analyses are manageable. The hardest part is memorizing the songs. The concert at the end is the best part and is very fun. I would only recommend this class if you have a thick skin and are willing to and can handle a lot of criticism. I think this class made my acting better overall and expanded my knowledge of musical theatre and performance.",
    "Musical Theater Performance was definitely a very helpful class in terms of acting and performing. Professor Gerle is a fantastic director, and so he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really able to help you get the most out of your performances. That being said, he expected a lot; every person performed every week, and we did a fair amount of writing and analyzing performances. You also get to perform original songs composed and written by the lyrics and the composing classes though, which is cool. I enjoyed the class, but it was also pretty stressful, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend it, but be prepared to have to put in a fair amount of work.",
    "The course consists of learning songs on your own and then performing themeach week in class for a while, getting critiques and notes from Andrew as you go (not much collaboration between the students though, mainly just Andrew commenting on each individual). Every few week is devoted to a different time period and therefore a different song. You also spend time in class watching videos and talking about other performances. There is a large writing component to the course--I think I did more writing in this class than in any other--with a bunch of small papers and one larger one. A good course overall--I think I got better over the course of the semester and learned a bunch of techniques for analyzing songs and characters and got a lot of practice.Andrew is a mixed bag, but always well-intentioned. Sometimes his comments can be a bit abrasive, but he clearly has a lot of experience and knowledge to impart that is very welcome in a class like this. He had very high expectations of the amount of work that would be put in to the class and the level of professionalism of the students, all of which is fair and understandable, but may have been more than was expected by the students at the beginning of the course, catching some people off-guard. I feel that I learned a lot though, and that he was honest and helpful and always found ways to improve a performance that the student could connect with."
