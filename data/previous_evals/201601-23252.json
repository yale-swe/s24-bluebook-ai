    "If you are interested in learning about membranes you should take this class.",

    "Great survey class for students interested in membrane biophysics.",
    "It was a great course and you will learn a lot about membranes. The topics were varied which made the classes interesting: history of membranes, lipid bilayer basics, ion channels, structural approaches to view membranes, etc.",

    "This topic was definitely outside my general field of study but it was good to branch out and get a more broad knowledge of science",
    "I found this course immensely helpful for my dissertation research on a membrane protein. I knew very little about membrane dynamics or general transporter behavior prior to this course",
    "This course was relevant to my study because I am studying localization of a protein that associates with a membrane protein. I learned a lot about membranes in their course."
