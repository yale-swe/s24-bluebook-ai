   "comments": [
    "Would highly recommend if you do research anyway. I spent a lot more than 10 hours a week in lab, but that's typical for me anyway.",
    "You just do research",
    "I love this class. It is highly dependent upon your PI but I recommend it (even if it is P\/F).",
    "Aa course that gives MBB students an opportunity to gain more practical lab experience. The most written work comes at the beginning and end when you write you research proposal, presentation, and report. Giving yourself internal deadlines so that your research mentor and PI can read your drafts well before the due date. Depending on your project, you will most likely spend more than 10 hours in lab (I certainly did) and you may be going in on the weekends. The fact that you get a grade for MBB 470 remedies these conditions, in my opinion. I enjoy projects and presentations so I would take this over a science course any day.",
    "This is just a pure-research class with no lecture component. Have good standing with your PI and have a good work ethic and you will do fine in this class. Word of advice: start your 12-15 page research paper earlier than you'd think you would need, because towards the end of the semester, all you work will come crashing down on you, and you will truly regret it if you can't proofread your paper multiple times before turning it in. Be prepared to spend upwards of 10-20 hours per week in lab (if you want to be in good standing with your prof\/have a good work ethic\/want an A). Because remember: science never sleeps! Often if your experiment takes more than 10 hours per week, you can't not do it! You have to do the whole thing and that can take up much more free time than you think.",
    "Great way to dedicate time to research and also get a class credit.",
    "This is great! Take while you still can get this class for a grade.",
    "Definitely take this if you can! MB&B 470 was a great way to learn lab techniques, because you got to learn new things and work towards an extended goal throughout the semester. Much better than just doing things for one lab experiment and then doing another technique the next day. The continuation actually led me to understand the thought process behind designing experiments, and to delve deeper into being able to actually talk about the research that I was doing in a comprehensive manner. It probably depends on who you have as your PI, but mine was great and I learned a lot, as well as had a great time doing it! Just make sure that you get an early start on your final paper.",
    "If you want experience in the lab or want to continue a summer research experience, you should definitely take this class.",
    "I'd strongly recommend taking a research-for-credit course as part of your MB&B major. Ten hours a week is plenty of work, but you'll get a pretty good sense of what lab work is like, and get to know grad students who can give you an even better sense. Choose a lab carefully: besides talking to the PI, talk to upperclassman friends to find someone who worked in that lab and ask them about it, or stalk the lab website and email some of the undergrads who worked there in the past. (One of the things I learned this semester is that I don't want to work in an academic lab for a career, and I still think this was a really valuable course!)"
