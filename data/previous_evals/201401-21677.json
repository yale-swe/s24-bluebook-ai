    "While class isn't always an enjoyable experience - 9AM lectures can be somewhat tedious - ECON 132 is everything it's promised to be in terms of actually teaching you how to interpret econometric papers and provide you with a base from which to do your own research.",
    "Ultimately a disappointment. Altonji is extremely friendly\/approachable\/helpful, but he's not a very good lecturer. Definitely go to his office hours if you take this class with him. I took this course because I wanted to learn more sophisticated econometric techniques to use in senior seminars\/possibly a senior thesis. I learned plenty of techniques, but I don't feel I really understand anything pretty in-depthy. Part of that is my fault for taking the course credit\/d, but so did (it seemed) about half the class of 20-something students. Spent way too much time on theoretical foundations of OLS\/related topics. Exams were stressful and didn't really feel like studying for them was a useful way to learn econometric skills. However, the final project was actually kind of fun.",
    "Don't be intimidated, it's very manageable in terms of workload and difficulty. The project at the end is very involved and a good warmup for a senior essay if you're looking to write one. Tests were very fair and there won't be any suprises. PSETs take a long time, but there are only 6 over the semester. 9 am was rough but definitely worth it if you're looking to do any sort of quantitative analysis in your thesis.",
    "It's very hard and requires outside work. But it is entirely doable and teaches you interesting and useful skills. The Psets are hard.",
    "Take it! Really tough, but fascinating and so useful",
    "If you want to take this class, you'd better have a real good reason for it. Lots of work, hard material, and boring classes that were badly taught.",
    "Really only take this class if you're interested in reading econometric papers and journals. You will learn to read and understand papers in the field, but it comes at a cost of the most boring and dull lectures this side of the Mississippi. That being said, its not an awful lot of work but it is very difficult.",
    "Only take this class if you're going to be really serious about getting something out of it. Lectures are very boring \u2013 Altonji usually assumes you know more than you do and he's usually really confusing to follow. If you keep up with the reading, the class is a lot easier because the textbook is helpful. Grading on the problem sets is pretty lenient, and there are 6 with one drop, so they don't end up being a real headache. The tests are fair and definitely don't try to trick you, but they require you to memorize a bunch of proofs, and it's hard to know exactly what will be on them. Overall, I think you can get a lot out of this course but it takes some initiative so don't sign up for it if you're not going to stay on top of it all semester.",
    "Best Econ class! So much better than Economics I. This might be the only class I've gotten any practical skills from at Yale. It's also not horribly hard, just challenging. The psets take a while, maybe about as long as Intermediate Micro psets, but are way less painful. You never really get stuck, and there are only 6 (and you can drop one), so you get plenty of time to do each! Also, the exams are straightforward, and the curve is centered on an A-. TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT And put in a cr\/d, but you probably won't need it after the midterm.",
    "ECON 132 teaches you a lot of useful econometric techniques, and you will come out of the class being able to read and understand economics paper a lot better. That said, econometrics isn't the most exciting subject, and it takes quite a bit of effort to go through all the material and understand it properly. Professor Altonji is a really good instructor and is really helpful during office hours. Overall, I'm glad I know this material now, but I didn't really enjoy the process of going through the course.",
    "It is a difficult, highly theoretical, but also highly useful class if one wants to do social science\/Econ research. The materials are very technical and the workload is pretty heavy. Expect to spend 4 hours on average for each pset and a huge amount of time studying for the midterm and final, as well as a lot of effort into the final project. Prof Altonji is a decent lecturer, though not super helpful at office hours. He is extremely nice and approachable though. Overall it is a class worthwhile of the effort.",
    "Good class but lots of work, be prepared to spend a lot of time studying",
    "This class should be mandatory for the Econ major. Take it to get a better understanding of a lot of the methods used in economics papers. Professor Altonji is a wonderful professor and explains most everything very well. Highly recommended as an interesting quantitative class, and for exposure to some statistical theory.",
    "Econ 132 is easily one of the most applicable classes that I've taken at Yale. As a junior preparing to write my senior thesis, I learned the techniques to be able to conduct economic research on a fundamental level. Professor Altonji was extremely attentive and good at explaining difficult concepts. This was a fantastic class. TAKE IT, even if you don't plan on writing a thesis. If you're an economics major, you should be able to read an economics paper, and you can't read an economics paper without taking this (or a similar area) class.",
    "\"Econometrics II\" is technically the follow-up course to \"Econometrics I\" but you'll be able to take it so long as you've taken any introductory-level statistics class, including AP Stats. The course definitely moves very quickly, packs in a large amount of information, and has a big workload. That being said, I guess that most students at least start the class Credit-D (and many keep it that way), and the grading is kind, so the course is less stressful than it might otherwise be. I took the class with Prof. Altonji, who is an absolute sweetheart. He loves the material so much that every day you'll be struck by how darn cute his enthusiasm is. Altonji isn't always the clearest lecturer, and he moves too quickly at times. Bottom line: there's probably not another stats class at Yale that will teach you as much as this, and it's worthwhile - but you have to be willing to do the work, and know that sometimes your eyes and brain will glaze over at the giant slides of proofs. Then Altonji will get excited about something again and the glaze will go away a little. Good luck!"
