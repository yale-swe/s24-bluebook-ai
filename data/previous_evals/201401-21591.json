   "comments": [
    "Gut. But, there are 8 writing assignments in class that are based on the lectures and readings. You can get by with Bs if you do the bare minimum. Professor Kahl is super sweet but doesn't have control over the class at all.",
    "I found the material to be relatively interesting as well as the readings, but organizationally, the course is not that good. Professor Kahl is extremely sweet and passionate about the topic, but doesn't always present it well. If you're motivated to do the readings and attend lectures fairly often, this is a pretty easy course.",
    "If you're interested in the subject, you could probably find a textbook and learn more in an afternoon of skimming than I learned in this class. Good fifth class... or sixth... maybe seventh?",
    "Relatively easy. But very engaging lectures and you will learn a lot about religion and even more about political participation from religious actors. BIG FAN!",
    "I wish I had better things to say about this class, but unfortunately, I don't. Throughout the semester, you get the impression that there's simply too much for this class to cover appropriately or even correctly given its incredibly broad scope. But as the semester goes on, you start to question whether or not the professor actually has a good grasp on the religious ideologies and traditions involved. To be fair, this comes from a person with more knowledge about Western Christianity, but at the same time, you'd hope that a particular tradition (heck, even one I don't agree with!) didn't get reduced to \"basically these people hate the poor\" (paraphrasing the mentality). There's simply too much for this class to cover for it to be good. For those seeking an easy class, this is it. But I strongly, strongly urge you to reconsider taking this if you're just looking for an easy class. Your Yale education is too valuable to have it filled with unfair and incomplete over-generalizations in a topic that's so important to so many people that it deserves a far more nuanced treatment.",
    "Though at times it is a bit disorganized, at the end you realized that you really have learned some elegant ideas.",
    "Easy class, you should take it.",
    "You have the potential to learn quite a lot in this intro class. I must say that Sigrun Kahl is such a great professor! She strikes a wonderful balance of being pretty laid back while at the same time being BRILLIANT. The class has a seriously manageable workload and the readings were only necessary for a couple of the in-class assignments and some of the final. A perfect fifth class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is interesting, has a fair course load, and will help you think about the course topic in depth.",
    "A good class to take",
    "Without question the worst class I have taken at Yale. First of all, Professor Kahl arrived late to every session, which is extremely disrespectful towards the students in the class. Second, she spent at least five minutes (sometimes up to ten) figuring out how to operate her laptop and get a Power Point going. All I could think during that time was that my tuition money is going to watching a professor set up for class. Suboptimal to say the least. Professor Kahl furthermore has a lot of trouble with English, which becomes evident when she tries to explain what she wants students to write on the in-class assignments. It does not benefit her to pick TAs who are all non-native English speakers. The assignments are the worst idea I have ever come across in higher education. After two (out of eigth), we got sentence limits, which basically just said \"the TAs are too lazy to read your explanations, so we will just go ahead and make life easier for them.\" Grading on the assignments was incredibly arbitrary. One TA once tried to give his desired three-sentence answer to a question, but could not do it in less than five. Then he smilingly remarked that he had read 5-sentence answers EVEN THOUGH THE INSTRUCTIONS TOLD US WE COULD ONLY USE THREE. Professor Kahl jokingly remarked that the grading more or less depended on \"what mood the grader is in when he\/she reads your answer.\" The level of laziness and incompetence that I witnessed in this class was remarkable. Hopefully this awful class gets scratched from the bluebook in coming years.",
    "Can be very boring, and was probably one of the most boring classes I've taken, but it's not too difficult. Very very easy to get an A-, much harder to get an A. But this class is almost no work.",
    "Take it if the subject matter interests you and you'll actually go to lecture and pay attention. Otherwise, don't bother.",
    "I would take this class for sure.",
    "The class is a massive gut but incredibly boring. You can get away with not going to class and still probably get an A. The readings are random and unnecessary so you don't even need to do that. The final exam was pretty much all opinion questions. Take it as a gut if you need the distributional credit or as an easy PLSC class",
    "Who knows what happened in this class. I don't.",
    "Good class. Professor Kahl is the sweetest and cares a lot about her students. The writing assignments are pretty chill as long as you go over lecture slides. Take it!",
    "\"Religion and Politics\" is interesting and worthwhile, if you (a) are genuinely interested in the topic, (b) are willing to sit through long lectures, (c) willing to learn primarily about Christianity and a little bit about Islam, and (d) looking for a more chill class in a semester with a heavy course load.",
    "Yes it was interesting with a light work load.",
    "Easy class, but you learn a lot. I really enjoyed it.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. It is boring, it meets at a horrible time in the afternoon, the assignments are graded in a random way and they are not very related to what you do in class, and having a writing assignment every week is really annoying. Also, you can't use your laptop, which makes things a bit complicated if you don't like writing by hand. I took socy172 because I needed a social science credit but I am convinced there are better classes offered at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it. Very relaxing class but you learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course. The reading is light, and the reading responses are not super difficult. However, the final was a little frustrating.",
    "This course is so easy that it is hard. If you over-think things, this course is not for you. You are better off taking a course where you can write papers and be able to explain your point of view. It also depends on the T.A. that you get for the semester.",
    "The class is interesting and not too challenging. Prepare to engage during class discussions, even though it is a lecture.",
    "I would recommend this class. The material is engaging but not overly complicated or so specific that it demands a prior knowledge of the subject matter"
