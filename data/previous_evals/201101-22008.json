   "comments": [
    "I cannot recommend this course highly enough for a student of philosophy or intellectual history who is interested in \"continental\" philosophy but is unsatisfied with the Phil. dept.'s meager offerings. The course is an excellent introduction to the movements it covers. Its shortcoming is that it is not nearly long enough to cover its remarkable breadth in great depth; but it is an excellent overview that will give students a broad base for future study. Philosophy majors, take note: This course isn't listed in the department but can be made to count towards the degree requirements as one of your two transfer courses. I recommend it.",
    "I recommend this class if you feel capable of reading, writing, and discussing dense, philosophical works and feel that you would enjoy it. Shore is very knowledgeable, but sometimes class discussion stalls and you aren't sure if you're coming away with anything. So a lukewarm recommendation.",
    "Intellectual History of Modern Europe - Structuralism, Phenomenology, Existentialim is a very good seminar, I enjoyed every section and every assignment. The material covered is fascinanting and beautiful, giving a deep understanding of Contemporary Europe's intellectual and historical evolutions.Professor Shore is very nice and very knowledgeable, ask her to narrate you her teaching method for her son!Overall, if you took DS or have a strong interest in real\/continental philosophy, take the class and you will not regret it.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Professor Shore struck that rare balance of teaching us and letting us have our own conversation that we all hope and look for during shopping week but resign ourselves to doing without most semesters. She's not a professor who will blindly and indiscriminately give you gold stars and effusive encouragement in either her written or oral comments, but I will (sheepishly and hopefully not too dramatically) say that I have never felt so privileged to have a professor read my written work and give me her feedback. Professor Shore is a rare teacher who actually teaches you how to think in that way that is disappointingly absent at Yale and one that any history student would be lucky to interact with during yale. It sounds idealistic perhaps but taking her seminar was one of the only experiences I have had throughout my institutionalized education where the experience of meeting, of class, wasn't contaminated by an uncomfortably present sense of how school is a game and a system to beat."
