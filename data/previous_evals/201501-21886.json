    "Take it!!",
    "Would recommend to everyone.",
    "Take it if subjects of this nature are intuitive to you or if you have time.",
    "Yeah, take it, and see if you like econ. Really easy class.",
    "This is a very college-lecturey course. It's exactly what you'd expect it to be.",
    "Kind of boring, don't take it unless you're doing Econ.",
    "This is a very basic introductory course. I would suggest not expecting much going into it because you need to learn the basics before you start with the more complicated, more fun aspects of economics. It is just a standard class.",
    "This class helped me realize that I personally don't learn best in a lecture class. The professor and TFs did a good job, but this class just didn't personally work for me.",
    "Terrible course. No knowledge was gained and after a while I stopped showing up to lecture and section because my intellectual curiosity was being violently slaughtered. If you can, avoid it.",
    "Standard micro course, way easier than the seminar \/ the one offered in fall. Goldberg is a solid lecturer - she moves a little slow and things can get boring but that's the fault of the material mainly. Only issue I'd have is that she spends the first 20 minutes or so of each lecture going through what was covered previously - so don't be too worried about showing up on time. Psets and exams were fair and (rather) easy. Not the most interesting of classes, but if you're vaguely interested in econ then give it a shot? You could do worse.",
    "Microeconomics as a whole is a basic rundown of how people and firms behave in order to distribute resources. Talks about Supply and Demand, Marginal Analysis (Benefit vs. Cost), Monopolies\/Oligopolies, Game Theory, Decision-Making over time, etc. Take this from a student who was simply looking for a QR credit, but I found the class to be very boring. On the flipside, there isn't that much work to do (just weekly PSet) and the TA's will likely do some of the problems in section. If you study, midterms and final aren't too bad, but they are graded on a curve, so don't be too far below your classmates. Good if you like Econ, alright if you're just looking for a QR or So credit.",
    "Good class! Great for freshmen and sophomores to take a structured seminar with straightforward expectations.",
    "I recommend the class to anyone who is interested in beginning studies in Economics, as it is typically the first Economics class students at Yale take. I do not recommend the class to people who aren't interested in Economics or who just want a QR\/SO requirement.",
    "Yes! It opened my eyes on the world around me.",
    "It is your basic introductory economics. It is in lecture format and a large number of students take it each year. I would recommend this class to another student. It is well taught, applicable to real life, something everyone should know, and the workload and tests are reasonable.",
    "I think Econ 115 is probably a really good basis for Microeconomics. It can be hard at times to understand the concepts especially if this is your first time taking Economics (like me). Whereas lecture can be a bit boring, section is incredibly useful. In the future, I think smaller Economics classes may be more rewarding.",
    "From what I've heard, ECON 115 with Goldberg is better than any other version of this class. I had heard bad things about ECON 115, but I actually really enjoyed the class because Goldberg was fantastic. She was clear and straightforward and really cared about her students. If you have any flexibility, definitely wait to take the class with her.",
    "Lectures were long and boring, but TA sections were really helpful in terms of clarifying concepts that were vaguely discussed and mentioned in class. PSETs don't take too long, and if you can do them on your own, you are probably well prepared for the exams.",
    "It's a solid intro course that is a prerequisite to many majors. Most likely a must take if you end up taking it.",
    "EH. This is an alright course- a good intro to econ, although a bit slow and boring at times. The problem sets are difficult, but not so bad if you work with others.",
    "Good introductory course in Economics - recommend it to pretty much anyone who wants to get a better understanding about how the economy works; it's also probably just good knowledge to have if you want to be an informed and educated citizen of the world. Goldberg is a solid lecturer; I found her to be good at explaining concepts, and she also seems to really genuinely care about her students. Obviously there's a bit of math involved, but that really shouldn't scare you off unless you literally can't do 9th grade algebra (in which case I don't know how you were planning on fulfilling your QR requirement). Overall, I warmly recommend taking the course with Goldberg.",
    "It's not the most exciting, riveting, ground-breaking, inspiring class, yet I learned a lot about things that are important to the functioning of society. I feel like I have a much better grasp of how markets function and my role in them. It's a class that everyone should take because it gives you a different way of thinking about problems, not just economically based either, and is an important aspect of society that is important to understand (taxes, voting, insurance etc.)",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. It was a solid foundation in microeconomics.",
    "I took this class as an easy addition to my STEM heavy course load and to get a Social credit, but it was so boring that I stopped going to class after the second midterm. I got really bored in every lecture. Half of each lecture covered the material from the last one again, so I would stop paying attention and then still wouldn't be paying attention when the new material started. I should have just gone to class every other day. If you're planning on doing econ, I guess you should take this class. If you're just thinking \"hey econ might be a useful thing to know, and it might be interesting,\" I would watch out. If you're a math, CS, or hard science person, you will be SO bored.",
    "Good class, take it if you're interested in economics.",
    "I would never recommend this class to anyone. If the student is seriously considering economics as a major, I would tell them it's necessary, but that it's the course that made me question whether or not I deserve to be at Yale. Any course that makes one feel that way is a course that should never be recommended.",
    "I would recommend Econ 115 for a fellow student. The course is interesting and provides a good foundation for a microeconomics.",
    "If you've never taken micro and want to check it out, take this class. Don't take it if you're just looking for a QR.",
    "Yes. The math Ian's conceptual concepts aren't very difficult to grasp and it really enhanced my knowledge of markets and I feel like I have a better understanding of the world.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student that wants a basic understanding of economic principles. Make sure to put effort in to the problem sets as they are the main source of practice for the exams.",
    "Take it with Professor Goldberg. She teaches in a clear, easy-to-follow way that does not assume that everyone in the class has experience with either econ or calculus, and the connections that she makes to the real world will shock you with how valuable econ knowledge is. It's a great course, the workload isn't very hard, and it's definitely one of those courses whose knowledge will help you in making good decisions ten years from now and beyond.",
    "I would only recommend Econ 115 if it's a requirement for your major. It's really terrible.",
    "This is an introductory course, so you learn the basics of microeconomics like supply and demand. The workload is not super difficult, there is a problem set every week but they are not very long. There are two midterms and a final.",
    "Econ 115 is a solid course--take if you'd like a course to teach you about the basics of the economy. Professor Goldberg was a clear lecturer and was often rather funny, so I would encourage students to take the class if she's teaching it again.",
    "I found Intro Micro to be an interesting course, which gave a nice introduction to the field of economics. Professor Goldberg did a great job explaining even the difficult concepts, and I liked it when she tied the topics we were learning to real-world applications and to current research. She really made herself available to students, whether they preferred to ask questions in class, in office hours, or by email, and she always maintained a positive and enthusiastic attitude. My TA, Alexandra McKinney, did an amazing job in section summarizing the topics from class and going over difficult ideas. Overall, a great course!",
    "A simple, easy, and often interesting course on the basic concepts of microeconomics. Take this if you have any interest in econ, as the lectures and sections are good, and the psets barely take a couple hours a week.",
    "The reason I chose to take ECON 115 was that it seemed, at least at the time, like a good investment, a class that would teach me some \"practical\" skills that would be of use later. My interest in the class quickly waned when I found the lectures to be exclusively theory and graph-based, with little to no application outside of the example-based problem sets (which, because the lectures were not example-based, were actually quite hard). Thus, I realized a few weeks into the semester that not only was ECON 115 not practical, it was also not a good investment of my time, as I am not someone whose memory easily holds on to abstruse formulae and mathematical concepts unless they are embodied in real-world examples that I can latch on to. If you're thinking about taking Introductory Microeconomics because you think it will be a \"practical\" or \"interesting\" QR, I advise you to talk to people who have taken the class in the past and get their take on it. I, for one, think that taking this class was a huge waste of time and represented a huge opportunity cost for me (hey, I remembered one thing from lectures!) as I will almost certainly never apply anything I learned and found it to be a race to the finish as opposed to an opportunity to relish and enjoy the experience of learning (which is what classes at Yale should be, and often are).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. It gives a basic overview of all the micro essential info. There are things that can actually help the way we think in our everyday life. Although calculus isn't a requirement, it sometimes helps to be familiar with derivatives and integrals (for concepts like marginal cost, marginal utility etc)",
    "I would recommend ECON 115 because it's a great foundational course. There are a lot of interesting concepts that build upon each other, and the professors and TFs are always available if you have any questions. I started off taking ECON 115 because it seemed like something that every student \"should\" take, but I actually did end up learning a lot about how the economy functions and how to apply those ideas to some of my other classes and my daily life.",
    "It really does give you an overall idea of what economics is. Students on the fence about majoring in Econ should really take this course to see if they're interested or not.",
    "\"The technology is not working!\" Otherwise a great course that will give you a comprehensive, insightful account of microeconomics. It's definitely a course that everyone should take during their time at Yale, regardless of what major you areit just gives you relevant info about how the world works.",
    "Good baseline lecture course I recommend everyone take at some point. Imparts the basics of how our societal economic system functions, and is very applicable to thinking about every sector.",
    "Only take this class if you need it for your major.",
    "It is a standard intro microeconomics course. The problem sets are difficult to work through, and group participation in solving the questions is required to get through them. The midterms weren't bad (the first one standard, the second one harder), but the final felt impossible. I would recommend the course if you are planning on going into econ or if it's a prereq to get to another interesting course, but people who take it just for the QR shouldn't take the course.",
    "Yes I would recommend it because it is a good introductory course",
    "Boring, poorly taught class - but touches upon interesting concepts and is a necessary building block for most majors.",
    "Yes; a class that is necessary for life.",
    "Requires a lot of work. Especially weekly psets and assessments.",
    "I was initially hesitant about taking Micro Econ because other reviews were either lacking or lackluster. However, Econ 115 with Professor Goldberg was great. Her lectures were very informative and clearly presented. She provided great review of previous material at the start of each lecture, to solidify concepts before moving on to the new material. She paused and thoroughly answered students' questions\/humbly corrected any minor mistakes pointed out by students. And she was naturally funny at times. The workload included weekly psets (for which you could drop the lowest 2 grades), 2 midterms, and a final.",
    "YES. This is not a wonderful class, but for a moderately difficult and important class that covers the basic, this is a good class",
    "Not too much workload and necessary for anyone interested in understanding economics better.",
    "I would say take it.",
    "I would recommend taking ECON 115 with Prof. Pinelopi Goldberg. Prof. Goldberg was a great teacher and taught the introductory concepts well. Having had no experience with economics prior to taking the course, this course provided me with a solid foundation in econ and also instilled in me a new found interest in econ. I would definitely recommend all Yale students to take this course, not only because it provided me with a strong foundation in econ, but because the concepts learned in this class are so applicable and useful for everyday life.",
    "This is a basic course that covers all you need to know about intro micro. It was well taught, clear and a reasonable work load.it also teaches you a lot about life and has many surprising applications. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to expand their general economics knowledge.",
    "Great introductory course. I would highly recommend it.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who is interested in economics since it gives you an overview. It's a class where you have to teach yourself the material",
    "I would not recommend the course. I thought it was very dry and not interesting at all.",
    "Weekly psets,2 midterms and final, lecture-based and not book based. Very intuitive.",
    "It is pretty straightforward. Go to lecture, read the textbook, do the problem sets, and you'll do just fine.",
    "This is a good and moderately paced course in economics. Some of the concept are easier than others and can be learned from the book while others are better learned in lecture. I would recommend it to ones not exposed to this field of thought.",
    "It is a good course.",
    "Hard but if you have any interest in Econ then good to take to get more of an insight into the field, can change the way you look at the world",
    "Yes but it isn't an easy QR",
    "The description given on the first day of class is actually very accurate. The class will not teach you how to invest or make money. Instead, it teaches you to think about how the world works in a different way. I wouldn't say it's essential for every Yale student, but it's interesting nonetheless. The workload is okay and so are the lectures, so your enjoyment of the class really depends on whether you find the material interesting.",
    "I would recommend it to people who are planing to pursue further study of economics. Otherwise it probably was not one of the most exciting QR credits.",
    "If you take it be prepared to put in a lot of extra work.",
    "Not to be taken for the sole purpose of getting a QR. Would recommend for anyone with even marginal interest in economics, if not then this will be boring.",
    "A very heavily math-focused survey of microeconomics.",
    "Worst decision of my life to take this course. If you get behind you pretty much stay behind - the maths part is very difficult, and I wasn't prepared. If you struggle at all with maths you will pretty much hate this class. I definitely should have taken the Econ lecture especially geared towards ppl who struggle with maths but I was lazy and the class was a Monday 9am. It was a really stupid decision. Take the other class. Even if it's at 9am",
    "Good survey of the economics literature that provides a sound, if mathematically-lacking, background for future study.",
    "Micro was a good introduction to economics. It was basically what anyone would expect: a huge lecture, with a solid professor. The material wasn't too difficult, and no calculus was needed for those of you who haven't taken it. Overall, the course wasn't awesome, nor was it terrible. Don't expect it to light a fire for your love of economics either; that's a little unlikely unless you really get into the material on your own.",
    "Great class. Really enjoyed it. All teaching fellows are great, and exams are fair. Professor Goldberg is very knowledgable and always willing to answer questions. Definitely recommend for a QR.",
    "It's not the most exciting\/interesting class, but it is well-taught and well organized overall.",
    "If you have no desire to be an Econ major, take it credit\/d\/fail and do it in the spring, not the fall.",
    "Important to go to class. Moves fast so try to stay on top of topics",
    "Yes but it is a lot more work than expected.",
    "Econ 115 is an introduction to microeconomics course. It covers a wide array of topics from consumer behavior to monopolies and oligopolies. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about economic thinking. It is a very important background to have, even as someone not interested in pursuing economics. I had never taken a course in the field before, but I found the class really fascinating and I'm glad I took the opportunity to learn the material.",
    "I would recommend this course, definitely. Professor Goldberg is wonderful and the coursework covers concepts which are instrumental in many disciplines. I would advise the fellow student, however, to be careful who they choose as their teaching fellow.",
    "An essential introductory class. Professor Goldberg is a great professor and the content, though difficult at times, requires persistence and effort but it is not too hard.",
    "A good glass you should take, if for nothing more than to have some understanding of economics. It is not terribly exciting, but it is a straight forward, clear-cut class where you know what is expected of you and you know what you will be getting in return.",
    "Interesting class if you can get a good lecturer. Definitely go to section, it'll help clarify a lot.",
    "Material is a little dry- but well taught",
    "Great!",
    "I took this as my QR, not intending to take any other econ classes. I wanted a non-gutty, but not terribly hard QR credit. Basically that's what I got. Some people tell me taking macro is more useful, but I think I understand the world of economics in a slightly more nuanced way now. Micro is pretty intuitive though.",
    "It teaches you a different way of thinking which is necessary for quantitative analysis anywhere. I would recommend it!",
    "Take it, especially if Goldberg is teaching it! It's a great introduction to economics, and you'll really see how economics can apply to your life or other fields. The tests are straightforward, the homework isn't too time consuming and can actually be sort of fun to do. Overall, great class. Highly recommend.",
    "I took this class as a junior and I may not ever take another economics class, but I wanted to get a foundation in business and the economy. I found it to be a valuable exposure to a different way of thinking, and I'm glad I took it. The lectures were not riveting but Goldberg explains the concept pretty well and makes a big effort. Find the right TA, do practice problems, and you will be fine on the exams. If you are looking to get a QR out of the way, this is not the easiest way but it will be more valuable then some gut.",
    "ECON 115 is your basic Intro Micro class. Don't expect anything less than other Yale classes would ask of you. This class will be easy for some, and hard for others, but it's a good class regardless.",
    "Economics 115 was a great course that clearly and effectively introduced students to the world of microeconomics. The lectures were clear and engaging, the PSETs were thoughtful and appropriate, and the exams were challenging but fair. The workload was manageable: weekly Psets (two lowest scores dropped), two midterms, and one final. While the textbook is not necessary, it can be a big help. I suggest reading relevant chapters alongside each lecture. Also, take advantage of TF office hours. They can be super helpful.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who was seeking to have an Intro Micro-Econ course taken. I think that the course does a very good job of covering a lot of material in a very short amount of time. Additionally, I think that the way the sections and PSETS are assigned along with the office hours available each week make this course a very doable one. If you do decided to take this course, know that you will have to work at it despite the 'generous' curve. In economics, its easy to assume that one understands concepts, but that isn't always the case so easily and yet many students fall into that knowledge trap, year after year. You'll be find, just make sure to stay on top of your things! Good luck!",
    "If you have to, do it and make sure to not treat it as a gut.",
    "Econ is fine--just fine. You need it as a requirement for many majors, and it's a good way to get some background on the subject. But beware: you need to put some effort to do well outside of class. Just taking notes isn't going to cut it for finals or midterms; generally, you're going to have to read the textbook, do practice problems, and work hard outside of class to do well in this course.",
    "I would probably recommend this class to someone as a class to take to get a good understanding of microeconomics and as a way to decide whether or not you want to go farther into economics.",
    "ECON 115 is an introduction to microeconomics that covers all relevant topics in the field and leaves its students with a thorough economic and quantitative understanding of the world around them. I would definitely recommend everyone to take it--no matter his or her primary area of study: microeconomics is basic knowledge. The class, however, is not a gut. You have to study and READ THE BOOK if you want to do well. In any case, however, take it.",
    "Eat your vegetables",
    "Having no econ background, I found this course very useful for understanding economic concepts. Essential to having a well rounded education.",
    "I would recommend it only if you think you might want to major in economics. Otherwise, not necessarily needed, but a good class nonetheless.",
    "A necessary pre-requisite for future economics classes but it is NOT an overview of microeconomics and will not leave you with much in terms of a general feel of economics.",
    "I would recommend it if the student is interested in econ or exploring econ, but I might also recommend a seminar instead of the lecture. it was rally big and far too easy not to engage when in class. I might even recommend a seminar to people not interested in econ for the major but just curious on the subject.",
    "It's really not too difficult of a course, but it's easy to fall into the trap of seeing the course as easy, and thus putting less effort into the course (making it sewhat difficult), especially if you really don't have that large of a passion for Econ.",
    "Only take Econ 115 if you are genuinely interested in economics and are willing to put in the time to understand the material.",
    "A basic Micro-Econ class. I would recommend it",
    "Largely lecture driven class, utilize the discussion sections. The textbook reading can also be incredibly helpful in getting to understand the material.",
    "You need to take this course if you want to do anything in economics. But that being said, it is still a good introductory course.",
    "A large lecture-based class with discussion sections. Go to every lecture because looking at the Powerpoint slides alone will not be helpful. Also go to section each week because that is when you will learn how to do the problem sets. A lot of your friends will probably be in this class as well, so I there is a great support system when doing homework and studying for exams. This class is great!"
