    "A practical, communal art-making experience! Its strengths are its focus on fundamentals while still allowing for artistic exploration. It has few weaknesses.It will take your time whether you take it credit d or not, but you won't mind it, because you'll be watching pretty pictures magically appear in the mystical shadows of the darkroom or laughing your face off as you overturn canisters of dangerous chemicals and watch the seconds tick by on one of the backwards clocks. What a world!",
    "yes I would recommend this class. lots of time in the darkroom before crits but a great way to spice up your course schedule",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. You're going to spend a lot of time shooting and in the darkroom, but it is completely worth it. At the end of the semester you will have a body of work you are very proud of, and will be a pro at all things dark room. If you can take the class with Joe Maida DO IT. He is one of the most influential professors I have ever had.",
    "AMAZING and FUNNY",
    "Yes. Take it.",
    "Absolutely. This is the best class. If you have the time to devote to it, it's absolutely worth it and you should take it.",
    "Yes! But only if you're willing to put in the time. I did not shoot nearly enough film for the class, and while I was able to get by, I know my experience would have been so much better if I had put in more hours like Joe was always recommending. This class is so much fun, and really rewarding, but take it ready to work.",
    "Intro to B&W is a time commitment and a monetary investment, but ultimately so much fun. I felt good learning how to make photos (as in, taking pictures and then processing film), and then also felt I learned a lot on the conceptual side of things--what it means to take a good photograph, to develop a good photograph, to make meaningful pictures.",
    "A good class if you are not experienced in photography and want to learn it for any reason other than to become a creative artist. Technically perfect. A little suffocating by the nature of black and white films aggravated by the professor's teaching style. The crit is a little painful because you have to be there for everyone's presentation.",
    "It's a wonderful class - I would recommend it.",
    "Fight to get in and then take it. Joe is awesome and the class will make you see the world differently. But actually. And you'll develop a hilarious rapport with your classmates during your giddy hours in the darkroom.",
    "This is actually one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I learned a lot, and even though the class uses 35 mm black and white film, the knowledge is applicable to digital. So even if you think you're not going to take pictures with film again, this class is still worth it. I would say that the class is a lot of work, just because processing film and making prints is such a time-consuming process. And I think Joe makes you work harder than the other classes, but it's all worth it in the end. I have a much better appreciation for the medium of photography."
