    "If you are reading this, it's because you have to take the class. If you don't have to take the class, leave immediately and punish yourself for even considering it. Rosner is perhaps the worst professor i have ever had. Class is run with no particular structure and is more an hour and a quarter ramble session for Rosner. His technology of choice is the transparency projector with graphs that have data from the 1960's (because the field of chemical engineering has made no advancements in the last 50 years). The problem sets for this class are unlike anything you can possibly imagine. Often, at least an hour is required just to interpret Rosner's cryptic writing and find what he is actually asking and then multiple follow up emails are sent beyond that to get the true way to solve the problem set. The moral of the story is that this class absolutely, positively sucks. If you thought P Chem Lab was bad, you are in for a whole different type of evil...",
    "Absolutely not. I would never recommend this class. Most useless lectures I've ever been to- he throws equations on the board and shows transparencies from 1950. The TA doesn't know the answers to the problem sets (and neither does he for the most part). Grading is cryptic and there is no solution key to compare to. The textbook is not followed at all, and doesn't even have the same notation. This class actually made me want to change majors.",
    "Most likely, you have to take this class. You'll learn some things, though the class will often be frustrating and confusing. I would not recommend this class to someone outside ChemE.",
    "One of the more painful chemical engineering classes you'll have to take. It's even worse than transport. The subject material seems very practical though. You'll dive right into solving problems that haven't been attempted before before getting any introduction to the material though which is destined to make this class unenjoyable.",
    "I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS.",
    "This course explores many chemical engineering applications. This is a much needed course for chemical engineers, and I would hope that students who are outside of chemical engineering take this course. The professor is incredibly smart and provides a lot of in depth knowledge on the material. must take! Really enjoyed it!"
