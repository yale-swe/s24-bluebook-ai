    "This course for me was about making links, about finding highways, crossroads, and even back alleys across a multitude of disciplines. Ideas that would seem otherwise disconnected were bridged with the easiest facility by the course readings and by Henry. A wonderful seminar. Would recommend it to any student with an eye for problem solving and a desire to have his\/her mind opened to a complex and confusing world of thought."

    "Yes! This course was shared by graduate and undergraduate students and there was a great spirit of learning in the classroom. Its a course that will fundamentally challenge the way one engages with political, artistic, and communicative systems around there. There was room for everyones diverse interest and academic specialties to be represented here as well. It wasnt a class for any one major.",
    "It was an honor and a privilege to take Henry Sussman's course."
