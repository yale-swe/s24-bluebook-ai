    "This is a great course. I love the high faculty-to-student ratio and ability to truly discuss papers with professors and other students, not simply to take the prof's viewpoint as in a lecture. The course suffered a bit this semester from the lower-than-usual faculty involvement, but that is unusual."

    "Instructor: Durland Fish \u00a0Dr. Fish did a good job with the course since it seems to have been handed to him totally and unexpectedly. The course did suffer a bit from having the attention of fewer people--we were a speaker short, and two were from Yale, which was a bit disappointing. And there was a little too much vector-borne disease for me. But I realize this was not Dr. Fish's fault and was unusual for him and the course."
