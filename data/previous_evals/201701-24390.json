    "No change, the course is brilliant. Prof. Jenkins forces you to rise to the occasion, his depth is unmatched which means the students have to be prepared. His style shaped my thinking and broadened my perspective to the point where I was personally invested in providing a new perspective that hopefully engaged and stimulated the professor's thinking in the same way he managed to influence mine.",
    "Ambassador Jenkins has a deep understanding of the region's history and politics. The reading list was also very good. The class could perhaps benefit from a bit more structure in the discussion, but it was a great course overall.",
    "The class discussions and Amb. Jenkins' perspective were all really interesting. Some of the readings were a bit dry, though--I might've preferred a few books instead."

    "Yes, Prof. Jenkins is a distinguished expert on the subject, with the academic and royal titles, and real-world, high-level experience to back it up. An unusual combination in academics, he can serve the historical to present-day context on any middle eastern country with perfection and immeasurable depth. I have never encountered a person who can recite as much history and insight without the aid of slides or other \"lecture materials\". Not only an encyclopedia, but expert facilitator who incorporates the lecture with commentary from the students brilliantly.",
    "Yes, this course will cover a region and controversies that aren't commonly discussed in other academic spaces.",
    "Absolutely, if you are interested in the subject matter."
