   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course covered a wide span of material - though sometimes we didn't get as much time as we'd like to cover some of the topics, I thought it was a fantastic and extremely engaging course in exploring all key areas of the Ottoman Empire.",
    "The strengths of this course came from the variety in readings. By having an assortment, even if you found one topic not to be approachable, there were other things you could focus one. I think overall the course could have used more background for some readings (particularly the ones that focused on the changing laws of the empire), but overall the background given was good.",
    "I think the entire course should be like the last 4 weeks and focus more on ordinary people's experiences in the Empire (maybe make there be a prerequisite in Middle Eastern history). The paper proposal was a very good idea and definitely helped me focus on the final paper\/start thinking about it early.",
    "I thought this course gave a very comprehensive summary of Ottoman history. However, the last few weeks of the course (full discussions of readings) were much more engaging than the first two-thirds of the course, where each 2 hour seminar was dedicated entirely to lectures. I think the course could really be improved by interweaving discussion and lecture into every class. I also would have been curious to dive into debates about Ottoman History and orientalism\/ post-colonial studies."

   "comments": [
    "This is a great course if you're interested in knowing more about the Ottoman Empire, which we often have so many misconceptions of.",
    "If one is interested in the Ottoman Empire, this is one of the best classes to take, given the breadth of knowledge covered. Professor Simsek is very much there for you throughout the entire class. He's very open about emails and office hours, so take advantage of those.",
    "This is not one of those history guts where you write a 5 pager and turn in a final. This is where you go to learn real history from a professor who genuinely cares about his students and their development as scholars (and is always willing to meet with you). It might help to have some historical background in the Middle East but this is not absolutely necessary. In the last 4 weeks of the course, where you discuss specific populations within the Ottoman Empire, I learned much more than I have in whole semesters of other classes."
