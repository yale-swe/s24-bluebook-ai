    "Question 1) Though I may not have had the time to do all of the readings during the semester I saved all of them because I am sure I will find them useful in the future. Question 7) The field trips were fantastic! They really solidified what we were learning in class and also made us realize the many factors one has to consider during a harvest. I would try to have another one during the winter if possible.",
    "The most useful parts of this class were the field trips, especially the trip to Spooner Hill and to the clients' properties for the final harvest assignment. I also learned a lot from the Orion exercise, and it was great to speak with the Orion foresters when they visited!",
    "I did not feel adequately prepared for the field trip assignments. I think we could have gotten more out of them if we had a better grasp of what we wanted to create before getting to the field.",
    "Mike brings a great perspective to the school as an alum and working professional. He is sometimes a bit dis-jointed during class, but he is very committed to students and its a very practical class.",

    "The best aspects of this course were the field trips and the guest speakers. The guys from Maine were excellent!! Please bring them back again. It would be great to have 1-2 more speakers as well to hear from them about their work and the challenges they face.",
    "The field trips were by far the most useful part of the course. Mike is excellent at explaining material in the field, and the field trips really helped cement the concepts covered in class.",
    "The field trips are vital to the forestry program, especially the southern trip and operations exposure there. The classroom time was relatively disorganized and not pointed. Material could be gained best by increasing field time and decreasing class time.",
    "As above, the best aspects of the course were the field trips. The lectures were also helpful, especially for learning the names and functions of different harvesting equipment and machinery. It was also helpful to look through examples of harvest plans, which the instructor provided.",
    "Field trips and writing the harvest plan. The group presentation work was also great to get more in depth in an area of our choosing.",
    "Mike Ferrucci's wealth of experience in many regions of the US. Very broad survey of forest operations - extremely useful introduction",
    "The field trips are excellent- particularly the southern trip. Please continue this amazing tradition.",
    "The field trips and harvest planning assignments were extremely useful as was talking to Mike in the field. In addition, the Southern Forestry trip was an essential component."

    "The lectures were informative but a little dry. I liked the number of pictures. More videos would be useful to see how the equipment is used.",
    "Course organization and classes v2 site was somewhat confusing. The workload and number of class-time hours combined seemed high for a 2 credit class",
    "The course focused predominantly on forest operations in the northeast. It would have been useful, for comparison, to learn a bit about forest operations in other parts of the country and the world. I also would have appreciated more information about urban forestry operations. But I understand that time is limited, and that there is only so much that can be covered!",
    "I learned the most on field trips, but if they had been better organized, I think we could have gotten even more out of them.",
    "Course materials were a bit disorganized on the classes server and the structure of the class could be improved. We jumped around a lot and could have had a more logical progression through course material.",
    "Although forestry is a broad subject, final presentations could have been made more relevant to operations."

    "I wanted to take this course in order to better understand the challenges faced by loggers on the ground. As someone who may manage logging contracts in the future, I felt it would be helpful to have a solid grasp of the logistics and complexities of forest operations. I have witnessed forest harvest operations in the field, but this course provided a better framework for understanding the nuances of the process. As someone interested in urban and suburban forest management, this course demonstrated how one might go about writing a harvest plan for a suburban landowner, or even how someone may conceive of developing a harvest plan for a forested park. It was a very important part of my overall program.",
    "Very important to my program because it teaches me how to actually do forestry. A good dose of reality!",
    "I'm a MF who plans on managing forestlands. This was one of the most important courses I took, and ideally the school would have several more like it. Very integral to my interests.",

    "The group work for this course was very productive. It was extremely helpful to be working in a group for the Spooner Hill and for the final harvest plan assignments. My group members were able to see things and develop ideas that I would not have been able to do alone. I think that we all were able to contribute something to each project, which was very satisfying for everyone involved!"

This is a very applied class, which compliments many other FES classes extremely well, and gives you some great experience in the field (especially if you go on the Southern Forestry Field Trip).",

    "Do it! The value of this course is extremely high, especially given that it is not super time consuming. Mike Ferrucci is a great teacher and inspiring person. He's also a fantastic guide on the field trips."
