    "I improved upon many fundamental aspects of singing technique, such as breathing, muscle relaxation, placement, etc.",
    "Placement of sound, resonance, performance, overall appreciation for the style of music, etc.",
    "I learned a good deal about how to learn pieces more efficiently and how to zoom out and care more about the music in terms of phrases rather than individual notes.",
    "It's a great experience to have one-on-one lessons with a professor! They can help you with developing any aspect of your musicianship that you wish to work on.",
    "Learned how to sing better",
    "I studied songs in German, French, and English, and developed both vocal and performance technique.",
    "Improved my singing!",
    "Learned professional level rep, improved musicianship skills, better technique",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of classical singing, particularly breath support and vowel sounds.",
    "A better understanding of classical music, a wide array of vocal warmups, detailed feedback on my singing and suggestions for improvement, experience with singing in different languages, experience memorizing, preparing, and perfecting repertoire.",
    "Practice techniques, musicality, tone, vibrato, how to deal with performance anxiety.",
    "I learned how to sing opera!",
    "This course absolutely changed the way that I sing for the better. My teacher taught me the beginnings of extremely healthy technique.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was great due to its flexible schedule, as well as the very individual nature of having a teacher coaching you alone as compared to other Yale courses where you don't get as much personal feedback. I can't think of any weaknesses of the course. It was great and I highly recommend it.",
    "Strengths: I enjoy the one hour per week schedule. Weaknesses: Honestly, I can not think of any weaknesses this course has.",
    "This course was great because it's tailor-made to each individual student. Sometimes it's easy to check out or fall behind a bit because there's no standardized curriculum.",
    "It's good - experiences will vary by teacher",
    "The lessons did not start for the first few weeks of the semester because teachers were not assigned, that would be the only weakness I experienced. A definite strength of the course is that instructors each only have a few students, so I felt like my development with my teacher was personalized and effective.",
    "I loved having an opportunity to improve my vocal technique.",
    "More flexibility with who to study with would be nice",
    "Generally strong. Good that lessons are flexible time-wise and juries werent too intimidating.",
    "I really enjoyed taking lessons and hearing from my instructor. The one thing I would suggest is more clear communication from the department at the beginning of the course. For a while, I was unsure if I had been accepted into the program or if I should be taking any steps to start learning music, and I wished there was more transparency in the process (for example, when we would hear back, when we would be assigned to a voice teacher, etc.). If there had been clear dates set out or if someone had sent me an email, I would've been far less confused.",
    "This course was amazing. Only thing that I would change would be to start lessons earlier in the semester so that one wouldn't be scrambling to finish while finals are beginning.",
    "It was really hard getting access to my instrument since I did not bring mine with me to school (the drive was way too long). It was super complicated being able to contact anyone with information regarding the lessons I wanted to take and overall access to the instrument. This barrier to smooth communication made the whole experience EXTREMELY frustrating. No one told me anything throughout the whole semester, I had to go track down every single person whenever I needed information about practicing, access to buildings, lessons, etc. However, I really liked my teacher! When we had lessons I felt like I was getting quality instruction and I can already see myself growing in skill.",
    "strengths: one-on-one instruction that is not very common in most other courses weaknesses: there is no real \"homework\" so progress is very slow",
    "Very good!",
    "It's really good! More studio classes where fewer students play each time would be really nice, but I understand that scheduling is difficult",
    "There's really a huge variance among teachers and students, so I feel I can't really comment other than to express gratitude that the opportunity to take for-credit music lessons exists at Yale.",
    "Direct feedback and work with vocal coach; a course very directly tailored to each student"

    "Yes. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their voice, or whichever instrument you play (and get credit for it in the process, and not have to pay for lessons).",
    "I would strongly recommend taking voice lessons; I see myself improving significantly every day with the one-on-one instruction, especially not having done lessons before.",
    "Absolutely! It is a fantastic GPA booster and if you want to enhance your musical talent. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Yes! If you want to continue to study on your primary instrument, the lessons for credit program is a great way to do so.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely! The work of preparing for a jury is super manageable, and it's a lot of fun to work with the music school students.",
