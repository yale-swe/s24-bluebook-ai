    "A course that provides a multitude of snapshots of Mumbai\/Bombay through time and various interesting themes, culminating in 10 page research paper. Very useful course to learn critical writing skills and how to engage with scholarship critically. Workload is manageable and deadlines are flexibile but do not underestimate how much you need to get done. I would definitely recommend this to freshmen interested in the History major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It serves a survey of the history of Mumbai and also engages in many other issues that concern urban areas in general such as class conflict, political tensions, and others. I would encourage anyone interested in history to take this class as it is a strong introduction to the methods of a historian. I would also recommend this to anyone interested in urban studies or in South Asian history.",
    "Go for it! It's a fascinating class."
