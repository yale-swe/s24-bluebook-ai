   "comments": [
    "This course required me to think critically about the material we read and to dive deeper into the theories and concepts we learned about. I learned so much about Japanese culture, but I also learned how to become a better student and a better anthropologist.",
    "I developed more skills and knowledge than in any other classes I have taken at Yale. I gained theoretical knowledge that is very applicable to everyday stuff, which I greatly appreciated. I also learned a great deal of tangible knowledge about Japan through ethnographic works, movies, and documents. They were very on-the-ground knowledge that fit the course structure very well.",
    "This is an excellent class--one of the most useful throughout my Yale career. I learned an incredible about human nature, society, history, sociology, philosophy and psychoanalysis. This is exactly the type of class I was hoping to take at Yale.",
    "From this course, I was able to learn the diversity of Japanese society and how their interaction are shaped by various social factors and perceptions, especially under the influence of the Japanese state. The course offered an understanding of an array of social theories and how they are implemented in analyzing real-life phenomena. The assignments also significantly helped understand Anthropology as a subject.",
    "To question stereotypes and norms taken for granted when analyzing the actions and ideologies of different cultures, peoples.",
    "It was very interesting to see things from an Anthropological perspective. Observing people and making academic framework for a concept like \"shame,\" is quite interesting. I learned a lot about the Japanese culture in general.",
    "This course was great as Professor Klaus presented concepts about Japan that are equally applicable to nations, cultures, and people beyond Japan. The course changed the way I think about groups of people living on the fringe of society, and made me more conscious about making overgeneralizing statements (such as about \"the Japanese,\" \"the terrorist\" etc.). It was a nice mixture of theory, ethnographic texts (focused on social contexts both in and beyond Japan), and current news sources."

   "comments": [
    "I found many of the readings in this course to be challenging, but I wouldn't change anything about the course. I am so glad that I was able to take a class which pushed me to understand the readings that were assigned and to take the concepts from those readings and apply them to the real world.",
    "The strength is that you will gain valuable theoretical skills to analyze the world. The theories we covered were very applicable not just in Japan but all over the world. It was also great that we dealt with on-the-ground material about Japan in depth. The materials we covered were really interesting. Finally, the class discussion was amazing, since everyone had different backgrounds. I admired other students a lot. The only weakness was that we couldn't look at each material for more than a couple weeks at best. Because all of the materials are interesting, I felt like I didn't talk enough about all of them. I don't think it's the professor's or the course's fault; it was just that the materials we looked at were just so deep and complicated. But then, I think it would go way beyond a college seminar if we tried to go more in depth. It was still a bit frustrating that we couldn't talk about each issue until we were satisfied.",
    "I would leave the class structure exactly as is--fascinating and engaging.",
    "The selected reading material were very applicable to any field or issue that we discussed, and although the theories were at times very difficult, Professor Yamamoto made sure to provide sufficient explanation for any questions we may have. The case studies were also fantastic, and the array of material dealt in the course was phenomenal. The assignments were also well-constructed and we received ample guidance to complete the assignments.",
    "Strength: Very engaging setting, lots of interesting reading, great discussion opportunities. Weaknesses: None",
    "The readings were a bit too much at times, especially for those who have no background in the field."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students at Yale. Before taking the course, I was intimidated because I knew very little about Japanese culture. Throughout the course I learned so much about Japan, but I also encountered texts and theories that will stay with me long after this semester. I strongly believe that this course was an excellent balance of engaging discussion and very knowledgeable insight from the instructor.",
    "This course was one of the best courses at Yale. The professor is really helpful and nice, and the materials we covered were really interesting. We also looked at theories and applied the theoretical lens to think about each material, and it was just fascinating to be able to do that. The professor will also help you extensively if you wanted to work on the final paper in depth. I would really recommend this course to other students.",
    "This course is a must-take for anyone interested in philosophical and psychoanalytical theory and it's application on human interactions and society. No other class at Yale broadened my horizon as much as this one.",
    "Take it! I really hope it is offered again, as it has been one of my best courses at Yale. The course offers an understanding of the diversity of Japanese society and how these various people interact under the influence of the Japanese state. The case studies are fantastic and will allow a incisive understanding of society's relation with the state and among its constituent people, not only in Japan but also in other nations. Professor Yamamoto is really approachable and offers great guidance for both the course material and assignments.",
    "Yes. By far the best course I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "Highly recommend!!"
