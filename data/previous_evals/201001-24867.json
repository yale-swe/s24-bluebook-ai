   "comments": [
    "Ling 110 is a solidly taught intro course. Breadth triumphs over depth, but for a linguistics noob it may be a good fit. Not very hard, as well.",
    "If you have no idea what linguistics is (I didn't), take this course! It's a really interested field that will make you think about things you've taken for granted before, and learn a lot about how you think and how language works. Very cool class.",
    "Overview of the various topics of linguistics. I would recommend the class to anyone, especially if you're interested in language and the way it works. It's a fascinating class.",
    "There are a lot of homeworks, but they don't take long. There are also two midterms, but they don't require many hours of preparation. Some areas of linguistics were more interesting than others, but overall I felt I learned some useful things about language.",
    "It's a really great course for anyone who is interested in languages. On top of providing a bunch of very fun tidbits from a variety of languages, it provides an interesting and solid structure for the english language.",
    "This class is a fun class. I came in not knowing anything about linguistics, and now I feel that I have a good understanding of the field. Dasha is a terrific professor!! I loved listening to her lectures -- she always had the best examples. Also, her impersonation of 70s slang was terrific! The homework is not bad, and the only reading is a chapter every few weeks. You get a packet every day that outlines what we are talking about in class, so you don't really have to take notes on paper (but notes SHOULD be taken on that packet, don't just go by what is typed out). The exams are not hard, but not easy; if you study, you'll be fine. I would definitelyrecommend this class to anyone as it is an interesting topic that many people haven't heard of, and the professor is wonderful.",
    "I'd recommend it if you want some cocktail-party knowledge or a general overview of a field. If you're thinking about majoring in the subject, it'll help you realize whether or not you want to get into it, because it is basically one class that consists of consecutive \"tastes\" of the other classes in the major.",
    "This is an extremely fun course. The first couple weeks you get to sit around and learn how to make noises in class. The rest of the material is mostly based on real languages and real analysis that you can do with ease once you have learned to understand your task.",
    "Totally worth it to take this class. Makes the PERFECT Credit\/D\/Fail option! If you're taking for a grade this class literally only takes up 1-2hours a week, including reading. BUT....the course material is very dry. The first third and final couple weeks of the class, you will need to be on speed to not fall asleep. Phonology is ridiculously boring, and the subject of linguistics itself is kind of a joke. Take it for what it is.",
    "Linguistics 110 is NOT a gut class. It's true that the tests and problem sets aren't bad but for them to be doable requires a lot of time and effort if you're not one of the five kids in the class who have a background in linguistics.",
    "Dasha is a good, engaging speaker who is genuinely invested in her students. Learn some random stuff that's cool if you're interested in language like I was (read William Safire's On Language?). Super easy workload, although the kids in the class who've already taken historical linguistics are really annoying.",
    "From the perspective of a non-Linguistics major, this course was fun and interesting. Many times, the subject matter was really engaging; other times it was a little dry. Overall, an enjoyable course.",
    "Linguistics is a basic introduction to everything in linguistics. I thought it was pretty good, some people loved it, and some people hated it.The course was quite easy, but you do have to understand everything for tests and do the weekly problem sets.",
    "Wow, the material covered in this class is really fascinating stuff. We started with phonetics (we talked about things like how [n]is different from [m]is different from [b]), moved our way up to phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics, and did some dabbling in historical linguistics, psycholinguistics, and sociolinguists. Those last three were not covered quite as well as the rest of the course, and I think we could have done without the psycholinguistics (which was covered in two guest lectures by an incredibly dull and incomprehensible Prof. Pinango) and sociolinguistics and spent that extra time on historical linguistics. But the bulk of the course is really fascinating, and although I will probably never take another linguistics course, I can honestly say that I feel like I learned quite a bit about linguistics over the course of the semester. The course is not very difficult at all. Prof. Kavitskaya (Dasha) seemed worried the whole semester that we might not be able to understand the material since there were no sections this year. I don't really see what wasn't to understand. The material was clearly laid out both in lecture and in the textbook, and I'm pretty sure everyone clearly understood the material. Sometimes the lectures did get a little dull, when Dasha belabored an easy concept or spent too much time on some obscure language. The workload for this course is quite light, with a homework every week and two midterms and a final. Perhaps one downfall of this course is that Dasha is a little too memorization-happy. On the final, for example, she asked us to classify various languages. So sometimes you have to memorized various trivia, such as Lithuanian being a member of the Baltic family. But this is a small complaint for a fascinating, stress-free course.",
    "Good class from a very kind professor.",
    "Good class to raise your grade. That being said, the material can be boring if you're not into this type of stuff.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's not too much work and I enjoyed taking the class. Dasha is awesome.",
    "Yes. Take it. Expands your understanding of language and raises your GPA!",
    "If you have the slightest interest in linguistics, this course is a fabulous way to test the water. It's not a gigantic time commitment, and it covers a really broad range of subjects--so you'rebound to discover a field that you like. For me, the course helped me to discover where my interests lie and gave me some direction for future linguistics studies. Also, if you get the chance to take this course with Darya Kavitskaya, I can almost promise you that it'll be an incredible experience.",
    "Interesting course, covers a lot of material but done in a way that is efficient and not intimidating.",
    "Linguistics 101 is a course that provides basic information about different fields of linguistics. It covers a lot of material but doesn't go into depth with any of it really. It provides a basis for more specific courses. The course is great if you know little about linguistics and anyone who has the spare time should definitely take this course.",
    "I definitely recommend taking Linguistics 110 if you are at all interested in linguistics, or languages in general and want to explore the field and figure out what is it all about.",
    "I would recommend it. It requires studying (you need to go to lectures and try to understand and do the homework sets yourself), but the assignments don't take too much time and the exams are easy.",
    "Linguistics 110 covers a wide variety of topics in linguistics, mainly phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. A weekly homework set of problems is assigned. Both homework and exams were quite reasonable. Prof. Kavitskaya lectured well and always prepared helpful handouts for the lecture.",
    "I highly recommend this class. I am not going to major in Linguistics, and took the class basically \"for fun\" - and I enjoyed every lecture! There problem sets are manageable and very helpful, and I ended up learning a lot about things that actually seem relevant - I've been amazed how many times this semester I've thought \"oh, we talked about this in Linguistics!\" Professor Kavitskaya is wonderful as well.",
    "I would recommend it. The workload isn't immense, usually one small problem set per week, and the exams are definitely doable if you keep up. It's a survey course, so don't expect very much depth in the discussion, but it's definitely worthwhile.",
    "The class provides a superficial introduction to the main areas of linguistics. Because it covers so many topics, it jumps around a lot.",
    "Yes. Very interesting, and I learned a ton about something with which I was entirely unfamiliar.",
    "This is a fun, easy course. Professor Kavitskaya's lectures were interesting and organized, and pretty much all the information you need to know is in the lecture handouts. Problem sets were extremely short, and there were enough opportunities for extra credit that if a student wanted to do well, he or she easily could.",
    "Its a good intro course, but if you're going to take more linguistics classes - it seems like its not necessary",
    "A good overview of the various fields in linguistics. It will be boring unless you already have some interest in the subject. Tests are easy and homework even more so.",
    "This is a fun introduction to the field of linguistics. It's a general overview of the topic, covering everything from phonology (sounds) to phonetics (how sounds are put together) to morphology (word formation) to syntax (sentence formation\/grammar) to semantics (sentences meaning). Atthe end you also get to cover some fun bonus topics like historical and sociolinguistics. In general lectures are fun to go to and the work load is not heavy by any means. There are quick weekly problem sets, two midterms and a final. If you're interested in learning about linquistics, this is a good introduction. However, if you've had any experience with the field before this course will be far too basic for you.",
    "Introduction to Linguistics is a very, very basic course in some major areas in linguistics. When I took it, the course was one third phonology and morphology, one third syntax and semantics, and one third assorted topics in the rest (historical, socio and psycholinguistics). It's a fun class, but don't expect anything super demanding orcomplex. I took it because I wanted to fill some gaps in my basic technical knowledge, but it would be good as a low-key fifth class or an interesting introduction to language if you haven't really thought or read about its mechanics.",
    "This class gives you a taste of all of the major areas in linguistics: phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, neurolinguistics and sociolinguistics. As the professor acknowledges at the beginning of the course, there isn't time to go into each of these areas in depth, but if you are looking for a broad introduction to linguistics, I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is vaguely interested in the subject of linguistics, since it gives a good introduction to future linguistics classes you might be interested in as well as teaching you many things about languages you might not have know.",
    "I learned a lot in this class, and the workload is definitely manageable. If you're not genuinely interested in linguistics, however, I could see it getting boring. Keep in mind that it is an intro class, so if you want to learn any one area of linguistics in depth you should probably skip it and go straight into phonology or semantics or whatever. Weekly homework was 40%, two midterms 15% each, and the final was 30%. I think most people got pretty good grades.",
    "I would not recommend this class because it was pretty boring and unless you are planning on pursuing linguistics, it is not information that you learn that will ever be useful again. It is however relatively easy.",
    "This is an easy course. I spent very little time on the problem sets, and little time studying for the exams. The professor was very good. The course covers a lot of topics, and some things are more interesting than others. Still, a good course overall.",
    "Good introductory survey of the various aspects of linguistics. Might not be in-depth enough for someone really interested in the subject matter, but still intriguing overall.",
    "I'll be honest, I never went to the class. But the material on the problem sets was often interesting, and the midterms and final were very easy. I hear from my friends that Prof. Kavitskaya was a great lecturer for those who attended.Not bad for getting a pesky So credit out of the way. Less of a pain than Intro Psych or Econ, that's for sure!",
    "Linguistics 110 is a broad survey course of Linguistics. As such, it doesn't get much in depth in any one area, which started getting a bit frustrating over the course of the semester. I'm not sure that I would recommend it, and if you have already taken a course in linguistics, most definitely do not take it.",
    "It may be better to take a more advanced and specific ling course than this one to get a sense of the field.",
    "If you want a good overview of different areas in linguistics, take this course and take it with Professor Kavitskaya. I shopped the same course last year and the material was definitely not as interesting.",
    "Although Linguistics 110, as an introductory class, does not delve incredibly deeply into the various branches of linguistics, it is a great overview of linguistics and a very interesting course.",
    "it's a good introduction to every area of linguistics. however, for those looking for a bit more than just basics shouldn't take this course. the homework is enjoyable and not very difficult.",
    "I would recommend it, not too difficult, interesting."
