   "comments": [
    "favorite course. and hardest course this term. harder than orgo.",
    "Excellent class. All professors are great. If you know you're only taking one semester of biochemistry, take this course.",
    "Covers the basic concepts of biochemistry - it's a must take for any pre-med student. I would recommend this course if you're interested in the chemical mechanisms behind key biological concepts such as enzymes and respiration or if you are premed.",
    "I'd obviously only take it if you have to, but it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. Definitely easier than organic chemistry, you just have to work on memorizing everything about a week before the exams.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I am pre-med so I had to take a biochem, but this class is a little more straightforward than orgo, and actually kind of interesting because of the biological applications.",
    "Take it if you need it. It is fun to synthesize the info the past few years but it is a lot of work.",
    "This is a great class. I definitely recommend it for bio or chem majors or anyone else with a bio\/chem background.",
    "I liked biochem. Ornston's lectures were fun, as was Ornston himself. It is not a trivial workload, however. Do not neglect studying until the night before a test, because Ornston's tests in particular cover every last detail of every slide he showed us.",
    "I would say it provides a solid foundation in biochemistry, and it is not as painful as other science classes like organic chemistry. This is where all the orgo starts to pay off! I would recommend it, the material is interesting, and the lecturers especially Ornston are great.",
    "Obviously, only for bio majors and pre-meds. Take the MB&B instead...this course goes severely downhill the second half of the semester.",
    "Intro to Biochemistry. Exactly what you think it's going to be except that the lectures are better than you'd expect (I know it's early and 3x a week, but seriously GO TO LECTURE) and the tests for the second half are actually just straight memorization. I'd definitely take it over the MB&B version, especially now that I'm totally down with Biochem instead of only halfway.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. You learn a lot and it's a good lecture. The professors were great.",
    "MCDB300 doesn't go into as much depth as its MB&B counterpart, and while I've heard people who didn't like MCDB biochem, the professors are pretty good and they're more than willing to answer students' questions if anything should arise. Prof. Ornston doesn't teach from the book- all the material is on his lectures, which is sometimes frustrating if you'd like to find more detail about a subject but don't have a specific source to reference.",
    "A great class with good, interesting professors. This really made orgo just a bit more useful. It wasn't hard. Just pathways to memorize. Study early and you'll be fine.",
    "best mcdb class i have taken. all 3 professors are wonderful and extremely approachable. and you really don't even need to buy the textbook.",
    "Good class for MCDB majors... I would also recommend the class for those science-interested students looking for a brief intro to biochem, but not necessarily the intensive coursework of the MB&B Biochem.",
    "This is a memorization course. It won't kick into high gear until Ornston's lectures. Make sure you go to each one and study the lectures after. If you do not, you will be confused. You really can not read the book for his part because you will end up learning unnecessary info. It's not a terrible course, you just have to be (or act like) a premed.",
    "YES. Great class. Who knew biochem would be fun and interesting?!",
    "The material isn't awesome, exciting, or different from the the material from previous classes. The last half of the class involved route memorization and the first half involved repeat of material learned previously in cell bio and intro bio courses. I memorized the amino acids and then memorized and forgot the steps in the calvin cycle and krebs cycle. Other than that, I learned very little from this class overall. TAs are very unhelpful but the professors are very clear lecturers and the powerpoint slides are great. The textbook was mostly irrelevant (especially for the second half of the course). Overall, this class was better than the average bio course but not too interesting and I wouldn't have taken it if it wasn't a requirement for the major.",
    "MCDB Biochemistry is well taught, and is a good review of organic chemistry and biology that will be helpful on the mcats. There was quite a bit of detail, so tests required a lot of time to prepare for. Overall, a good class if you are ok with applied organic chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student; I think it presents a clearer and more cell-bio-y look at biochem, which helped me because I don't think I could've done all that regulation stuff in MB&B biochem. The profs are pretty good, their tests are all fair, and Ornston especially is great, such a kind man.",
    "Yes, but with one caveat - be prepared for a LOT of memorization (which will seem useless at times).",
    "I took it to complete the MCDB requirement. Didn't have the opportunity to compare this to the MB&B counterpart but found this course to be manageable.",
    "The class is definitely heavy on memorization - be prepared to spend the second half of the semester memorizing cycles. If you don't need this course for your major, don't take it.",
    "great class. keep up with class lectures and readings. seek help from TAs in explaining topics that are unclear in timely fashion.",
    "Pretty solid bio lecture. All three lecturers were good, although some personal opinions may vary. Not too much work (although, again, it depends. It's a lot, though not entirely, memorization. Know how you do with this sort of material).Regarding the choice between this and the other biochem: as I understand it, this course has more of an emphasis on memorization, the other one deals with more cause\/effect type questions). I took this one because I had a conflict with during the other time slot. I ended up enjoying this class (though I can't say it was my favorite either).",
    "This is a really great course. It's not overwhelming as long as you keep up with the material. All the professors are great lectures and are all very friendly and helpful. The exams come from the lectures so make sure you understand and memorize what is presented in class.",
    "Tests were way challenging, dont miss a class or youll be way behind",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to motor through biochemistry. The beginning of the class was definitely much better than the end, which involvedmuch more straight memorization.",
    "MCDB 300 is the kind of class that you probably only take if you are pre-med or if it is for your major. It is actually enjoyable, and the exams are doable if you put the work into it. The key is to stay on top of the material and not to wait until the exam to study since there is a lot of material. Ornston and Breaker are great lecturers and Engelman gets the job done.",
    "Overall, MCDB 300 is a pretty good intro biochem course. It forces you to memorize and know basic structures such as amino acids and DNA, knowledge which has come in handy in many of my other biology courses. I would recommend it to students looking for a comprehensive and light intro to biochem."
