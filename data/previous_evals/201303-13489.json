    "Pretty good writing credit. Good readings. Interesting.",
    "I definitely recommend the class if you're into nonfiction writing - just don't take it with Professor McCabe.",
    "Take ENGL 120 with McCabe if you want to improve your non-fiction story telling, because it's a serious class with a lot of writing. You should spend around 6-8 hrs a week doing the readings and writing your essay. Try to get in a section that does 5 essays instead of 6--5 essays seems to be a fair pace for the class.It's hard to get a A on essays, so don't take this class unless you can deal with Bs or if you don't want to work very hard. Your pieces will be held to a very high standard.Also, the readings in McCabe's section are fun and informative.It's definitely a great class, sometimes stressful, but rewarding and not too crazy for a writing credit.",
    "This course is challenging, but can be a highly enjoyable creative release of you are willing to put in the roght mindset and amount of work. I would recommend.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It not only gives you tools that are useful in the sphere of nonfiction writing, but also refines the way in which you look at writing as a craft and helps you think in what I think is a more clear way. The knowledge that I gained about how to connect to a reader and deliver succinct takeaways is invaluable.",
    "Yes, I would. Everyone should know how to tell stories. The essays are not that long, and you are taught how to form a piece in a short word limit.",
    "You should take this course, but keep in mind that it might be challenging. You should also prepare your paper topics in advance. You get two weeks per paper, but you would benefit greatly by having an idea for your paper ahead of those two weeks."
