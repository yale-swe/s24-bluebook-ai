   "comments": [
    "Very tough but easily my favorite course. You will laugh a lot and make good friends. The teachers are very good and very on top of it. Highly recommended.",
    "A lot of daily work, but rewarding! You have to stay organized.",
    "Extremely difficult, but very fulfilling--the professors are passionate and very capable. Just be ready to devote 3-4 hours per night on this subject if you want to do well.",
    "Take the course! It's a lot of work, but never will you otherwise have the chance to be taught Japanese in such a structured way by such an outstanding faculty. The class meets daily, but because of this, you will grow close friendships with those in your class.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "This class requires a lot of work outside of class for homework and study but that is to be expected for a language course. The language is very difficult in itself so likely requires more time than some of the other language courses available. The course moves along very quickly which makes it difficult to keep on top of the workload all the time but the amount that you learn during one semester is very rewarding. The teachers are all very engaging, funny, and knowledgeable about how to present the subject. I would recommend the course if you are truly interested in learning the language.",
    "Very hard to be genuinely new to the language. It felt like a huge percent of the rest of the class had taken Japanese before or at least had experience with an Asian language. I felt like I was struggling from behind for the whole semester. Unless you REALLY want to put the time in it takes to master each element as you learn it (that's hours a night), I would advise taking a new L1 language."
