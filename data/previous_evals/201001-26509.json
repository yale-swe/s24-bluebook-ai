    "Take this course for an easy (but not too easy) science credit that is more rewarding than a gut-- I actually enjoyed class time!",
    "I thoughtthis course was incredible. For the first go-around, it did have some flaws (like sitting in lecture style setting for seminar is a bit constraining compared to round-table type seminars). I think these will be fixed in the second time through though. It was a wonderful opportunity to explore issues of scientific interest in an accessible way that related the scientific concepts to real-world issues\/applications. As the class was mixed in experience level, Professor Lee serves as great facilitator of dialogue, stepping in to briefly explain things when necessary. The course helps you with your scientific analysis, public speaking, and writing skills. You are assigned to lead two class sessions, which forces one to really understand the material assigned for the week. Those sessions are up to the students to select which enables you to pick a particular area of study you find most interesting and can be applied to the final project. Also, you have a writing assignment due each class (twice a week) which is not bad. Each writing response is critiqued in a way that is constructive, as I (not a science major), learned a great deal about how to critique scientific journal articles--an experience I never had anticipated.",
    "This class is the absolute worst part of yale's ludicrous science requirement. I came out of this class with less respect for the natural sciences than I had when I went in, which is the opposite of what is supposed to happen. Don't take it! Also, the reading responses were utterly stupid.",
    "I would recommend this class to students with limited college science background and with an interest in the basics of many different fields. Also, if you're into discussing the science behind climate change, you will find this very interesting. However, you have to be comfortable with daily assignments and with presenting a powerpoint in front of the class. There are also no problems sets or tests.",
    "Science of Water is extremely accessible to non-science majors. The class covers topics in astronomy, geology, biology, climate science, and a slew of other areas. Because all but the first couple of lectures are student lead, the quality of class is going to depend heavily on who's in it.If you need to fulfill a science credit, don't like math, and would rather do presentations and papers over tests, this class is for you. Professor Lee is super cool.",
    "No. Rather boring, actually more work than you would suspect, and harsh grading.",
    "A pretty easy science credit with some very cool information and readings. short, journal quality readings. pretty general overview without a lot of specifics."
