   "comments": [
    "this course introduced me to many native american artists and scholars whose names and work i would not have encountered otherwise, as well as a critical overview of anthropology in the US. i learned a lot about how different periods of native\/US history, and law, affect us today. basically every week\/reading was new knowledge and insights.",
    "So many, wow. Knowledge of contemporary issues in Indian Country at a deep level. Skills in close reading and discussion leading. Insights were numerous.",
    "I learned a base knowledge of anthropological history and was able to build analytical, verbal, and writing skills in the context of Native American issues.",
    "I learned how to further critique and analyze an aspect of being american that I had little interaction with. The class, the professor, and the people in it helped me to be able to articulate myself on this subject which I am very passionate about. I learned how to sympathize and feel empathy towards native peoples in a way that I was previously unable to do in such depth.",
    "I learned so much about anthropology's history and about all sorts of issues relevant to Natives peoples in the US today.",
    "Great survey course and seminar in contemporary Native American with the appropriate amount of history for context. Focuses on stereotypes, anthropology's relationship with Native peoples, the Native American Graves and Repatriation Act, blood quantum, gaming, law, and Native education each week highlighting a different Indigenous group or regional area provides a vocabulary and basic context to understand modern Native issues. Close reading skills are developed through short analysis of Native art (ie poetry, music, visual art, etc.). Many short assignments allow for Prof. Fayard to help with the development of writing skills, especially for younger students.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of anthropology and how white people used to romanticize \"ancient\" cultures. Although anthropology was horrible, today it is evolving into a respectable discipline that even Native people are using to educate and empower themselves. I learned of the reason why some people claim to be Cherokee and the complications that arise from that including colonial measures of blood quantum and \"New Age\" appropriative groups. I also learned of the issues and benefits behind casinos and how the Seminole people used them to become an economic power. We also talked about Native education and discussed the No Child Left Behind act and how it changed Native schooling. Despite this, we looked at a charter school's success in teaching Native values and skills in a somewhat urban setting.",
    "This course was a survey of problems facing native american communities in the United States today! It presented issues from problem quantum to tribal casinos and the discussions were really AMAZING!",
    "This course encouraged me to confront complexity in a reflexive way. The lectures, readings, and discussions were stimulating beyond the sphere of CNNA, and what I applied insights and theory from this course in other aspects of my coursework this semester. I saw a Native woman, a doctor of philosophy, sit at the head of a classroom at Yale and show me that it was possible to achieve success as an educator and as a researcher, all while supporting the growth of college students. The course format ensured that all students had an opportunity to contribute to each discussion, which led to richer dialogue and respectful debate. I'm immensely grateful for having had the opportunity to take this course."

   "comments": [
    "this was a very strong course. it would have been helpful to have a sense from the start of how much of the class time the presentations should have taken up, but basically that was fine, too.",
    "Everyone was engaged in the course, it seemed. The readings were very manageable, I only wish that we had time enough to cover many more areas of interest. Every week I looked forward to reading and discussion, and I framed my life outside of the class with the theory that we had read. It was always on my mind.",
    "I loved the course. Don't change it.",
    "The strength of this class was that there is no other class like it offered by Yale, and that is truly special. The class is taught by a knowledgeable Native American, half the class is Native American, and the subjects are Native American. This class was made to Indigenize Yale's curriculum and just by its presence accomplishes that goal. The experience of taking it with so many articulate Native Americans is like no other experience I have had in my undergraduate career. The weakness, if there is to be one was there was sometimes a lot to unpack from the large readings assigned that we couldn't get to in discussion. Some topics that deserved more extrapolation had to be swept under the rug. I would've like to discuss these topics more, and I feel like my peers feel the same, but we were not able to.",
    "No other professor at Yale does or is qualified to teach about contemporary Native issues. This class does the absolute best that it can to make up for the lack of Native studies professors at Yale, but it is clear that students want more Native studies material. Assignments are reasonable and interesting.",
    "I loved the way discussion was almost entirely facilitated by the students who signed up to lead it that week. Many of the earlier readings were online or in a pdf on canvas.",
    "The course had really fantastic discussions and each week students led discussions based not he readings. The course had a lot of small assignments, but overall they were pretty interesting as well",
    "This course was a fantastic overview of a broad field. Given that it was trying to familiarize students with many issues facing contemporary Native American communities, it was done excellently. The only way it could be improved was if there was more classes (or perhaps an entire department) to flesh out each subject more in depth."

   "comments": [
    "would recommend! this was a great class in its own right, but it's also pretty unique among other yale courses offered",
    "Absolutely! I think it was an incredible and comprehensive study of contemporary native american issues that continue to happen today and so it is very relevant and makes for interesting discussions.",
    "YES. Dean Fayard is a pure soul, and she knows so much about anthropology and contemporary indigenous issues. I hope this class is offered again so that others can take it.",
    "Every Yale student should take this course. You learn about topics that otherwise get ignored in most college curriculums. An entire history of American is often forgotten. This course teaches about Native American history and contemporary issues that are so important for students to know about.",
    "Yes, I believe any anthropology major or US History major should be made to take this class, or a class like it. It is important to have a longitudinal gaze on the culture and history of Native America, from 1492 to the spring semester of 2017. It is important to see that these people exist and the problems they face in the modern era.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! Definitely take it!",
    "Everyone should take this course! As a survey course it provides a vocabulary to talk about Native issues and just enough history to understand modern issues and events in historical context. Focuses on stereotypes, anthropology's relationship with Native peoples, the Native American Graves and Repatriation Act, blood quantum, gaming, law, and Native education each week highlighting a different Indigenous group or regional area. Close reading skills are developed through short analysis of Native art (ie poetry, music, visual art, etc.). Many short assignments allow for Prof. Fayard to help with the development of writing skills, especially for younger students. Would recommend to anyone looking for an introduction to Native studies and a manageable workload with helpful feedback on writing.",
    "This course is amazing because it takes you on a tour of a variety of Native American issues in today's society. You will learn about blood quantum and why you never ask a Native \"How much are you?\" It's a good course to compliment Ned Blackhawk's \"Intro to American Indian History.\"",
    "TAKE IT! For sure.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The course syllabus provides both the depth of theory and a range of contemporary texts from which to conduct a survey of Contemporary Native North America. The content is broad, however the students have an option to focus on one or two particular issues of interest in their research papers or in their current events presentations. We learned from the disciplines of anthropology and from the methods of ethnography as well as from indigenous scholars from the sciences and the humanities.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, if offered again. Dean Fayard is amazing and so knowledgable. This course as a course on contemporary Native American communities is really directly relevant to issues today."
