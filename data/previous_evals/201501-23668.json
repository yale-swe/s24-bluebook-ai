    "Instructor: Nicholas Aaron Hodges \u00a0Really not a reflection on the teaching fellows, but since they were the ones grading the policy memos: it would have been really helpful to get examples of what a great policy memo is. Instead, we got feedback on our own after the fact, when it was too late. There was clearly something that you were hoping to see in these memos, both in terms of style\/organization and content, and the instructions\/writing tips\/grading key were NOT helpful at all. In general, making sure that students know what is expected of them is a good thing. Seeing what others have done right is not going to stifle our creativity, but it will allow us to understand what it is that you actually want. It's the end of the semester and I am still not sure.",
    "Instructor: Nicholas Aaron Hodges \u00a0All was great- the final review was very helpful. (I never attended TF sessions because they were all during my classes-- unfortunate). For grading the policy memo's I wish there was more substantive comments and less grammar, etc.",
    "Instructor: Nicholas Aaron Hodges \u00a0Accessible, timely. Provided thoughtful critiques of the policy memos.",
    "Instructor: Nicholas Aaron Hodges \u00a0Nick was very accessible via email and did a fantastic job of explaining the material. Although he was only present at a few of the discussion sections, the ones he led were very well organized and I felt I got a lot out of them. Z was also very accessible via email. Z seemed to have the primary responsibility of leading the discussion sections, and for the most part did well in leading them. I do think there is room for him to improve with his style and pace. He would often rush through the material without really explaining anything. He also cancelled several discussion sections.",
    "Instructor: Nicholas Aaron Hodges \u00a0I really appreciated Nick's responsiveness and willingness to provide extensive feedback on the policy memo's. Both he and Z also did a great job leading the discussion sections I attended.",
    "Instructor: Nicholas Aaron Hodges \u00a0One of the best editors I've ever encountered - harsh but really valuable feedback.",

Perhaps through his tone or approach, he could be more welcoming and conversational. This might make others more receptive to engaging him in questions\/conversation about the material.",
    "Instructor: Nicholas Aaron Hodges \u00a0He was great, but the feedback I got on my memo's was not as helpful.",
    "Instructor: Nicholas Aaron Hodges \u00a0Z was very accessible and helpful during office hours and during sections (and outside via email as well). He does come off as a bit intimidating and intense, but he is very helpful.",

    "Dan is a fantastic speaker. Stories are great to put things in context, but sometimes that gets in the way of the content. I thought we could have spent more time on technical\/aspects of the law.",
    "Esty's perspective is very valuable and will be missed. I felt that he focused more on providing his perspective rather than hard facts at times.",
    "Esty is a very polished lecturer. We had a lot of material to cover but I feel like that was handled well and I learned a lot.",
    "This course was very valuable for my education at Yale since I would like to be involved in policy. I have learned a tremendous amount of information.",
    "Prof. Esty has an academic acumen unrivaled in his field by anyone else at the School of Forestry. He is a compelling speaker and his willingness to share his own experience was one of the better qualities of the lectures. However, Prof. Esty was always quick to leave class immediately once his lectures concluded. I think that if there were a door closer to the podium, he would have used that instead of having to walked through the auditorium to the back exit. I understand that he is very busy, but he was pretty much locked down once class ended unless you headed him by standing directly in his path.",
    "12: I really appreciated how Dan took the time in the middle of the semester to collect suggestions and feedback on the course, and addressed most of them.",
    "It's fairly obvious that Esty put little or no effort into this course. His outlines for this year were the same as previous years and the fact that he spent 95% of the time talking about the people he knows and the experiences he had in office rather than teaching the law was further proof.",
    "Professor Esty and classes of this type in general are much better with a smaller class. If nothing else, a better large lecture room would have really improved the experience.",
    "Excellent class- professor was organized and very engaging.",
    "I felt that is class not very valuable at all. The reading was too much and cumbersome and did not teach you what you needed to know for lecture (except maybe the last 10 rushed minutes of class) lecture was a little policy mostly anecdotal and reflection of estys career. The material, at least for an environmental student should be a brief overview clarification of the policy but then the bull should be how to we think about and use envirknemtantl law as a tool for the improvements we want to accomplish. The reading should be digestible background and class should allow us to think about and get to real solutions or courses of action for progress. Ok you did stuff in the 90s for the epa but how can we learn from those lessons and be effective policy maker lobbyists in the future. This required more work in the part of the instructor, TAs and students."

    "Gives a comprehensive overview of environmental law system in the US. Helpful and essential for anyone interested in the environment.",

    "Breadth and depth of law that it covers. Policy memos were helpful.",
    "For students who do not have a background in law this course was very effective in introducing students to the most significant U.S. environmental laws and policies and the evolution of environmental policy over the last 60 years.",
    "Broad overview of environmental law and policy. Interesting stories from Prof. Esty.",
    "The policy memos - having these as an assignment helped clarify my learning on a number of laws and issues.",
    "Great overview of environmental law - was really helpful to have this framework for other classes, and to help orient issues of environmental policy.",
    "The policy memos were indeed challenging but were very important for learning how to apply the law and to think critically about how it can be improved.",
    "Esty's lectures are engaging and very well-articulated. Really worth paying attention to and taking good notes on. His actual experience in the field is an immense resource.",
    "Great that lectures supplemented the readings, but I resorted to reading case briefs after about 5 weeks because I could not keep up with the amount of material that I was required to be familiar with. The practice mid-term was a great supplement. Please continue to offer this.",
    "I liked Professor Esty's very good experiences and stories of his practice of environmental law and policy.",
    "It was great to learn about the foundations of environmental law in the US (which affected many other countries), and also to hear Dan's experiences and opinions on why the current system is facing problems, what potential solutions are there, and what lessons we should learn as future leaders in the field.",
    "The readings.",
    "Very interesting material which Professor Esty knows a lot about.",

   "comments": [
    "It was a large class. This made it hard to foster real discussion. Dan did do his best, but there was a small group of students who did the vast majority of contributing.",
    "This class has too much assigned readings. Having a more focused selection of reading material would be more helpful for students to allocate time and actually remember something from the readings.",
    "I think we should spend more time on domestic issues, and delve further into the CWA, CAA, CERCLA etc, rather than spend time on global governance\/trade etc. Most students were taking that class to get exposure to US environmental law, and most will work in the US. There are several classes dedicated to global governance\/diplomacy etc. at FES that people can take if interested in these topics. There are no other environmental law classes. Trying to fit everything in one semester makes the scope of the class too wide. We cover everything, and nothing in depth. It's a little frustrating. In addition, it would be helpful to provide the students with samples of the main regulatory instruments for federal regulation - For instance, it would be great to get a glance at what a listing decision looks like under the ESA, or see what a NPDES permit is in practice. Further, writing policy memos on topics that we have not yet covered in class seems like a futile exercise. You end up putting a lot of time into researching topics, in addition to the readings, which are already quite long, and you write something subpar because a) you have no concrete experience so have to make things up as you go and cannot possibly be expected to have something meaningful to contribute to the debate after a couple days of research, and b) you have no concrete direction for writing the policy memos (see my comment on policy memo above). Let people delve into a topic they are interested in, and make the policy memo a semester long endeavor, with Nick and Zee available to review drafts during the writing process. This would be a much better learning experience. Lastly, please please please migrate class readings and documents to classesV2!! Nothing more frustrating than wasting time downloading documents one by one when you could download the materials for the entire semester in one click on classesV2. If that is not possible for some weird administrative reason, then please take a minute to put the documents in Yale Box, or some other sharing network. People are busy and technology should not get in the way. (I thought that was actually one of the main tenets of Dan's time at DEEP!)",
    "Final exam too comprehensive to not have a set exam outline to study. To simply to know everything is completely unreasonable.",
    "Visuals during lecture.",
    "For FES students not having any other foundations of law class, it would be helpful to have a structured lesson or two and an assignment (to cement skills) on understanding how to search for federal statutes, regulations, and court cases and how to search the Federal Register. As environmental law evolves during our careers, we should know how to perform basic legal searches rather than relying on media to track developments in the field.",
    "A final paper or series of short answers would have been a better exercise than the final exam. The exam led to too much cramming and not enough focused, thoughtful analysis.",
    "A bit more clarity around the expectations for the class (especially the policy memos) would have been helpful, especially in a class that draws from so many different schools. For instance, knowing we'd be competing in the same distribution as the law students might have been helpful to know much earlier, so people could be strategic about how they invested their resources across their class schedules.",
    "I don't like the way the assignments were structured. Having just two memos due before the final exam which is a huge chunk of the grade is not as helpful as other methods I believe. I understand that this is the way that most law classes are structured, but perhaps there can be a longer paper that touches on some overall important aspects of environmental law would be more helpful.",
    "As much as I appreciated Dan's lecturing style (very impressive), I felt too many times that I spent the whole lecture writing down everything and not processing or thinking about the topics as much. It would be quite helpful if outlines of the lectures could be uploaded in advance so students can focus less on writing things down and more on thinking about the issues and engaging in discussion.",
    "Esty forgetting he needs to teach law, not his rolodex.",
    "The room and size. Perhaps required 1 hour small group discussion sections would help with this?",
    "The policy memos could use a bit more instruction.",
    "It is utterly absurd that Forestry students are graded on the same curve as Law students. It would be just as easy to have separate curves for Law and non-Law students, with grades given out in equal proportions. Law students have extensive advantages over those who have not taken law classes before. One rumor is that the course is graded on a single curve because the professor does not think grades of Forestry students matter as much to them. Different students are in different circumstances, and this should not be his decision to make. Some employers do care about grades, nearly all scholarships take grades into consideration, and grades are extremely important to those who will seek future schooling after Yale. It was almost entirely unclear what was expected of us for policy memos. Having clearer guidelines--or even a sample memo or two to look at--would have helped immensely.",
    "It needs a complete overhaul. Maybe make it smaller or get the law students putt if they want to only learn all te statutes. Those can be learned on ones own time I want class to be learning how to actually work with this stuff and make change."

    "This class is challenging but very rewarding.",
    "Pay close attention to the first day's lecture. He sets up the rest of the class in that first day and indicates what he'll emphasize on the final. Take good notes on the lecture.",
    "As an FES MEM with little to no law exposure, this course provided a whirl-wind introduction to some of the most famous and impactful cases in American environmental law. I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in law and policy, or anyone who wants the opportunity to examine and critique the foundations and future of environmental law in the US (and the world.)",
    "Try to get to Professory Esty's hours ASAP and don't forget to schedule that in advance. That was one thing I didn't get as much from the course since he was always so busy: not enough 1-on-1 time.",
    "Don't get intimidated by all the readings or the legal jargon, and definitely take the class! It is mostly US-focused, but the principles learned in the class have worldwide implications. Dan is an amazing teacher and very supportive of his students.",
    "Take another law course with a more interested professor",
    "Definitely take this course with Prof. Esty. He's one of the best professors\/lecturers at FES and the material is relevant for any environmental manager\/scientist.",
    "Maybe law students got more out of this class"
