    "The content was interesting, but the lectures were not. The instructor aimed to form a discussion based class, but a lecture format would have been more interesting (and we could have covered all of the material). If one read the chapters, class was very repetitive. The grades are completely unknown. It will be a surprise to see what is received. More feedback throughout the semester would be helpful - and not to have 70% of a grade based on a 2 hour exam, when we have no idea what to expect on said exam given the absence of a practice exam or midterm.",
    "The lectures are well organized. Topics are interesting and relevant. The only weakness is that homework should be more application oriented. So that I will have a better idea on how to apply what I have learnt.",
    "Good course, efficient",
    "Good information, actually went beyond Intro to Clinical Trials and Reg Affairs",
    "The course was well-designed, and the textbook was distributed free and provided a good outline of the class material. If some discussion sections could be added, the class could be more interactive.",
    "I enjoyed this course, and I think it was very useful and practical. I wish we were moving a little faster and covered all chapters from the class text.",
    "This was a great course taught by a very knowledgeable instructor. We did not get through all of the chapters of his (very well written) course text, but it was okay because of the thoroughness in which we covered topics. It may have been helpful to have fundamentals of clinical trials as a prerequisite for the course so that we could spent more time on advanced topics.",
    "very nice",
    "This is a very interesting course. Dr. Peduzzi is a thoughtful guy who cares a lot about teaching. I did less \"work\" for this class than other courses, but I did a lot more thinking and I did learn A LOT. It's also a course that I think is quite a bit more preparatory for our careers than some others since a lot of us in biostats or epi will be doing work on clinical trials and we need to learn how to think about some big, complex, potentially insoluble problems.",
    "Good overall. We have lectures from Industry person, which is helpful.",
    "This course should require students to do more pre-class readings and preview of the textbook. Also, the form of lecturing should be changed in some degree. Lecturing by the professor alone which lasts nearly 2 hours is rather boring for the students and many would lose focus on the lecture in the latter half of the course.Additionally, I think closed book final exam is unnecessary. But the cases from VA and other clinical trails are really good, these examples really help students understand the principles better."

He tended to go off on extremely long tangents about trials he was involved with, the high points of which could have been condensed substantially. It would have been more interesting if the pace of the class was faster.",

    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0a very nice professor did a very nice job",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Dr. Peduzzi was great. He really cares about the material, getting us to think about it, and getting us to care too because doing these things right matters. I think he also did a great job of showing us why professional ethics matter, that they aren't just abstractions.",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Very good.",

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend reading the course textbook or a similar overview of clinical trials. This would result in the same knowledge in less time.",
    "I have learn useful techniques in multicenter clinic trials through this course. What I have learnt in this course is gonna help my future career in multiple ways. I would recommend it to other student.",
    "Yes will recommend",
    "Highly recommend for students interested to know more about clinical trials.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was an in-depth course about clinical trials, and you will walk away with a good understanding of basic but key concepts.",
    "very practical",
    "Yes. Again, this class was less \"work\" in terms of what I did outside of class, but Dr. Peduzzi did ask us to think harder and better than we are asked to do in other courses. It was good to be asked questions with no right answer and have to justify our positions.",
    "Yes, it is a class worth taken.",
    "I will recommend it to another student because it gives many examples in multicenter clinical trails in real life (many from VA). This is very useful for a biostatistics student to have a better understanding of clinical researches.",
    "This class gives a whole picture of clinical trial."
