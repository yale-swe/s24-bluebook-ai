   "comments": [
    "I learned a basic knowledge of Stata and refreshed my calculus knowledge.",
    "I learned many skills, mainly STATA. I also for the first time believe to truly understand statistics.",
    "Stata, Calculus, Derivatives, Algebra, etc... How to read and appreciate the nuances of statistics and quantitative analysis.",
    "I gained a basic but solid understanding of stats. The math I had done before, but the statistical analysis and Stata were both new to me. I can now read the methods section of a study and more or less understand what is going on.",
    "I learned so much about the principles of statistics, and the practical applications of analysis in policymaking. I loved every moment of it!",
    "I have a very thorough understanding of multivariable calculus and stata. I have a strong understanding of the fundamentals and the course did a great job of building on that.",
    "Calculus and stata.",
    "I developed knowledge of stata, derivatives, and policy memo",
    "Essential Calculus skills Broad understanding of functions Programming and Data analysis skills in Stata",
    "Strong analytical skills including proficiency in STATA; strengthened overall mathematical skills which I hadn't had a chance to work on since 2nd year undergrad.",
    "I learned how to take a data set, analyze it and extract useful information. I also was re-acquainted with quantitative analysis (calculus), which was a healthy reminder of a non social-science way to approach the world.",
    "How to use Stata and interpretation of results of Stata.",
    "We acquired basic knowledge on derivative and statistics as well as primary skills of statistical software (STATA).",
    "I felt this was one of the better courses I took this semester. Very useful knowledge of calculus that I foresee myself using in the future and data analysis software, stata."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are that it teaches you how to interpret statistics, which are misused all of the time. It teaches you to be a discerning consumer of data. It refreshes calculus knowledge, which I had forgotten. The weakness is that you spend a lot of time on the same data set...it would have been nice to use a few more after we got a basic knowledge of Stata. The problem sets are also maybe too long on the calculus part that they became busywork -- they could have been 25% shorter and I would have learned the same amount and done each problem with more care.",
    "The weakness I would say is that it unnecessarily goes into the trap of repeated and repeated question-answering for questions that don't add much to the course.",
    "Strengths: Lloyd Grieger Weaknesses: my own capability to understand Stata and the processes within that particular program.",
    "The only weakness was that we had to accommodate a wide range of comfort levels with stats, calculus etc. Otherwise, Lloyd did a great job keeping everyone engaged.",
    "Lloyd made this class engaging, exciting, and I would take it again, if I could! It is incredibly challenging to teach to a group of varied levels--at times, I felt like we moved too slowly, but I know others would say the opposite.",
    "Incredibly effective course! Learned a lot but I think the calculus portion could have been condensed so that there could be more stata work. The homework was very effective and allowing us to work with others (and have some answers available) really helped facilitate learning and practicing.",
    "This course is fantastic and Lloyd's teaching methods and style was its biggest strength. As someone who had not taken a math course since 2007 (and had had a very negative experience back then), I felt like my eyes were re-opened to the world of math. It was a fantastic way to re-learn everything that I previously found challenging or had forgotten. Lloyd makes sure that you know the very basics before building on them.",
    "One of the best designed courses I've taken. It was super engaging and the difficulty progressed at a good rate.",
    "Strengths: dedicated & engaging professor; content of the class and accompanied office hours. He is one of the most smartest professors I have countered. He is open to work with you despite your level. I would miss him!!! Weakness: Policy memo writing should be introduced by mid-semester or right after mid-term to allow time for some level of feedback and proficiency.",
    "Strengths: - Amazing Professor! This is the kind of course that could have become extremely boring if it wasn't for someone like Lloyd teaching it. Lloyd made the entire experience amazing, and the course content more digestible. - The course teaches an extremely important hard skill which is necessary in the market: STATA Weakness: - Way too much work to understand some concepts for which lesser amount of work could have done the trick as well - Some of the classes towards the end of the course were boring and it was hard to keep eyes open; it would be better if the professor could make it more interactive by making students work on STATA as he teaches, instead of utilizing a traditional lecture format - Please change the classroom location; frequent noise from nearby adversely affected the functioning of the class.",
    "Lloyd did a great job of bringing us all up to speed and challenging us at every step. In terms of ways the course could be improved, I think perhaps spending more time on Stata (.75 semester versus .5 semester) that would be helpful.",
    "Strength: The explanation by the professor was clear. The lectures were organized well. Weakness: The pace of the course was slow.",
    "The strength was the math part in the first half of the semester. I felt that the concepts developed very naturally and tied to each other from class to class and I saw a story developing that made sense. That same sense was not present during the data analysis part. I cannot pinpoint the reason as to why that was."

    "Yes! For those one interested in data analysis!",

    "Every student at Yale should fight for a chance to learn from Lloyd Grieger.",
    "Yes. This is not a subject I would have chosen to take, but Lloyd is so enthusiastic, knowledgeable and organized that he was able to keep me engaged. I learned a lot.",
    "Everyone should take this class--it is a perfect introduction to data and statistical modeling, and allows students to tap into skills they may not know they have!",
    "Yes, it was an excellent course and Lloyd was phenomenal!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course if someone needs to really cement statistical analysis basics and gain a thorough understanding of calculus.",
    "Yes. Its a good introduction to calculus and stata.",
    "Yes, the student would be taught by a dedicated, intelligent, engaging, and wicked-smart professor. The student would learn stata and how to interpret data as well as learn how to write policy memo.",
    "Yes! Should remain a mandatory course",
    "Absolutely! Lloyd is by far one of the best professors I have had the chance to study under, and this course also provides a strong understanding of the concept STATA.",
    "Since this is a required course at Jackson, I'd say yes!",
    "I recommend this course for anyone who is new to Yale and applied methods of analysis. The Instructor is a world class professor.",
    "I highly recommend this course to students who haven't learned derivative or statistics before.",
    "Yes. I would definitely recommend this course."
