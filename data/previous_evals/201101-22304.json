    "This class requires constant performance with weekly film projects and reading responses. If you give yourself time and take the tasks seriously, there is a lot to be learned and a lot of fun to be had. Sandra is a great teacher and pushes each of her students to strive for their best work. Take this class, you won't regret it.",
    "Yes, this is a great class to read incredibly helpful literature on filmmaking and to create a final project that you are hopefully very proud of.",
    "This is a great and challenging course -- if you're interested in filmmaking, take it (with Professor Luckow, if you can). Expect to be frustrated and a bit overwhelmed but ultimately very enriched.",
    "Great class. Small sections, good teacher, lots of hands on work. The reading responses are kinda annoying, but there's not many of them and they're short. Class is a lot of fun, and the homework is awesome for people interested in film (mostly short film projects or script writing\/editing).",
    "Absolutely. The class was certainly a lot of work, but definitely worth it.",
    "This is an intense, but rewarding class. Make sure that you have 10 hours a week (probably over the weekend) to spend filming things and a few good friends who are willing to act for you. You will come out of the class with a wonderful appreciation for what goes into creating a movie, as well as a hankering to do it as much as possible.",
    "LOVED IT! I came into this class having done still photography, but never film, which is a different experience than if you've done this stuff before. I am SO glad that I decided to take this class - I only wish I had found it sooner. It gives you an overview of what it's like to be a filmmaker. The class moves fast - each week you add a new element without having time to perfect the last one. It's also EXTREMELY time consuming, and the amount of time needed grows exponentially for each project. You also end up spending a lot of time begging friends to help you with your films, which is possibly the most frustrating part. Taking this the same semester as my senior essay was a challenge, but I'm glad I did it none the less. Sandra is tough, but very supportive, fair and very funny. If you're interested in learning about the craft of film making and what it really means to be a director, take this class!",
    "This is an intimate workshop class with lots of room for flexibility and talent of all ranges. In order to make the most of it, students need to plan well and approach this class as an opportunity to hear genuine feedback from their peers and instructor. They will need to go above and beyond the minimum requirements\u0097because currently, the requirements will not teach you enough technical knowledge, nor make it easy for you to put all of the readings into practice.",
    "Yes. Sandra's great and I actually learned more about screenwriting here than in the screenwriting class. Beware: a lot of work, and class is like therapy."
