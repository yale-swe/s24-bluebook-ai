    "Take this course if you like language. Everything you read is in Old English, and there is a lot of grammar rules, etc. so it really is more like a language course than a literature course.",

    "Absolutely.",
    "The course conveniently covered both the ancient language and ancient literature requirements for my program; I would not recommend it for other reasons. Perhaps if the teaching had been more rigorous, I could have felt better satisfied."
