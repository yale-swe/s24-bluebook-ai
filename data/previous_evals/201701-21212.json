    "This is the only real exposure I've ever had to astronomy and astrophysics, so I gained a cursory knowledge of the field and how the math works at a very basic level.",
    "Analytical and Quantitative Skills",
    "Nothing substantial.",
    "You need basic algebra that is covered in your standard 5th-grade math class.",
    "Learned a lot about exoplanets, dark matter, and black holes.",
    "I love this class! As a humanities major I wasn't expecting to like astronomy or physics but I ended up learning so much and enjoyed the class a lot. I learned all about black holes, how to find exoplanets and more about dark matter. It was a fascinating class that I learned so much about space.",
    "I learned to have an appreciation for science. This was a great course.",
    "A great amount of knowledge on various topics of astronomy including exoplanets, black holes, and dark matter, as well as some issues that arise in the domain of astronomy.",
    "This course allowed me to understand the issues that current astrophysicists are attempting to solve.",
    "I have a much better understanding of how the Universe works and I know about some of the most important current questions in astronomy",
    "The course is a really interesting survey of some hot topics in astronomy. It covered exoplanets, black holes, and dark matter.",
    "Goes through exoplanets, black holes, and dark matters. You get an overview of the concepts in each unit and learn how to set up basic physics equations to get information about each (using keplers law, conservation of momentum, etc).",
    "Even though I have no interests in Astrophysics, the course topics were really interesting and I enjoyed learning more about a field that is changing every day.",
    "I definitely learned tons of new things about planets, black holes, and dark matter. I also learned how to think as a scientist.",
    "This class taught me a lot about 3 specific topics in astrophysics: exoplanets, black holes, and dark matter. It was interesting to get a peek into the field of astrophysics, the type of math involved, and the thought process necessary for it.",
    "I've learned so much about how stars, galaxies, and black holes are formed. This class has given me more literacy on matters concerning the cosmos, and whenever Ned discoveries are made, I'm made to use my knowledge from this class to understand thes significance of new discoveries.",
    "A lot about gravity, time travel and dark matter",
    "I learned how to think big and think very, very small when it comes to things like time, space, and space-time. Learned some fascinating facts about the Universe as well as the state of various academic subfields in astrophysics.",

    "A general overview to black holes, exoplanets, and dark matter.",
    "this course was a great sweeping view of exoplanets, dark matter, and black holes. As the course description says, it is an introductory course and provides no more than a cursory view of these topics. That being said, at the end of the course you really do have a much greater appreciation for these topics and what the forefront of research today is like.",
    "The course was in 3 chapters: Exoplanets, Black Holes, and Dark Matter. You don't need any previous knowledge of astrophysics for this course.",
    "Very interesting course! Taught me a lot about specific cool ideas on the cutting edge of astrophysics, and definitely useful to impress your friends and interesting to think about!",

   "comments": [
    "Strenghts: Geha, the TA's, the lecture weaknesses: ? didn't have any",
    "This is a very good science credit if you are comfortable with doing some math. The problem sets were very fair and not confusing at all, you are allowed to take in one paper sheet to each exam and the course is very, very well organized and straightforward. I thought it would be difficult because we did not even have a textbook to go off of, but that just makes it so that professor Geha is extremely organized. One of the best courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "Strengths: No textbook, very organized Weaknesses: Material was not really reinforced outside of 2 lectures a week Improvement: Make mandatory sections",
    "This course is very straightforward, which is a big strength. The units, homework, and exams are broken down very clearly, so expectations are clear.",
    "No improvements. Very straightforward and fair.",
    "This course is incredible! You will learn a lot of great info about exoplanets, black holes, and dark matter. Please take it with Marla Geha. She is wonderful.",
    "great class. great survey of hot topics in astronomy, taught in a way that is very accessible and interesting if you've ever had an interest in the topic.",
    "An excellent course to fulfill your Sc credit",
    "It covered a lot of ground, but I actually think it could have stood to be a bit more math-y.",
    "I thought the class was extremely well organized and the tas were very hands on. True lectures were extremely interesting and I was actually excited to go to them because professor geha made lecture interactive and exciting.",
    "I really enjoyed the level of engagement with this course. Even though it is a lecture, Professor Geha did a great job of making sure people understood the material.",
    "I thought this course was pretty solid for what it offered to be. Not too much work, but still interesting. All in all, the problem sets and exams were quite fair and never too difficult.",
    "The course is really interesting and I enjoyed it a lot, but the dark matter section was a little frustrating because it felt like we were glossing over a lot of the math and real science (probably for good reason, to be fair). It's also really easy (you get a cheat sheet on midterms and finals, and problem sets take no time at all).",
    "This is a really great course, not a lot that needs to improve.",
    "Very well taught, engaging material and well structured! No bad comments.",
    "The course format was very good. The exams were fair and the p-sets were helpful. I think the course could have been shortened to 50 minutes.",
    "More math could have been involved, and some of the essay questions in the first few psets were a little subjective.",
    "Professor is dope. I like her spunk",
    "This class was ran wonderfully and I appreciated how the course did not assume any background knowledge before entering the course. The professor and TA's were a great deal of help and very patient with all of the students.",
    "A very good introduction to astrophysics. However, I wish the controversial side of astrophysics.",
    "Professor Geha was INCREDIBLE.",
    "The best parts are the range of material that's covered. It was so great to be able to learn about not just exoplanets, but also black holes and dark matter. It's clearly an intro class, and the expectations of students are clear throughout the class. Professor Geha is INCREDIBLY helpful, as are the TAs, and Piazza is a godsend. I really enjoyed having to write questions after each class, and having Prof. Geha answer some of those questions before every class. Getting to bring in one sheet of paper to each exam was really helpfulI get the educational reason for this (that it helps us LEARN the material yet again), and I definitely learned a lot WHILE taking the tests as well. One improvement I would suggest concerns the open-ended questions on the problem sets. Joel's feedback for the first problem set was a lot to handle, and in general, it didn't seem like the grading rubrics for these open-ended questions was clear. Perhaps give people a rubric of what you want to see in terms of argumentation?",
    "The strengths include Prof. Geha's fantastic teaching, and the interesting information being taught.",
    "Strengths: overall structure (3 separate units in astrophysics subjects), nice professor, relatively interesting material, fair problem sets Weaknesses: sometimes it was difficult in a given lecture to follow the progression of the material towards some conclusion, would like to know why I'm learning about X-rays before it is explained that X-rays are emitted by gas surrounding black hole, for example.",
    "Made a very complicated concept easy to understand.",
    "All of the course materials, grading formulas, and exam formats were clear and relayed to students at the beginning of the semester. The material was all interesting and well balanced between the quantitative elements and popular topics (life on other planets, dark matter, etc.). Grading was fair and always timely, and the TA's were very helpful at every section and in advance of the exams. Additionally, the professor and TA responses on piazza were not only helpful but also extremely timely, which I and many other students greatly appreciated.",
    "sssoo fun, except the last topic was slightly too complex for people who are simply interested in space generally cool field trip and side lectures and opportunities",
    "Super interesting, super easy to follow, and fun.",
    "honestly this course was fantastic, don't have any suggestions for improvements. Professor Geha also constantly asked for feedback and tailored it to the class's needs, so if any improvements needed to be made it was definitely not for lack of anything on her part.",
    "It introduces you to some astrophysics concepts and explains how those ideas came about.",
    "The strengths of the course was that it encouraged lecture attendance, and student learning was prioritized over pure test taking. It encouraged us to really engage with the material. A weakness is that the exams could have been more challenging.",
    "Great course.",
    "Assessments in this course are very fair and made so that it is very much possible for you to get a good grade, provided that you do what is expected of you. Lectures are interesting and are usually quite interactive (multiple choice questions throughout and some in class demos\/experiments) which make lessons engaging.",
    "It certainly was not very challenging (though far from a gut). I think there were a few too many concessions made (such as the entire sheet of paper for notes). I mean, the average on one of the midterms was a 98, which is kind of ridiculous. That said, I really appreciated all the review materials posted.",
    "Strengths: The professor was very passionate about her work as were the TA's. Weaknesses: Because it was a lecture and most of the time it was just the professor lecturing, most people were very disengaged.",
    "The professor was very knowledgable about all the topics, and when she didn't know an answer, she made sure to look it up and provide us with a response, which lent itself to a cohesive learning environment. Lectures were not very entertaining, though."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, its a great class, not mathematically terrifying - but you still get an idea of the math used to discuss all of the things we know of in space.",
    "Yes. 100%. Yes, most people that take this will do so for the science credit, but it is a genuinely interesting topic and Professor Geha makes the course fun and I actually looked forward to attending class.",
    "This is a great 5th course to take. Many people were spooked by the amount of \"math\" needed for this course. I think if you did decently in high school algebra and well on the Math SAT, you are all set for this class. It was very, very watered down physics at times, nothing too challenging.",
    "This class is a science credit for non-science majors. If you are at all comfortable with algebra and at all interested in space, it's a dream science credit. The class is very well structured and easy to manage if you do the psets and prepare well for the exams. And space is cool!",
    "Great astronomy class. Take it! You will not regret it!",
    "Yes please take it, especially with Marla Geha. An interesting and well-taught science credit without much work.",
    "YES my GUT feeling is a YES!!! lovely QR\/SC credit, very chill, Prof. Geha is great",
    "If you need it for the Sc, do it. It does get boring though.",
    "I would recommend this course as a stress-free and interesting science credit for a humanities major.",
    "Yeah, this is a fairly low-stress way to learn a lot of science",
    "If you need a science credit, definitely take it. The material is quite interesting and the professor very effective at teaching the material. The workload is rather light and it's not a fast-paced course.",
    "I would recommend this course to. In science majors that are interesting in learning about astronomy and gaining some knowledge about how to apply physics to space. It was a very interesting course without a ton of work.",
    "Great class, perfect if you need a science credit. Low workload and interesting material, very manageable to get an A.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they are worried about taking a science course at Yale. This was a great way to learn about a new field of academia. It was also a great introduction to astronomy.",
    "Good science gut.",
    "Yes! Science class with a qualitative approach. Professor Geha is very enthusiastic about astronomy and you'll learn about a lot of super interesting topics in astronomy with little workload.",
    "Yeah I would definitely recommend this course to someone else who is looking for a fairly easy science credit that is still interesting.",
    "Take this course! It is fast paced enough to be interesting but is not too difficult. Professor Geha is a very engaging lecturer and you will learn a lot about the galaxy and universe.",
    "I'd recommend the course to somebody who wants an easy Science credit but still wants to learn interesting material.",
    "Yes! Take this course - it's really interesting material covered in a way that is very approachable. If you have a decent grasp on using algebra it's not going to be too challenging, the problem sets take a little time but are graded fairly. Engaging lecture.",
    "Definitely would recommend! Great course that is extremely well taught and very engaging. If you dedicate time on the PSETs and are awake during lecture this course won't be too challenging, but it neither is a walk in the park for lazy people. Professor is great lecturer and has structured the course very well.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Even if you are just looking to fulfill a science or QR requirement, take this course!",
    "If you want to see if you like astrophysics and learn a little more about scientific thinking, this is a fantastic class.",
    "YES",
    "Absolutely",
    "Yes. Very approachable",
    "Yes, this class is amazing and if you have any interest in the field of astrophysics or sci-fi related topics you should look into this course. Very interesting topics and the staff is great.",
    "I would recommend this very much! It's very interesting and fun to learn.",
    "This class is out of this world.",
    "You learn about a subject you'd otherwise have no reason to learn about.",
    "YES. Take it if you want a relatively chill lecture about things that will blow your mind, taught by an incredibly clear, funny, and dare-I-say-it Cool professor, guided by helpful TAs, and with pretty easy midterms and tests. You get to bring in one sheet of paper to tests which is so helpful. Homeworks are fine, can be tricky at times, but nothing that collaboration with peers couldn't help with (Prof. Geha encourages collaboration to an extent!)",
    "Absolutely, I already have. It has been one of my favorite course I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, Astronomy is an extremely interesting topic and this class covers a lot of ground.",
    "Great class, would definitely recommend for a science credit. Prof Geha is great.",
    "AMAZING class for non-science majors. Challenging yet engaging with a very reasonable workload. 10\/10 recommend.",
    "sure",
    "Yes. Not that difficult, but very interesting.",
    "Super fun class!",
    "Yes definitely! If you have ever had even a fleeting interest in space, this is the course for you. It's also just good to be aware of all of the progress scientists are making; you will be amazed at how much we have learned in the past one-hundred years, much less the past ten, about space.",
    "Yes! Very cool and unique topic, special to Yale. Wonderful professor, too!",
    "Yes, great process and professor",
    "Take this if you want a fairly easy science credit that's actually pretty interesting-- you really know the universe better afterwards!",
    "Absolutely",
    "This course is great if you want to be introduced to some cool astrophysics concepts like exoplanets, black holes and dark matter. It's a simple and straightforward course, weekly quizzes and psets, 2 midterms and a final, and class participation is just handing in a question every lecture. It's a really chill and interesting course, Professor Geha was really enthusiastic and explained really well, her lectures were very well structured and she cared a lot about answering students' questions.",
    "Yes! It is a very interesting science credit, about very interesting material.",
    "A great science credit. One of the most fun classes that I have taken at Yale.",
    "This is a great course that introduces students to some of the most pressing issues in the field of astrophysics in an easily digestible way that is very interesting, even for people who wouldn't typically be interested in science.",
    "Great science credit for non-majors: not too challenging, but the material is really interesting.",
    "Yes. Very easy course to take. However, because it can be very easy don't take problem sets or the tests to lightly as they are most of your grade.",
    "I would recommend this course because I found the material to be interesting and the professor was really good.",
    "Great science credit class for those who do not want to take hard courses and are interested in learning about astrophysics.",
    "I absolutely loved this class! An easy science credit, but also super interesting. The grading is very fair. Tests are easy, you get to use a cheat sheet on each one. Also, if you do poorly on a test, you can make it up with an optional paper. Overall, an easy A.",
    "Take this class for Professor Geha's superb teaching. I'm an Americans studies major, and I dread taking my Sc\/Qr classes because it's so much easier to find inspiring teachers in Humanities seminars. But Prof Geha is a superstar. If Leslie Knope had a more wry, less impulsive older sister, it'd be Prof Geha. Her PowerPoints are impeccable (for example, she'll recycle old slides to remind you of how much you've learned from the first time you saw it), and she always annotates her lessons with frank, candid asides about \"how science actually gets done,\" as she puts it. When Yale says that you'll benefit from taking classes with people who are vanguards in their field, they're talking about Prof Geha. Her transparency and humility make this promised learning possible."
