    "If you have previous exposure to this subject and are interested in taking a very detailed look at certain aspects of the period than yes. If you are interested in learning about this period more broadly or this is your first foray into British History then no.",
    "If you like the subject matter, then take it. If not, then it will be tough to remain interested in a course that deals so heavily with difficult primary sources. If you are interested, thenProfessor Bulman is a solid professor, and you will learn a lot.",
    "If you're interested in and have background on British history, you should think about taking this course. The professor is good and the material you read is interesting. But if you don't know much about the period and are just looking to try something new, I wouldn't recommend this course for that. That's what I tried and I don't think this course is the best way to introduce yourself to a new area of history.",
    "History 224J introduces students to the various historical interpretations of revolutionary Britain through a study of both primary and secondary source material. The class is rooted in the primary sources, so be prepared to pour over manuscripts with tiny print! However, it is a fulfilling seminar.",
    "Take it. Important part of British history which you could easily spend a year studying. Try and do some work before the term starts though to get a background - Bulman doesn't bother with a real introduction of what happened in the 17th century so its a good idea to do some base reading on your own",
    "I would recommend it but I would also be aware of the time commitment this class takes. It is definitely worth it, you'll come away with a lot of knowledge about a very interesting time in English history but there is a lot of reading and the papers take time."
