    "The first semester of Math 230 was certainly difficult, though I found it a rewarding and even enjoyable experience. The grading was tough but the material was interesting and Dr. Athreya was the best instructor anyone could have asked for. I would therefore recommend the course to anyone who is willing to work (a lot) and is interested in mathematics.",
    "Take it for sure if you want to major in math. Otherwise, think long and hard about whether this will be useful-physics 260 does not depend on it. You could get away with the math 120 and physics 260 and be a lot happier unless you have a strong interest in proof-based math.",
    "Math 230 is a good amount of work but it is manageable and really teaches you how to write proofs and we learn a lot and really understand the material deeply. I think it is a good course and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested.",
    "Only if you are majoring in math, are amazing at it, and are willing to work a lot.",
    "This course was challenging and probably not for someone who is set on getting an A. You learn a lot, and it is very proof-based.",
    "Math 230 is a very well-designed course. It's very accessible for a student who has seen proofs before, but it is still rigorous and challenging. I think that\u0097as advertised\u0097seeing vector calc and linear algebra presented together has helped me to understand bothin more depth. The pacing of the lectures was fairly good; I rarely felt either rushed or bored. The textbook was also fairly good, and the homework problems were interesting but doable. Prof. Athreya is quite engaging. Unfortunately, I gather that he's leaving after next term, so check out the course reviews for whoever is teaching it the semester you're considering (even if the reviews are from other math classes). A good professor makes the material come alive, a bad one could make it deadly boring. That said, if you're looking for a fast and interesting track to upper-level math at Yale, 230 is probably your best bet. I found the first semester of 230 to be a very satisfying introduction to Vector Calc and Linear Algebra, and I am looking forward to next semester.",
    "It's a lot of work, but it's a worthwhile class. The class all works together, so you have other students to help support you and work through the tough problem sets.",
    "I would recommend Math 230 for a student who is very interested in math and prepared to do a lot of work.",
    "The class was hard. But Professor Athreya does a good job explaining it. If you have an interest in math and want to learn how to prove theorems this is a class for you.",
    "A course in MVC and linear algebra. I would recommend this for any student willing to put forth the effort to learn the material, and work a lot outside of class on the homeworks assigned.",
    "Math 230 is a hard course (for most people). That being said, if you are interested in seeing proofs behind the calculus concepts we take for granted, this is it. If you want to see what math is really all about, this is it. However, this may not be the best course for everyone, and is not a good co-requisite for Physics 260 if you have not taken multivariable yet. Take this course if you are prepared to work hard and make sure to have fun with it.",
    "Math 230 is primarily a class about proving things which uses multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and differential forms as a \"testing ground\" for proving things. It might help to do a little background reading in or before the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend 230 to another student, at least as a starting point. You can always switch down into an easier course part way through the year, but I definitely recommend sticking with it. It gets easier as you become used to this type of math, and is certainly interesting. The problem sets are in general not as bad as people say.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student who has had a very solid background in calculus and is willing to do much more work than he\/she has in a math course before (around ten hours\/week on the problem sets alone). The material is interesting, and while it was certainly my hardest course, I learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend Math 230 for a student who is looking for a serious challenge. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on this class; 15 hrs\/week is NOT an exaggeration on the workload of this class. Also, don't expect easy good grades in this class. However, if you're willing to work hard, and risk bad grades, you will learn a lot from this class, not just the concepts behind multivariable and linear algebra, but also how to write proofs and think logical. Study groups are a really good idea to help with homework and prepare for tests, not to mention a good way of getting to know people.",
    "Math 230 is a pretty intensive proof-based class. Other people will tell you that you should only take it if you plan on majoring in math, but I'm not majoring in math and I still it. I would say that you should either a) be good at math or b) know some multivariable calculus, before enrolling in this class, unless you want to spend 15 hours a week on this class and still fail.",
    "OVERVIEWMath 230 is a mathematician's math course. As far as I know, it's a one-of-a-kind course in rigor, scope, and theoretical focus for Yale freshmen. If that's what you're into, you should be willing to bear a lot of hardships and imperfections in the teaching style and textbook, and perhaps a lower grade in order to take the class.TAKE COURAGEIf you're intimidated about this class but have the preparation and interest, try it. The horror stories turned out to be exaggerated, by the way. It is very easy to bump down to a lower level if necessary. But once you realize you have a safety net, push that fact to the far back of your mind or you'll be too complacent with mediocrity on challenging homework assignments. Don't get bummed out by a few grades that are lower than you might be used to in high school; it's worth sticking with the class because by the end of the first semester, the vector calculus and linear algebra all comes together in an exciting, rewarding way.PROFESSOR ATHREYAProfessor Athreya did a relatively good job communicating geometric intuition about theorems and definitions. I can't speak for other instructors. Your job as a student is to learn the material, not just what the professor chooses to teach. Browse the internet or math library if you have to to get a better grasp on what's conceptually happening.TEXTBOOK: MULTIVARIABLE MATHEMATICS BY THEODORE SHIFRINAs to our textbook, until reading week I felt disconnected from the author when he was deriving proofs. He often would use bouts of cleverness, that I could affirm worked, but I had no inkling as to what inspired the original author to guess in advance that that tactic would work. I think a lot more explanation should be in both the textbook and the class as to how a problem solver would go about trying to figure out the next step. Our author, Shifrin, also had the obnoxious habit of leaving parts of some proofs left as an exercise to the reader. The problems were pretty cool though. And the pictures blew my mind: those manifolds, they have *so many folds*!ADVICE:There are some stock proof techniques. For example, you show two sets are equal by showing that each is a subset of the other. You prove a condition is true for all the elements of a set by showing it holds true for an arbitrary element of that set that you haven't differentiated from the other elements in any way. Figure out what these stock techniques are and learn them cold. It may be the case that they are so second-nature to your instructor that he or she may perhaps mention them once but fails to emphasize them. The quizzes and exams rarely get too fancy, so the important part is knowing how to implement the most fundamental proof strategies.OFFICE HOURSI wish my schedule allowed me to take advantage of office hours, which are a great resource when the material gets very difficult or the notation confusing. Sometimes taking advantage of office hours means starting your homework earlier, but then you often face questions without the benefit of instruction.NOTE TAKINGKeep in mind the proofs are all in the textbook. Note what it is you went over that day, so you know what your professor thinks is most important. You have a limited ability to attend, so don't waste it in copying the board when the proof is in your textbook anyway. Often, the best things to write will be not what the professor writes but what he says \u0096 those are the truly irreplaceable nuggets of experience. To really understand a proof, by the way, will take the average 230 student much more than passive class attendance.AFTER IT ALLI enjoyed this class and plan on continuing next semester. Good luck!",
    "Math 230 will teach you how to write proofs. Most of the material is only semi interesting (unless you LOVE linear algebra) since you're going over mostly fundamentals, but the strength of the course is its rigor. The problem sets are almost all proofs and will be difficult in the beginning if you haven't had any exposure to them before.Jayadev is a great professor. You can tell that he puts in time to prepare his lectures as they are well organized and engaging. A lot of people say this course is hard but it is manageable if you go to lecture,have a good chunk of time to devote to the problem sets each week, and most importantly, are genuinely interested in math.There will also be lots of people shopping the class. If you get a decent grade on the first problem set I suggest you stay in the class. You can always drop down later in the semester. It's worth it to finish the class since 230 is a prereq for the \"honors\" versions of analysis and algebra.",
    "Math 230 is a rigorous proof based examination of the foundations of multivariable calculus, going over topics like continuity, limits, and differentiability in n-dimensions. I would recommend this class to someone who wants to learn math in a way other than memorizing formulas and only doing calculations. Overthe semester, you begin to feel comfortable proving various theorems and get a deeper understanding of the material. Math 230 is difficult but rewarding.",
    "Math 230 is great for a student who has a strong mathematical background, or for someone who is planning to pursue a career in the maths, sciences, etc. It is by no means an easy course, but if you work hard and diligent, it can be one of the most rewarding. The concepts that we cover in class and in the readings and homework really give students a much deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics of some very beautiful theorems, and will also teach students how to be mathematically mature and to be able to read mathematics on their own in the future.However, although Math 230 is a great class, it requires significant time commitment, depending on your mathematical ability. Make sure that it is something that you will be able to handle with your workload!",
    "It's not for the faint of heart. Most of the people in this class are freshman who - like you - did very well and never had to try in high school math. You \/will\/ have to try in this course. However, it's rewarding, and gave me a much deeper understanding of the material than I would have gained had I simply taken a course designed to teach problem solving (instead of proofs).",
    "Math 230 was a challenging, yet rewarding class. It is very proof based and everything we use is proved in class. While the problem sets take a good amount of time, they prepare you very well for the exams. If you really enjoy math and a challenge, then I would recommend this class, however every student has to know that this class is a challenge and will require a lot of out of class time every week.",
    "If you're very good at conceptual and somewhat abstract mathematics, this course is interesting and will make everything else you ever do make a lot more sense. Not a course for the weak of heart though.",
    "Math 230 is great if you are looking for a challenging math course. It is a lot of work, but very rewarding and never boring.",
    "Absolutely. Requires significant time committment (8-10 hrs\/wk) to read the material covered and solve\/write up problem sets though. Great class for a more rigorous way of presenting multivariable calculus (everything is proven) and a nice stepping stone toward higher-level math classes.",
    "MATH 230 01 is a good course. You get a very solid grasp of vector calculus, linear algebra and the proofs of the important properties and theorems in these areas. It is not particularly exciting, but it's not boring either. As far as challenge goes, I found it a bit disappointing. The problem sets don't challenge you as much as they annoy you. Would I recommend it? Yes. Consider it laying the groundwork for exciting things to come.",
    "Best math course I've ever taken."
