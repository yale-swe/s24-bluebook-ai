    "The Haas library is absolutely terrible. Whoever thought that it would be a good idea to have us only check out one book a day for a single day's time has obviously never had to do research while being in any of the programs. I have absolutely no idea who benefits from this system but I know that I had a terrible time trying to visit the library as my schedule was ridiculous because of studio. It seemed the only free time I had to research (nights and friday afternoons) were when the library was closed.Seriously though, the library's policies need to be reconfigured if anyone is expected to write a substantial paper without being in the MED program. I paid countless fines because of the utterly ridiculous one day rule (yes you can renew on-line but only for three days) and always had to wait to borrow direct books from other libraries since I could never use our own. If there is one thing I would change at this school it would be the terrible library structure.",
