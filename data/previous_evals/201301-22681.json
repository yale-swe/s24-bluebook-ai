    "The course is a grammar-intensive course that covers compound tenses not previously learned, such as the present perfect subjunctive, the future perfect, and the conditional perfect (amongst others). I would absolutely recommend this course to another student!",
    "Spanish 140 is a lot of constant work, but it's necessary to finish up the language requirement. However, I do feel like I finally got more comfortable actually speaking the language in this class. Because it's mostly focused on in-class discussion, talking became easier for the first time ever, which is rewarding.",
    "take cividanes if you can she is sooooooo nice she's really accommodating and her class is kinda hard but she's pretty easy to understand and she really is approachable",
    "A lot of work but if you need the class take it with Prof. Cividanes!",
    "Yes, take it! It's a wonderful course and you learn a lot about the language, grammar, speaking, and culture!",
    "It's a good class that goes through all four aspects of Spanish - writing, reading, speaking, listening. Strongly recommended as it builds off of Span 130 and strengthens your language skills a lot more. It is also easier than Span 130."
