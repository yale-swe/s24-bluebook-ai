    "a course designed to improve your creative non-fiction, but through that, to become mo aware of your own writing and how to improve it. I would recommend this as a class every Yale student should take in their freshman year.",
    "Being in ENGL 120 has made me more confident writer, editor, and communicator. In high school, I won numerous local, regional, state, and even national writing competitions; but being in Professor Shirkhani's class with 15 other talented writers, I realized I was not the only \"good writer\" and this feeling gave me a reason to improve myself and my writing style.As Professor S says, \"you're here to help one another, but you're also competing.\" I did not start the semester with an A, in fact it was a few assignments in before I saw my first straight A (for those curious about how 120 will affect your GPA), but when I did receive one, I felt as though I had earned it.",
    "Emphatically yes. It is a class that, if you enjoy reading and writing, will be pure fun to be in. Challenging and interesting.",
    "Regardless of when you take this class, I think it's an absolute must for all Yalies- the techniques you gain through this course are invaluable, and the way it forces you to look at texts is so helpful for you as a reader AND as a writer. Be warned that you WILL have to work hard to do well, but the work is completely worth it, because the pride you feel at realizing the immense improvements you've made to your writing style is extraordinary. I didn't consider myself to be at all a good writer coming into ENGL 120, and I can now say that I'm relatively confident in my writing ability. Try to take it with Prof. Shirkhani if you can- she really goes the extra mile in trying to give all of her students personal attention (if you seek it out), and if you really put in the effort to improve your writing, she'll notice. Overall, a great course to take at Yale! (Though if you're on the fence about taking ENGL 114 first, I probably would recommend it. I didn't, and I felt like my introduction into this course was a bit abrupt in terms of my writing abilities versus expectations of my writing ability.)",
    "On the whole, I would recommend this course to a fellow student. The opportunity to hone writing skills by writing multiple drafts of each paper was very rewarding (although our section's writing five essays as opposed to six probably made time for revisions especially plentiful), and as a freshman, various assignments provided great opportunities for getting to know Yale in unique ways e.g. writing about specific places around campus or interviewing faculty members. The course isn't as much work as is purported, with readings being relatively short, but the difficulty of the class will vary tremendously based on the speed with which one writes largely non-research-based papers. While I might not have come away from the course with particularly specific ways of improving my writing, I can definitively say I've gained a greater awareness of each sentence's effect on the audience's thoughts in pieces I write.",
    "English 120 is a class where we read 'modern essays,' or essays that you would read in The New Yorker, Gourmet magazine, essay books, etc. It can help you with many forms of writing in the future, from letters to editorials to proposals. If you are interested in learning to craft yourself into a more considered, smart and creative writer, this is the class for you. I highly recommend this class because it was one class where I had very strong discourse in every single session. The discussions are really stimulating and there's nothing better at Yale than getting to throw ideas at each other, re-shape it, reject it, throw it back, and have it constructively scrutinized by your classmates.",
    "This is course that is designed to improve your writing, and it delivers. Even if you are already comfortable with your writing in high school, take it. It will improve your writing no matter what level you start at. If possible, take it with Professor Shirkhani. She has a long waiting list, but her brilliant insight into writing combined with her firm but kind inductive teaching style makes it worth it.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who was interested in an introductory English course a bit more advanced that 114. However, it's not necessarily one I would recommend to someone not on the English track, especially not in his or her freshman year.",
    "Super interesting discussion-based class where you get to write essays, read professional writers' essays, read your classmates' essays, and get fantastic feedback from your professor and classmates. I would DEFINITELY recommend this class. I always looked forward to going to class and was truly emotional when the class came to a close.",
    "ENGL 120 is definitely one of the must-take courses at Yale (I recommend enrolling in Shirkhani's course). I highly recommend everyone take it; it's a fun way to fulfill the writing requirement! The course, however, is very difficult and getting an A is not easy.",
    "It's a good class. The readings aren't always helpful, but you do get to read some great writers, especially in the humor section. Shirkhani knows what she's doing, but she can be moody at times. Overall, take it."
