    "i would certainly recommend it to any student trying to figure out how to actually do statistical work (i.e most other courses firmly stop at the theory and leave all software computations to individual learning or ad hoc implementation). The practical skills offered in this course are the salient strengths",
    "SOCY580 is a statistics course that covers all the basics of statistics with a particular focus on the OLS model. Assignments include a weekly problem set that is completed with STATA software.",

    "As an undergraduate student aspiring to enroll in graduate school and conduct my own research, I must say that SOCY580 was an amazing opportunity. With Chris's encouragement, I am happy that I took and completed the course. Not only did the course serve as a way to deepen my knowledge of statistics at a higher level, but it also allowed meto see what to expect in an academic community, particularly in a Sociology department. The class expanded my knowledge on multiple levels.",
