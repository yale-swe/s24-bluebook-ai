   "comments": [
    "The studio project dealt with the problems of the largest scientific After several decades of development, this institution has neither a well-articulated structure of the site plan, nor any specific architectural identity.The scientific nature of the institution implied the interdisciplinary approach in the project.Before starting individual proposals we made some substantial research on precedents of relation between science, technology and architecture in previous decades.Then we had a great opportunity to visit the site, meet with the representatives of CERN, learn about their research, policy, as well as the current problems with spatial organization and building infrastructure.With the knowledge received from these two preliminary stages of studio we proceeded to our individual proposals.In all, I think the way the studio was set up, allowed the students to use much more comprehensive approach in their design, as opposed to the projects done without substantial preliminary investigation in the related areas.We worked on different scales - site scale, and building scale - which in my opinion is very valuable.I also think that part of the success of the studio is due to a very smart choice of the topic, which gave such a great research opportunity.",
    "The studio topic is interesting in terms of its position in architectural discourse. Looking at 60\u0092s futurism as precedent, the forecast of CERN 50 years in the future investigates technology and architectural possibilities. Conventional architectural issues, such as structure and planning are not discussed in depth in this studio, more focus is directed towards system and integrated strategies. However, the preliminary research on technologies are not quite adequate comparing to what is required for the project in the later half of semester. As a result, the technology part of the projects are more like adding\u0097up instead of integrated.",
    "The project Chris chose for this studio was great to explore the studio\u0092s interests on technology, infrastructure, connection, and architecture. The choice of the site \u0093CERN\u0094 and researches by him ahead of the beginning of the semester were nice. Readings are all well prepared by him and clearly explained to us.The trip and the site visit were not quite prepared. I personally wanted to have more specific location and program of the project before we went to the site, so I could have better understanding on the site and have better preparation toward the project at the site.",
    "The coordination was on a by project basis, but there were no experts brought in for advice.The integration of systems into the projects (where it happened) was forced and not critical of neither method of architectural production, nor architectural form.",
    "There was a strong push in this studio to achieve a balance between architecture and other disciplines, especially within the notions of \u0093systems integration\u0094 and the \u0093scientific aesthetic\u0094 and the work of architects like Fuller, Wachsman, Tyng, Zanuso and much more. All these were covered in class, through several reading assignments that students were meant to read and discussions on structural, landscape and support systems in which all of us participated with our own research.",
    "This course was very interesting with the integration of 60's architects such as archigram, fuller, cedric price. I found the integration of sustainable systems, transportation infrastructure to be very relevant to the way architects should be thinking about architecture today and think it will be invaluable for future practice. I wish there was more with integration in landscape."

   "question_text": "Comment on the most and least valuable aspects of the studio",
   "comments": [
    "In my previous academic education I have done projects based more on intuition and artistic sense.Therefore this studio, research-based with systematic approach, was a little challenging to me - I had to shift away from some of those stereotypes.I would like to emphasize the great amount of time and effort that Professor Perry devoted to my desk-crits, helping me to become more flexible.I think I have come a long way, but there is still more work to be done on my own.",
    "Most valuable part may be desk-crits since we spent most of our time on it. The lack of pin\u0097ups and input from outside experts reflects the lack of choreography of the studio in general.Juries for mid\u0097term and final reviews are quite helpful too because many of them are intelligent and sharp. Their criticism usually touches crucial point of the project although some of them seems less relevant and more willful.",
    "We should have pin-ups as the whole studio at least once a month. DI wanted to discuss about the each student's concept, progress, and outputs through the pin-ups. The desk crits are good for us to save a time for preparation, but I think lots of students did not manage their time well.",
    "The lack of pinups and class discussions was very detrimental to the class and the projects as a whole. We only had 3 of which one was for the precedent analysis, one the midterm and one final review. Students were not able to rehearse ideas about the project nor did they have the opportunity to hear a third party's review as ideas were being tested.The studio trip was very poorly organized and with the exception of the site visit, did not in any way inform the subject matter of the studio.",
    "Desk Crits:Chris was always available for desk crits, which allowed him to asses to each individual\u0092s ideas.Pinups:Although we had a series of pinups at the very beginning, Chris gave us the option to choose between desk crits and pinups as forms of review. The majority, including me, chose the desk crit option.Juries:The diversity of juries, available through Chris and YSOA was probably the most beneficial aspect of the studio. Having such diversity allowed me to consider my project from many different and un-biased perspectives.Studio Trip:Unfortunately, we couldn\u0092t attend to some of the events we had originally planned. For instance, situations of political upheaval and other events that were out of the Professor\u0092s grasp prevented us from going to the Frac. Nonetheless, there was always an effort from the Professor to make them happen. I believe the visit to various locations in France-Villa Savoye, Parc della Villete, Pompidou and the final visit to CERN in Switzerland were and will always be of great value to me.Outside experts:Chris extended the invitation (to those interested) to attend his seminar and listen to experts in some of the subjects we covered in class.",
    "We probably should have had more pinups. I found the studio crits to be very helpful and Chris was available for a large amount of time which was very helpful. It would have been nice to have other crits and pinups with outside or other yale professors other than just at the mid-term and final."

   "question_text": "Discuss the main strengths and weaknesses of the studio as a pedagogical tool",
   "comments": [
    "I liked the succession of the design stages that we had: research on precedents, research on the given institution, and finally, proposal.Although it\u0092s extremely hard to embrace all these design stages within 3 months, I would probably adjust the schedule so that there was little more time for design, less for the research.",
    "Sedule of the studio barely exists. Specific time frame and deadlines are missed. Time spent on precedent study are too long and actually not as much helpful for final project. The trip to Paris and Geneva has a loose itinerary and students spent most of their time wandering around the city when they should get access to materials they usually don\u0092t.Production part went quite well, thanks to the instructor\u0092s being in studio every Monday and Thursday, available for desk\u0097crits and consultation.",
    "Throughout the semester, Chris avoided to talk about the form and aesthetic. He taught us to make all decisions based on the performance. The anti-spatial process was not comfortable to go through at the beginning, but I was able to find an interest on the architecture and aesthetic driven by technology at the end.",
    "The strengths of this course were found on the vast amount of information and readings (relevant to the project and the character of the site) provided by the professor from the beginning, which as it usually happens in many studios, was only assimilated by those who were interested in learning from these.The weakness I found in this studio was probably the lack of interest by some of the students in the class, which only made me wonder how different the environment could had been if they were more or equally motivated.",
    "main strenghts were the integration of the systems and transportational infrastructure within the project. I think more emphasis on the creation of architectural spaces and the quality of those spaces would have been helpful. I think that the project at times might have been too broad and focusing on the architectural elements and how people interact with those spaces would have been valuable."

   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this studio and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "Since this kind of approach to design have been unfamiliar to me, I didn\u0092t have a very particular expectations, except the intention to broaden my professional erudition.I think in this way the studio was very important and useful to me. Most of the things learned here were new to me.",
    "The studio went well on general. My expectations are basically met. The discourse of system, futurism and technology are not my major interest, but fairly interesting. The process of the studio is not so intense, rather casual and not so organized. I wish more time is spent on the study of the site before the studio trip, and more specific criticism could be given to students.",
    "My expectation of this studio was foreseeing architectural of the future. Since I did not get a clear understanding on the technology \/ system of the future, my project ended up as a futuristic architectural image based on the current technologies.",
    "From the very beginning I felt enthusiastic about taking this studio because of the site and the syllabus that Chris Perry presented.I knew it could allow me with an opportunity to continue exploring some concepts I was exposed to during the previous semester. At all times, I sought to take the fullest advantage of everything I was presented, from readings, to criticism on my drawings and models, to even undergo substantial changes that I knew would improve the overall direction of my project after midterms. In the end, I was very satisfied with my results for the final review, same as for the level of the discussion and the comments and criticism I received."

   "comments": [
    "I think that the most important aspect for the studio head is being able to give a lot of time to a student,if needed.I\u0092m thankful to Professor Perry for working with me really intensely.I also appreciate, that at our request our professor brought a specialist in computer design, who answered all the questions concerning modeling, rendering and other computer techniques as we went further with the project.I would like to thank professor Perry for this challenging and nice studio.I also would like to thank the digital design specialist Justin.",
    "Studio instructor is very committed to the studio and his availability is very much appreciated. He spent a lot of time on the studio and each desk\u0097crit is long and thorough. However, the lack of organization of the studio as a process is a little problematic, eventually results in less yield than it should be.Chris is a very sophisticated theorist and a strong designer. I think a more rigorous approach of management and leadership will be helpful in his future teaching and practice.Assistant teacher Justin Snider is helpful in terms of technical issues such as rendering and digital design software. However, his attempt to criticize students\u0092 projects is rather odd since he is brought in later on as a technical consultant rather than a teaching assistant. His role is not clear in terms of that. I think he can contribute more if he can concentrate on the technical problem- solving.",
    "He was very friendly and approachable throughout the semester. It was also very nice that Chris stayed up late until 11 pm to discuss about each student\u0092s project individually.However, the directions he gave to each student were all very similar, and we would like to have unique instructions according to each student\u0092s interest.",
    "Chris Perry was encouraging and supportive.He made himself available for desk reviews and stayed with the student until that student seemed to have a clear way of proceeding.However, his availability was more often than not after studio hours or on alternate days. He was often late to class. His availability outside of studio time (when was often absent) was problematic in that it burdened the students ability to concentrate on all of their classes, and often inhibited them from attending lectures.",
    "Chris Perry is a very knowledgeable Professor. He has always been available for mentoring and advice, and many of the conversations we had about my project extended to very broad areas of the discipline, far from what one may think is his field of expertise.These desk crit conversations, his comments (which were non-generic and particular to the development of my project) and his open perspective allowed my project to incrementally extend from only abiding to the initial agenda and subsequently evolve it into a more rigorous and rich project in both the pragmatic and rhetorical senses. I was very satisfied with having Chris Perry as an instructor and with the project I had throughout the semester, as well as in the end.The presence of the Teaching Assistant was little in the case of my project, but nonetheless useful from time to time.",
    "I found Chris to be very open and knowledgeable about his aesthetic and pedagogical agenda. The variety of projects and aproaches within the studio are indicative of this. A a majority of the projects were applying sustainable systems in the same manner and there could have been more variety or exploration in the development of these systems. The seemed to be a simal resolution of these systems for all the projects.Justin was very helpful with the digital aspects of the studio, glad to have him there."
