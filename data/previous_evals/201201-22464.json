   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in writing fiction.",
    "TAKE.",
    "Obviously take it if you get in. Cunningham is both incredibly sweet and incredibly helpful as an editor. You'll be a better writer at the end of it.",
    "Absolutely. Why not?",
    "It was incredibly rewarding to write two short stories, and revise one, this semester. Michael Cunningham is one of the most enthusiastic, wise, encouraging people I have ever met. It was a gift to take this class with him. Writing the short story is incredibly difficult, and it does get a little frustrating, trying to put as much effort as possible into these short stories while balancing the rest of the work of the semester. All in all though, a wonderful class. The other students also often had insightful, useful comments--and Michael Cunningham's comments also are invaluable!",
    "An opportunity to improve one's fiction writing in a supportive, critical, empowering environment. I would definitely recommend this class, as the instructor's attitude, that anyone can learn to write, and write well, permeates the course. It is motivating, and you will definitely see the results if you apply yourself.",
    "Awesome workshop. I would absolutely recommend taking this course. Probably the best class I've taken at yale. Michael Cunningham is helpful and wonderful.",
    "If you're looking for a creative writing workshop, you've come to the right place. Michael Cunningham is a great instructor: funny, kindly, charming, and helpful. If you've taken Reading Fiction for Craft, though, be aware that this really is a different class. You'll get less lecture\/teaching\/directed exercises and more general discussion about stories written by your peers. Still, definitely a course worth taking. (I mean, your homework is reading and critiquing stories. If you're a writer, you can't really complain about that.)",
    "It is a workshop, so a lot depends on what you and others bring to the table. Cunningham, though, is excellent. He is very wise about writing that is not his, knowing, sometimes miraculously, exactly what the writer needs to do to it. And his recent choice to require revisions at the end of the semester was a good one - it forced me to seriously revisit a piece, something I've never had to do before, which was very good for me."
