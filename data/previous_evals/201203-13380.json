    "Major English Poets: Chaucer to Donne shows you how the English language transitioned from the Middle Ages to the 1600s. You get a good sense of how English has changed and how words operate. The readings are sometimes dry, but taking English 125 will help you to become a close reader, which is essential to anything else you do in the English department, or at Yale.",
    "Take English 125 with Professor Minnis! Among the four poets -- Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, and Donne -- you are guaranteed to find at least one who really clicks with you. I honestly loved all the texts. Our discussions in class were fascinating and we were really given the chance to work through our interpretations aloud and together. Professor Minnis is incredible, kind, and funny, and he cares so deeply about this material that his enthusiasm is infectious. He has high expectations on the papers, but that's appropriate since this is the prereq for the English major. Take this class!!!",
    "English 125 is the first half of Major English Poets, the English major prerequisite. The reading is awesome, and I'm very glad I took it. Donne, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Chaucer--I deeply enjoyed reading and thinking about all of them. Would I have taken this if it weren't a major prereq? Debatable. But I'm glad I did. While the readings are good, the class can sometimes drag by. Many people don't do the reading, so the discussion can easily be dominated by a select few. But if you put in the time, go to office hours, and spend time thinking about your papers, you will, I believe come away with at least a small knowledge of why these poets are brilliant.",
    "English 125 is a fairly intensive, yet friendly introduction to high-level poetic criticism: it not only emphasizes close readings of some of the most complex texts of the English canon, but also focuses on improving students' writing skills. While ENGL 125 focuses mostly on older English texts, do not think the class is at all antiquarian: we read modern criticism that provides a fresh approach to these old texts, ranging from queer theory readings of Shakespeare to Lacanian readings of Chaucer. Highly recommended for students who think they have sufficient English background, and wish to take their reading and writing to the next level, whether or not they are prospective English majors.",
    "Yes, even for a non-English major. But I would warn that what you get out of the class is highly dependent on who your professor is.",
    "I feel somewhat neutral about recommending this class. I don't see any reason for a student to avoid taking it; the workload is manageable, the professor was kind, and the material is good. However, it definitely wasn't my favorite class this semester either. I'm glad I took the class, but I don't see any reason for someone to go out of their way to take it unless they have an expressed interest in poetry or majoring in English.",
    "I wouldn't have taken this course if it weren't a requirement, but it is about as delightful a requirement as one can find. The readings can feel dull or tired or hackneyed, but class discussion and constant paper-writing encourage students to dig deeper and find their point of interest in the text. We had two 3-page papers, two 5-page papers, one 8 page paper, and a final. Professor Minnis is incredibly encouraging and a wonderful instructor. Despite my initial dread, I came to really enjoy this class.",
    "A great course for those looking for an introduction to some great poets, especially Chaucer.",
    "125 is certainly not painful, considering it is a required class for the English major. I enjoyed learning about Chaucer and studying Shakespeare and Donne, but Spenser is a little dry. You should definitely take it with Professor Minnis, he has a lot to offer in terms of supplementary material and is a really kind and intelligent professor to boot.",
    "The syllabus isn't quite as pleasant an experience as 126, unless you're a fan of Spenser or Chaucer. That said, Minnis is a laid-back professor with great knowledge of these poets, particularly Chaucer, his area of expertise.",
    "Only take it if you have to. Material can be dry. Beware former DS-ers who will bring up the Iliad every chance they get."
