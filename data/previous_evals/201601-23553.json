    "Take with Juliana if you can!! She is incredibly animated and so much fun to listen to, which really helps bridge the gap between listening to a language you don't fully understand and comprehending it in real time. She is actively engaged with her students, inside and outside the classroom, and reaches out to you whenever she feels you need help, need to talk, etc. The instructor will make or break you in Span 120, so do yourself a favor and make sure you find a good instructor like Juliana!",
    "It is an intensive, every single day of the week class. It can be draining, and sometimes it just feels like you are just trying to scrape by by doing the minimum of homework each day. But ultimately I think it was a good class and I would recommend it.",
    "Avoid like the plague. Just take Indo",
    "This class is tedious and can be a pain, especially because you have work due every day of the week. However, you learn a lot and with a good professor it can be pretty fun.",
    "Straightforward language learning class. Compared to 110 I think there was a little bit more group activity, and some (very) short (like, one page) readings toward the end. Steady workload, but not difficult--just requires a decent amount of time. Take it with Juliana if you can!!! She's the best. So inspiring, funny, interesting, and all around a glorious queen.",
    "I would recommend it to another student, I thought it was an interesting class that really improved my language skills. Spanish is a lot of work and involves a lot of memorizing of the material which can be tedious at times.",
    "SPAN 120 is beautifully organized and transparent, and this is such a godsend. I learned so much, and definitely feel more in control of casual conversation\/reading than I ever would have expected from just 1 year. That being said, it's also a ton of work. I often felt overwhelmed when I got back late at night and had to do work for spanish, which is every day. If you decide to take it, choose Juliana. She loves her job like no professor I've ever met. She's always accessible for office hours, goes out of her way to speak to students out of class, is always prepared to teach, and gives great explanations. The only issue is that she often allows class to slip 5-10 minutes late, which can be difficult if you have class far away.",
    "Yo lo recomendara esta clase a personas que quiere tomar mas clases de Espaol.",
    "Great course, mostly because of Juliana! She is fantastic, take it with her if you can. She made class fun and engaging every day and has so much energy. Her pace is also perfect, challenging but not too rigorous."
