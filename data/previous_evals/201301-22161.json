    "Very interesting material, but taking it with Chevalier was a superb experience. She is an amazing professor. Her presentations were always on point, funny, and engaging. Also she is a wonderful person to reach out to--very responsive to her students.",
    "Really interesting class, great for senior econ majors. Professor Chevalier is really great. Her comments are always sharp and interesting, and she really cares about her students.",
    "Absolute must. Its a great class for anyone interested in the tech industry, the business of tech or policy related to tech.",
    "Definitely the best choice among the various choices for spring senior econ seminars. Professor Chevalier is so smart, but she also is an easy person to relate to, and she does a great job of conveying the information to students in a way they can understand and appreciate. The workload is not too bad, 2-3 papers each week, a presentation on one of the papers one week, a response paper on another, and the final paper, which is on a topic of your choosing and really lets you dedicate as much time as you want on that topic, which should hopefully be something interesting to you.This class is also one of the few classes which will force you to brush up on your econometrics skills, as many of the papers you read have regressions and all that good stuff, which can be a helpful refresherif you plan on including that stuff in your final paper. It's also just nice to read academic economic papers to see the methodologies they use and the interesting results they get.I highly recommend this course. Fair workload, great professor, interesting topics. Perfect combo for a senior seminar",
    "Yes, I would recommend it! Good econ seminar surrounding very relevant topics on the economics of broadband infrastructure, network management\/net neutrality, externalities and welfare created by the rise of networks in the modern age. Very interesting subject and extremely relevant now. Professor Chevalier is also very knowledgeable and helpful. Workload consists of leading a class, a two-page reading response, and a final paper (12 pages).",
    "Definitely one of the better seminars offered. It's a great syllabus and Chevalier is an amazing professor. You should have some interest in the material, but prior knowledge is not really required. The readings are interesting and make the few assignments very enjoyable.",
    "Lot of interesting material, and the professor really knows what's going on. Unfortunately there wasn't a whole lot of incentives to pay attention or read the articles, which may be a positive or a negative depending on what you're looking for.",
    "Good second semester senior economics seminar with a professor who is willing to meet outside class to discuss any questions you have. Good diversity of topics. Start your paper early.",
    "Take it! Not to stressful, but you'll learn a ton without having to struggle through anything too dry!",
    "It's very interesting if you're interested in the economics of information. Every student has to present on one of the readings once over the course of the semester, and then do a final paper and presentation at the end of the semester. You can probably only get in if you're a senior Econ or EPE major. Very interesting topics, and Professor Chevalier is incredibly helpful and approachable."
