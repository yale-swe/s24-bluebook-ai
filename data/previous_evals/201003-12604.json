   "comments": [
    "If you want to beef up your Russian skills and know how to speak well, then this class is absolutely necessary. Lots of reading and writing practice",
    "I would recommend it, but just make sure to speak with the professor beforehand.",
    "This class does exactly what it promises to: teaches non- or semi-literate native Russian speakers how to read and write. I couldn't even write my name the first day, but by the end of the semester I was able to write compositions (character comparisons, chapter summaries, etc.) of several pages and do dictations. Grading isn't too tough, although the work can pile up, especially if you never studied at a Russian school. Try to keep up with everything, and you'll do fine and your Russian WILL improve a great deal. Julia is fun and pretty easy-going. Definitely a useful class!",
    "I would definitely recommend Russian for Bilingual Students to all native speakers. I was on the fence myself in the beginning of the year because I was at a lower level than the other students in the course, but Professor Titus really makes an effort to help everyone individually. The grading for the course is not based on performance compared to others, but rather based on progress over the term. However, this course requires a lot of work and dedication. There are many workbook assignments, readings in the books, and essays\/summaries assigned for each class period. However, Professor Stuart is lenient with deadlines.",
    "I will recommend this course to a fellow student who is Russian and wants to improve their skills.",
    "This was a good course, but I don't feel that I learned as much as I should have. It's great that the professor focuses on everyone's individual needs as much as she can, but the class has such a huge spectrum of abilities and knowledge that it's hard to administer to everyone equally. The course is best for students who don't know too much grammar, for example those who don't even know how to write. The reading and homework is very light and interesting.",
    "It is a good course to strengthen Russian skills for native Russian speakers who are not perfect. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes I would recommend, its very flexible and interesting - a midway between a grammar and a literature course."
