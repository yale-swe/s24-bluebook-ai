   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend. Pretty easy. You will have 6 pop quizzes (all of which will be towards the end of the semester, but you'll be forced to come to each class thinking there will be one.) Make sure not to miss them because making them up is kind of burdensome. You can also drop one, which is nice although they're extremely straightforward and you will absolutely know the answer if you even skimmed the reading for that day. The only other assignment is a 12 page paper on the topic of your choice, which is probably something you're already used to doing. DeCanio is awesome and has a great sense of humor. His lectures are actually enjoyable and engaging. He has trouble responding to emails in a timely manner, if at all, so always make sure to follow up.",
    "An interesting class yet dry for students who aren't interested in the details of voter engagement and elite manipulation in politics.",
    "`,THANKS,`SUPER EBAYER `,HIGHLY RECOMMEND,`*; 5 STARS",
    "While not the best course I have taken at Yale, Public Opinion was relatively interesting and the course load was almost non-existent. Not an automatic A, but not super challenging either.",
    "Nope.",
    "I would 100% recommend PLSC 249 to another student. Public opinion is one of the most important aspects of politics today, and the course is wonderfully taught.",
    "Not a course about the generation of public opinion. Instead, Decanio focuses on the twin challenges to democracy that 1) voters are hugely ignorant and cannot possibly be making informed decisions on the complex workings of government, and 2) politicians don't really care what voters think anyways.",
    "Great professor. Lecture can be very engaging and foster great conversation (no laptops\/electronics). However, it can become slow at times, as students go off on tangents\/various conversations. Prof. DeCanio is a great lecturer. Be sure to do the assigned readings, in the case of a possible quiz at the beginning of class.",
    "Recommend",
    "yes, take it if you want to know more about the science behind the voting system in America. Easy going class, with lots of interesting readings.",
    "I would only recommend PLSC 249 to poli sci majors (or other majors) who are specifically interested in learning about public opinion in a low stress setting. If not, you probably won't enjoy this class. The final paper is worth a huge amount of your grade and the rest of the grade makeup is five quizzes and section participation.",
    "Good class",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Literally the most boring, poorly organized poli sci lecture at Yale. We have gotten ZERO grades back by the end of the semester (our only assignments were a paper due at the end of the semester and pop reading quizzes we didn't get until the last week of class). Prof. DeCanio is arrogant and wastes most of class time talking about random things. Very little work, but even so, not worth the aggravation.",
    "I would recommend this as a fifth class probably. As my fourth class, I didn't spend very much time on the readings, and the final paper is only 12 pages long. This is definitely a very interesting, relevant topic, but the class itself is much more of a survey course and does not delve into the specific research results or theories behind each reading.",
    "Your grade is 20% participation, 20% pop quizzes (which are easy if you did the reading), and 60% your final paper. Professor DeCanio is hilarious. Take this course if you are willing to have your grade essentially ride on one final paper.",
    "A gut that's not really a gut... that I would not highly recommend.",
    "Great 5th class. You get what you put in.",
    "Low work, high reward class. Just be warned the final paper is worth a ton of your grade, so be prepared to put some serious time into that in the middle of finals. Professor DeCanio is great and I would highly recommend the class. I learned so much and the class is extremely thought provoking.",
    "Take this class. It is a relaxing class that is also deeply interesting and informative. Check check check.",
    "Intro to Public Opinion is a great class where students have the opportunity to learn about the role of public opinion in the context of American Government. Professor DeCanio is a great professor that teaches not only about the topic, but about life more broadly. I would definitely recommend this course to other students!",
    "It is a great first PLSC class. It is relatively low key, got",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES IVE TAKEN AT YALE. POSSIBLE THE BEST. AMAZING. overview of intro to pub opinion as name suggests. Topics include voting, elite manipulation, and voter ignorance. Thought provoking and interesting for anyone not even interested in political science because we all vote",
    "PLSC 249 discusses the role of public opinion in American politics. It delves into issues such as voter ignorance, elite manipulation, and the viability of voting as a democratic mechanism. I would definitely recommend this class to any other student.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. I think you learn more in just a week in this class form listening to Professor DeCanio speak than you do in an entire month of many other classes.",
    "Introduction to Public Opinion was a great course that effectively introduced students to the world of public opinion research and analysis. The syllabus was logically structured, the lectures were engaging, and the workload was very manageable (5 short quizzes, section participation, and a final paper worth 60%). I found the course thought-provoking and memorable, and would take it again in a heartbeat.",
    "DeCanio is adorably arrogant and loves to argue. This makes the lecture one giant section; youll have to figure out for yourself whether that works for you or not, but I thought it made the class highly entertaining."
