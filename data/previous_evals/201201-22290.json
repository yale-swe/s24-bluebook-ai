    "You're taking this because it's required, so it is really up to which section to take. Manish was great, a lot easier than the other's. The difficulty will also depend on how many people are in your class - we had a ton - so we only lectured once and then gave a group lecture.",
    "You have to take it for the math major. It was pretty enjoyable, and not too much work.",
    "Show up (if you want), give a lecture or two, learn a lot of math.",
    "You take this course if you have to for the math major, otherwise don't.",
    "It's not a satisfying class. Consider doing a reading project instead.",
    "Here is the information you are looking for: this lectures are divided among all the students in the class. There may or may not be homework or exams depending on the professor who leads the seminar. It is offered both semesters. If you are looking to minimize work, take the first semester one if more than half of the math majors are there. Take the second one otherwise.Manish was a great instructor, and was very enthusiastic about getting us to learn something, which is unusual in the math department.This class is poorly designed though. You have to take it (basically) but it will probably be a chore, and not a very satisfying capstone experience. The lectures are all given by students with varying degrees of math experience, and this leads to a lot of mediocre presentations and very little incentive to come to class.",
    "It is a required course. Make sure you prepare well in advance of your lectures (at least 2 weeks), get in a practice run in an empty classroom, and get any questions about the material take care of before you start."
