   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Good introduction into Korean. Covers more grammar and less vocabulary. The teacher tries to have you speak in class almost every day.",
    "I developed a pretty good starting knowledge of Korean. We practiced reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Given the short time we were able to accomplish a surprising amount as complete beginners to the language.",
    "This course has given me a new passion for language study that I had never been able to find before. In high school, getting through language courses was a complete chore. But in this class I learned to appreciate the work that goes into learning a new language, and it helped that the class was a very supportive, fun network.",
    "Besides gaining new language skills, I also was able to learn a lot more about a different culture that I would have otherwise not have been exposed to. I learned that engaging with my peers is a really great way to learn a language and gain good learning skills.",
    "I developed a really strong understanding of the foundations of the Korean language and culture! I really grew into a beginning speaker, writer, and reader of the Korean language.",
    "I learned Korean grammar and writing skills. The course was organized very well to maximize the learning experience and keep all students actively engaged in the material.",
    "Professor Lee Smith does a very good job about switching between reading, writing, and speaking korean. It's a very interactive, small environment where you can talk with partners a lot and speak with her directly. Overall, I developed my reading, writing, and speaking skills. There's also a high element of learning about korean culture as well; you'll get to learn a lot about pop culture, history, and traditions.",
    "I learned Hangul, the Korean writing system, and developed basic grammar and speaking skills. I feel confident enough to have basic conversations in Korean.",
    "Learned the basics of the Korean language; a great baseline for more advanced study.",
    "I learned a good deal of Korean grammar structures and vocabulary, more than I thought I could retain.",
    "I learned to be more bold in speaking in class and to not be afraid to make mistakes. I also learned more about my study habits and how to change them.",
    "I feel like I really learned a lot of Korean for only taking 1 term so far. The amount of grammar and vocab really exceeded my expectations and gave me a well-rounded experience in a new language.",
    "In a nutshell, the basics of the Korean language. From the Hangul alphabet, to everyday phrases and objects, important action words, conjugations, and grammar forms, this course provides students with a very good introduction to a very unique language. But most importantly, it gave me the skills necessary for me to independently continue learning Korean if I wished.",
    "Through this class, I learned the Korean alphabet and basic reading, writing and speaking skills. We were also asked to research parts of the Korean culture and that helped me learn more about the country's past and present.",
    "This was by far my favorite course of the year. Korean is a very fun language to learn and there are many resources to aid your studies. I learned basic grammar and vocabulary. I also learned a lot about Korean culture.",
    "I learned the first level of Korean."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The organization is not always clear. Assignments often were assigned last minute. Some of the grammar wasn't taught clearly. BUT if you ask follow-up questions, the teacher is great about answering quickly and clarifying.",
    "This course was incredibly fun and engaging. Professor Lee-Smith has to be one of the best teachers I've ever had. This class's main strength is how interesting it is and how well Professor Lee-Smith makes learning an enjoyable experience. I honestly cannot think of a weakness for this course.",
    "I don't know how to improve this course because honestly, it was the best language course I've ever had. STRENGTHS INCLUDE: great support from peers, TAs, and social networks, a lot of practice speaking and becoming more comfortable in conversation, and a healthy balance between Korean language learning and Korean culture learning.",
    "A lot of information is covered in just this one semester which allows for students to get to a point where they have more freedom with the language at an earlier time. I learned the grammatical ways to say things in Korean that took me multiple years to learn in high school language classes. There was a slightly smaller emphasis on speaking, however, but there was still speaking as well.",
    "I think at times, assignments could be given over a longer period of time. Usually, assignments are assigned in a timely manner, but we once only had a weekend for a long video assignment (during the week right before reading week, which is already really busy). I think if sometimes that was taken into account, it would be a bit better. But otherwise, everything in the class is amazing. The strengths of the class are that it's small, interactive, and incredibly accommodating of different levels of speakers and readers and writers.",
    "The strengths are the great professor, flow of the curriculum (material introduced in very methodical way), and focus on important concepts (we learned things in a foundational manner that allowed us to move along well). The only weakness could be class size as it was large for a language course, but even then it was still an intimate environment and the professor interacted with everyone.",
    "The small class size really makes your class grow closer together. Professor Lee Smith is amazing at really engaging her students and helping them improve without belittling them. The workload as well is very manageable and prepares you well for assessments. Occasionally the spacing of the listening assignments felt a little rushed to me. When we had to do 4 of them in a night, it was a little exhausting and could have easily been spread out through the weeks-long unit.",
    "Prof. Lee-Smith is phenomenal and by far makes the course a stand-out among the Yale (not just language) courses I have taken. She uses a variety of formats of activities, exercises, and teaching strategies to creatively reinforce grammar and skills learned in class. The one-on-one TA sessions are also very useful and low stress for improving spoken proficiency. If I had to point out a weak point in the course, I suppose it's just the pace; the course is very simple at first and accelerates quite quickly by the end.",
    "Strengths: The professor is amazing, the amount of work is far from unbearable and most of the times enjoyable, I looked forward to coming to class everyday, and it was a very comforting environment. Weaknesses: Really none, but over breaks and weekend honestly a little more work would have been nice, just to ensure I wouldn't forget anything.",
    "At times it seemed like just to be able to understand what was going on in class, one needed a whole lot more vocabulary than what had been taught. This was also sometimes the case for the tests, and is a little unfair. However, class is engaging and fun and welcoming, and tests only happen a few times.",
    "The class was very fun and accepting. Everyone was not judgmental and hardworking. I want to continue learning Korean.",
    "The main strength of the course was Prof. Lee-Smith. She was a wonderful instructor and made the class a positive learning environment for everyone. I really can't see any weaknesses from the course.",
    "I always struggled with listening and speaking Korean throughout the semester. It would have been very nice having been assigned partners with which we could practice speaking to outside of the classroom. I found that I was much more comfortable speaking one on one with people rather than in front of the whole class. And while I understand the importance of speaking in that setting, I felt that I learned the best speaking individually with people I was comfortable with. Other than that, I though the course was very well structured and facilitated my learning of Korean.",
    "The fact that we meet everyday is definitely a strenght of this class. Our instructor is wonderful and the class environment as a whole was welcoming and fun. I would not change anything about this class.",
    "There are no weaknesses regarding this course, only strengths. It is quite fast-paced, but the teacher and TA are very helpful. It is a very fun course and there is a lot of practice.",
    "Professor Lee-Smith is amazing. It could have gone a bit faster or focused on phrases more but overall It's really well done."

   "comments": [
    "Overall, good class and I feel I have a good introductory understanding after just 1 semester.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. If someone's looking to learn a new language, Korean is a great one to choose because it's interesting and it's designed to be easy to learn. Plus Professor Lee-Smith makes the experience amazing.",
    "If you're interested in Korean language study, you could not find a better place to start! You'll leave the semester having learned so much and excited for what future classes will bring!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. People may think that because it's an East Asian language with a different alphabet that it's just too difficult, but that's not true. The way the class is taught allows for learning to be fun and for students to learn a lot.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! If you want to learn Korean, this is an amazing place to start.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. Not only is the subject one that is important to learn, but the professor is truly amazing.",
    "I would strongly recommend Korean 110 to any student who has an interest in learning korean! The class is fun and fast paced, but starts very slow and gradually picks up from there. Professor Lee Smith is amazing and she helps students without embarrassing them. A lot of korean pop culture and history is also discussed, making the class more relevant and interesting. Workload is very manageable and the entire class becomes close, probably from meeting so frequently. Korean has been my favorite class this semester and made me want to get up every morning.",
    "If you're interested in Korean culture and the language, there's no reason to not take Korean at Yale. The program is wonderful in every way you could want: Professor Lee-Smith is kind, funny, engaging, and provides so much feedback on your work that you always know your weak points and what you can do to improve. The classroom has a great atmosphere and I never felt intimidated, even though some students come in with background knowledge. There are weekly one-on-one speaking sessions with a TA which were not only useful for improving spoken fluency, but also very fun! The workload is certainly not too much, and even then I feel like I learned so much more in this class with a lesser workload than I did in other courses with more work (i.e., the work you do is very effective for learning).",
    "Absolutely! This class started every day off on a high note.",
    "If you have the time to devote to this class then this class can be really fun and rewarding even if you are just trying to take care of the requirements. If you are short on time, it will be hard to succeed, though nevertheless fun.",
    "Yes Korean is a great language!",
    "If someone is looking for a fun interesting, language, I would definitely recommend this course. The professor is amazing, the course is very nicely organized, and you really feel like you have a solid grasp on the beginnings of a language.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they are even the slightest bit interested in Korea, Korean culture, etc. Once you get past the initial language \"hill\", Korean becomes increasingly easier to learn and in fact is very easy to pick up. It is also a very enjoyable language to learn as you can actually see how much you are improving. While it is a supposedly difficult language for native English speakers (and not as easy as say Spanish, Italian, etc.), it is surprisingly intuitive. But I did spend around three hours daily just on Korean, but this is standard with any language course. Also, (Professor Lee-Smith) makes sure to create a fun, friendly, and comfortable classroom environment to facilitate your Korean learning. I actually started off the semester with another language (French) and absolutely hated everything about it. So, at the recommendation of a friend, I decided to give Korean a try. was kind enough to let me join the class a week late and even helped me to catch up with the class. Looking back at it, changing from French to Korean was probably the best decision I made this semester. Learning Korean at Yale with is such a pleasant (and fun!) experience and I can honestly say that I have learned so much. Once again, I would highly recommend this course!!",
    "Yes! I think the class structure really facilitates the learning of a foreign language and makes you want to continue learning Korean. I always looked forward to going to that class.",
    "I would recommend this course, however you do need to invest a lot of time outside of the classroom to enhance your grasp of the language. It also doesn't hurt to already be exposed to Korea, K-pop, K-dramas, or Korean politics\/life.",
    "Yes this course is amazing. Take it if you are at all interested in Korean."
