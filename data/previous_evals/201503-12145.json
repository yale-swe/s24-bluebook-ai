    "Casey is an interesting beast, one that you will either love or hate. If you're looking for a capstone that will actually teach you things that you'll use in the real world, Casey's capstone is for you. You will not write papers or read books, but you will find yourself with interesting assignments like flipping through sex ads on Backpage or building an app (even though your quant\/tech skills are low-key almost nonexistent). Casey won't provide you with much guidance, and he'll make you work as a team. If you can handle that, then by all means I would recommend Casey's capstone above all others. He's a fun and funny guy with unprecedented amounts of knowledge about super random things. Take it.",
    "I would summarize it as a consulting experience with a public sector client, though our team had two principal clients: IST Research and the FBI. The idea is to bring outside perspective and approach to a challenge facing those clients. For the difference in classroom experience that his provides, I would absolutely recommend it to another student. The capstones vary a great deal though, so beyond my experience in Casey's class I think it's worthwhile to note that not everyone left the capstone satisfied with the outcome (or with a real outcome to speak of). Our team with Casey was somewhat unique in terms of the practical deliverables we achieved.",
    "Well taking this class isn't really a choice, but I would recommend it nonetheless. It is very different from anything else I've taken at Yale--highly unstructured and driven by student effort. You end up learning a lot about how to work with a team, set your own deadlines, and bring interesting deliverables from conception to execution. Casey is great.",
    "You will produce something you're proud of that has actual impact. We identified leads of human trafficking for the FBI which is a heck of a lot more fulfilling than the usual written report \/ thesis I expected. That being said - this may be one of the most frustrating classes you'll take at Yale. Let's just say there's a lot of team bonding, not out of fun times but out of tough times. Choose wisely.",
    "GLBL 499 04 was a really enjoyed the chance to work on a real issue, and the community that formed within the students was invaluable. However, carefully consider taking it with Prof. King - he's very entertaining and has great insights, but is not the best in delivering appropriate guidance and fostering a good class dynamic.",
    "Well, if you're a global affairs major, you have no option but to take the capstone. The nature of your project and your interaction with your instructor will vary depending on the assignment and the instructor. Be ready and willing to work as a team and give your best to whatever it is."
