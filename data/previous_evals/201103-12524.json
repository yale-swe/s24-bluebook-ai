    "Math 230 is the intro calc\/linear algebra course for math (and related) majors. I would encourage all prospective math majors to take this course. Even those who have seen much of the material in computational linear algebra\/multivariate courses will, in almost all cases, find themselves engaged in math 230 as the rigor of the course is beyond that in analogous courses at most other universities. Topics include the Heine-Borel and Bolzano Weierstrass theorems, Cauchy sequences, inverse\/implicit function and constant rank theorems, basic topological spaces, and characterizations\/properties of manifolds in addition to all the standard linear algebra and calculus material. Problem sets are lengthy, perhaps even reaching 20 hours per week in some cases, but tend to contain interesting problems and aid one's understanding of the material. It is also entirely possible to take this course concurrently with a more advanced course for those with strong backgrounds who'd like to see topics beyond calculus and linear algebra but not give up the good treatment of the latter this course affords (cf. math 301 and math 350).",
    "A difficult, proof-based introduction to linear algebra and differential calculus. Take it if you like theoretical math! Very different from solving problems like you would in math 230 -- we are hardly ever required to do calculations that could be done by a computer.",
    "Math 230 is possibly the most work of any class at Yale. It is a whirlwind of new concepts and approaches to doing math. Its strength is that it is a seriously thorough and engaging treatment of linear algebra and multivariable calculus for math majors, with some topology and analysis sprinkled in. The fact that it is proof-based sets it apart from other multivariable calculus courses; it's a different beast entirely. The workload was massive; I enjoyed the problems but didn't enjoy the stress of the weekly deadline. If you want to major in math and are ready to contribute some serious time to the course, it is a good choice. You do not need multivariable or linear algebra experience as a prerequisite, but many kids do so you will be playing catch-up if you don't. However, it is very manageable. Though you will sometimes feel like you are failing out of the course (you will actually feel this often), it is graded very generously and if you do the work (which is no small achievement\u0097an number of kids gave up on it partway through the semester) you will do at least decently. Not for the faint of heart, or kids not interested in majoring in math or physics!",
    "Math 230 is a very difficult and work-heavy class. You will never be bored in this class. The material is challenging, but the pace of class and the level of homework provide most of the difficulty. Homework routinely goes above and beyond material that is needed for exams.",
    "Math 230 in a nutshell is hell if you don't like math, and pretty close to hell if you do. If you want to become a math major, this is a right of passage. Trust me, it will be painful, and very frustrating at times. The syllabus says you will spend about 8 hours a week on homework, but this is a lie. The first three weeks I spent anywhere between 19-26 hours a week on homework assignments. After that I got it down to an average 10-14 hours. Either way, it is A LOT of work and a big time commitment. Here is the plus side, it is extremely rewarding. You end up learning so many new concepts and cool applications. At the end of the day, after turning in an assignment, you feel good that you made it through. And, believe it or not, you will come out ten times smarter than when you came in. This course pushes you to your limits and will really test you to see if you are ready for a math major. So I would recommend this to any prospective math (or physics) major. One word of advice- WORK WITH OTHER PEOPLE. This course is near impossible (unless you are a completely math genius) to complete on your own. I found that working in a group on the problem sets was extremely helpful and helped me get through some rough weeks of work. All in all a great experience!",
    "Math 230 is a super-rigorous approach to calculus and linear algebra. Do not expect to use the material covered here; there is almost no practical application covered, nor are there many useful formula. This is not a good substitute for MATH 225(or 222)\/250.If, however, you're one of the olympiad-wininning geniuses that want to be prepared to jump into real analysis, take it by all means. The class becomes very cohesive (we had a facebook group and weekly study sessions in Bass, among other things) and you'll get a lot out of it I think.",
    "Math 230 covers multivariable calc and linear algebra rigorously (with proofs). Learning to write proofs is a main point of this class.This class is a lot of work. It should be worth 1.5 credits.",
    "If you did very well in Calculus BC, I'd say you're eligible to take this class. If you took any multivariable calculus (even looked at a book for a week or so) you'd be pretty set. The best preparation for this class, by far, is linear algebra. That said, you also need to be willing to put in up to 24 hours a week for the problem set. I'd never done any true proof-based mathematics before, and the second problem set took me about a cumulative day for that reason. It gets easier, though, as you get used to thinking about proofs. It was a lot of work, but Math 230 was probably the best class I've ever taken. If you want to be a math major, you should definitely take this class. If you don't want to be a math major but still enjoy math, consider it seriously. Shop it. It's extremely rewarding and a true test of your abilities.",
    "MATH 230 is an intense introduction to upper-level math.. But homeworks are not impossible; simply start the p-sets early (i.e., not the night before) and seek out help from the TF and professor. It will all make sense in the end.If you're passionate for math and put the time in, easily one of the best courses at Yale. TAKE IT.",
    "This is a freshman math course for those interested in pursuing math as a major. A tremendous quantity of homework, usually around 8-10 but occasionally as high as 20 hours per week. The class covers linear algebra and its usefulness to differential calculus. It is a bunch of Good Stuff to Know, for a math major.",
    "If you are thinking about majoring in math or think you might enjoy a proof-based class, you should take this class. That being said, it is hard. The first few problem sets took about 30 hours each, but by the end, I could do them in about half that time. Some students are much more prepared than others and it usually shows. I just finished Calculus BC so I had a little catching up to do, but nothing unmanageable. Also Asaf is cool and it is fun bonding with classmates over shared torture. All in all, I would recommend this class.",
    "I came into this course thinking that I was fully prepared. I was not. I was under the impression that I was good at math: everything in high school came very easily to me and my senior year, I took a class that essentially Calc BC with an extra semester or so of material. I quickly learned that I was not good at math. My level of comprehension the first few weeks was minimal at best. But I decided to stick with it, and I'm glad I did. The work level and pace are both extremely high, but it is by far the most rewarding course I have ever taken. If you really really like math, take this class.",
    "This class is a lot of work. Expect to spend 15+ hours weekly doing the problem sets, going to review sessions, etc. There is a strong emphasis on proofs rather than calculations, and you will learn quite a bit of math. Taking this course requires making a strong commitment, since it is so different from the other introductory math courses. I took this class as the recommended co-requisite for Physics 260. My advice is not to do this. It's not necessary, and the workload and difficulty of this course is highly disproportionate to its benefit unless you intend to become a math major.",
    "If you really love proof-based math, you don't have many options other than Math 230. It's really hard, but not completely unmanageable. Take this if you're a math genius. If you're not a math genius, definitely befriend a math genius.",
    "This class manages to cover light topology, some integral concepts at the base of multivariable calculus and all of linear algebra using a long-forgotten technique that other classes I have taken avoid--homework. Homework is essential to this class, since most of the learning takes place in exploring new concepts in homework, discussing homework solutions with others and gleaning insights on homework problems from the TA. I cannot overemphasize how important the 12-hour problem set each week is for this class. My blatant disregard for it during some parts of the semester was highly regrettable.That said, one should not view attending classes as unimportant. After all, it is during the classes the topics are introduced, important theorems are proved and the amazing Professor Hadari teaches.",
    "Math 230 is not a class. Math 230 is a lifestyle. I believe the syllabus said to expect 8 hours of homework a week from this class. This is a massive understatement. I easily spent 20-25 hours a week on it. Math 230 was practicallya full-time job.It was a fantastic class. We learned linear algebra and multivariable calc in all its glorious generality. We were not playing with mathematical toys and were able to prove some very deep and beautiful results.It seems this class is taught by someone different every year, so hope you get a good professor.",
    "So difficult! I recommend it to anyone who is strongly considering math as a major; however, with that said, it is not a course to go into without understanding its rigor and demands. The psets took anywhere from 12 to 25 hours a week and were extremely challenging. The course challenges you r way of thinking and can be extremely frustrating most of the time. However, if you are in the class, the professor understands the rigor so you will pass, failing out shouldn't be a worry. But don't underestimate the intensity!!! If you don't have time and\/or patience for a course like this, it is not for you.",
    "Math 230 is a very, very difficult class. You learn a lot and get used to proving everything. It is not high school Math...it's much more work. You have to be willing to put in a lot of time to the class, but you will definitely learn and get a lot of practice doing math.Bottom line: take it if you really like math and you're willingto put in the work (a lot of work).",
    "Math 230 is a proof based introduction to multivariable calculus and linear algebra. I would recommend it to anyone who is really interested in math and has time to devote to it. The course really gets at understanding, not just memorizing or learning how to do something, so it probably isn't the best choice for someone who is learning the material just to apply it to something. It requires a lot of work, but if you are interested in the material, it's fun and rewarding.",
    "If you think you're smart and have good study skills, this course is the one for you.If you appraise yourself merely smart (my case), you'll probably do just fine too.Warning: workload is heavy and stressful at times.7.5\/10.",
    "I'd recommend it only for very talented and dedicated students, and even then, only if it's your hardest class."
