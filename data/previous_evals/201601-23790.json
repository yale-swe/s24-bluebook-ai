    "Practical approach to learning about leadership - by participating in class exercises, planning the class trips, visiting eminent leaders from diverse backgrounds in DC and New York. The small class size also allows for robust discussion and building valuable relationships with your classmates and the professor.",
    "I learned more from the field trips than I thought I would. I don't think leadership can be taught, but interesting to see some different styles and pick people's brains.",
    "Meeting interesting speakers in DC & NYC, and getting professional advice from them.",
    "Student presentations on leadership topics.",
    "It offers opportunities to interview leaders in different environmental industry and learn about leadership through their stories. It is very inspiring.",

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "The teacher's teaching style can be a bit boring at times. It would have helped to have a structured powerpoint prepared instead of having random anecdotes. I sometimes came out of classes not entirely sure what I've learned. I'm also not sure why we learned the parlamentary procedure. Is that something NGOs and companies use a lot?",
    "The course covered several issues\/topics related to leadership, it would have been great to have an introductory lecture by the professor for each topic before the discussions (this was done for some but not all topics) A lot of class time was spent on planning the field trips (it is part of the requirements) but perhaps this can be streamlined and some of the discussion\/planning be shifted to email communications. We addressed several leadership issues and approaches in our class exercises, discussions and trips to DC and NY. However, some more time should have been dedicated to leadership theory - different types of leadership, etc. Some of the speakers we met expected us to have some of this theoretical knowledge as well.",
    "For a course on leadership where students take on various roles to plan field trips, it is not set up to let students thrive as part of team. Decision making is the biggest challenge - many things are discussed in planning the field trips, but it is totally unclear how decisions are made and what aspects of the trips are up to students to decide.",
    "The emphasis on running a meeting and planning the two field trips dominates the course. These items should\/could be supplement to perhaps comparative critiques of Leadership Theory.",
    "I recommend that a field trip\/ team-working event should be organized at the beginning of the semester so that candidates in this course can know better about each other. And this event\/ field trip could be very helpful for the planning of other field trip.",
    "Deeper discussion on each topic."

    "I think this course is a nice complement to my other more academic coursework in that it provides professional development skills for students who take it. I tend to forget that an MEM degree is a professional degree, and it is important for me to focus on developing career skills in addition to accruing knowledge in a certain environmental sector."

I initially thought it's a waste of time to organize the trip in a group but it did turn out to be really great.",
    "Advantages: team spirit and the general enjoyment that comes from working with peers on a project. Disadvantages: the usual conflicts in scheduling that arise when busy students are working together outside of a class. Thankfully a lot of our work on the projects could be done remotely, so that helped."

   "comments": [
    "Start the student presentations as early as possible! We had wayy to many lectures in the beginning and then barely time for the student presentations in the end.",
    "You will learn a lot of practical lessons about leadership and professional development. Since the class size is small, you will also have valuable interactions with your classmates and the professor and build strong relationships. The professor is very amicable and takes a keen interest in the students.",
    "Push for more clarity on goals and how decisions are made. The field trips are interesting and the work load is very light. You really learn from other students in this course",
    "Ask Chad and all the speakers you meet with a lot of questions. Think about your own strengths and weaknesses when you begin digging into the course material about leadership. I'm going to say it again because it's that important: ask all the speakers you meet with lots of questions--they have tons of knowledge and good advice!",
    "Look to engage with your peers in such a way that you all can push each other to improve your leadership qualities and capabilities. Be willing to have the courage to be vulnerable about what you dont know and use the time to cultivate a deeper understanding of your own leadership style, as well as an understanding of how different people approach different problems in different ways."
