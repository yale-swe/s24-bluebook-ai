    "I think this course is a helpful course for biologists to gain some insight and basic understanding of the methods used to model biological phenomena.",
    "Highly recommend it for students who want to get an idea of what kind of systems biology techniques exist out there and what kind of data we can get out of it. Don't recommend it to anyone expecting to learn how to program or to get really in depth into a specific biological pathway.",
    "Yes I definitely will.I would recommend it to a student who is interested in learning more about the interplay between experimental and computational techniques applied to systems biology, signal transduction pathways and protein-protein interactions. Also, the small class gives ample chance for the students to express their thoughts. Lastly, if you want to be introduced to a variety of techniques and write a grant proposal, this is the course to take!"

   "comments": [
    "It hasn't contributed to my research yet, but I would like to see if I can find a problem that can be answered with some of the approaches we learned in this class.",
    "My interests are in systems biology and synthetic biology and the use of experimental and computational techniques in exploring topics in these areas. But I have very little exposure. I have attended systems biology courses in Germany and I can say that this is a very unique course that gives me that opportunity to learn and gain knowledge of techniques that very intersection. It might not provide very hands-on experience, because I do not think that's the point and also it would be rather impossible to do sofor one semester for a seminar-style discussion. But precisely also because it is a seminar-style discussion, where current literature is being used as materials, I was being introduced to a lot more interesting aspects of systems biology."
