    "A fun class. I'd highly recommend it, particularly if you want to learn about personality politics. You'll learn bits about foreign policy decisions (and more if you do the reading), but do not expect to learn much about the domestic politics behind the decisions or to gain an understanding of significant events from class discussions. Also take it because Howard will challenge you to write in styles different from typical Yale seminars. He's wonderfully dedicated to the class, brings neat guest speakers, and tells the most unbelievable stories. Plus he's the fastest grader I've ever had.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who can get in. It's really interesting and doesn't require a huge amount of work. Governor Dean has a lot of strong opinions but he facilitates good class discussion despite having a clear bias. I doubt this class will revolutionize the way you think about things, but it's a fund place to have some good discussions with smart people.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale with the best professor I've had here at Yale. It's really a no-brainer, if you get into this course you must take it. He rejects a alarming amount of students since the course is so popular, and it is so for good reason. You discuss a book a week, and current events, with Howard Dean, who is just about the sweetest, most kind, caring, devoted professor I've had on campus. He takes the class to dinner multiple times a semester, and many of these dinners have special guests that are pretty well-renowned in their field. Highlights, aside from Howard himself, include a National Security Council simulation where everyone places a specific role and must solve a national emergency - it's basically a seminar-long Model UN committee with a crisis. Grading can be slightly tough so maybe start it out Credit D and see how you do on your first paper, but he lets you rewrite the first one for a higher grade. First paper is 2 pages, 2nd is about 5-10, and the last is usually 10-15 but this year he had us form 5 person groups and write a collective paper, with each person writing 5 pages to make a 25-page paper. So the writing intensity is not too bad, but the point is he really wants you to do well since grades aren't as important to him, and he emphasizes that many times. This is a wonderful class, you get to know a wonderful professor who tells you stories along the campaign trail and the people he's met, and every Political Science, Global Affairs, EPE, Humanities person out there should take this class - it's a life changer.",
    "Definitely recommend. The class is very interesting, Howard Dean is amazing, the class vibe is very chill, no section assholes. Overall, excellent class. Definitely recommend.",
    "Classic global course with a fun professor! Great booklist and fun dinners are an added bonus.",
    "If you get in, absolutely take it. This was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale -- awesome guest lecturers, not too much work, really interesting readings, and generally an awesome group of people. Howard is amazing (has so many fun stories and gets the class together for several class dinners -- we had Pepe's for our last seminar!) and really tries to get to know everyone. You have conversations about a different president every class, and it's stuff you'll want to bring back and talk to your friends about (as nerdy as that sounds). All in all incredible class.",
    "I would say that the class is an opportunity to learn about politics from a nationally prominent politician while building a basic understanding of how international events and strategies shape U.S. politics. I've heard other students describe it as \"book club with Howard Dean,\" although that may be a little generous since not very many students read the assigned books.",
    "This is a great course for understanding the unique approaches the past several presidents have adopted toward foreign policy. The readings are fascinating, as are the written assignments.",
    "The comment \"this is a book club with Howard Dean\" is the most accurate assessment ever. Really really fun course learned a ton from Howard (who's brilliant) and a group of awesome, tight-knit classmates. Take it if you can!",
    "If you get in, take it! Really interesting readings. The almost weekly dinners make for a great class dynamic which in turn makes for great discussions!",
    "This is a very good overview of various Presidents and their foreign policy. Greatly enjoyed the discussions. The guest speakers were also phenomenal. I do wish there were more discussions focusing on other regions of the world e.g. Africa, Asia, but in a semester-long course there are obviously limitations.",
    "The Politics of Foreign Policy with Governor Dean blends fun, politics, and foreign policy in a compelling and enjoyable way. The guest speakers are excellent, and Governor Dean's political insight helps refine your own thinking. The review from last year that described the class as \"book club with Howard Dean\" is pretty on. You look forward to going to class, and even the assignments tend to be interesting. I would definitely take this class if you get the chance!",
    "Global 388 is a seminar that discusses a different recent hot foreign policy issue (The Iran-Contra Deal, The Iran Deal, Bosnia-Kosovo) and the leader who dealt with it each class. Howard Dean facilitates each discussion and includes personal stories and expertise. This class is all \"applied\" rather than \"theory\"-based. I would recommend it if you love to talk about and debate foreign policy and already know a lot about the world and 20th century American history (or are willing to do some research)",
    "Solid above average seminar if only for Howard. Readings and discussion were slow at times or predicated upon prior knowledge rather than the readings, but how bad could 2 hours hanging out with Howard Dean be?"
