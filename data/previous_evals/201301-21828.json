    "Just take the class if you possibly can. Think experience of a lifetime, beyond anything you could ever hope for just at Yale.",
    "What an awesome experience. Obviously the trip to Ecuador is CLUUUTCH, but the whole concept behind the class is amazing. So amazing, in fact, that Carol got a paper published in Science just describing the class. The whole class is aimed at each student developing his own experiment. But science is full of dead ends. This class removed the dead ends and thus exposed us to the whole process of experiment development and realization.This class restored my faith in the sciences at Yale (which were pretty disappointing up to this point).",
    "An adventure of a lifetime, anyone who takes it is incredibly lucky, must be deduced and willing to put in time as effort, learn so much about aspects of research, and learn about an incredible group of people.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can. You won't get a chance like this ever again. Just remember that it is a ton of work even though it doesn't seem like that in the beginning. Stay on top of the assignments and you will decrease the stress level a lot.",
    "Absolutely take this if you can. This was (and still is, into the summer research portion) the most rewarding experience I have had with a course at Yale. The trip itself is only one part of the experience, but the instructors are all so great about teaching you how to think like a scientist and develop your own project. Definitely what I came to Yale for.",
    "The best science course you'll take at Yale. The trip to Ecuador is absolutely incredible - life-changing, in fact - but don't expect a relaxing Spring break. This course really trains you to perform original research, but I still found it enjoyable as a premed. However, it's an insane amount of work (as in, I took this course alongside orgo 2, and as a conservative estimate, I put in ten times more effort and hours into this class). The grading is also not particularly easy, but it's absolutely worth it.",
    "I would definitely take this class again. However, there is much more work than I was expecting, and the grading is rather stringent. The class trip to Ecuador was well worth it though. Just be wary of the workload after the trip, and the grading that comes with it.",
    "It's an amazing course. It pushes you outside of your comfort zone in many ways to help you grow as a student, researcher, and person. There isn't much work up till Spring Break, but right before Spring Break and the rest of the semester, there is a big commitment. I looked at ~6hrs of lab work per week outside of class. The papers are also not joke. But if you're able to get into the class, it's definitely worth it.",
    "MB&B 230 is a great course for MCDB\/MB&B majors who are tired of taking typical science courses. Although the class is best known for its trip to Ecuador over spring break, the main focus of this course is placed on helping students become true scientists. You will be able to choose your own topic to do research on and collect plants that are relevant to your topic. After spring break, you will isolate endophytes that grow out of your plants and use those to conduct research over the summer. The people (both students and profs) in this class are awesome and you should definitely take this course!",
    "This was by far the best class I've taken. Although the trip to Ecuador was definitely a highlight, the lectures were also great because there were a lot of different professors who lectured on what they specialize in and gave students so much knowledge in different fields. Then the summer lab portion of the class gives students a lot of independence in what they want to focus their research on. It's great to be treated like a collaborator rather than a student. If you have the chance, definitely take the class!",
    "This class is not for everyone. There is a large amount of lab work and you'll need the time after spring break to be fairly clear in order to commit to all of it. (Although work is vey light until the week before spring break.)That said, this class is awesome. You'll learn botany, mycology, those orgo lab techniques that you thought you could just forget, microbio techniques, something of your choosing to do your assay on, loads of stuff. You'll make great friends, get to go to Ecuador, know amazing professors on a first name basis, and have a summer plan. Also, everything is so fucking cool.Shop the class. They'll outline the course on the first day. The gist is that you'll collect plants from the rainforest, grow the fungi that live inside them (endophytes), and then try to see if they do anything cool (think 21st century penicillin discovery... does this fungus degrade plastic? inhibit HIV? cure cancer?) Don't miss the first day as there'll be interview sign ups. They say they preference sophomores, but our class was about half and half (they don't take seniors and freshmen don't tend to get in). If you want to increase your chances, take botany.They'll tell you not to put off the work until the last minute and you will and you'll regret it. You'll put in lots of hours in lab and they'll pay off. Hard work and some luck and you may get published.",
    "Rainforest Expedition and Laboratory is a class where you and your classmates go to a Tropical Rainforest in South America to look for special plants to isolate symbiotic fungi that produce new, useful compounds.Every student has their own collection theme, and their own sort of project they hoped to pursue. If you have a project idea, it's unlikely anyone will tell you no. The amount of freedom you have to pursue whatever you want is what defines this class. Having so much independence is a little scary at first, but you'll be surprised at what you and your peers come up with.The professors and TAs of this class are phenomenal and will make every effort to support you along the way. The Ecuador trip is fun, but after that the class will consume your life (particularly in lab). Get started on your assignments early (assomeone who procrastinated, no, it's not a good idea).It's a fun adventure with a small class and great teachers. You really get what you put into it, so if you're willing to invest the time and effort into the class, I think it's an awesome experience.",
    "If you have the opportunity to take this course, definitely take it! It is hands down the best course I've taken at Yale!",
    "By far the best class I have taken at Yale. If you are interested in doing biochem-related research over the summer, I would definitely recommend taking it. The instructors are great, the trip is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and because you are responsible for developing a research project, it is easy to get involved in the coursework",
    "This is the best class I've taken at Yale. I didn't know anything about the subject before the class and now I'm hooked. I recommend it for a hard working student who loves science and has a lot of curiosity about the world, and who likes to have fun and isn't afraid of a challenge. Our trip to Ecuador was obviously amazing, but even the lab work is fascinating if you have the aptitude for it. The professors are so caring and smart. If you can get in, definitely take it. I can't think of a better way to spend a semester and a summer."
