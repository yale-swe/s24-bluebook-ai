    "?",
    "This was an excellent course. It provided a good overview of perinatal epi topics and a nice general background of many issues.",
    "We definitely should have at least one written assignment. I understand tha this is a seminar course and we will be evaulated on our participation and presentation but it would have been helpful to have at least one written assignment.",
    "The strength of this class is that you are able to get a good overview of topics that are most important to perinatal epi right now. The articles were all recent and covered a variety of different topics. I prefer this class structure to that of other survey courses I have taken.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It is not a lecture-style course, rather it is more discussion based. I think how a person experiences this course depends on the other people in the class, and I had a great class. It was helpful to have several clinicians in the class (an obgyn and a neonatologist) who were able to answer questions and speak to their experience working in the field. I thought the topics were also great, although I think in the future maybe birth weight should be one topic instead of two (we had birth weight and childhood disease, birth weight and adult disease, and another lecture from one of the visiting scholars on birth weight) because it became a bit much.",
    "The topics addressed in this course were very interesting, however there was no comprehensive discussion about conducting or designing perinatal epi studies. It would have been nice to have had a more solid basis for what are the major issues and topics in perinatal epidemiology and any special considerations when dealing with these populations."

    "Instructor: Kathleen Belanger \u00a0Dr. Belanger is a very knowledgeable instructor.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Belanger \u00a0Dr. Belanger supplemented the material covered in the two papers with outside information, which was helpful. However, we would have gained more from the class had there been more of a structure. Perhpas students should have been asked come in with at least one or two questions that the thought of after reading the papers. This would have ensured greater engagement and made for better discussion.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Belanger \u00a0Dr. Belanger was an excellent instructor. She was very helpful in providing background information on the science needed to understand the papers to make sure everyone was on the same page at all times. She was very engaging and you can tell she has a true love for perinatal epi.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Belanger \u00a0Dr. Belanger is very knowledgeable and did a good job leading discussion when it slowed or when the student presenter needed clarification. She was able to provide lots of additional perspectives from her work in the field, and she would also generally prepare a few other articles on the topic before hand in case we wanted to expand the discussion or to bolster the findings in the other articles presented.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Belanger \u00a0Dr. Belanger was very helpful and receptive to students. The course structure needed improvement for her to engage more thoroughly with students."

   "comments": [
    "YES",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. If you are interested in perinatal epi, this course gives you a nice introduction\/overview to the subject. The papers we read in class are all recently published, and the discussions led by Dr. Belanger challenges you to think critically. You would not learn as much if you did't read the two weekly assigned articles prior to class. Overall I enjoyed this course very much.",
    "Great overview of Perinatal Epi",
    "This is a great course if you want to apply skills you learned in EPI I to perinatal issues. However, it is helpful if you have a strong background in perinatal issues prior to starting this course because we don't cover much of the basics.",
    "This is a great course. The workload is just enough to keep you engaged, without being a burden. I came away from this class with a basic knowledge of topics and issues that are important in perinatal epi.",
    "In this class you only read research papers and discuss them one by one--there is not much else to it.",
    "This course gave a broad overview of perinatal epidemiology topics, from IVF to low birth weight to HIV and pregnancy. It is almost entirely discussion based, and thus class participation and attendance are mandatory. The workload is generally pretty low, just 2-4 weekly readings, a two-hour discussion\/presentation session, and attendance. Overall, I would definitely recommend, it is a unique course and the topics discussed here are not discussed in any other epi courses.",
    "This is a good course for beginning to learn about perinatal epidemiology but it is really concerned with special interest topics and there is not a lot of general discussion about perinatal epidemiology. This course emphasizes critical evaluation of studies but does not really provide a basis for understanding or conducting perinatal research."
