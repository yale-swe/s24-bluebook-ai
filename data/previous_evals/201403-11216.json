   "comments": [
    "Social Cognition is a fantastic survey of the field, with the opportunity to interact with John Bargh, a pioneer of social cognition, one of the best parts of the course. John Bargh has a wealth of knowledge on the field, and is happy to talk with students about any and all related topic. He is a fantastic instructor.",
    "Yes, as an undergraduate, it is not too difficult and very interesting.",
    "I would summarize PSYC 509 to a fellow student as an overview of the field of Social Cognition by someone who has contributed significantly to the field and knows it very well. If they are looking for a seminar class where they want to learn these things, I would recommend it to them.",
    "Psych 509 provides an introduction to research in Social Cognition, major threads in the class being stereotypes, motivations, and automatic vs. controlled processing. The class is a seminar format that is driven by student discussion, and explanation of major concepts by the professor. I would definitely recommend this class to another student; I think it is widely applicable to anyone whose interests intersect questions about how people relate to each other and the world around them",
    "I would recommend this course. I think the course nicely integrates cognitive and social psychology."

   "comments": [
    "The course helped ground me with foundational knowledge of the field of social cognition, an absolute necessity for continued research in this area.",
    "I took this class as a non-Major, but Psychology plays a large part in the research that I will be doing. More than the Major classes I took this semester, I learned more out of this class that will apply to my research than any of the others. It was extremely valuable in that way.",
    "I had not taken a social psychology course before, so this was a great introduction. My own thesis deals with social interactions and identity in public space, so this deepened my understanding of these issues from a psychological standpoint."
