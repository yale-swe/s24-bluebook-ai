   "comments": [
    "Even having taken no biochemistry in the past, most of this class was review of material I'd seen in other courses (mol\/cell bio, etc). Despite this, the workload is not appropriately spread out for a graduate student, and I felt as though I had to choose between caring about biochemistry [exams]and focusing on research (I chose the latter). I do not feel as though taking this course drastically improved my background knowledge, and it was not worth having the time-intensive study-load characteristic of a pre-med undergraduate sophomore.",
    "This is a cell biology course that focuses from time to time on biochemical aspects of biology. I would avoid this course if you have a strong grounding in cell biology and are not planning to do heavy biochemistry research.",
    "An excellent introductory course to biochemistry. I would recommend it but I would also caution it is filled with premedical students looking for A's which can give it an element of competitiveness that I did not enjoy."

   "comments": [
    "Though I gained a bit more background in biochemistry, most of the course reviewed knowledge I had from previous courses, and the rest is mostly either extraneous to my research or could be learned easily if needed.",
    "The metabolism lectures may be helpful for my dissertation research.",
    "This course will be essential in moving forward in my research. I had not taken a biochemistry course before and this course did an excellent job 'catching me up'. Thanks!"
