    "I would, I think the class does a very good job teaching the foundational microeconomics material well.",
    "Yes, especially if you have certain background in microecon and you are not pursuing a Econ Phd.",
    "I would recommend ECON 545 for students without and an undergraduate background in Microeconomics.",
    "I would not recommend econ 545.",
    "I may not recommend the course to other students as it is a course in-between the undergraduate and Phd level economics courses. Much of my learning came from my own understanding of the lecture notes - which is doable without attending the lectures themselves.",
    "Good for an in-depth exploration of some microeconomics concepts.",
    "I would recommend the class for someone who is interested in microeconomic theory and proving them mathematically. I believe the class was not what I was expecting and was a lot more proving theories than what I was expecting.",
    "The course is a great rigorous class on the fundamentals of micro economics. It covers many of the topics in a PhD level course, but is slightly less theoretical and mathematical (it isn't just proofs). The class is challenging, problem sets take a long time, and the tests can be difficult. Be prepared to put in a lot of time. However, Prof. Boozer is a great lecturer and is very helpful to those who feel confused or that they are falling behind.",
    "Yes, very helpful course"

    "ECON 545 deepened my knowledge of Microeconomics and taught me many new concepts. It also showed me more of the complexities underlying the discipline.",
    "I believe I did not choose the right course; however, I hope to use some of the skills I learned in the future.",
