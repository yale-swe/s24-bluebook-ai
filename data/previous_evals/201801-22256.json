    "Strengths: great reading list, great instructors, good participants Weaknesses: Discussion was somewhat scattered at points Improved: Focus on specific passages, questions, etc to try to drill down on one aspect of the books",
    "The course was useful as it exposed me to a broad number of topics. This is important, and since the final paper was not a term paper it was adapted to a general study, so I found the homework assignments to be appropriate for an interdisciplinary class."

    "Yes, if they want a general awareness of Renaissance culture and literature.",
    "Yes."
