   "comments": [
    "The grammar review was useful, but I wish it had been incorporated into discussion rather than have it as the focus of the class. There are so many interesting and meaningful conversations to be had about Israel, but the level we engaged with issues in Israeli society was very superficial. I also felt that the vocab we learned felt random and inapplicable. Having completed L5, I still feel that I have major gaps in my vocab and I wish that over the previous semesters there was more continuity in what words were studied, with a deliberate focus on teaching us words that will help us converse more fluently and follow Hebrew-language media.",
    "Excellent organization, Orit is always super prepared and lovely to deal with",
    "The strengths are that it tends to be a small class where these is a lot of time to participate and the teacher\/structure is flexible for student learning. I think this course could be improved by structuring it around discussions, ex: today we discuss israeli politics, and everyone talks freely without being graded, as opposed to structuring it around grammar lessons. I believe the grammar will come through engagement in topics in Israeli culture in Hebrew, and better than the other way around, as we will retain vocab and grammar better when it is associated with meaning.",
    "We could spend more time talking in guided casual conversation. A little too much time was spent reviewing grammar and not enough time was spent with all of us conversing."

    "If you want to continue your Hebrew, this is the way to go. It is a comfortable learning environment and it was definitely worth my time. It certainly wasn't a challenge.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a friend. Strong continuation of an already strong Hebrew Program.",
    "Definitely! If you are interested in Hebrew and want to advance further, I recommend it. It's a very low stress environment and I think reaching L5 in a language has a lot of benefits.",
    "Yes. It is a fun way to engage with Hebrew and complete the sequence."
