    "It's lots of work, some of which is frustrating because it's busy work rather than interesting work. You read good texts. Make sure you know your grammaire going in. Take it if you want to study French, not if you just want to get the language requirement out of the way.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their French language skills. French 150 is good course with carefully chosen topics in grammar and a good selection of books and movies. This course really increased my language skills; it is, however, quite a bit of work (at least if you are not that firm when it comes to grammar rules).Prof. Colvin is great and really helpful!!!",
    "If you want to keep learning french I would recommend it. If your grasp of grammar is good but not great I would recommend it, however if you can write well I would probably go up to the next level.",
    "French 150 is a lot of work, but it's a great way to improve your French."
