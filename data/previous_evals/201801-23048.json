    "I adored everything about this class except for the time it was held. 8am is for coffee, not class. My brain is not awake. I am unable to function as a human being at that ungodly hour. Im sure you didnt pick it, but I just thought I would register my displeasure. Please tell the registrar that 8am classes are unacceptable. Other than the time I loved the class. It was great. I did think that a lot of the same people talked over and overthey had good points, but I would have liked to have heard from others too. I think this problem would be solved by a class later in the day. Also more cold calling, but thats not as fun as an afternoon class. Also, I really, really, really appreciated the way you organized the readings on Canvas. You made it super easy to find all the readings and to know what I was supposed to do on what day. Most other professors are not so considerate. Also I would have appreciated more grades. Maybe this is a law school thing, but I like to measure my learning before its too late to do anything about major gaps."
