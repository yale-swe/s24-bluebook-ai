   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, even maybe if you don't need it for the English major but enjoy English.",
    "For either an English major or someone who just wants to learn more about this poetry, this is truly a great class. I would really recommend Professor Walsh to any student. All in all a great class!",
    "I would only recommend it if you have a supreme love for old poetry (or if it's required of you for the major).",
    "I would recommend this course. It's not too much work, just a couple papers plus reading (which really drops off after Chaucer and Spenser). It's really cool to read Chaucer in Middle English, though it takes a little while to get used to it. Plus, The Canterbury Tales is a surprisingly modern work, which was really interesting. I didn't really enjoy Spenser, but I guess it was necessary for the chronology. Donne and Shakespeare were really cool.Take it with Walsh! It sounds like the other sections weren't nearly as happy with their professors.",
    "I would heartily recommend this class to another student. It's certainly not a class to be entered into lightly, as the material is difficult. However, the reading assignments are relatively light to compensate for the difficulty of the reading, so the workload is manageable. Even though I expected to dislike Chaucer and Spenser, I actually really enjoyed them. I am really glad that I took this class, and I got a lot out of it. If you can, take English 125 with Professor Walsh. He is really an excellent professor, especially for this material. Our discussions were always interesting, and Professor Walsh's mild-mannered personality is very non-intimidating, which made it easier for me to feel comfortable speaking up as a freshman. He's definitely not an easy grader, but he is fair, so I always felt like he was right about my grade even when I wished it was higher. All in all, take this class (with Professor Walsh!), even if the material scares you. It seems difficult at the beginning, but at the end you'll be so glad that you read it.",
    "English 125 with Professor Walsh was a wonderful experience. He is a skilled professor armed with intriguing insights. I enjoyed his reading selections as well as the assignments that he set us. He is open to different ideas and always willing to try different interpretive approaches to a particular poet.",
    "If you're looking for a section, take Walsh. He's a great discussion leader and brought life and humor to material that might have (at least for me) gotten a bit dry otherwise.",
    "ON MEP: a good class, I think, regardless of whether or not you are an English major. Not only is it nice to know the classics, so you can love or hate them but at least understand something that has been very important to your culture, but the readings turned out to be pretty interesting, over all. Sometimes they are humorously or offensively pedantic and sometimes they feel repetitive, yes, but still, many things you might not necessarily expect, and certainly enriching. ON WALSH: Absolutely the best prof you could take the class with, obviously I don't know the others, but I can't really imagine someone doing a better job. His teaching style is: he often opens with a mini-lecture of under five minutes to tell us some background information or get some points he wants to make about the work out of the way (instead of guiding our conversation toward those points), and then lets the conversation go pretty student-guided, interfering exactly when you need him, to propose a subject, or synthesize what someone has just tried to say (no matter how brilliant you are, you know you have those moments where you can't find the perfect words or where you go on forever, and the class ends up maybe not totally understanding what you're saying: he saves you and the class from this), etc. He is also extremely kind and approachable (willing to meet outside of class, willing to bring up non-academic subjects in section, smiling frequently), and, as is clear from the way he guides and helps along discussion, he is as intelligent as I have the intelligence to gauge.",
    "English 125 is a very broad course on old English poetry. While it covers too much material for just one semester and the entire course is based on open discussion with limited guidance from the instructor, it is the prerequisite for the major. So,if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in the English major, best of luck! I recommend Professor Walsh. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good man and a fair grader and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make the class a bit more entertaining if nothing else.",
    "A survey of the early English poets, necessary for English majors. A worthwhile course if you want to study Chaucer and Donne, but if you're looking for literary inspiration, there are courses with better reading lists. I'd recommend Professor Walsh enthusiastically, however. He's a kind person, a good professor, and a generous grader. Discussion tends to be better with his guidance.",
    "It's a traditional overview of English literature. Three full essays, a couple short responses, and a final. All in all pretty straight forward.",
    "You pretty much know what you're getting into: 4 poets, 5 papers, and a final. Take it with Walsh if you can! Laid-back but still really knowledgeable. Also just be aware that people will come into class with different backgrounds (eg, DS kids, people with a lot of backing in the classics, etc.), but don't be too intimidated.",
    "This class is very much what one might expect in reading the description. You will read Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Donne, and you will do a fair amount of writing. You'll be in class with a bunch of prospective English majors, so take from that what you will. There will be lively discussions, but you'll have to come to class really ready to talk about the reading. Professor Walsh is great. He is always ready to respond to questions or concerns, and he is especially knowledgeable about Shakespeare. If you're interested in learning about the foundations of English poetry, if you're interested in any one of these poets, or if you want to be an English major, take this class. If you have no desire to be an English major, think long and hard before you take this class, but by no means should you write it off.",
    "Major English poets will give you a survey of the great early English poets (Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Donne) that serves as background for all further study in English, or (I think) in any of the humanities. The poets are all very different. Chaucer is playful and raunchy, Spenser loves allegory, and Shakespeare and Donne love to play with poetic form and figurative language. Even if you don't fall in love with all the poets, you are bound to get really interested in at least one! I highly recommend taking the course with Professor Walsh--he conducts the discussion very well and always has really interesting ideas to add. He also writes very thoughtful paper comments and is very approachable.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are serious about English and planning to make it your major. However, it isn't terribly hard, so if you are not interested in majoring in English, but still wish to read Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Donne, it's a good class."
