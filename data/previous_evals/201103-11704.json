    "Great class! Mohan is great at both lecturing and engaging in discussion with students about the material. He clearly really cares both about the material and his students, and brings a valuable perspective from his background in monetary policy.",
    "Highly recommended, but be prepared to read, present, and discuss. Mohan is a good teacher, and you should take advantage of his depth of experience. Each person presents at least once, and you should use this opportunity to learn about your topic. Take this class if you want to understand what's going on in the news every day."
