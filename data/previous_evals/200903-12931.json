   "comments": [
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student who is interested in literature, history or the classics, and who is willing to work hard. The required reading is rather formidable and at times became a struggle, but the course itself has been richly rewarding. Through sheer necessity, I have learned how to read vast quantities of text with much more patience than I had before I came to Yale. The syllabus is appropriately cohesive and I believe it provides a good overview of early to medieval Western literature. I'm very glad to have taken this course.",
    "You need to be in love with what we study in DS for you to be able to enjoy it at all.",
    "Highly recommended for those interested in the Western literary tradition. Its exactly what its supposed to be, andtherefore excellent.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. I found that Lit was my favorite section of DS, because the readings were really interesting and accessible. The ensuing discussions were great, too.",
    "First semester DS lit is pretty simple to get through, in terms of the texts. Professor Yeazell, while an excellent professor, was not an effective section leader because she did not control section well enough. Very powerful personalities quickly took over the section in a way that was not helpful or elucidating. She has interesting ideas. She can be a bit of tough grader too, but she's ultimately very fair.",
    "This was a good course. Strengths include both the material read and the lectures, which were frequently very thought-provoking and engaging. Weaknesses include the perennial DS course weaknesses: discussions tend to be dominated by a few people; the pace of the course is fast; there is little time to look at the text at an exegetical level.",
    "I would not wholeheartedly recommend any DS course to a student because I believe DS is not suited to all students, but I would recommend DS 001 06, Yeazell's section, to a student taking DS.",
    "Take it if you're looking for a solid introduction to the Western tradition. That's what it intends to do, and it does it very well. If that's not what you want to do with your semester, don't take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who has had extensive studying in English literature in high school and is willing to have a strong bonding with the books.",
    "I enjoyed the selections which we read for Directed Studies, and I like the course as a whole. Doing all the reading really isn't that difficult, and the course is a lot of work, yes, but it is manageable. I would recommend Directed Studies to any student who is truly interested in exploring the ramifications of intertextuality in the Western canon."
