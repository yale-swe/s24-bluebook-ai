   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about current research in cultural psychology and how to design my own study based on what we studied. I learned how to analyze research papers and contribute to class discussions.",
    "I learned a lot about different findings in the cultural psychology field and how the psychology field has room to grow. I learned how to push and question entire fields.",
    "As basic as this may sound, the most important thing I learned in this class was how to define and understand culture, but also how it manifests itself and is produced in various forms. Anyone except a cultural psychologist would probably be very bad at defining other individual's communitys, or nations's culture - let alone their own - and it was interesting to learn how to create a new mindset to better take notice of these things.",
    "An overview of a range of topics relating to cultural psychology and discussion of published papers. A great seminar if you're interested in learning about the shortcomings of psychological research and how we might use a cultural approach to inform our understanding of present and future research.",
    "This class will teach you how to consider the role that culture may play in shaping who does social science research, under what paradigms and ideologies, whom it will benefit, which populations are studied, and how data are reported. It will also help you critically analyze results in your social science field for universalizability and applicability of findings, ultimately training you to consider research practices that may capture rather than elide human difference due to cultural background. It's probably helpful to have some experience reading psychology papers before you begin this course, but if you don't have that, you will learn fast!"

   "comments": [
    "The class seminar was very nice and engaging! I liked being able to design a research study and presenting it briefly to my classmates. The weekly reading responses were also helpful because they encouraged me to keep up with the readings. The only weakness is that we sometimes ran out of time because students would have a lot to say about one of the papers assigned for that day.",
    "I really liked how we focused on different topics and explored cultural psychology that way, and the papers we read were really interesting. The only thing is that class was fairly predictable - talk about the readings and share ideas - which was really interesting, so even if it didn't change, that'd be fine. However, if there could have been more to engage different people in different activities that could be interesting.",
    "The course is very discussion-based, which is great! Professor Gendron also clearly cares about our thoughts and tries her best to make sure that everyone has a chance to speak (but not in a way that invites pressure\/stress, or unnecessary comments). As the course revolves around the discussion of specific weekly readings, however, at several points throughout the semester I felt myself wanting to take a step back and investigate the topics on a macroscopic level, rather than through the specifics of certain studies\/theory papers. It would have been great if we had spent some time underlining the broad themes of each topic before or after we discussed the readings.",
    "I think one of its biggest strengths was definitely Professor Gendron. She created a great structure for the class, was passionate about the subject, and made sure to try to engage with each student in the seminar every week. Perhaps the only weakness was the presentations at the end of the semester. I felt that many of us put a lot of effort into our presentations but had only a very short amount of time and often were cut off and we did not have time to receive feedback. But other than that nit-picky detail, the material was super interesting it was a great course overall!",
    "I honestly can't think of anything, it was a very good course! 3",
    "Strengths: a wide survey of topics in cultural psych, really interesting readings both clinical and theoretical in nature Weaknesses: lack of\/delay in Dr. Gendron's feedback to our weekly response papers, class felt too big sometimes for discussion (we often had to roll over discussion time into the next week)",
    "This course is pedagogically excellent, with class formats offering inroads to a wide range of learning styles, including large-group discussions, small-group work, and presentations. It is really empowering to finish up a class with the sense that you've become capable of leading others into engagement with this important material! The readings are impeccably curated, and many of the articles assigned are sources I'll use in my research and writing for years to come, reflecting both depth and breadth of analysis of culture. But I think the real strength of the course lies in Dr. Gendron, with her intuitions for facilitating discussions and her style of bringing students to engage with questions. She is so knowledgeable in the field, yet simultaneously committed to offer inroads even to people who have never studied culture or psychology formally."

   "comments": [
    "I would really recommend it if you are interested in learning more about how you can integrate culture in psychology. It's a topic that is really important but there are not very many classes offered that teach it, so I highly recommend taking advantage of the opportunity to take this seminar.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student - it challenges how you think about the world and teaches you many things you didn't know that you didn't know.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I learned a lot and I think that my perspective on culture\/cross-cultural issues has shifted. It was also wonderful to hear from so many different perspectives. I would say, however, that the course is what you make of it - if you put in the work and are engaged with the material and the discussions, you will get a lot more out of it than if you don't put as much effort in.",
    "Yes! As the weeks went on, I began to enjoy the material more and more as well as began to appreciate Professor Gendron more and more. I would definitely recommend the class if youre a psych major, but even to anyone with an interest in learning a new way to think about life!",
    "Yes, learned a lot and changed the way I think about cultures and different people",
    "Definitely! We read so many interesting papers and discussed topics I'd never considered. Professor Gendron and the rest of the students all come from different backgrounds of study and it's wonderful getting to discuss our ideas with each other and get a fresh perspective on a topic you thought understood :D",
    "Yes, I would! It's not a very heavy workload (weekly response papers, mid-term paper proposal, presentation of the paper's abstract, and a final 10 pg. paper) and class was relatively chill each week. The psych papers we were assigned to read were very interesting and differed in content (theoretical, clinical, some were rather neuroscience-y) which kept things from getting tiresome.",
    "I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to do social science that takes into account human difference as well as similarity. It also has potential to help us be wiser consumers of research findings, analyzing results with regards to culture: How do we ask questions and why? Who is included in this research? In what contexts are the studies conducted? It is a really, really fun class that will prepare you to engage intelligently with study results and, perhaps, with a wide range of cross-cultural interactions, from friendships to academic collaborations."
