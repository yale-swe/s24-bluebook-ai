   "comments": [
    "It was a required course for me, but if you have the option, do not take this class. It's poorly organized and poorly taught and was a complete waste of time.",
    "If you're looking at this class, you're probably a GA major and I'm really legitimately sorry you have to take this class if its similar to what it was like this semester. It's really disorganized and pointless. Going to class (which was mandatory) felt like a chore, except I'd rather do chores than go to this class twice a week. Luckily the workload is kinda manageable, although the Research Design at the end is more difficult than you expect, especially because most people have never written one before and they don't provide a lot of guidance about how to go about writing one.If you're not required to take this class, either don't take it or wait until they figure out how to run it in an interesting and engaging way. Also if Melanie is a TF try and get her section, she's awesome.",
    "You know a class is bad when the students have been anxiously awaiting this moment - the moment we get to submit this review.If you are not a Global Affairs major and don't have to take this class, DO NOT.This course is enormously frustrating. Right now, there are two audiences in the class - those who find the material boring and elementary, and the group for whom this may be the only security class they take at Yale. As a security-focused major, I found the lectures to be elementary, and as a survey course where there was 1 lecture on a wide range of issues, I came away having learned very little.Section is wholly useless - I really don't understand the point and the fact that it was mandatory was mind-boggling.I'm very frustrated that this was a required class for my major. Global Affairs is on the whole fantastic, but this class is truly a waste of my Yale tuition money. It seriously has to be changed.",
    "If you're a Global Affairs major, you have to take it. If your'e not, I really wouldn't, honestly. There are probably better IR courses out there.",
    "If you're in the major, you have to take it. Otherwise, don't. There are more interesting classes on the topic.",
    "I would not necessarily recommend it to you because the course is VERY basic.",
    "Survey course in problems of international security that emphasizes the \"strategic choice\" approach. While some things you might learn in lecture will seem pretty common sense, the real value of this class comes from doing the readings (I know they're long but do them!) and section, where you really learn to improve your writing.",
    "The global affairs majors tried to warn me away and I probably should have listened. This was a very basic overview of the theory behind current problems, but it didn't really leave me with any impressions other than the technical terms for things most people who read the newspaper would understand anyway. That being said, it was a very easy writing credit and the research design project at the end was a new and challenging kind of writing for me. You have to go to every lecture because she seems to print out Yale Facebook and check to see that everyone's face is there, but other than that it's whatever.",
    "The material is really boring and it is extremely theoretical. If you are not into academic theory of international relations, then this class is not for you.",
    "Take it if you (a) have to for the major or (b) are a freshman\/sophomore looking for an introduction to the topic. Otherwise, it's a waste of your time.",
    "This class is great for students who want to learn about approaching international security issues without getting bogged down in the \"-isms\" of IR theory. It does a great job of working to build the gap between policy and academia.",
    "Don't take this class unless you're a Global Affairs major and you have to. If you take this class, however, and don't like it, don't let that deter you from pursuing the Global Affairs major.I think the Global Affairs faculty is still working out the kinks of its core Security class, which is commendable and ought to be respected. That being said, I didn't like this class. Professor Hyde would lecture about a theoretical \"problem\" in international security and then a proposed \"solution\" to that concept, again focusing on the theory behind the solution. We covered a new problem\/solution every week. Our final project was a research design, something that many of us (even Global Affairs majors) have never done before.I also didn't like this class because I didn't really understand what the point of the class was. Was it to provide an survey course to students who may have been interested in international relations but had never really studied it in depth? Or was it to build upon instruction that the Global Affairs faculty assume that the students enrolled in this course already had? If it's the former, I think the class should focus on fewer topics and go more in-depth with them. If it's the latter, I think the class should stray away from making this assumption, even for the Global Affairs majors on the Security track.Still, the Global Affairs major is not just its core class; the capstone is awesome, and so are the electives that fall under it!",
    "There's no final, which is awesome - that being said though, prepare to write a lot. Papers are not easy either. Was not a global affairs major and took this class for a writing credit - definitely wasn't the easiest writing course I could've taken, though I did learn a lot.",
    "Global Affairs was a good introduction to some of the concepts in Global Affairs and Political Science, but the material was covered in a fairly shallow way. Maybe this was required because of time constraints and the fact that it was an introductory course, but I might think about improving the depth of the teaching in future iterations. Otherwise, it was a good class.",
    "In one word: Terrible. This is by far one of the worst classes that I have taken at Yale and it is embarrassing that this is a requirement for Global Affairs students! I understand that you think that students come in with different levels of background with regards to International Security; however, we are ALL global affairs students. Which means that we ALL have at least heard of the New York Times before. Which means that giving us a class that is not Intro to IR but rather Intro to IR level 2 is border-line insulting!There was simply no \"narrative\" to this class. There was nothing that tied the 20 hodge-podge IR lectures together. Nothing connected a surface-level understanding of human rights to the same shallow lecture on inter-state war. Instead of trying to cover the entirety of international security in one semester, try forgoing a few topics and dig deeper or at least come up with a narrative that you can weave throughout all of your lectures.(And I didn't enjoy Susan Hyde at all as a professor)Huge thumbs down!",
    "For non majors looking for a survey class of IR, this might of. For majors, you don't have a choice but I hope the department seriously rethinks the utility of this course. A major restructuring of the requirements of the major may be necessary so that majors won't waste a precious credit on a class that promises so much but in which they learn very little.",
    "This class will not teach you anything you don't already know. It sets out to cover every topic in international security, meaning it covers each one so superficially there's nothing new to learn. Workload includes three short response papers, an in class presentation, and a final paper.",
    "You have to take it if you are Global Affairs but I wouldn't recommend it if you are not.",
    "This class was good. I wouldn't particularly recommend it for non-Gobal majors since I'm sure there are tons of more awesome classes out there, but go ahead and shop it to decide for yourself. I gained a LOT from it, but in unexpected ways - it was almost more about writing than it was about topics in international security. All the grading was paper-based, and feedback was excellent if you have a good TF. Section turned from discussion of the readings to lessons on how to be more concise and argumentative in our own papers. This was incredibly helpful and I took away more from the class than I could have expected, but again, in terms of writing rather than substance of security. There was no form of assessment of our mastery of the material, so people were less and less inclined to take notes, do the readings, or pay attention in class since little of our grade depended on that. Overall, good course. Lecture wasn't the most engaging, but section was great.",
    "If you're interested in global affairs at all, you should take this class. If you have no background in political science theory, you'll have a pretty steep learning curve, but it's definitely doable. I'm a sophomore hoping to major in Global Affairs, and even if I don't get in I'm glad that I took this class because it was so interesting.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend it unless you're a Global Affairs major in which case you'd have to take it. Just hope that it's been changed by the time you have to take it.",
    "As you Global Affairs majors know, this is a requirement so there's not much of an option as to whether or not you can take it. But from what I hear, this semester showed a massive improvement to the quality of the course. I personally was quite happy with it. Section is good, lectures are generally pretty decent (especially \"case\" classes). I liked that Professor Hyde didn't focus on getting us up to speed on intro to IR theory, but make sure you're pretty comfortable with it already or you might get a little lost. Workload and deadlines are fairly manageable.",
    "Could be better. Could be worse. The readings are pretty good, try to actually do them.",
    "Dont take unless you are in the major and are a sophomore wanting a survey class in current affairs.",
    "I would absolutely not recommend this course if not necessary for your major. It's very boring, and the essays were incredibly annoying to complete. You're forced to do your final paper as a research",
    "This course is an overview of many of the major topics of international security. It does not, however, often address specific cases, choosing instead to focus on themes and international relations theory. Despite this, I would recommend this course, as it gives students a base to the apply to specific geographic areas in international relations.",
    "You have to take it for global affairs. If you don't, then don't take it.",
    "Not a good a class as you'd hope for being a \"core\" course for Global Affairs. I'm sure it will be improved next year, but this year it was rather underwhelming. The lectures are cursory, and Professor Hyde tries to make a lecture course into a seminar by including participation and attendance in the final grade. That said, the class is not too much work if you stay on top of all your response papers, and you will probably find at least some of the lectures engaging. In terms of required courses, it could be worse.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "It is difficult to teach a survey to topics in international security, because each topic touched on (nuclear proliferation, humanitarian crises, cyber warfare, etc.) could fill an entire course. The sooner you can take this course, the better, because it is more of an introduction. That said, the final paper gives you a chance to look a more closely a particular topic of interest.",
    "The course was decent, but don't take it unless you have to (i.e. you're a GA major). Might be more enjoyable taking a more specific\/focused GA elective. Unless you really know very little about international affairs, and think that a very broad overview of key issues will be helpful for you."
