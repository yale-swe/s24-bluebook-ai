    "I learned how to critically write and especially read essays and literature very closely. This class taught me how to analyze a text very closely, and then build my own argument from that analyses.",
    "I learned an entirely new way of structuring papers which was extremely helpful even in the other courses that I was taking at the time.",
    "General methods for making an argument, and getting practice making arguments. Read lots of science theory which was really interesting.",
    "I learned a lot about philosophy in the first part of the class and then a lot more interesting applications of this philosophy in the second half. Good for writing practice, but not necessary for improving writing.",
    "How to structure my thoughts and develop arguments",
    "Good writing, critical reading, and close-reading skills.",
    "I really felt like this class helped me to grow as a writer. I gained exposure to forms of writing I've never attempted before."

   "comments": [
    "I found that this course was very well organized and well taught.",
    "One of the huge strengths of the course was the sheer amount of material that was covered. Although it can make for a heavy workload, it was well worth it.",
    "Units could be made more contiguous. We skipped from plato -> science theory -> morality in science -> truth -> queer theory. Some were interesting, others less so, and the units seemed totally random. Seminar was fun; Templanza made a very welcoming environment for discussion.",
    "Does not teach specific writing techniques, as I expected,but you write a lot so you learn to write in some way, and you learn to think and to structure thoughts.",
    "Great for group discussion and really delving deeply into the texts. The class is set up in a sort of discussion forum format which I enjoyed very much. Good seminar!"

   "comments": [
    "If you enjoy writing as well as discussing scientific topics and themes I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is either looking to improve their writing or learn more about science and philosophy.",
    "For an English class, this is top-notch. Teaches you how to write, and the readings are actually interesting (unlike 120 on both counts, which I took prior to this). Learn some philosophy of science and argue about how the world works. Would recommend to any STEM major looking for a worthwhile writing credit.",
    "yes, not too tough, and the material in genuinely interesting.",
    "Yes, a great seminar.",
    "Absolutely, especially with Templanza"
