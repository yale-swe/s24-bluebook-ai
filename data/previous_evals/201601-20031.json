    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0I did not have a Teaching Fellow.",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0My Teaching Fellow was Justin Hawkins, but he isn't in the menu. I thought overall that he did a great job with section and I appreciated his effort to include everyone in discussion and clarify which concepts from lecture we should focus on.",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0I did not have a teaching fellow. Dr. Eitel led our discussion group.",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0My teaching fellow was Justin, not Bradley. There seems to be a problem with my drop-down because only Bradley appears. Anyway, I thought Justin's appreciation of the material and understanding of questions that my, admittedly small, section had was wonderful. He clarified the more challenging concepts easily and in ways that made practical sense. In particular, his expertise with Reinhold Niebuhr was very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0Did a fine job.",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0I thought Brad was great. Sometimes I wish he had more energy in our section, but overall thought he did a great job.",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0The survey and forcing me to select Brad's name. He seems like a lovely man, but he not my TF. #TeamJustin",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0Brad was always available to answer questions after class and provide guidance on readings and papers and was very supportive during section.",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0Great discussion facilitator.",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0Very good at clarifying questions about lecture Good input on papers Available and responsive to meeting requests and questions",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0Brad was great. Would have preferred that he participate more actively in discussion rather than having students lead section. Arguing is good . Would help gets ethics on the ground and in our lives where it needs to be. This would help resolve tension of ideological lectures.",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0Brad was a trooper! He stuck with his section, even if we were unable to properly grasp the material. As our discussions were primarily centered on how the readings\/theories\/topics of the week were applicable in modern-day ministry settings, Brad was able to allow us to control our own conversations. When I struggled with some of the topics discussed, Brad was also willing to hear what I had to say and support me in my choices of speaking or not speaking.",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0My teaching fellow was Justin. He encouraged participation in our section and clarified some difficult topics. He was available and met with me regarding both my papers. He went above what was expected of him by holding an optional study section for the final during reading week.",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0I think Brad was a very strong TF. He provided great feedback on papers (both in the thesis crafting stage and in grading). Brad let our section take the reins on presenting course material, but was always there to guide and instruct us when needed. He made himself available to students during a very busy semester, and that is really appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0Brad was always willing to talk through paper ideas or any questions I had about the course material outside of lecture\/discussion section, which was extremely helpful.",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0He strikes the right balance between encouraging discussion and guiding the conversation when it goes off track. He's very knowledgable and I enjoy having section with him (this was my third section led by him).",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0I had Justin H as my TF. He was great. Very organized and helpful during section. He's the best.",
    "Instructor: Bradley Raymond East \u00a0I thought it was great that Brad allowed discussion to proceed organically, only interrupting when we started to veer too far from issues or offer too simplistic answers. Brad's ability to push back against viewpoints was helpful to the overall flow of the section."

    "Justin - Justin clearly has a deep knowledge base from which he was able to draw readily and navigate some of the more convoluted areas in which our discussion decided to wander. I was very much impressed with the way in which he framed the entire section during the first meeting. The setting of expectations for conduct is extremely important and I believe could have been used throughout the semester more to remind the students in the discussion when we were getting off task or being too critical before understanding the argument of the writer. I think one place in which the section was misguided was during the discussions of Cone, Gutierrez, and Soskice. Although I understand the decision to deconstruct the deconstructionists, I think that in practice applying deconstruction as a way into the argument of the only non-white, marginalized voices in the tradition had the unfortunate effect of implying that their arguments needed to be 'fixed' or supplemented by a white audience.",

    "Justin Hawkins Justin was fantastic in section. Provided a very helpful link between professor's historical and ideological outline and why and how these thinkers matter in our lives now. Justin helped us to develop a sense of their strengths and weaknesses. This was helpful when it came to evaluating them for papers and formulating our own opinion. Brad was good at this this as well.",

    "Excellent section leader, very strong at summarizing complex readings and runs the section very efficiently. A great pleasure to be around.",
    "good at moderating section discussions. offered helpful feedback on assignments.",
    "Justin was inspiring, clear in his explanations and open to questions and discussion. His knowledge of the material was impressive and his ability to make connections between sources was most helpful.",
    "Justin was hands down the best TF I've had at Yale. He knew his material and subject matter, was approachable, easy to talk to, encouraging, and understood the role of section.",
    "Justin was very knowledgeable and thoroughly covered all class material during sections.",
    "Justin had a commanding knowledge of most of the authors and their arguments. He does seem to need to get better acquainted on Hispanic authors and their arguments. But over all, I learned so much more about the authors and the arguments he did know about than what the readings covered.",
    "I answered it all in the first one...",
    "Strengths: Justin was well prepared for every section and he consistently engaged all section participants. He explained and elaborated on lecture material by incorporating humor and humility which helped keep the material \"real\" instead of a totally academic \"head\" exercise. He was enthusiastic in his presentation of the material which added energy to the group discussions. He really cared about the students and did his best so we would \"get\" the material (he offered different strategies and resources if he saw blank stares in the room). He was generous with his time; he was available for consultations and review sessions. When the class veered into discussion of personal experiences, he went with it. Our different voices and experiences were heard which built a sense of community in the classroom. Justin is one of the best instructors I have had at YDS.",
    "Justin was a great teaching fellow. He is extremely knowledgeable and was able to bring in current and past events to help solidify the concepts we were engaging. Justin is one of the few teaching fellows I have had at YDS that I feel confident will become a great professor. When he taught our lectures he kept on point and made the material clear and comprehensible. Additionally he was available outside of class to help with paper prep however, he often was delayed in his email responses to students.",
    "see above",
    "Justin was engaged, thoughtful, and well prepared.",
    "Justin's lecture on Neibuhr was fantastic. It was easy to follow, and he made use of the board - as a visual learner I really appreciated that, especially his graph to explain proximal justice. I met with Justin outside of lecture (even though he was not my section TF) to discuss my paper on Niehubr - Justin was extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and patient."
