   "comments": [
    "A good continuation of Russian language for those interested in pursuing a detailed study.",
    "This class is a good place to solidify what you learned in the first two years of Russian, and drastically expand upon those lessons of grammar and vocabulary. The pace is fast but it is worth it because you will make great strides in your language ability.",
    "This is an upper tier Russian class. It is quite time consuming and difficult, but then again, what would you expect. If you stick with it and put the time in, you will find this course to be extremely rewarding! Highly recommended.",
    "Professor Muravnik is really passionate about Russian and a fun instructor. A phenomenal class that dedicates half of class to a grammar or history-based program, and the rest to explanation, practice, and projects of your own interests and design. I personally love the history component of the course, but I can see how it can be frustrating to those who don't like history or don't feel as confident in their Russian language ability.",
    "Take it if you have any interest in improving your Russian grammar and want to get to a point eventually where your speech will sound like a native speaker's. It's a rewarding class, and you'll get out what you put in.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I'm not sure how tough the grading is yet, but I know for a fact I learned a lot.",
    "RUSS 150 focuses heavily on military and political history vocabulary, but also informs you to essential (and difficult!) grammar rules. You should take this class if you wish to continue Russian, even if the topic is not of interest to you, as Professor Muravnik's explanations are bar none.",
    "A lot of work, but important for continuing Russian, and learning the trickiest parts about the language.",
    "I would only recommend L5 to someone who is very interested in academic Russia. There are some benefits for conversational Russian, but a lot of it is history focussed which threw me off guard. I do not regret it but it should be known before beginning the course.",
    "It is a continuation of lower level language courses. You keep learning more grammar and expanding your vocabulary, adding some nuances to your previous knowledge. You increase the amount of reading you do too. I would definitely recommend if you want to keep up your Russian skills.",
    "Great class taught by an awesome professor; he is one of the best language teachers out there, logical and clear, understanding and challenging. Strongly recommend any class with Prof Muravnik. I wish there were mandatory conversation hours with native speakers (like many other language courses at Yale) to have individual chance to practice oral conversational Russian though, for the class as of now focuses heavily on reading, grammar and oral presentations ; that said, Russian grammar is complicated enough that this makes sense...but more oral practices would be beneficial"
