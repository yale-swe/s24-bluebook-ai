   "comments": [
    "This class has some really interesting readings (and some not-so-interesting ones), but it is up to the students to lead and maintain a good discussion. The work load is not bad at all, but the class can seem boring if half the people are on facebook and not taking part in the discussion at all. I'd recommend this class to people who are intersted in examining medicine from a historical perspective and like analyzing documents. Professor Tannenbaum is really nice, and this was all in all a great seminar. Oh and I'm pretty sure 90% of the class was pre-med and wanted to get a writing credit in a class related to medicine.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student interested in gaining a foundational perspective on the evolution of the science and art of medicine in America.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who is either interested in the History of Medicine or just an interesting seminar to take Freshman year. As far as science majors are concerned, this is a great way to get WR credit and only having to write 2 four page and one ten page papers.",
    "Highly recommend to students who wants to know how a freshman seminar works and the discussion style of the class. Great professor, very knowledgeable and understanding (not intimidating at all). Lots of fun and insightful discussions in class. Not very demanding in terms of workload (homework readings and responses and monthly essays with one final research paper at the end that is mostly open-ended)",
    "This class was great for students who love discussions and interesting debates. I would recommend this class for anyone looking to take an interesting freshman seminar.",
    "This is a fascinating class if you're interested in pursuing medicine. This class discussed medical advancements beginning in 1600s and continuing through today. However, class discussions center around readings, so if you don't do the readings you won't get a lot out of the class.",
    "If you are interested in the topic absolutely!",
    "I would recommend this class for people who are deeply interested in the history of medicine. If you don't actually care about the subject, you will probably become very bored within the first month or so. If you do, however, you will love this class.The professor is very reasonable and helpful, and the assignments (3 essays) are manageable. On the whole, a great opportunity to earn a writing credit while learning about an interesting aspect of American history.",
    "It becomes a little repetitive, but it is a good fulfillment of a writing credit and is not a very strenuous class; you learn a lot of random interesting things.",
    "History of Medicine covers the important changes in the practice of medicine from the 17th century to the present, but it also addresses the changes in society that caused or enabled the changes in medicine.History of Medicine was my favorite class this semester -- take it! I learned a lot just from my classmates. We routinely came 15 minutes early for class and had already started discussing the readings before Prof. Tannenbaum even arrived. The subject matter can be sort of fun if you're not easily grossed out.",
    "Medicine and Society was a fantastic class. I really enjoyed the topic, the readings, and class discussions led by Professor Tannenbaum. The reading comes to about 4 hours a week, but if you put the effort into the reading, class will be really lively. The writing is actually pretty light for a WR credit--two reading responses a week, two 3-5 page essays, and one 10 page research exercise. All of the work is completely worth it though as the class was incredibly interesting and Professor Tannenbaum is great in leading discussion and commenting and helping on papers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to see how medicine has evolved over time. You don't have to be a pre-med student or know anything about medicine to enjoy this class.",
    "Yes i would, great course if you want to get a base knowledge of the \"history of medicine in america\", interesting, a manageable workload, and you actually feel like you learned something at the end of the course, also good for first time essay writers",
    "HIST006 is an overview of the history of medicine from the colonial period to the Clinton administration. With this broad scope, it moves very quickly, but the reading is never overwhelming and isinteresting. The syllabus given on ClassesV2 is a very accurate summary of the course. I would recommend this class to another student; the material is very interesting -- a good introduction to a few different fields -- and it is helpful in sharpening one's writing abilities."
