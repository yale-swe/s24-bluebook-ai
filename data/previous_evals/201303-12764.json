   "comments": [
    "It's either a bad review of math that you've already taken, or an incredibly confusing introduction to several topics you aren't familiar with. Either way, I wouldn't recommend the course.",
    "This course is a quick overview of many aspects of mathematics used in biophysics research. This course is good for students with a solid math background, but not the best class for a pure biologist or biochemist. I would recommend this class to a student with math or programming background, but not to the students the course is currently marketed towards.",
    "I want to recommend this course for future students, but I think that it can be improved.Ultimately, it is an important course to take if you're not afraid to get your hands dirty with some quantitative analysis. In its current form, I can't say you'll learn mathematics, but you will learn how various techniques are applied.Homework is the best way to learn, so don't be afraid to disguise homework as interactive class workshops. Don't be afraid to go through a few problems - actually ask us to look at the steps.OR, tailor the class to the background of the students; or, be very specific in the background needed in the course.In its current form, the course was somewhat helpful, but I want more for future class years. If this course is optimized, no one with an interest should be turned away out of intimidation."

   "comments": [
    "This course did give me a basic understanding of many areas of mathematics. Not enough to do them on my own, but enough that when doing my research I could recognize when these areas of math should be applied and look for someone to help me do them.",
    "My professional knowledge was greatly deepened - I don't want to leave the material, because I personally don't feel like I'm done with it. I would not mind taking it again, given infinite time and enthusiasm.I think it planted the seed of usefulness inside of me - now I know what I want to know and what I suspect I need to know. I'm not a mathematician, but darn-it if I'm not going to understand it!"
