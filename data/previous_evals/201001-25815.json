    "This goes over all the necessary grammar, a lot of vocabulary, and Italian culture. I would recommend this to another student because you WILL learn Italian if you put the effort in.",
    "The grammar gets significantly harder this semester, but you will also get to learn a lot more about Italian culture, including art, opera, film, poetry... Take it with Professoressa Iglesias if you can! You will learn a lot!",
    "I would recommend Ital 120 to a student who took Ital 110 and wants to continue learning Italian. I feel that in this class, I greatly improved my Italian knowledge and became much more able to speak, read and write. It does meet everyday, but it is very similar to Ital 110, so if you liked that, you'll like Ital 120 better.",
    "Italian 120 is more intense on the grammer than ITAL 110 -Once the textbook is over, you learn better.",
    "Italian is difficult, but fun! Studying in Italy is worth it.",
    "This is a wonderful language course!",
    "The second term of Italian. Fun, not too hard, and I did learn Italian."
