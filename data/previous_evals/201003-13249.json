   "comments": [
    "TAKE IT. (Especially if you are a philosophy major!) The material is slightly more difficult than other philosophy classes, but it's really different from any other subject in philosophy and really mindblowing. And, once you do the reading, you realize that these philosophers and their come up in a LOT of other areas of philosophy. TAKE IT TAKE IT.",
    "Really dense readings; good lectures. Professor Szabo is dynamic and interesting. Discussion often became inane because of the intricacy of detail being discussed. Tough class, hard material, everything becomes much harder when you realize you really don't care about the subject.",
    "It is fairly dense, but if you are committed to doing the reading and asking a lot of questions, it should be fine",
    "Eh. It has flashes of brilliance. Justin is wonderful. If you're already into metaphysics and language or linguistics you'll like it. They grade the short assignments much harder than it seems like they should. The teachers are good guys and pretty helpful.",
    "This is a pretty interesting course. Make sure you know what the subject matter will deal with, especially in the later parts of the course.",
    "If you are interested in the philosophy of language - which is similar in many ways to semantics, but with more of a focus on justifying the theories of meaning rather than simply stating them - this is the only game in town. Luckily, Professor Szabo is an expert in the subject. The readings can feel disjointed, especially since the lectures focus on specific authors and their theories without necessarily taking the time to situate those authors with respect to the others you have read, but they are consistently interesting. Just be prepared to do a little extra work reading summaries of the general movements in philosophy of language online and you will get a grasp of the general picture of the topic and its various sub-topics.",
    "I would recommend the course, in large part because Professor Szabo is great. The material can get a bit technical, but the professor is very good at guiding you through it and connecting it to larger philosophical questions.",
    "It's an excellent overview of the philosophy of language. 'Nuff said. Just make sure you're wide-awake coming into the class, or you're going to lose it halfway through - the lectures are largely summaries of the material in the reading, with the only extra explanation and elucidation coming from responses to student comments.",
    "I would certainly not recommend this course to another student. Only if someone had a really strong background in logic and a really deep interest in philosophy of language would I recommend it. To everyone else I'd say stay very far away.",
    "Only take this class if you have a strong interest in asking questions about the essence of language that you won't be able to answer.",
    "Great class. Zoltan is a force of nature, and justin is super helpful and nice. At times, it might make you feel a bit stupid, particularly if you ask zoltan a question. Overall, though, great times, and some really important stuff in analytic philosophy.",
    "If you are into either linguistics or philosophy, this course is definitely recommended. If you are into both, there is no question that you should take the class. Zoltan is a fantastic lecturer, and he would have handouts every day with key info on that day's lecture, making note-taking and following along easy. The reading is hard, and it's important to keep up with it. The short assignments (4 of them) are difficult but fun. The final paper is kind of a pain though.",
    "This is a very good class. A great intro to philosophy of language - should be required for the major.",
    "I would recommend it, but only if you are willing to put in the effort, because the class gets difficult fast and stays that way. Don't bother if you're one of those people that just sits in front of a laptop browsing all the time.",
    "This course is a very rigorous, fast-paced tour of modern philosophy of language. There\u0092s a lot of logic and challenging reading involved, but it\u0092s quite an intellectual experience. Each lecture is devoted to a careful analysis of a single reading, so you\u0092ll easily get lost unless you do the readings carefully. That being said, the readings really reward close attention---there\u0092s a lot to get out of this course, both in terms of content and philosophy reading\/writing skills. I would recommend this course to people interested in linguistics and to philosophy majors who want a real challenge. I would not recommend this course to someone who hasn\u0092t yet taken an introductory philosophy course.",
    "This is the hardest course I've taken at yale. It deals with very complex issues at a conceptual level. However it is also rewarding and makes you think very analytically and precisely. I would suggest taking some logic course before taking Philosophy of Language. Zoltan is the man though, and I would not take this course if he is not teaching it.",
    "Linguistics 271 is very much not a Philosophy course in the way one might expect -- it is much closer to a course in the Logic of language. It should be take by people familiar with how Logic classes work, and not by students who merely have an interest in linguistics."
