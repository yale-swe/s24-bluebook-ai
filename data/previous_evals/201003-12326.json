   "comments": [
    "Syntax is a great introductory course, and although we spend a lot of time asking questions about language and not answering them, that is the nature of the field.",
    "I really loved this class! Take it even if you're not going to be a linguistics major. Just make sure that you don't mind spending a lot of time talking about sentences and grammaticality. If you like this, you'll really enjoy the class. Not too hard either!",
    "Really interesting even if you're not a linguistics major, but might be difficult if you haven't taken any Intro Ling. I really, really enjoyed this class and looked forward to it every week.",
    "I would recommend Syntax only if you have a taken an intro Linguistics course before. A lot of the class comes in with some linguistics background. There is not too much work\u0096 one reasonable pset a week. Linguistics is a really new field, so there is a lot of information that is still being learned. If you are a person who wants all the answers and doesn't like when theories don't have inconsistencies then you will not enjoy this course.",
    "I would - it is a good introduction to syntax.",
    "This is a good introduction to the principles of modern syntax. It's challenging and effective and well-organized. I would recommend thelecture to linguistics students (who have to take it anyway) and to anyone else interested in the discipline.",
    "It's any interesting class but perhaps a little too specialized unless you're thinking of studying linguistics.",
    "I liked Syntax. I'm not a linguistics major, but the professor was really nice and accessible and the material wasn't overly daunting. With just a weekly problem set, the work load is manageable and there is section if you have any big questions about it. I took this course as a last-minute addition, but I have no regrets--fairly fun, not too much work, all in a great atmosphere. The professor really cares about making it a good class. You won't look at sentences the same!",
    "This course is a very interesting look at Linguistics, and it is foundational to the field. If the idea of modeling sentence structures in a formal way appeals to you, you will enjoy this class. Professor Zanuttini is great to work with- she legitimately cares about her students and will work through the concepts with you. The main weakness of the class is that it becomes discussion-based to the point that you'll get confused after class and need to ground yourself in the textbook.",
    "This is an interesting course for some and the Carnie books is great. However, I would probably not recommend this course for most. A lot of the class relies on intuitions (which may not be a bad thing itself), but the assignments are simultaneously hard, confusing, and unsatisfactory when complete. I've also heard that Syntax is better taught elsewhere in general.Some of you may have heard that this will be an easy A: it isn't. While the homework assignments may not seem mind-bogglingly challenging, points (or half-points) are fairly easy to lose and there is lots of reading.About the time spent in class itself. Professor Zanuttini is very knowledgeable and kind.However, the organization of the course leaves a lot of room for all sorts of discussion, not all of it relevant and intelligent.",
    "It's an awesome class whether you're a major or not. If you're not a linguistics major, you'll see really cool examples of language working in our mind and think \"huh, I never thought about these sentences in this way!\" You cover a lot of the basics and it's a good incentive to take Syntax II. Raffaella is wonderfully sweet and a fun and very interactive lecturer, so class is very enjoyable to go to. You get problem sets every week, but they're not horribly difficult and are great reinforcement for what you learn in class. Take it!",
    "I would guardedly recommend this course. It was interesting, and I learned a lot, I'm just not sure if anything I learned was at all useful. The course was not that well organized, although it improved once we switched textbooks halfway through. If you're a ling major I guess you have to take it, but otherwise, I'm not sure it was worth it. I still had a good time though.",
    "If you want to understand syntax, then you obviously have to take this class, and I think that it has the possibility to be a great basic course. It needs to be broader, though, and it needs to take a bigger look at things to fit in better with what a Yale course is expected to be. That said, the professor is really nice and the material is very interesting once you actually start learning it, and it can even be fun.",
    "This class will change the way you think about human language in every way--both philosophically and technically. If you're into that, then take the class. I took it for a Social science credit, and I'm happy with my decision.It's a LOT of work though. I spent hours on those problem sets every week. The good part is you are encouraged to work in study groups, which makes the whole experience much more enjoyable. The midterm is take-home, and for the final you have the option of writing a paper or doing another take-home final. Grading was not too harsh. The midterm and final were easy if you took good notes in class.",
    "This was my first linguistics class. It's not terribly difficult. Take it to get an introduction to linguistics, specifically syntax. Useful (but not necessary) to know multiple foreign languages.",
    "This class is great if you have no interest in linguistics and don't plan to continue. Unfortunately, if you're a linguistics major you have to take it, so you'll just suffer through. Band together with the other majors, check your homework together, and wait for the second half of the semester when it gets more interesting."
