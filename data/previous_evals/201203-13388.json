   "comments": [
    "It is a lot of work, but you will learn and become a better writer. There are also some really thought-provoking readings, and I really enjoyed those.",
    "English 120 made me really enjoy writing and an english class for the first time. You learn a lot about yourself as both a person and a writer, get to know a great group of students and professor, and read a lot of different pieces by some amazing writers. I would absolutely recommend the class to another student, it was definitely worth the waiting lists and pushing to get into it.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to become a better writer. It's a decent amount of work, but the reward is well worth it as you'll emerge with a much better understanding of narrative nonfiction writing.",
    "Yes! Take it.",
    "Take it. It's a great course that really improves your writing. One of my favorite classes and Dr. Stuart is so great. Lover her. She doesn't give the best critique on the essays, but if you go see her during office hours she will help you so much.",
    "I would highly recommend English 120. Although the course involves a significant amount of reading and writing, it effecitvely prepares students for writing at a college-level. Additionally, the flexbility and freedom afforded to students makes the writing enjoyable. Dr. Stuart was a fantastic professor: she genuinely cares about her student, and I always looked forward to her class.",
    "A great, writing intensive class to teach you how to write about yourself or about non-fiction events creatively.",
    "Take it if you appreciate the value of writing in society, like reading, like expressing your views in a creative, effective way.",
    "I would absolutely recommend English 120 to a fellow student, but I would not necessarily recommend taking it with Professor Stuart. I think there are many other professors that are more effective teachers and would enrich the experience more than Stuart did for me. The class in general, however, was a great experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student, but only if they genuinely like creative writing. For a nonfiction writing class, there is a lot of creativity and flexibility that is fun to explore. Considering the workload (an essay every week), some people might find it more bearable than others.",
    "ABSOLUTELY.",
    "It's a class that will improve both your basic writing and your revising of essays. You'll learn about your own writing process and will then be able to write and revise more effectively. You'll also gain a greater appreciation for the interaction between the reader and the writer by critiquing other people's papers and by reading essays by other writers. I would absolutely recommend the course to someone else, even if they don't particularly enjoy writing essays. It's a valuable push out of your comfort zone, particularly the interview paper. Don't worry about it - it'll turn out fine. And writing essays about new topics and ideas really stretches your head and makes you think. It's a very valuable lesson, and I think Professor Stuart is a good one to teach it.",
    "Lots of essays, lots of reading. Really no surprises for an English course, but look out for the interview essay, it's a major time sink.",
    "I would recommend, a great opportunity to improve writing, an excuse to read easily manageable and interesting bite size essays on interesting topics and steal great ideas from great authors"
