    "Intelligent Robotics is a course about the history of robot intelligence and development. It's interesting stuff, and it's a pretty easy class.",
    "History of robotics with some practice in coding and architecture design. A great introduction into the field. I would absolutely recommend the course, it was a lot of fun.",

    "I think it helped me put into perspective the work that I'm doing now in light of what's been done in the past. I don't think I'll use any of the methods discussed, but it's good to know for perspective.",
    "As a mechanical engineer I learned much of the vocabulary that I will be using for the rest of my career.",
    "This course gave me how to create the artificial intelligence to interact with real environments including the social envirionment. My study is to examine the way to imporve social environments using information technology and artificial intelligence. Thus, this course could compensate the engineering aspects of my study. It was very helpful to deepen the way to design social system using technology."
