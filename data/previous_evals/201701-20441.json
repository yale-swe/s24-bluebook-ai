   "comments": [
    "Learned about copyright, trademark, and patent law through modern court cases.",
    "Absolutely knew nothing about law before taking this class (as a CS major, was very interested in the intersection of law and tech). Learned SO much, and had really fun class discussions. Definitely think I have a stronger grasp of the understanding of the legal side of technology development, and the law that surrounds our daily lives and decisions.",
    "Loved, loved, loved this course! Learned so much about IP Law and our legal system.",
    "Learned a lot about copyright, trademark, and patent law.",
    "I learned about copyright, trademark, patents, trade secrets, moral rights. I feel as though I have a strong command of the material after taking this course.",
    "I definitely improved my skills in synthesizing information to craft well-written arguments through weekly reading responses and the final paper. I learned so much about the categories and nuances of intellectual property law and how it applies to modern and landmark cases.",
    "Developed a really in depth knowledge of IP law as it applies to modern day topics. Class focuses mostly on copyright and trademark although patents and trade secrets get their time as well.",
    "A basic understanding of all things having to do with intellectual property. You do lots of case reading which is great to develop skills applicable to law school."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Tang is incredible. The course is a great introduction to the hot topics within IP.",
    "Strengths were definitely in the class discussions and the readings - I think the readings were the best way that I learned the material in the class. The discussions were never quiet or awkward- they were always lively, with almost everyone participating. I think the only weakness of this class was that it met once a week for 2 hours. Would have loved to have met possibly twice a week for an hour each - it was somewhat challenging to stay focused during the 2 hour period without getting tired.",
    "No weaknesses!",
    "A lot of reading, but the topics can be very fun since it is all modern and relatable.",
    "not applicable",
    "The biggest strength of the course is the seminar style. It facilitates absorption of material naturally through discussion and readings. The readings of court cases and articles put the law in context of how they apply to real cases as we were learning them. A weakness would be that there was little in-class discussion for the format of reading responses and the final project\/paper.",
    "Professor Tang and Lexie our TA did a great job of leading in class discussions. If you enjoyed the subject matter in 183 with Brad I think you will enjoy this class as well.",
    "This course was my favorite course of the year. The readings were very interesting, and there was just the right amount of reading that it was fun to read the different articles and cases and there was plenty to respond to for reading responses. The style of the course was great, and the workload very manageable. The reading responses were a great way to engage students and make us think deeply about the cases and how they fit together. The format of reading responses instead of tests definitely encouraged my engagement with the course and helped me think deeply about synthesizing the information, and were a great way of prompting a compare-and-contrast style of thinking about the different court cases.",
    "This course is honestly perfect. Maybe I would have pushed trademark to the beginning with all the other basic types of IP protection, but where it is now at the end is great for discussion and analysis purposes. Xiyin does and AMAZING job of both teaching and organizing this course. It really gives you a concrete understanding of how IP law works and its various applications. The one weakness of the course was that it wasn't everyday. I honestly could have come to this class everyday and had an amazing time. I always looked forward to Thursday afternoons because of this class."

   "comments": [
    "If you have any interest in law, IP, or are curious about the legal side of art and technology, take the class. It's a bit reading and writing focused but the workload is reasonable.",
    "Xiyin and Lexie do an excellent job of making the legal material presentable to students- with no background in the humanities of law, I was able to understand the material with relative ease, and the class discussions were really fun and helpful. I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who has any relative interest in entrepreneurship or technology, or for a technical\/STEM-heavy major who wants to learn more about the humanities side of their field. 10\/10.",
    "I'm not sure. I was a huge fan of CPSC 183, but this class fell short mostly in format. As for the basic facts of each kind of intellectual property, Xiyin never spent time just laying down the essentials. The class felt like it was a discussion section every time instead of a class of its own.",
    "Xiyin runs an engaging, lively seminar--she's always sharp and funny, and it's interesting to learn about intellectual property issues from a practicing lawyer in that field. The syllabus is well-organized, with a good mix of legal opinions and lighter stories from popular media outlets, etc. I came to the class from a not very adjacent field and didn't take Brad Rosen's course, but was still able to keep up--although I wouldn't call it the easiest way to get an SO credit, if that's what you're looking for! The readings can be dense. But overall, I really enjoyed the course.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. TRULY AMAZING",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course if you're interested in learning more about IP law in a comfortable setting. It's a small class and the discussions are very interesting and engaging. I genuinely looked forward to each class and enjoyed the readings.",
    "I really really loved this class. You learn a lot about intellectual property law, which I feel would be interesting to anyone. There are only 6 reading responses and the readings every week are not to long. Xiyin is amazing! She is very knowledgable, approachable and does a great job of guiding the conversation in class.",
    "Absolutely. This course was engaging, fun, and I came out of it having learned so many interesting aspects of IP and the legal world in general.",
    "Yes! A seminar with a great professor and interesting subject matter.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. The material is fascinating and the class is fun and lively. The readings were so interesting that I really enjoyed writing each reading response, making even the homework and final project fun. The course never felt like work because of how interesting and enjoyable it was both in class and outside of it.",
    "If you're interested in intellectual property law and in going into music law like I am its a must take. If not, then the class will still be very fun since Xiyin is a great professor. Just be ready to read a fair amount of cases. If you're not thinking about law\/have a passion for it I could see that getting boring, but all the cases are pretty interesting on their own."
