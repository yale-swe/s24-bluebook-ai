    "I whole-heartedly recommend Slavery and Abolition: it's a small class, dedicated to the study of an essential history that does not get nearly as much attention as it should. The workload was entirely manageable, and never entered the realm of busywork. My understanding of race in a post-slavery society has been revolutionized because of this class. I'm very grateful for that.",
    "TAKE IT. It's fascinating, not an incredibly difficult class, and really, thoroughly enjoyable.",
    "A hidden gem. Not difficult at all, and on a much wider range of topics than just black people in America. If you have an interest in the Caribbean, the age of empire, black people, women, white people, economics, Brazil, or in ensuring that your necessary credit (pre-Civil War, America history, whatever) is engaging, go and shop this as your fourth or fifth course. Professor Rugemer is bound to be engaging.",
    "OUTSTANDING! This class is a true gem, I highly recommend it to anyone. Please take the time to shop this lecture, even if you're not certain you'd be interested in the subject. You will find yourself completely captivated by Professor Rugemer's exceptional storytelling ability and academic expertise. You will realize that the history of slavery is far more relevant to modern-day life than you ever thought possible. It will become evident that the history of slavery is poorly taught in American high schools--you will question what else has been conveniently left out of your education. I left lecture and section nearly every day with the feeling that what I had learned was really, REALLY important--so important that I felt uncomfortable to realize that I hadn't known it sooner. Please, do yourself a favor and complete your liberal arts education with this brilliant and necessary class."
