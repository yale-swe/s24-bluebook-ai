    "Definitely one of my favorite classes at Yale! The teachers are all sweet and will go out of your way to help you, and earnestly want you to do well. It was a nurturing experience. Zhou laoshi is a boss, he wrote the textbook. Plus I heard Yale has the best undergrad Chinese language department in the country, so you will learn a lot and feel taken care of--you can't go wrong.",
    "Excellent class! These are the best professors you'll ever have!",
    "YES! It's a great class!",
    "If you're willing to commit in the long run it's a fun language to learn and there are so many opportunities available. However, it's a language that's easily forgotten if not maintained so I wouldn't recommend it to someone who just needs to fulfill a requirement",
    "Take this course!!!",
    "Yes, it is surprising how much you learn and it is an enjoyable class.",
    "Chinese 120 is a continuation of the well-designed program in Chinese 110. While the class requires discipline to do well, it is fun and effective (even if repetitive at times).",
    "THIS CLASS IS AMAZING. Probably my favorite class at Yale. The professors are OUTSTANDING. As long as you are ready to do the work (which is a lot), this class is truly a life-changing experience.",
    "It's a lot of work, and especially since the course packet isbrand new it isn't perfect right now. The professors are very dedicated, though, and do their best to prepare you for getting a Light Fellowship. Really ask yourself how much time and energy you can dedicate to the class before you commit.",
    "This course is really fantastic. You will leave each class period feeling like the learned something. I have heard of students being discouraged from the Chinese program due to the workload, and, while it is significant, it is very manageable. This is definitely the best course I have taken at Yale and I'm very much looking forward to continuing in the department.",
    "A great class. Definitely take it, but be prepared to commit the time every day.",
    "A great course in which you end up knowing your professors very well and if you are fortunate, you can end up touring China at no cost to you.",
    "If you've taken Chinese 110, you know what you're getting into. The class is difficult but rewarding, and the teachers genuinely care about you. I felt it was more difficult second semester than first, but both semesters offer an extensive amount of Chinese vocabulary in a short amount of time. Be prepared to learn a lot, and to enjoy daily instruction from your caring Chinese professors.",
    "A fantastic follow up to the introductory course. Perhaps a bit easier, if only because the daily workload and exercise of learning Chinese has become familiar. If you liked the first half, definitely continue on!",
    "YES, take it.",
    "I highly recommend this course, because you really learn a lot throughout the course of the semester. The language comes quickly with this course because the teachers focus on core areas",
    "If you like languages, take this course.",
    "I didn't feel like Chinese was a lot of work, actually. For me, language classes work better because the workload is spread out throughout the entire semester. If you just keep up with the daily work, you don't have to worry a lot about the exams and quizzes. Chinese class is a LOT of fun, and all the teachers are superb. Light Fellowship is also a great motivation.",
    "I would recommend every student interested in language learning shop Chinese, and that they continue to 120 if they start 110 in the Fall. There's no reason to drop it. :)",
    "Great class, but be prepared to work hard",
    "A lot of work but DEFINITELY worth it. Take it for sure if you are at all interested in Chinese. You won't regret it.",
    "Seriously, if you want to learn Chinese some time in your life, it should be at Yale. L1\/L2 with Zhou, Wang, Zhan teachers is the best.",
    "As wonderful as Chns 110. If you're going straight to L2, take it! The class is great!",
    "Could not have been more happy with the Chinese program at Yale. The structure of the classes is very effective, learning how to speak by memorizing daily conversations, providing really thorough grammar explanations, and of course, characters. The teachers are well-trained and literally work harder than the students. This year, Zhou Laoshi also revised the entire course packet, so take it next year, and you will be even more impressed! Plus it's just FUN - the teachers are hilarious and always try to incorporate cultural tidbits with videos and even cooking lessons. I'm not going to lie about the workload - it's a ton of work - but by the end of it, you'll know around 600 characters and be able to carry on pretty basic conversations. And there's Light fellowship, which you should definitely take advantage of.",
    "I'm convinced Chinese is the best language to take at Yale. Chinese 120 has been under lots of changes recently, but this year it was a great continuation of Chinese 115. Quizzes and homework were slightly more challenging, but the transition was facilitated by the warmest and most patient\/knowledgeable professors you could ask for.",
    "YES! Tons of fun, fair course, you learn a lot, and you have the opportunity to study abroad if you so desire.",
    "It's pretty much the same as 110, but another semester advanced. The work is a little harder, but that's only because you're moving more in depth in this course. I wouldn't recommend this course if you're just trying to get your language requirement done: take something other than Chinese. If you do want to learn Chinese, however, it's a solid course, and will help your speaking\/reading\/writing abilities immensely.",
    "I highly recommend this course if you are willing to do a language that requires lots of memorization and work. Maybe not the best choice for people with other time intensive classes. Anyway, you have to take 120 to get credit for 110, and your knowledge and understanding of Chinese culture will be enriched at the same time as your knowledge of the language.",
    "Excellent way to learn the language!",
    "I would 100% recommend continuing Chinese through 120. Though not quite as amazing as Chinese 110, as the thrill has worn off to a certain extent (though by no means entirely), it remains one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you want to learn Chinese seriously. I would not recommend it if you just want to take it to pass the language requirement because it is a lot of work and it will be too much if you don't enjoy it. But if you really want to get good at Chinese like I do then you can't ask for much more really. I would definitely take the class if I were to go back and have to decide again.",
    "It's a very hard course, so if you cannot spend some time for Chinese everyday and you're lazy, don't take this couse. If you have Chinese friends and would like to talk to them in their mother tongue, you should take this. It's hard but a fun course!",
    "I would recommend Chinese 120 to another student who is willing to put in the effort. Taking Chinese at Yale is definitely a lifestyle choice, it does take up a lot of time. If you are willing to commit, taking Chinese is definitely worth it. You will also meet a lot of other really motivated students in the process which is really nice as well. Overall it has been a good decision for me.",
    "This course is just as excellent as the first semester of Chinese was. If you're looking at taking this, you probably have to take L2 to get credit for L1\/L2 chinese, so you don't really have a choice, but you're in for an excellent semester nevertheless. I'm still really impressed at the course material that the teachers write specifically tailored to the course, and I feel like my Chinese improved a lot over the course of 2nd semester. Definitely worth your time, and if you put in the effort, you can certainly get an A.",
    "The same deal as Chinese 110. If you put in the work you get the grade. The structure of the classes is very similar to first semester. I would say the tests were a little harder than first semester, but they aren't unmanageable. TAKE IT.",
    "If you're taking Chinese 120, it's because you've already taken Chinese 110. AND THEY'RE BOTH AWESOME.",
    "Take Chinese! The teachers (though I hear they may be changing) are great! They really care about you. And class is fun.",
    "I would recommend the course.",
    "Chinese 120 is the continuation of 110 and is an excellent class. You really learn a lot of Chinese, and the teachers are all very supportive.",
    "Please take this class! It's not as hard as people say it is. You just have homework every day and I liked the structure!",
    "This course is highly recommended. No language is as well taught at Yale as Chinese.",
    "Highly recommendable",
    "Chinese 120 is fascinating, with a large return on time invested, and a bonding experience amongst students and teachers. It is also a *lot* of work. So, take it if you want to learn Chinese, or just in general if you want to learn a language very different from English. It is *not* the class you should take just to fill your language requirement, though.",
    "I would definitely recommend l2 Chinese, not only because you have to take it if you want ant credit, but also because its really cool.",
    "Second semester of Chinese at Yale is just as good as the first. The course packet that Zhou laoshi and Wang laoshi spent the semester creating is fantastic. I don\u0092t think the work is much more than any other language class (daily worksheets and quizzes which will take you maybe and hour a day total to complete\/prepare for). Also, if you\u0092re lucky you\u0092ll get into a sweet section and make some good friends too, who you\u0092ll be seeing every day in class. A lot of people slack off second semester because there\u0092s no long the pressure to do well to get Light Fellowships, so if you stay on top of things you should be fine. Highly recommended.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Though it will consume your life."
