    "This class was a lecture course, so pretty much all you had to do wwas sit there and lok at the slides. Since this course was taught to both Yale and Chinese students, there was a lot of line-by-line explanation going on, which made it too easy not to do the reading. This tripped me up on the Shakespeare portion when Minnis did less explanation and more actual lecturing, so at least do the Shakespeare reading. Would recommend for people who need to take an English course but don't feel comfortable talking in class.",
    "Overall if you are interested in exploring more about Shakespeare and Chaucer, check out this class, and at the very least you'll have a good time listening to Professor Minnis. I really can't say enough about how much it was a pleasure to have a class with Professor Minnis! I had the great pleasure also of getting to travel with him in China, as a part of the Yale-PKU program, and that was also really great fun. Professor Minnis is a really nice and experienced teacher and a scholar to boot. One thing that I must also emphasize if you take this class or other classes with him is that you should be sure to chat with him generally as well, since he has lots of interesting stories to tell!This was a fine class and a nice study of both Chaucer and Shakespeare; though the two were not taught in as much comparison as I had first expected, it was still a fun and new experience. I'm a big fan of english lit but have not studied similar courses at Yale because of other major requirements. I think this was a good course particularly for people with less exposure to the topics, and in some senses I felt unhappy because I had had some more exposure to some of the material. However, Professor Minnis is really nice and I think made the course still very interesting and fun. Though I am not a fan of lectures, Professor Minnis is really great and his lectures are very, very excellently prepared and very engaging. That being said, I think that because this class was taught at PKU, things tended to drag - perhaps moreso with the Chaucer - because pacing was adjusted for our fellow students for whom English was not their usual language of instruction. When we moved on to Shakespeare, this became less frustrating, and I think that the pacing picked up a little bit. So overall I think that if you are taking this class at Yale, things would be different in that respect. Overall if you are interested in exploring more about Shakespeare and Chaucer, check out this class, and at the very least you'll have a good time listening to Professor Minnis.",
    "Definitely."
