    "It is an intense reading load, but I think that this is a strength for those who take it seriously. I learned a huge amount in one semester, but I really engaged with the readings. David Sorkin has a pedagogical model somewhat different than the average seminar course, such that he is very focused on learning content. Comparatively, I learned much more in this class for this reason, but there is less focus on student discussion."
