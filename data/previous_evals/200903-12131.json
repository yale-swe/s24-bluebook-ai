    "YES I would definitely recommend AMST 410 to any student interested in issues of gender, ethnicity, race, migration, the construction of history and voice, Asian Americans, etc...",
    "YES I WOULD! I think it is a pity that Asian American themed classes are only taken by a few number of people (most of them Asians). But the topics we discuss are not confined to Asian Americans per say, because we focus more on how to put this particular group of people in historical context. We evaluate social changes, critique on social systems that affect individuals and groups alike. Discussions are very fun, although the reading load and four short essays along with a huge research paper (20-25 pages) are quite hard to manage.",
    "Great class, interesting topics. Professor Lui is the best! Take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in Asian American history. It was a great way to see how different groups of immigrant women have coped with their experiences and hardships while trying to conform to their new situation.",
    "This is really a class which gives you a new perspective on under-discussed topics: 1. Asian American history and 2. the struggles of minority women, which aren't properly captured by mainstream history or the brand of mainstream feminism which is so prevalent at Yale."
