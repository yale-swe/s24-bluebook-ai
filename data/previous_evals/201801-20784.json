   "comments": [
    "The lectures are not super helpful overall. I did almost all my learning in section. There is very little conceptual work its almost all problem solving.",
    "lecturer was hard to understand and did not really explain terms slowly so everyone could understand",
    "All the teaching fellows were not very helpful with the exception of Eoin.",
    "I felt that the lectures were really well organized. I could tell that Professor Goldberg was very prepared and I really enjoyed her concise explanations and emphasis on the intuition of the material as opposed to just the math involved.",
    "Section and lectures are not at all helpful for actually learning the course material that we'll be tested on. Would be helpful to actually learn how the two are linked.",
    "I did not find the course material very interesting or applicable to my life. I think the course primarily taught conventional ways of expressing what already seemed intuitive to me, and it did not really change the way I think. I liked that the lectures, assignments, and tests were all relevant to the material, and I never thought that I wasn't sufficiently prepared by\/for the class. At the same time, I think some of the more difficult concepts would've benefited from more elaboration\/explanation.",
    "For someone who already has strong math skills, this course would be a decent introduction to economics. However, for those who have a harder time with maths already, ECON115 was difficult. Eoin was a huge help",
    "I thought classes were good but I got nothing out of section",
    "Sometimes the problem sets did not line up well timing-wise with the lectures - we would often learn the things that we needed to know in order to do the problem set a day after it was due.",
    "Strengths: my TF was great and I learned a lot about an important subject. Weaknesses: my TF is leaving and the lectures were pretty lackluster.",
    "Strengths: focus on marginal analysis; professor willing to engage with and help students. Weaknesses: lectures not worth going to, which meant I was a lot less engaged with the course. Final was heavy on the conceptual questions, which we weren't really prepared for and wasn't given sufficient attention on the practice finals. There were several instances in which pset questions were about content we hadn't yet covered, which became problematic at times.",
    "It's a lecture, which is always a weakness. I think it's too theoretical in class. It needs more practice problems in class, especially since there is a lot of wasted time that could be put to that use.",
    "The lectures were often redundant and not very engaging, and I think that this has a lot to due with the instructor.",
    "Better lectures, with less repetition at the beginning of each one, would be good!",
    "I think the course is well-taught and I began to see that more as the year progressed. I really appreciated the recaps at the beginning of each class. The TAs, however, could definitely be improved. Eoin is a phenomenal teacher and all the others for the most part were unhelpful. Additionally, it was sometimes hard to understand them.",
    "The lecture perhaps could be more engaging but I lack the economic knowledge to recommend content improvements.",
    "It was very hard to get engaged with the course.",
    "The course was a good introduction to these concepts, but the material was very dry.",
    "This course did not have as much small group engagement as it could have had.",
    "I think that the lectures can be improved to be more engaging for students.",
    "So boring. The concepts are interested but presented in an unengaging way.",
    "The strengths were that Goldberg was great at explaining things and putting them in context. The psets were very similar to the tests, which I think is fair. The greatest weakness were that the psets often dealt with material that we would cover the day after turning them in. Honestly, it seemed like an organization problem, but if purposeful it was not conducive for our learning!",
    "I didn't like how some of the material on the problem sets weren't covered in lecture until after the problem set was due.",
    "Strengths: it only lasted a semester Weaknesses: everything else",
    "I thought that the course covered a lot of important material, however it was not always clearly explained and examples were rarely provided, sometimes making the problem sets difficult.",
    "Strengths: Professor Goldberg!! Eoin!! Nic Snashall-Woodhams! Weaknesses: I think most of my classmates felt very disengaged and the structure of the course did not help to amend that.",
    "Strengths: Sections; power-point slide lectures; a lot of office hours\/extra-help resources Weaknesses: Not a very engaging lecture; conceptual importance of certain information is not emphasized enough",
    "it isn't taught at the introductory level... people with experience in economics should not be in the same course as those with no exposure",
    "I think that this course is exactly where it needs to be. There was an adequate amount of resources for the students to use, and it certainly allowed those who had no prior knowledge the ability to succeed.",
    "I think that the course is well-designed, however the problem sets did not always correlate with the week's lectures, which they should, since the textbook was not required.",
    "The class is simultaneously very basic but also it is a lot to take in if you are new to the subject. It is taught in a large lecture setting and it can be easy to tune out - so you have to make sure you are actively listening. The slides move fast. And the information all builds up on the other.",
    "Horribly organised course, sometimes had to do problem sets without even learning the material.",
    "THE GRADING! Psets NEED to be worth more than 5 points per pset. Sometimes the professor will be behind in the course material, and you will end up doing a pset on material you have never learned. THIS IS A PROBLEM because you may make a few mistakes (given that you haven't learned it), but if you make a few mistakes (like 2-3), you will get a 4\/5 which really hurts your grade! Psets are fairly hard, but manageable. Also, I would have preferred SHORTER classes. 75 minutes is a LONG lecture, and many people begin to zone out after 50 minutes which can be detrimental. Maybe 3 lectures\/week?",
    "The lectures are incredibly boring and hard to follow and the sections dont clear up much. It would be really helpful if the TFs could guide us on the problem sets more because when they just skirt around the actual questions as to avoid giving the answer I dont really learn anything.",
    "Lecture class, so harder to stay focused. Section should be structured more like a review of topics, rather than doing problems on our own.",
    "I learned how to efficiently do problem sets",
    "This course is well-taught in section, but lectures always felt a bit disjointed from the problem sets and midterms. It seems that Econ works better in a smaller setting -- if you can take 110, you probably should. Otherwise, this isn't a horrible introductory course, and it prepared me well for further study in the field.",
    "There was a large discrepancy between section TAs. Eoin was fantastic, and luckily I switched into his section. I learned a lot about how to apply theory and concepts to mathematical situations in section. However, I found other sections taught by other TAs to be lacking.",
    "Lecture is hard to pay attention to. Course is very well structured, psets and exams are very well written and there were many resources to help.",
    "This course is really straightforward, and it has a lot of support outside of the lecture. However for people without some background knowledge of econ, it can move really fast",
    "Boring",
    "It was very informative, but I wish we went slower in lecture",
    "The lectures were very boring and confusing, and often were not structured in an effective way to facilitate student learning and knowledge. I ended up teaching myself the material before the tests. The problem sets were engaging and involved problem solving skills. The overall course was incredibly organized, and the teaching fellows were very helpful at explaining material that was presented in lecture.",
    "Strengths: plenty of resources, amazing TA's, kind professor Weaknesses: lectures are not dynamic (do not facilitate learning that well)",
    "Sometimes the problem sets were assigned before the material was taught in class",
    "N\/A",
    "I think the course moves too quickly through the material and many of the lectures have to be supplemented with the textbook or individual study. I like that they offer many resources to find extra help, but often, these are overcrowded and particular questions don't get answered. I think some TFs are a lot better than others, and as a result, some kids go to section more than others.",
    "Great prof.",
    "The strengths include the clearness of the lectures, the amount of sections and office hours available throughout the week, and having edited lecture notes along with several old materials for review on canvas for students to study from. The weakness is the timing of having problem sets returned, because I found myself making similar mistakes on problem sets since I would not get back the previous ones in time to understand that I had made mistakes on them.",
    "The sections were great, the lecture could be more engaging",
    "TAs were good",
    "Strengthes: slides on canvas to be accessed whenever, P-sets that cover good range of topics, information represented in different types (formulas, words, graphs) for everyone to understand, good balance of mathematical evaluation and conceptual understanding Weakness: None",
    "This course was well-organized. However, it could have helped if they emphasized how essential a knowledge of math would be to the course.",
    "I think this course should explain the math better, explain what a derivative is, and therefore why it is useful for determining marginal quantities, instead of just saying \"use slope\"",
    "The course was generally well organized. My one complaint was that for a couple of the problem sets the relevant material had not been and was not scheduled to be covered before the homework was do.",
    "Strengths: logical progression Weaknesses: there was a terrible pattern in which the lectures were behind the problem sets.",
    "I think the lecture slides could have been more legible. Having graphs prepared for the final slides would be helpful. It can be a little slow in lecture.",
    "This course was well taught and had interesting material. It could be improved by having more accessible office hours from TF's and peer tutors. I went to peer tutor hours and no one was there.",
    "Interesting, but lectures were a little boring at times.",
    "Exams could be made closer to the PSETs and lectures should include problem solving examples. Apart from that, it's a very well-organized and well-structured course.",
    "Lectures were dull. TFs were useless. I never received a single actionable piece of feedback on my problem sets - only question marks, like those were supposed to magically help me understand concepts. I often felt in sections like TFs were unprepared to teach the subject material - several times, after members of the class asked questions, they adjusted their answers to the problem set that were doing wrote on the board. Only saving grace was Eoin McGuirk - energetic and clear, if a little prone to overexplanation.",
    "The fact that this course fails to address the calculus background of economics does it a disservice by removing it from a logical, connected system and instead teaching it as disparate parts accessible through memorization. Also, the lecture addressed the conceptual parts while the PSETS addressed the mathematical parts, creating a disconnect, once again dividing the course into separate chunks. I think it would serve every student MUCH better if the math was taught more effectively in lecture, and the PSETS strove to strike a balance between concept and math more.",
    "Honestly, this class was VERY, VERY frustrating. As someone who'd never taken economics before, I knew I was in for a tough time. But COME ON! This was probably one of the most irritating academic experiences I've ever had. Meeting two times a week for 1 hour and 15 minutes was inadequate. The structure of this course was NOT conducive to student learning. We learn the most basic form of whatever we're studying in lecture, and then we're asked to apply that information to extremely difficult problems. We hardly ever do numerical examples in lecture. Although we do them in section, having a base-level example from the lecture itself would've made a HUGE difference (in my opinion). We're also expected to rely on out-of-class resources and example problems from previous years. Sure, it was helpful having old problem sets, exams, and section materials to use. However, it's too easy to turn to example problems for help when you get stuck on problem sets instead of working through them. I just don't think this class was structured in a way that would maximize students learning and success."

    "Yes if you are interested in majoring in econ",
    "Do not take it unless necessary for a major requirement",
    "I would suggest that a student only take this course if they are truly interested in pursuing economics as a major. Even then, this course doesn't count towards the major.",
    "Intro Micro is about as bland of a course as you can get. You're not learning anything groundbreaking or super interesting, a lot of it is just basic stuff that's a necessary foundation to the more advanced level material. However, the best part of the course was Professor Goldberg. Although she could be a bit dry at times (but what lecture isn't dry), it was amazing to learn from such an accomplished and smart woman. You could tell that she really wanted the students to take away something from the course even if they aren't planning on pursuing a career in economics.",
    "I personally was not a fan of the course. I wanted to try out economics, and it wasn't for me. I recommend trying it out though! A great intro course to get your foot in the water.",
    "I mean, it's an intro class that many people have to take, but I wouldn't recommend taking it for fun.",
    "Unless you are determined to pursue economics or it is necessary for what you plan on studying, I would not jump to take the class. I'm glad I used it to fulfill my QR requirement, but by itself, I was not radically changed by the class.",
    "YES! Pinelopi is such a great professor.",
    "Yes, decent intro course if you want to learn about econ",
    "You definitely learn a lot in this course, but you end up working through a lot of the material on your own.",
    "Yes. Despite my dislike of the organization of the class, Econ is a particularly important subject and I thought it was interesting to learn about. Please do the best you can to find a good TF though.",
    "If your prospective major requires Econ, then you should take it anyways. Taking Micro and Macro will open up so many higher-level lectures and seminars, and if you're remotely interested in the field, then Micro and Macro are good to have. Micro teaches a new way of looking at things from an economic perspective, which I find really useful. If you have a lighter semester, however, I would try to get into Tolga Koker's section of 110, because you get better teaching (but a slightly heavier workload, and lectures are required).",
    "Only if they really need a QR credit or are interested in Econ.",
    "I would not recommend this course because I feel like it could have been taught better.",
    "No. The theory is boring and (with a few exceptions) almost self-explanatory. Section is extraordinarily boring and nearly useless. TFs comments on PSETs are also useless (I never received feedback on what went wrong in my problem sets -- just question marks next to places I went wrong.) Saving grace of this course is Eoin McGuirk, who is an engaging and fun lecturer and TF.",
    "Yes. Everyone should learn Econ basics and this is a great way to do it.",
    "If they are interested in Economics or market forces more generally, this is the place to start.",
    "I would recommend it if you are naturally very interested in microeconomics. If not, it's really difficult to get engaged and do well.",
    "Yes, if they want to understand if they like economics, then they should take this course to figure it out.",
    "Only if they are majoring in economics or EPE; it is one of the least interesting courses offered at Yale and is not a fun QR for a non-STEM major or a fun SC credit for a non-social sciences major.",
    "Yes. It is a great introduction to economics.",
    "I think this class was helpful for getting a taste of economics but I personally did not enjoy the subject.",
    "Boring. Do not take.",
    "Yes, this class teaches pretty simple things which help you think about the world in a different way. Especially if you're comfortable with quantitative reasoning, the psets are all very straightforward, very relevant for the tests, and pretty fun to do. Review your notes after class.",
    "Yes, I think in material, this was a great class to take. I think that the lecture wasn't very engaging so in that respect I might urge them to take the seminar.",
    "Lol no.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student interested in economics, however I think I would suggest the seminar version because the lecture was often not very clear or engaging.",
    "Yes, microeconomics is a big requirement for a lot of majors, and this course is a good first step in.",
    "For students interested in economics or who value the conceptual importance of economics, this course is a good start. Students must be engaged in order to succeed, however.",
    "Yes",
    "absolutely not. instructor was lovely but the course itself sets any kid from a disadvantaged high school up for failure-- this was super disappointing and my heart breaks for the first-years whose mental health suffered as a result",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it taught me things that I needed to know. It is extremely useful to have this foundation off of which to build more knowledge.",
    "Yes, I thought it gave me a good feel of economics and helped me decide that I want to continue with the subject matter.",
    "I'd recommend it as an intro microecon course, but would not recommend it for fun. It's necessary for starting to learn econ.",
    "It's a really interesting course: it doesn't really have gimmicks or memes during lecture to hook you in, but it covers seem really cool topics (particularly in the second half) and is taught in a clear, straightforward way. It's unlikely to completely change your outlook on life, but it is interesting and really worth taking. I'd definitely recommend it. (Also, make sure to read the textbook - it definitely makes learning the material easier.)",
    "Good, relevant stuff to know. Many majors need it. Take it for some intro econ that can be ~kinda~ relevant, but don't go into this thinking that you will be applying ECON 115 to your everyday life because you won't. A lot of what you learn is fairly abstract.",
    "If you want to be an econ major you have to take it. Also its good to know the basics of micro.",
    "Yes - the material was interesting.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. It was a good way to start the econ track",
    "I would recommend the seminar-based version of this course to another student -- I only understood the material fully after section each week, which I imagine was similar. I did also have Eoin as a TA, though, which could've skewed the experience positively -- I'm not sure how section went with other TAs.",
    "An interesting course on Econ. Manageable and straightforward, but not thrilling.",
    "Yes! Very nice if you have no experience with economics and want to learn the basics.",
    "I feel like it is an important course to take at least once, and it was a good QR credit that will feel relevant to many majors.",
    "Yes I really enjoyed the course",
    "Ya",
    "No",
    "Yes, because it is a good introductory course to economics",
    "If you are interested in economics or math, yes. The lectures were really boring and very hard to sit through. The problem sets were fun if you like problem solving and math, and I found the material to be interesting.",
    "This course is a prereq to a lot of other courses so in many cases, one doesn't really have a choice about taking it. I took the course to see if I would like economics - I enjoyed the material, just the class was not well organized nor engaging.",
    "Yes! It offers a simplified look into the idea of a market, and the different economic situations. Teaches a valuable understanding of the economy around us.",
    "Yes I think it gives you a good foundation for understanding economics",
    "N\/A",
    "I would recommend this course if you are genuinely interested in the material or pursuing economics in the future. If you are taking this class for a QR credit, however, I think there are better and easier options. The class doesn't require that much of a math background but much of the problem-solving requires the same skillset. I did enjoy learning about the real-world applications, which motivated my desire to take the class and understand the influence of economics in political decision-making.",
    "With Prof. Goldberg, then yes. Otherwise, no. She made the course GREAT.",
    "Yes, because I think it is a good course that helps people understand the basics of the economic world.",
    "Yes its a great introduction",
    "Yes. I would recommend it for all econ majors as it is a required class as well as to other students as it gives a general overview of what micro-economics or as a whole, what economics looks like and provides good information to be an economically aware citizen.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who already feels comfortable with microeconomics or if it's a requirement for a major.",
    "Yes, it is an excellent introduction to the field of micro economics.",
    "I would recommend for building a solid base in microecon.",
    "I think everyone at Yale should probably take this course at some point. You might prefer the seminar, but it has some important lessons unless you took Econ in high school.",
    "Only take this course if you are actually interested in economics. If you are only taking it just for the sake of taking it, you probably will not engage with it enough to do well. With that said, the content of the course is interesting. But make sure you get a good TF.",
    "I would because it's very useful for not just your career at Yale, but also for general knowledge.",
    "Yes, it's a must-have course pursuing anything further in economics. Don't try to skip it even if you have a strong econ background!",
    "No - take the Seminar. This course convinced me I should only take seminars at Yale.",
    "No. I have heard from many, many students, and in keeping with my own opinions, that they went into this course interested in economics and truly disliked it and were discouraged from taking any more economics. This course seems to be a weeder course, which is a shame, because I think many students truly only want to take one or two economics classes to understand the basic economic background of the world, and when they are treated as necessary but not intellectually stimulating courses that must be taken for an Economics major, the students who take the class simply because they want to learn the material cannot derive any enjoyment from it.",
    "Unless a student absolutely has to take this course for their major (or wants an in-depth introduction to economics), I would not recommend this class. Someone could probably learn the same amount of information (or more) by watching Khan Academy (as I did) or reading a textbook by themselves. I just did not enjoy this class, and I couldn't want to put anyone else through it."
