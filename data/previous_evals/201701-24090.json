    "This course goes through the traditional classical chinese poetry canon. Really rewarding stuff to read that will impress any actual chinese person because they all learn it in primary\/middle school. Reading professor bender's translations was much more useful in learning about the cultural context and attempting any kind of literary analysis than translating on our own.",
    "translation skills from classical Chinese to English, literary analysis skills (some ways to read poetry), Chinese reading skills, tidbits of Chinese history illuminated by poetry, some Chinese literary history and themes across the poetic canon"

    "It was a little unclear, especially at the beginning, who the course was designed for. Mixing lots of japan-focused EALL grad students with undergrads who were not EALL majors was pretty bizarre, but fine in the end",
    "I think the format of the course is great, and it would change depending on the needs of students in the course. the cohort this year was pretty diverse, so at times perhaps it was hard to cater to everyone's needs but luke did a good job of navigating this challenge. turning in weekly translations started happening about halfway into the semester, and I think this is a good way to keep students accountable and know where they are at. perhaps in the next iteration of the course, this format could remain."

    "I'd definitely recommend this course if you have some experience with classical chinese (at least through 171). The material is very enjoyable and rewarding, and bender is great! He occasionally re-enacts lines of poetry and it's the best.",
    "absolutely. luke is a fantastic professor and really helps make classical chinese poetry interesting and accessible. class discussions never failed to be interesting, which I think speaks a lot to luke's ability to make the material come alive. the course is conducted in English, but readings are in classical Chinese and you are expected to translate poems into English weekly. some experience with classical Chinese is probably ideal, and hopefully you enjoy translating too (you read a lot of poems). the course pretty much flies through the Chinese poetic canon from the shijing to song ci, which is a lot of material. but at the end of the class, I walked away with some knowledge of a broad range of works and styles, and the resources to delve into any particular area in greater depth. I think the course is especially great for people who may have had some exposure to some aspects of classical Chinese poetry and are looking for a broader overview, and are looking to develop skills to read and translate these works.",
    "I 100% recommend you take this class. Professor Bender is amazingly passionate about the poetry, and he presents you with poems written over 1000 years ago that give you goosebumps."
