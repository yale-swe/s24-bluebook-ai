   "comments": [
    "Good class, if you're willing to delve into some complicated theoretical thinking. I felt behind most of the semester, but the class allows each person to select paper topics that they feel comfortable with, so this was not a problem. Good class, cool readings, great professor.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone who is not required to take it for the WGSS major. It is much too broad an overview of feminist theory to get much out of it and the workload is way beyond acceptable.",
    "Absolutely take this class. This intellectual tradition is fascinating and everyone who was in the seminar was deeply dedicated to understanding and exploring it. It is shocking to see how so many of the dilemmas that these women faced years ago have not been solved in any sense and still face us today. There is a lot of reading, but it is all brilliant. Laura Wexler is an engaging and smart Professor. She has the ability to make everything that everyone says in seminar appear far more profound than it actually was.",
    "I definitely recommend the course. The reading load in heavy, but I admit that I didn't do all of it and Prof. Wexler was understanding - she recognized that the load was intense and that we might not be able to complete it all every week. However, the discussion always remained lively and I felt like it was a very open environment that encouraged discussion and debate.",
    "History of U.S. Feminist Thought is an in-depth of feminist theory in the United States from the suffrage movement to the present day. It combines canonical texts with less well-known works. It's a great class and Professor Wexler is brilliant and incredibly nice and approachable.The class size was very large this semester, which definitely put a cramp in the \"seminar\" style, but even despite that it was still very engaging.",
    "I'm conflicted. The material is very good, Laura Wexler is incredibly lovely and understanding and, like, VERY smart. Listening to her talk about feminism and culture is a treat that I would recommend to anyone who thinks they might be interested.On the other hand, the structure is sort of peculiar and maybe needs work. I think it is pretty well-known that Wexler assigns an absurd amount of reading. FORTUNATELY, she is open about the fact that you should do only as much as you can do without killing yourself. However, this led to a lack of accountability and also to somewhat disjointed class discussion.",
    "This is an intro Feminist class. If you are just getting into feminist studies, its the class for you, if you are a WGSS major or an individual with experienced background in feminist and queer theory this class is too introductory.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! It was very intense theory and a ton of reading, but I learned so incredibly much and enjoyed it all! Really an amazing, mind-bending course!",
    "Yes of course! For me at least it's been one of the most life-impacting classes I've taken at yale-but only for its content and the professor.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! This was one of the best seminars that I have ever taken. The readings and discussions are fascinating and the assignments provide a lot of flexibility so that you can actually pursue your own interests. I think that women and men would very much appreciate the intellectual history presented in this course. The material is wonderful to learn about and also very relevant to where the struggle for women's rights and equality stands today. Professor Wexler is also incredible and very approachable. Take this class!!",
    "i would recommend this to a student interested in learning more about feminist history or feminist theory. it's a great intro.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in understanding a framework of thought. This course does not force anyone to buy into feminist thought, instead it offers feminist thought as a starting point on which to build or diverge and develop your own framework. This course was so much more than I thought it was going to be in the best way possible.",
    "Great readings, totally wonderful and brilliant (and kind! how often does that happen?) professor whose presence you will feel privileged to be in on a weekly basis. The only downside is that there is just way too much reading. Like, we're talking several books a week. Take the course, because it's a really great learning experience, but do so in a way that the workload feels manageable, for example by doing the bulk of the reading over the summer."
