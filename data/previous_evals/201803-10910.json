    "Variety of new econometric methodologies and models, intersections with machine learning, structural vs reduced form, interesting hybrids of the two.",
    "I learned about empirical methods in economics and how to use them for public policy.",

   "comments": [
    "I like that this course fleshes out certain econometric topics that are commonly useful in applied research but not emphasized in the core metrics courses. I also like that it provides a little more structure to the second-year paper assignment, even though there is no real bridge between that assignment and the rest of the course.",
    "I really enjoyed getting to see more recent\/\"frontier\" methods rather than just the usual textbook models. Lectures were engaging in general. In all quarters, it would be nice to have more time spent on applications of the methods - in particular, in what situations are these models most commonly applied, when are they useful or likely to provide interesting results, where has the empirical literature used them, what are the data requirements in terms of sample size etc. For example, with many of the panel models, it was not clear to me when it would be appropriate or important to use them, as compared to standard FE\/RE. Thus, especially in parts 1\/2, perhaps less time on theory, equivalencies between different approaches and such theoretical results, and more time talking about papers that use these, when in your research should you think about using these models, etc.",
    "The main strength of the course is that it is taught by three professors and covers many topics.",
    "Strengths: Good choice of topics. Excellent instruction."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wanted to review\/deepen their knowledge of applied econometric techniques. I would also recommend this course to a student who wanted to get their second-year paper out of the way but did not have much of an idea of how they were going to do so. To a student who already has an idea to work on for their paper and a faculty member to work with, the additional structure of the class probably wouldn't be very helpful, and may impose unnecessary timing restrictions.",
    "Yes, any economics student should go beyond the 1st year classes in metrics and see some newer stuff. Especially the 3rd part of the class was a nice synthesis of recent work and approaches in econ.",
    "Yes I would recommend it, because it is important to know about empirical methods in economics.",
    "I would recommend the course to 2nd year economics PhD students."
