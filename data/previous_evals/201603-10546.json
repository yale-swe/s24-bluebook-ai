   "comments": [
    "In Historical and Political Thought, we learned a range of history and politics from many different historians and politicians. Very glad to have learned from the great minds of Herodotus, Livy, Machiavelli, etc.",
    "How to think historically. History of political thought from Herodotus to Machiavelli. Developing historical arguments in a paper.",
    "I think perhaps I gained a greater understanding of ancient political theory and how it was closely related to philosophical thinking.",
    "In taking this course, I have developed a new way of thinking that was once foreign to me. It has encouraged me to be more inquisitive and critical of arguments presented in novels and in seminar settings, which in turn has made me further develop my own ideas in my writing assignments and class discussion.",
    "This course helped develop my close reading skills. I feel that I learned how to approach a large portion of text and understand how to break it down into smaller portions and focus on details within the text to help understand to bigger ideas within the works we read.",
    "I learned more about Ancient Greece and Rome than I ever had before. But even though I feel like I did learn something, it's kind of a nebulous concept of something...I couldn't really recount many concrete ideas."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is very solid and does not need to be improved.",
    "Sometimes the assigned readings for a day is so immense that one discussion section can not effectively discuss and cover all the material. In this sense, I feel that the large reading load is not conducive to a good learning experience. However, the professor does a good job in providing guiding questions to attempt to foster a better conversation.",
    "DS H&P provides a great starting point for the study of Western historical and political thought. I thought the syllabus was great. My only suggestion (and this goes for all of my DS classes) would be to have reduced the class size. Often times I had difficulty participating in class because there were too many other students who had things to stay. A smaller class would have made discussion better. Even so, I think classes were small enough to engender thoughtful discourse.",
    "I felt very interested in the historical texts, and the political theory was sometimes interesting. But too often it felt like Philosophy 2, and it felt as though the texts we were reading really didn't have much to do with the historic world or even political thought.",
    "while the class was enjoyable this section of the program seems to suffer from a disjointed identity crises. This section needs to be more focused so a student can get more from the text selection and discussion.",
    "A strength of this course was the level of discussion promoted in the seminar sections. I enjoyed the small seminar setting as a way to take apart these larger works and valued the input from both the Professor and my classmates. One weakness of the course is that there is so much to read and what feels like not much time to discuss the works, so sometimes it felt like we were rushing through a work and i would have liked another class to discuss some of the works.",
    "The identification questions on the final exam were unnecessarily difficult and at times irrelevant to the topics discussed in the work cited. Pulling a quotation about gymnastics from the Republic and putting it on the final? Seriously? I understand that the DS faculty may be bored of using the same quotations every year, but frankly, you've got a lot of better, more relevant pages to choose from. It was borderline ridiculous.",
    "I didn't have a clear sense of how political thought evolved throughout the readings we did. It felt like we were just picking up a different author each week and breezing through without making enough comparisons between what we read. I guess I expected to leave the class with some idea about \"schools of political thought,\" but mostly we just read interesting passages and discussed each author individually, not in context. It would be possible for a student to zone out one week and completely ignore that author, and then pick up next week fully equipped to talk and participate, which doesn't really make sense, you would expect everything to build together."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend Directed Studies to other students. It is a dream come true to learn from so many great minds.",
    "Professor Renaud is an excellent section leader. You'd be very lucky to be placed in his section.",
    "DS is an one-in-a-life time experience; 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Yes. I didn't know anything about historians like Herodotus and Tacitus before taking this course, but DS H&P gave me a great respect for them. Seeing how political thinking evolved from Herodotus to Machiavelli was an invaluable experience.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in examining the evolution of Western historiography.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this course, alongside the other two Directed Studies courses, only to students who have an interest in intensive reading and who wish to vastly improve their critical thinking and writing skills. Though I ultimately intended to pursue either Electrical Engineering or Architecture, I saw these classes as a chance to see whether or not I would be interested in pursuing any majors related to Humanities. Though it has not changed my mind about what I want to pursue, I see them as worthwhile distributional requirements, ones in which students are given the opportunity to cover some of the most well-known texts in history. I have enjoyed challenging myself in these three courses, and I encourage all students, whether they are interested in Humanities or in Engineering, to consider taking Directed Studies.",
    "DS is a great program if you really want to read these classic texts. I would recommend DS if you are interested in getting a solid background in the classics, even if you do not plan on continuing with humanities in the future. It is ALOT of reading, but it is manageable, and the consistent paper schedule with no midterms is a nice way to have a balanced schedule with a workload that for the most part is evenly spread throughout the semester.",
    "DS is a package deal, so yes, I would recommend this course even if I had not liked it at all in order to take the other two DS courses. Fortunately, there was a lot to like in the H&P syllabus, lectures, and ensuing discussions. I've never been the biggest fan of history or politics, but viewing the two through the lens of thought (the way people thought about the two over the course of time) made things much more interesting. This is not a class about dates and facts. It's about the evolution of the way people conceptualized history and politics itself, and I find that pretty cool.",
    "Yes! It's a great course!"
