   "comments": [
    "Wir treffen jeden Morgen seit zweiten Stunden. Es ist sehr intensiv, aber es hilft mir, schnell Deutsch zu lernen.",
    "Frau Sippel was great and was probably the highlight of the course. She was very good about keeping track of the vocabulary and grammatical structures that we had already learned, so that there were very few times when she said something in class that we wouldn't have been able to understand. The two hours might seem like a lot but it goes by pretty quickly. No real weaknesses to speak of.",
    "Der Unterricht ist sehr intensiv, und die Studenten mssen viel lesen.",
    "The course covers a lot of material. The approach is chiefly communicative, which in truth isn't really my taste: I prefer a literary or writing approach because that is why I am learning German. However, Lisel is an AMAZING instructor and anyone who wants to learn German ought learn from her. She knows what she's doing. I would not have survived this class without her. She makes sure you get it right and is never satisfied with second best. The breath of the course is definitely challenging. I very much struggled to keep up. I also found Connect sort of inane. It's a really annoying system and paper homework is a lot more effective. Weekly tests are their own challenge but important."

   "comments": [
    "Ja, ich empfehle diesen Kurs zu 100%.",
    "Yes -- definitely take if you have the time and want to learn a new language quickly. I didn't feel like I sacrificed too much in terms of taking intensive versus a full-year sequence. It was definitely nice to feel myself learning so quickly.",
    "I will recommend this class to students who are very interested taking German and seriously thinking about learning the language instead of taking the just for credits.",
    "I would, but it is a lot of work. Please plan ahead. It is not a good course to have as a fourth or fifth class! I made that mistake!",
    "It depends on how much time you and energy you are willing to devote to it. If you have the time and gumption, you can learn a lot. If not, you may feel like you are just learning the material in order to do alright on the test and then forget it afterward. Frau Sippel gives you everything that you need to learn a lot, but it's a LOT so you have to be capable of taking that and running with it."
