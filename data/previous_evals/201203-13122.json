    "Great course! Really gives you an nice overview of the governing systems of the earth with a nice amount, but not an overwhelming amount, of math and physics.",
    "I liked this class, and if you're interested in physics and atmospheric science, it's worth taking. There were students from a range of backgrounds in the class (there was a sophomore physics major, junior physics and g&g majors, and seniors in mb&b, applied math and environmental engineering, as well as graduate students). The problem sets were short andquite easy, so the explicit workload for this class was lower than that of other science classes. However, we covered a lot of material very quickly, so studying for the midterm and preparing for the final was stressful. I might be the only person who feels that way though. It would have been nice to know the breakdown of scores on the midterm, but we never found out what our result meant (was the average a 98? a 90?). The professor was really nice and was always willing to answer questions. Sometimes classes were a bit dry, especially if we were doing derivations, but I guess that's the nature of the subject at times. If you want a quantitative atmospheric science class, this is going to be a good choice.",
    "This was an interesting class that tried to make really difficult concepts surrounding weather and climate easy to understand. If you are interested in learning how different things like green house gases affect global warming and climate this is a good class to take. Not too many problem sets for the class but the midterm and final were pretty difficult.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have a very solid understanding of thermodynamics and fluid dynamics. Then you can really get everything out of this course. Otherwise, it was great for learning a ton about how our climate works from a physics standpoint. It's really interesting material!",
    "G&G 322 is a pretty intensive survey of atmospheric& climate science. I would encourage people with a strong chemistry\/physics background and off course the G&G major to take it. We begin with thermodynamics moving into cloud microphysics and then more macroscopic stuff."
