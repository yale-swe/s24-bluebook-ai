    "It is definitely a lot of work, but it is a constant workload, which, in my opinion, is easy to maintain. The quizzes aren't too difficult, and as long as you keep up with what you're learning, the tests aren't either. I've really enjoyed learning Arabic and would definitely recommend taking this.",
    "Take it, the Arabic Department is on the rise and Professor Aziz makes things low key and pretty easy. If you put in a little work you'll do well and actually learn a little too.",
    "Yes",
    "i would definitely recommend this class to another student, the course work fits perfectly into my schedule, and i do not feel overly stressed about this class.",
    "I would! I would tell them to make sure that they get Aziz!!",
    "I would certainly think before recommending ARBC 120 to another student. I would only recommend it if the student was interested in learning Arabic and preferably had an interest in the Arab world outside of just the language. I would ask that because the class can try student's patience, and it is very time intensive, so I would date to see them put in all of that time for something they are not really interested in. Also, as for learning the material better, I would honestly recommend that a student take the class with Professor Al Ani, but Professor Aziz definitely made for a more positive class atmosphere. So, as long as the interest in very strong, I would recommend the course."
