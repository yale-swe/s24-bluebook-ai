    "The capstone is fantastic. I had a wonderful experience, and it seemed like everyone had really interesting placements.",
    "This was a fantastic practicum! I loved working at the Office of the State Comptroller.",
    "The practicum places students at the intersection of academia and practice. As a capstone, it provides a great opportunity for students to apply materials learned throughout their time at YSPH.",
    "The quality of the course is highly dependent on student placement. The policy practicum is particularly strong in that all of the placements wanted us to do meaningful work. It would have been nice to have more frequent check-ins with Shelley and the other practicum members, though."

    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is amazing. First, she secured awesome placements for all of the students. She also brought us all together for meals to discuss our progress, which was far more enjoyable than doing the same thing in a classroom setting. She also invited us all into her home multiple times. Her home is beautiful and she and her husband are so welcoming. I loved hearing Shelley's perspective through our discussions all semester, and I will miss having her as a professor.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is fantastic!! She worked so hard to get us great placements and checked in frequently to make sure things were going well.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is an amazing instructor and was beyond helpful during the practicum. I am thankful to have professors such as Mrs. Geballe at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is an awesome professor who places her students at the center of the course as she builds the course experience around them.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is wonderful. She goes the extra mile to make sure each student has an excellent experience."
