    "I would definitely recommend any course on Benjamin, Kafka, and Hoelderlin to anyone who takes reading seriously, but I would and have recommended any course taught by Prof. Nagele to my fellows. He is an exceptional teacher.",

I would recommend the class, but suggest that the student do extensive reading on her own in order to get the most out the the assigned readings."
