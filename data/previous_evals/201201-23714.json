    "This was an excellent course! I learned a lot from the different speakers, from engaging with the other students, from the professor, and from the field trip to DC.",
    "Question 9: The field trip to New York was the best part of the class. I learned a lot from all our leaders we met with. I liked that the class culminated with this trip.",
    "Overall, I would give the class portion of the course a 4, but the field trip was extremely beneficial from a career development and learning about leadership perspective.",
    "I would like this class to have a more specific forestry focus. Professor Oliver is full of great ideas, wisdom and insight. However, I felt that many of the other students were not as interested in the class as I was. This dragged down the class on the whole. To remedy this, I think that a more specific focus (forestry) would have helped to weed out the freeriders who really hamstrung the discussions with their stone-faced (and silent) presence.",
    "Overall, the course was disappointing and unstructured. It was unclear what themes in leadership we weresupposed to learn and most of the course for the semester was dedicated to planning a 2-day visit to Washington DC or NYC.",
    "Prof Chad made students to feel as real leaders. I learnt a lot from his styles of dealing with various issues."

   "comments": [
    "I think this course was run very well.",
    "The format of the class eats up a lot of time. Though it is important to be able to run a meeting, trying to implement robert's rule of order was a waste of a lot of time. Rather, spend time in class in discussion about readings, guest speakers, upcoming speakers, and class reflections.There was also too much time spent in class planning the trips. If we had less time allotted to planning we would have gotten it done in less time. Then we could have had more time to discuss. The class really didn't feel like a seminar at all, we barely got into engaging and meaningful discussion.More follow-up on readings. Don't just give them to us, make us talk about them the next week. Bring up our class reflections during class time, question us, challenge us.The class can still be fun while being much more stimulating. Ask us to do small, simple assignments each week to keep us engaged. For example, research a current leader in your field and report back on successes\/challenges.Really this can be summed up by saying that we need to be more engaged. We need to be pushed a little. We want to participate, but if the bar is set so low, we lose interest early on and resign the class to something that we don't need to put effort into.",
    "Not enough structure to the course assignments. Reflections were suppose to be handed in for each class, but not everyone did.",
    "I wish more time had been allotted for class discussions. The majority of class time was spent on planning the field trip and we rarely discussed the readings (which were really interesting!) I think it would have been a more enriching experience if we had been able to discuss the readings and talk about leadership instead of planning for the field trip.",
    "I wish we'd spent more time in class discussing leadership challenges as a group, rather than listening to lectures. my classmates have so many useful stories and thoughts about leadership. Also, I think the content of the course needs to be strengthened. a stronger focus on why environmental leadership is different from traditional leadership would help. As would a more rigorous and structured set of units to be covered over the course of the semester.",
    "Discussions- we need to have students who are interested in talking, debating, and going deeper into the material. Required readings, student-led discussions, and more consistent out of class assignments would help drive a more lively and fulfilling class.",
    "This entire course needs to be redesigned. There were infrequent lectures and guest speakers. There was almost no discussion of assigned readings -- several students commented that they did not do the reading, given that it was never covered in class.",
    "The professor and curriculum.",
    "The lectures on leadership seemed archaic and not relevant to natural resource\/ environmental managers. The leadership we learned was about factories and the military which is not the kind of leadership I will ever be engaged in.While we were supposed to learn about leadership through \"doing\" by planning the DC trip, the process was made far more complex then it should have been. We did not need to take up class time to do this. Also we were not given actual decision making authority as Chad seemed to take all the real decisions into his own hands.The pudding assignment was terrible. It didn't take any ingenuity on the part of the students. It should have been for each team to come up with a dessert and make it on their own through teamwork. If we are to be leaders we need to be able to think for ourselves.It is unfortunate that this class is an MF capstone course as I think it is an example of the worst teaching and lack of student creativity at FES.",

    "duration and Trip and interaction with world leaders may be increased"

    "I wanted to learn more about leadership and thought this course would be a good overview.",
    "FES is dedicated to training leaders, so this course is very relevant to the overall program.",
    "This course is a capstone course for the MF. It is a requirement and is a culminating experience. As such, I think it should have more of a forestry focus. The majority of the class did not have an interest in forests and some even lacked an expressed interest in natural resources management. There were so many wonderful opportunities for discussion about the difficulties surrounding natural resources management- but many of these were squandered because people were pegging away on their laptops and not paying attention nor showing any interest.",
    "It was a good introduction to leadership and career information that you do not generally learn in school.",

    "It was really interesting to see how our group dynamic panned out with 14 people on the DC team. We worked well together and self organized to meet with DC leaders: from the scheduling, to the student bios, to the transportation and hotel, to the gifts. The students ran the whole event.",
    "The groupwork component of this class was a highlight. We really learned a lot about ourselves and our abilities within a group.",
    "It was a good exercise in planning a trip with other individuals. Frustrating at times because different people put in different amounts of work to planning the trip.",
    "It was very good! The structure of the groups and the ability to see how leadership and organizations work on the micro and macro level was very useful.",
    "Advantages = can delegate and distribute the work load, gain new perspectives from other team members.Disadvantages = differences in leadership and communication styles can sometimes lead to friction.",
    "my classmates have a lot of strong skills and interesting experiences that they brought to our discussions.",
    "The planning of the field trip was THE central activity of the class. I learned a lot about myself during the process. I also learned a lot about identifying people with whom I am not interested in working. It was not that the experience was bad, it was just that I now have a better sense for who I work well with and who I will avoid when possible.",
    "I enjoyed getting to know my classmates through the group work. I thought what could have been relatively simple (planning the trip) was made complex by chain of command etc. It was nice that everyone seemed to pull their weight with the group work.",
