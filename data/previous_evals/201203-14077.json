   "comments": [
    "A great class to learn how to think critically through diplomatic documents. Not as much of a class where you are memorizing dates and events. Make sure you take the time to meet with Professor Evans and discuss with him your interests- he is great at giving advice!",
    "Great class. Expect to work hard, but also expect to learn a lot.",
    "An engaging course on the implications of rising powers to the United States.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would certainly recommend. Somewhat of a moot point as the instructor is leaving.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in U.S. diplomacy with rising powers.",
    "If you like to appreciate the interactions of politics, economics, security and ideology with regards to the US and various world powers, this is the class for you.",
    "I would most definitely recommend INRL 722 to another student. Professor Evans is a dynamic and highly intelligent instructor. The class pieces together both historical case studies with more contemporary ones, providing the historical context that is commonly missing from classes on today's international relations issues. The readings, while sometimes long, were very interesting; they were readings that I would gladly peruse in my free time, even if they weren't for a class!",
    "It is a must-take course for anybody hoping to enter the world of international relations, or hoping to understand the factors - human and structural - that shape foreign policy decision-making both in the U.S. and abroad. The course will give a thorough walk-through of the debate on rising powers and their impact on the international system, and by the end you will be able to dismiss many claims routinely defended in the media while critically assessing which countries are actually rising powers, why do they matter, and to what extent they present a new paradigm to the international community as we know it.The readings range from extremely interesting to extremely long and boring. But even the pieces that fit the latter category will be highly beneficial, as they are the sort of technical pieces that policy-makers must learn to skim for valuable information. It'll teach you how to be an efficient reader, if nothing else.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone who is interested in diplomacy and foreign policy. It gave me a good grounding in the key themes and made me a better analyst of foreign affairs. I started off with no knowledge of foreign affairs whatsoever, so it was a little daunting to begin with, but I found my feet by the end.",
    "I would say it's an in-depth, comparative politics course, and that if you haven't had one a the graduate level, it would be beneficial. So in that regard, I'd recommend it.I would, overall, recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone with very little background knowledge about IR generally as a good survey course but not to anyone who would really want to delve into the issues of any one of these countries (ESP South Africa and brazil which had cry little airtime)."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "The course certainly deepened knowledge of the field - did so mainly through encouraging students to think about how states functioned and how they decided what their interests were (in the context of rising powers).",
    "This course was very helpful in broadening the scope of my familiarity with international affairs.",
    "It helped a good deal but the syllabus was abit scattered due to the course direction. A regional focus or perhaps thematic focus would have helped.",
    "This was one of my favorite courses to date. Professor Evans, as a seasoned practitioner, provided anecdotes that really shed light on how our readings and case studies have realistic importance, important lessons for students who are also interested in the fields of diplomacy and international relations. While my thesis does not exactly pertain to any of the themes of this course, the material covered in this course will certainly have relevance for future classes and career endeavors.",
    "Having just come out of an internship with the United Nations where I dealt on a practical level with many of the questions addressed in the course, INRL722 allowed me to look more critically at the real factors behind the rise of certain middle powers. It allowed me to dissect many of the staple arguments in the rising power public debates, to see that while there are indeed a group of countries we can call \"rising powers\" it remains very hard to predict who is a part of the group, who will remain a part of the group in the long-run, and how they will interact with the established powers. Most importantly, given my interest in working at the UN, the course allowed me to examine the role that the rising powers debate plays in international organizations and global governance structures.The course also reinforced some technical skills that will be required in my future career such as memo-writing, and the ability to sift intelligently through technical documentation.",
    "It introduced me to the analysis of foreign affairs and some of the key issues arising from the increasing global presence of the 'rising powers'.",
    "I learned more about a countries that are on the rise, in which I may find myself working closely in diplomatic venues in the near future. Much of what I got out of the course was what I learned in the papers I wrote for it, although the anecdotal items that appeared in the lectures were helpful in tying it together.",
    "Gave me a good survey of scholarly opinion on a number of different hot button issues."
