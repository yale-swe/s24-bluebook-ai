    "This course provided me a better understanding of the legal systems at both national and international levels, with a particular emphasis on legal systems that interact with the technological advancements and related happenings across the globe. It was also enlightening to see the gap that exists between theoretical proven results or constructions (ex: Bitcoin and encryption) and their usage in the real world. This course provided me a perspective on how to look at each technological solution from the viewpoint of its cultural and social impact, and what implications it might have for the available legal frameworks.",
    "I learned a great deal about the current conflicts between technology, computer science, and law.",
    "I learned how to examine the law through the lens of a computer scientist and vice versa.",
    "Better understanding of how the legal system works, current efforts to deal with technological issues in terms of legal improvements",
