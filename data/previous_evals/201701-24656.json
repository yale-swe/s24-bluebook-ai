    "I gained a deeper understanding of Norse mythology and why it is relevant to history and modern day culture and life.",
    "This class was very interesting because it was a very different mythology that I had never really learned about before. I learned about Scandinavian culture and their beliefs in this class which was great because I had never studied it before.",
    "How to piece together fragmentary and conflicting sources and gain meaning from them",
    "norse myth and culture and its relevance today",
    "We learned a lot about Norse mythology. We focused more on gods and giants than we did on epics with heroes. The Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda were the most used texts.",
    "Very comprehensive look into Old Norse mythology (with a little bit of the literature). The course is very well-organized, and all the topics flow very well. The source material might appear strange and even silly at times, yet they present an encompassing picture of the Old Norse tradition and culture. This is definitely much better and more entertaining than watching a certain show about the Vikings."

   "comments": [
    "The readings for the course are manageable, varied, and engage the student. The small class size allows for a greater sense of community and makes engaging in the class more comfortable.",
    "This course was interesting because it was a small class and everyone seemed pretty engaged with the materials. It was set up as a seminar so good discussion took place during class.",
    "overall discussions were good, a little more structure could have been helpful at times",
    "A great introductory course to Norse mythology that explores the gods and goddesses we know and some that we don't and relates it to modern culture and pop culture. Workload is light and the readings are short and enjoyable. Writing assignments are short and require a lot of condensing.",
    "The course content was everything you'd probably hope for but I think classtime needs to be mixed up a bit more because sometimes the discussions were pretty slow.",
    "I really like the small seminar setting. Every discussion was lively and productive. The 'section leader' was a great idea because each student had the chance to research a bit deeper into the topic they were in charge of leading, while also enjoyed certain freedom in steering the discussion points."

   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this class to another student. Anyone who has an interest in Greek mythology or similar topics would greatly enjoy this class. The end-of-semester tie-ins to popular culture are also a fantastic way to end the academic year.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in learning about a new mythology that is not necessarily mainstream like Greek\/Roman mythology. The stories are interesting and enjoyable to read and discuss.",
    "'Twas one of my favorite classes at Yale! The Norse myths are an amazing body of work--they seem to contain a bit of every human emotion and experience, from truly moving and thought-provoking questions about the nature of reality and identity (for me, the most intriguing parts were the episodes about the gods being put in positions of weakness, especially the apocalyptic narrative of Ragnarok) to random and profane elements (like the squirrel whose sole role in the myths is to ferry insults between two other characters). Work-wise, it's not too demanding--the readings tend to be pretty short (since the entire corpus of Norse mythology is not very large) and the quizzes and essays are very manageable. Finally, Johanna is absolutely wonderful--she's an incredibly kind, thoughtful, and at times hilarious person, and she does a great job of facilitating discussion amongst students from very different backgrounds.",
    "Yes Johanna is so sweet and it is a really fun class",
    "A great introductory course to Norse mythology that explores the gods and goddesses we know and some that we don't and relates it to modern culture and pop culture. Workload is light and the readings are short and enjoyable. Writing assignments are short and require a lot of condensing.",
    "If you're interested in mythology take this class. If you're uninterested, I don't know that this is the class that will convince you to be interested though.",
    "A great way to understand the Old Norse myth beyond bad Thor movies or the TV show Vikings. This course is for everyone and it offers a lot in terms of critical thinking. Professor Fridriksdottir is a genius in the field and her teaching style is very effective. I find her feedback very thorough and helpful."
