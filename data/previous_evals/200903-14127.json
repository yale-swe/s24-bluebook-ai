    "I probably learned more in this class than in any other this semester. If you have an interest in poli sci at all but realize that much of poli sci sucks, take this class to learn how to do compelling, interesting, AND non-bullshit poli sci.Kahl is a great seminar leader and we read some great books. There were a few little things about the class that could have used some fixing, but Kahl seemed to know what they were and said she would fix them in future years. All in all, awesome. This class is the bomb.",
    "Learning how to analyze and, to a degree, conduct comparative historical social science research. This class is half grad half undergrad, and there's a fair amount of reading. Also, know that the real point of the class is METHODOLOGY - ie HOW TO do this certain kind of political science- not any particular substance (such as labor law, revolutions, etc). I personally really enjoyed the class and would highly recommend it, especially because I think there will be some changes to it that make it better than it already was. And except for the decent amount of reading, the workload was light and Professor Kahl was very conscious of how much other work we have. For political science majors interested in political science (that is, how to actually do political SCIENCE, as opposed to just learning some more random stuff about another area of the world), this is a really good class. For those who don't care that much about polisci as a discipline and just want to learn about another area of the world they're interested in, look elsewhere.",
    "focus on methods of how to do qualitative work in sociology. interesting introduction, and fun having the grad students in the class as they raise the level of discussion"
