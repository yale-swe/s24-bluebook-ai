    "Would have helped to go over the grammar more frequently in class.",
    "Strengths: I enjoyed the \"serious fun\" model. Having real conversations and answering real questions in Italian was very helpful to improve fluency. It helps you start thinking in Italian. Feedback was always helpful and considerate. Instead of discouraging me, it helped me learn. The pace was much better than L1. Weaknesses: It is easy to forget material- especially specific grammar concepts and vocabulry. More practice spaced throughout the semester might be useful.",
    "I enjoyed the discussions before class, I think it brought the class together while also improving our speaking abilities. I also liked the speed at which we learned the material. L1 was a little too quick to fully understand the material before we were tested, but this semester I felt like i had time to grasp it fully.",
    "Strengths: discussion based Weakness: None",
    "Teacher was incredible and very encouraging. Improved a lot in dialogue skills."
