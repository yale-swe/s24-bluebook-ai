    "An overview of a whole slew of quantitative methods in ecology and evolutionary biology; jumps around from topic to topic without much time for depth; profs approachable and nice, but course awkwardly structured and more like a reading group than a prof-taught seminar",
    "Reading intensive, but not so much actual modeling work. Time for the class exercises was a little short.",
    "yes, if they already have a programming background\/.",
    "If that student was interested in evolutionary theory and hadn't been exposed before I would recommend it. Also if they wanted to recognize some of the typical quantitative methods used in papers it would be helpful.If they want to really learn how to perform the methods themselves I wouldn't really recommend it. Too many topics were covered at at the superficial level for that.",

   "comments": [
    "This course exposed me to some new quantitative methods that I now have some understanding of and might at some point use.",
    "Very good overview of many mathematical methods that you could encounter in your research, but the class does not actually teach you how to perform many of them, apart from showing you where to start. For a beginning modeler, this is a excellent course to get a sense of what is possible."
