    "Don't take it unless you have to. Make sure you shop at least twice before deciding. If you don't have a very strong background in econometrics (most people don't), then DO NOT take this class. It's really hard if you don't know all that well.",
    "Kind of a weird class. The topic is fascinating and Professor Kumar is passionate about sharing how genetics and economics intersect. He also emphasizes concepts of thinking to make sure you understand how to make good analyses. The class is somewhat unstructured. Not too much work and the grading is pretty easy. Overall, a decent course.",
    "Yes it is especially good if you want to integrate biology into your economic studies.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend it. My experience in the class was excellent. I thought the material was interesting and the grading was fair.",
    "The class was very disorganized and was often hard to follow what the professor was thinking."
