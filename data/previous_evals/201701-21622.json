    "Interesting course. Learn a good about the relationship between states institutes and religious ones.",
    "I gained next to nothing by taking this course, except for memorizing some facts about secularization theory or \"spiritual\/temporal swords\" which I'm absolutely going to forget by 5 minutes after the final exam.",
    "The ability to analyze date and put in in historical and political contexts.",
    "I received a general overview about the trajectory of major world religions, with a macro perspectives of the overarching trends.",
    "Learned to analyze the relationship between religion and government throughout history.",
    "Using quantitative data to understand historical trends regarding the relationship between religion and politics and the development of the nation state",
    "Learned about religion and its relationship with politics.",
    "How to analyze critically",
    "I learned a great deal of analytical skills in interpreting writings and data.",
    "I learned a lot of information about the current state of the interaction with religion and state in many different countries.",
    "I developed a better understanding of how to do analysis when two different factors come together, affecting an overall issue in delicate and unique ways. The complexities of religion and politics and their often dual nature lead to outcomes unable to be explained without first delving into the nature of each as a separate entity.",
    "I learned about the trajectories of Christianity and Islam, secularization theory, fundamentalism, and how different religion-politics regimes can develop based on the rational choice theory and historical patterns. I gained a language and an analytical framework to discuss different types of religion-politics regimes and consider how and why they differ."

   "comments": [
    "Sometimes lectures were slow and a little repetitive. Hard to stay engaged at times. Professor was always excited and engaged in the material with is a plus.",
    "This class needs to be seriously restructured. First of all, why are there 15 minute in-class writing assignments? Writing something in such a short period of time is not only stressful, but it is also a skill that is totally impractical (when will I ever need to do that in the real world?) and definitely asks too much of students to analyze giant tables of data and write a fully-formed and organized response. There is no time to plan when you only have 15 minutes to write - writing takes time. Also, there should be optional or mandatory discussion sections. I genuinely feel like I understood nothing you were saying in lecture (and I did come to every lecture), and the slides themselves are seriously unhelpful. If you're going to post slides with multiple choice questions, please include the answer in the slides, for example.",
    "SIgrun makes incredibly points and arguments but the lecture was incredibly disorganized.",
    "This class covers a very interesting and relevant topic, however professor Kahl's lack of organization made it difficult to follow and be engaged with. Not hard at all, but could have been so much better with more organization and structure.",
    "While the content might have been interesting, the course was honestly very lacking. There were many changes to the lecture timings (nearly three were cancelled). The readings did not always align with the themes. The whole experience was quite messy.",
    "Strength - interesting informative readings Weaknesses - I think most courses at Yale are quite excellent, even if unpopular. This is without a doubt the WORST class I have ever taken at Yale. Professor Kahl was not merely \"unorganized\" as previous reviews warned, but she literally cancelled numerous lectures was more than 30 minutes late to at least half a dozen, rescheduling our review session 10 minutes before it was to start. When lectures did actually happen, they were poorly run in which she would explain concepts in a very confused manner, then backtrack to reexplain concepts, then let one student ramble for at least half the lecture. I was one of the very few students who regularly attended. About half the class or less attended lecture, and some around me even listened to headphones during the lecture. Even the TF's hated the class and would talk throughout the lecture. while obviously this behavior by students is rude and unacceptable, I greatly sympathized with them as lectures were PAINFUL TO LISTEN TO. Professor Kahl would just make her concepts more confusing it. I learned from the readings . The quizzes were extremely difficult. Honest to God, I'm so sorry that I took this class, and especially since this grade counts towards my major grade. This is the only 1, or even grade below a 3 that i have given for a class in my 3 years at Yale College. Maybe since Prof Kahl is leaving, this class nor this review matters to her and this is written in vain, however, it was truly an awful experience. Professor Kahl needs to seriously reevaluate and restructure her teaching design. I feel bad writing this terrible review. Professor Kahl is a very kind woman, she did seem sorry for the horrid catastrophe of a lecture. However the lecture was not \"cursed\" as she put it, but was terribly executed from beginning to finish.",
    "My weakness was the writing assessments.",
    "Professor can be more organized",
    "The course was very good on days that we interacted, but less interesting when we lectured",
    "It's very interesting but occasionally the class feels like it's moving too slow while other times it's moving too fast.",
    "The course does a good job of explaining the many terms important to the class. We studied many of the leading minds in the area of religion and politics, whose opinions were expanded upon and added to by the Professor.",
    "The class was really interesting towards the end - the religious marketplace\/rational choice theory and unit on fundamentalism were both really fascinating, and then we got to apply what we learned to variations in laws on topics like poverty and abortion. The course did a really good job of first introducing new material and then offering real-world examples to apply that knowledge. The weaknesses were that sometimes - especially in the first third of the course - the lectures were repetitive and sometimes boring. I grew more engaged throughout the semester.",
    "The material was definitely the highlight of the class. Organization left a lot to be desired."

   "comments": [
    "Take it. Easy class, not much work, not hard intellectually. Good for a 5th credit.",
    "DO NOT take this class. You might be tempted to because you hear it's a low workload, or because friends are taking it, but I cannot emphasize what a waste of time this course will be. The professor seems like a nice person but she really cannot structure a lecture in a logical or compelling way. The slides are incomprehensible. You're evaluated based on 15-minute in class essays that are graded ridiculously arbitrarily - it's not an easy A. You will learn nothing interesting. Most of the class is looking at and trying to analyze these massive tables containing ten rows and ten columns of data (rarely do they give you the courtesy of just turning the data into graphs, and rather ask you to try to just understand what the spread looks like mentally ????). The first classes and first writing assignment are the best and strongest but it goes downhill from there so don't be fooled. I regret taking this class and would strongly urge other students to reconsider if they are thinking about taking it next year.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are looking for a gut that you don't have to show up to. I would not recommend if you are actually looking for an in depth exploration of religion and politics.",
    "Absolutely. The class does a great job in enhancing a student's understanding of historical and current developments, and the role played by religion in them.",
    "No, I would not. I took this class hoping to understand the motivations and historicity of religion and politics and a greater explanation for such trends. However, we looked at trends and statistics that were eventually shown to have little consistency. Not really what I was expecting.",
    "Great course if you are interested in the subject; prof made it very exciting.",
    "never Strength - interesting informative readings Weaknesses - I think most courses at Yale are quite excellent, even if unpopular.

    "Yes! I learned a lot.",
    "Yes teaches you in depth about religion",
    "Yes, it is important for understanding modern day religion which is so prevalent",
    "Take it if you're interested in the subject. You may learn a lot about different religions (particularly the denominations of Christianity and Islam) as well as how they've interacted with governments and gained or lost power over the years.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is insightful and enjoyable. Religion and Politics brings new perspectives into the fold not thought of before. The class covers a spectrum of life and reality that is often times neglected.",
    "If you engage with the material and go to lecture, you will find that this course is actually really interesting - the way Professor Kahl analyzes poverty laws based on religion-politics regimes, for example, is fascinating. Some of the lectures are dry, and the workload is low, so this class is easy to discount. But it does have good potential because the material is really interesting, especially towards the end."
