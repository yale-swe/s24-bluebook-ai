    "I would definitely recommend it. The Chinese department runs so smoothly, the teachers and fabulous, and you learn so much. It is a lot of work, and you have to be committed to putting in a couple of hours a night, but it is manageable and very rewarding.",
    "Incredibly effective and efficient course, but requires an incredible amount of individual work and motivation. Minimum1.5 hours of work a night, and much, much more for tests. Tests every two weeks. The teachers are absolutely wonderful, however, and always willing to help. Take advantage of office hours!!!",
    "Intense but manageable if you stay on top of things. It might seem overwhelming in theory but it isn't in practice.",
    "This is an excellent course that pushes students to study regularly and efficiently. With hard work and the collective dedication of the wonderful Chinese professors, it is amazing just how much one can learn in one semester!",
    "I would recommend it to fellow students with a lot of time, and a real desire to learn chinese. While it is very interesting and a great investment in the future, it is a lot of work and any student entering the course should be aware of this going in."
