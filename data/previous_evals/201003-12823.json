   "comments": [
    "Take it if you want to do research. Research will change your life.",
    "I would definitely take advantage of doing research while you are here - it was a great experience, and nice to have an academic setting in which to frame our lab work.",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "take it if you're already in a lab and know your PI who likes you, this course is very dependent on your personal experiences in the lab",
    "You do research in your lab, and write a paper and give lab meeting at the end. Take it if you want to do research. and get credit for it.",
    "If you're already doing research and want credit for it just take this class. The class demands from you what typical PIs ask for anyway - research proposal and results analysis.",
    "Definitely- much cooler than doing a cookie-cutter lab course at Yale. Pick your own mentor, do some original research, and learn a lot about a specific field.",
    "Basically research for credit. You work as much as you can in your lab, do some paper writing and proposal, presentation. Very straightforward.",
    "Yes, take it if you can find a lab. It is a great way to get to know the department and to learn a lot outside of class.",
    "Research for Credit is a great course to take, particularly during your senior year. It\u0092s low key, and you also learn a ton. It\u0092s a chance to put into practice the techniques you\u0092ve learned about in all your courses, and to gain a much deeper understanding of the concepts you\u0092ve studied in the other MB&B classes. The requirement is 10 hours a week, but I often found myself working more like 15 hours some weeks, and then 6-8 on weeks when I was busier. There aren\u0092t many assignments \u0096 just a proposal at the beginning, and a presentation and final paper at the end, so it\u0092s fairly relaxed. I\u0092d just recommend starting the final paper about a week in advance, otherwise it can be a lot to do in a few days.",
    "You can get way more out of doing research during the year than taking a class. Find a good lab and a good project that you can have ownership of.",
    "Take it to waive MB&B 360. It's of course also valuable for the research experience.",
    "I would recommend that every MB&B major try to complete some research for credit before they graduate -- getting involved with lab work is an experience not to be missed. One caveat to consider: be sure to account for research for credit as a full course on its own. Even if you already work in the lab on the side, you will probably end up spending twice that amount of time working once you do it for credit, so it is not a good idea to tack it on as a 6th (or in some cases, 5th) course to an already-full course load.",
    "Yes. I love the freedom this course gives you to choose whichever area of science you would like to investigate. It also allows you to continue furthering your research in labs that you have started working in during previous summers. It's great that you can get credit for this. There's a research proposal due, a presentation, and a paper due.",
    "This course is is very dependent on both your project and your mentor. Depending on your own drive or luck it can end up being easy or hard, but it's worth it if you spend any time normally in the lab as you're getting credit for it."
