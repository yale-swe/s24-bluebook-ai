    "This is a great course. The German department at Yale has a really good program set up. (The online flashcards were an incredible resource) I would highly recommend this class to anyone wishing to improve their German and a little German history, culture, and literature as well.",
    "Standard course that reviews basic German structure. I took it after taking a long break from German and I was able to learn everything very well because the review is very comprehensive. The films, texts and songs can be quite fun and they give you a good idea of the culture of Germany that you talk about.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it to a grad student, because the course-load is too demanding. I would recommend my fellow grad students to get weekly tutoring and do reading on their own.",
    "i would recommend this class. If you need to take it, then you need to take it, but everything from german 1 and 2 really come together in 3.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class - I feel like my German has improved so much beyond what I learned last year, and to a point where I can really use it now.",
    "The course is great, you read German literature, listen to German songs, and watch German movies. It can get time consuming, but it's worth it."
