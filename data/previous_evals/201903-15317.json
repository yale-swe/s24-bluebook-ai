    "I gained an understanding of how Cold War politics affected the lives of every day people.",
    "A very multidisciplinary view of the Cold War, with a focus on first person experience. I had never taken an anthropology course before and this course merged traditional anthropological ethnography with history, philosophy, and literary\/film criticism in a way that made me excited to engage with the course every week. The biggest skill involved was becoming familiar with anthropological methodology, as it was described in some of the studies that we read (the come to mind.)",
    "How to think of the influence on the Cold War in the lives of the public and ordinary people, based on both first-hand accounts and political structural analyses"

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the readings for this class. Many of the units exposed me to effects of the Cold War which I had never learned about previously. Discussion often started with viewing a series of video clips that related to the unit of study. I thought that this was a fantastic way to jump start the conversation. Since many of us have parents who lived during this era, I think it could've been interesting to have a brief assignment that required us to do a bit of our own anthropological research and talk with them about some of the course content.",
    "The class was full of intriguing materials, making it possible for us to reflect on the Cold War from various perspectives and how the Cold War influenced and formed the everyday lives of people living at the age. It'd be great if the course could refer to Cold-War-related movements and phenomena taking place outside the US and the USSR, particularly in the so-called Third World."

   "comments": [
    "As long as you are interested in history, I would absolutely recommend this course! In particular, the anthropological lens made for a refreshing take on an otherwise well studied subject.",
    "Absolutely. Our class was composed of people with many different disciplinary backgrounds and the structure of the course made it so that there was material every week which I found engaging and favorable to my tastes\/skill set (not an anthro major.) More than any other class that I have taken, this class made me realize the gravity of the Cold War and its consequences on everything from knowledge production to public spending to sexual dynamics. The films, books, and memoirs always brought me to class with a genuine interest in the weeks topics, and Professor Martins extensive knowledge of the fields involved made for a lot of meaningful tangents (ex: does history have a teleology? What are some views on the possible teleology of anthropology as a discipline?).",
    "Depending upon your interests, but the Cold War certainly formed (at least) today's political, economic, social, and cultural reality, so the course will provide you with viewpoints and analytical tools that you'd like to employ in analysing the status quo of your own society"
