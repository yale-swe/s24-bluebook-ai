    "This course provided me with a useful overview of several prominent theoretical orientations with applications to not only literary studies, but also film, history, and philosophy.",
    "I came into this course expecting a history of theory with a specific focus on East Asian texts. The course showed me that there are other ways to teach a theory course, and having a course that is more about theoretical topics recently discussed can be helpful as well.",
    "Broad overview of colonial history in the East Asian context, skills for analyzing literature and film, survey of the most prominent works in critical theory currently"

   "comments": [
    "One of the strengths of the course is that it covers a wide range of materials. At the same time, however, one weakness of the course was that it felt as though there was a limit to how thoroughly we could discuss each topic.",
    "Using the whiteboard was great. So much better than ppts",
    "Strengths: really great syllabus, Dr. Poland was incredibly helpful in our discussions of the more challenging theoretical texts, the combination of \"primary sources\" from East Asia and major works in theory was thought-provoking and revealed interesting connections. There could have been more discussions of the primary sources--sometimes we spent so much time trying to dissect the theoretical texts that the primary texts got left out of the conversation."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. The course provided an excellent introduction to the material covered, and the material itself is genuinely useful beyond the class.",
    "With enthusiasm. The discussions in class were great, and everyone was friendly and engaging.",
    "Absolutely. This course would work well both for a student in EALL who is hoping for a better grasp of the contemporary theoretical literature, and a student who is looking to enter into conversations happening in EALL. The syllabus spanned philosophical anthropology, ecocriticism, and queer theory, which enabled me to form a helpful foundation from which to engage with theoretical literature outside of the course. The different units also spoke well to each other."
