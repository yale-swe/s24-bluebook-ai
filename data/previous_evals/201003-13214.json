    "Ayala is fantastic! If you want to take Hebrew, definitely try to get in a section with her. She made me happy to wake up every day for a 9:20 class, and I'll miss her next semester!",
    "Take it with Ayala. She is outstanding. She really has such an appreciation for the language and explains in depth why words and pronounciations are how they are in the language.",
    "Take Hebrew. You will learn a lot, but in a friendly and caring environment. There is never a pressure to worry about grades because everyone is just having fun.",
    "This is a really great class. If you stay on top of the vocabulary it's not too hard and Ayala is always willing to help. It's worth taking the early class in order to have Ayala as a professor, she's fabulous.",
    "I would recommend Hebrew L1 to another student. Ayala is really fun and a great teacher. The course is much less intense than some other languages offered at Yale. Rather than a quiz everyday, there is one every week, and there are only two tests. The workload really was not very bad either. By the end of the semester, I really felt that I could read, write, speak, and understand a lot of Hebrew."
