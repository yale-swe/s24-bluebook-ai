    "A great introductionto 20th century critical theory with a wonderful professor. Come prepared to read, write, and talk.",
    "this is quintessential for any art student or creative thinker.",
    "I would highly recommend this class because it seems to be the only one at Yale that provides this very essential content in a way that is suitable for a studio practice.",
    "This class is reading based - every week is based on a reading, some of which are very long and difficult to get through. Each week, a reading response is due, and there is also a midterm essay and final artist statement. If you keep up with the reading, you'll get a lot out of it. If not, there's really no point in taking it."
