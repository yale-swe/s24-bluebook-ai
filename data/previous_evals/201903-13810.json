    "I learned a lot about different disciplines within food justice such as urban political ecology and critical race theory. The biggest insight I gained from the course is that food justice movements within local movements is connected to a larger food justice movement globally. Although the local movements may be different, the principles and goals are similar. I also learned how to work with a client and how to conduct efficient group work.",
    "I learnt about social justice dimensions of todays globalized food system, considering justice in terms of sociopolitical and environmental dynamics (topics included: food sovereignty, agroecology, food regimes, Black agrarianism, and gender & agriculture etc). Also, through the capstone part of the course, we got to work with Farm School NYC (NY Food Justice Organization\/NGO to be) and was able to connect theory and practice. Through that process we learnt how to present better, write proposals, arrive at a research question that would be useful to the organization etc."

    "The weakness of the course is that there is a lot of material to learn and very little time. The course is really good despite that. There are a lot of strengths in the course. It is meant to provide real world experience in food justice work, which it does. It also provides a space to talk about food justice and is the only course at FES that does this.",
    "Strengths: Interesting readings, good because it combined practice and theory - although we did cover a lot of topics, and sometimes discussion did feel quite on-the-surface since we just move onto something different the next week Weakness: If I was being very finicky I would say it could be structured a bit better but overall a really good course!"
