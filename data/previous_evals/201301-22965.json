    "An overview of the most important forms of renewable energy with a physics\/math approach to understanding how they work. Recommended if you're interested in renewable energy and aren'tafraid of basic math. I didn't find it very difficult considering the warnings I had received from students who had taken it and previous reviews.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in broad knowledge of how alternative energy is generated. If that is what you seek, it will not disappoint.",
    "G&G 275 provides a comprehensive overview of conventional (i.e. oil and gas) and renewable energy technologies, with an emphasis on the physics responsible for making these energy sources viable. The course was well-organized, covering oil and gas basics, hydropower, wind power, geothermal energy, ocean and tidal energy, biomass and biofuels, and a broad overview of the energy industry. While the electricity and magnetism review was dull and boring at times, one easily recognizes how essential these physical phenomena are to electricity generation. The physics review and PV Solar unit, taught by Prof. Schwartz, could be improved upon, but Prof. Smith's lectures and the rest of the course were enjoyable and intellectually challenging, especially if you're interested in energy.",
    "very interesting class and material, take it if you are interested in energy and value the scientific basis",
    "Although I was very excited to take this class, I ended up disappointed. The material was either stupidly basic or complex and not explained. Although Professor Smith is a very good lecturer, Professor Schwartz did not have a good command of the material and could not answer student questions. The course could not decide if it was focused science or \"issues\" surrounding renewable energy, and thus gave a surface-level overview of both. The professors and TAs were also disorganized and did not consistently return problem sets. It is certainly an interesting topic, but the course has room for improvement.",
    "Great class. I would recommend it.",
    "Would recommend for anyone interested inEnergy",
    "Great introduction to renewable energy. I would highly recommend it.",
    "I would not recommend the course because even if you love the topic, like I do, this class will frustrate you. You can learn this material easily enough on your own and spend your class time more effectively.The topic is interesting and important, but the course is poorly designed and not that well organized. It suffers mainly because it tries to teach students who have never taken a college physics class before at the same time as teaching students with a science\/engineering background. This means that most of the lectures are spent on reviewing the basic physics behind the technologies rather than the technologies themselves. The physics is swept through too fast for the non-science students to be able to learn anything from it, but the review is boring for science students. The result is that both groups of students are frustrated and not served as well as they could be.This course needs to decide on what it wants to be. It can either be a basic, non-physics-based course like G&G 205 and continue to not require physics, or it can make college physics a pre-requisite and enable science students to delve fully into the technology without having to waste so much time on review.",
    "I learned a lot about renewable energy. However, the class was not very challenging and I could have learned more. Overall, a good class.",
    "Essential course for anyone who will work in the renewable energy field. I would recommend it. Just buff up on physics beforehand if you can, particularly in the first few weeks of the course.",
    "This course is an excellent overview to anyone interested in renewable energy (or energy in general). Learn about the limitations of renewable energy and the amazing work that is being done to make the technologies more viable.",
    "See Question #1. I would recommend it if you have the right expectations."
