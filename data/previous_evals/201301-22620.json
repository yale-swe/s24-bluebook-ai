   "comments": [
    "A large lecture with a lot of interesting takes on a dense topic. I would recommend it to someone interested in history and ethics.",
    "It is a great class with only a paper and a final.",
    "Ummm.... Learn about the nuclear dilemma and how to make extinction happen?",
    "I would not recommend taking this class if you want to learn much, but would recommend it for a 5th class.",
    "History class. Material could be a bit dry. Taught well enough, though!",
    "Gutty gut, gut, gut, GUT!",
    "\"One cannot fully understood the modern world without understanding the nuclear dilemma.\" This is a great class as long as you are interested in the subject. Personally, I am! So after every lecture, I would leave starry-eyed and in awe of how amazing the lecture was. Other people, i.e. athletes and others taking the class solely for a gut, were not as impressed nor did they enjoy it. 50% of your grade will be a paper, 50% a final so if you do take this class, be ready for the psychological pressure of these two grades.",
    "Very interesting class if you take the time to engage the materials... You can get by without putting in a lot of work, but it's worth it to listen to what Schell says and do some of the readings.",
    "Good overall course",
    "yes but you'll need to work a lot on your own",
    "Good 5th class. Not too much work and is an extremely interesting topic. The nuclear dilemma is something that we will all face in our lifetimes and we should understand its complexities and paradoxes. That being said the lectures are super boring and most people do not come. Make sure you put a lot of effort in for the final and midterm paper.",
    "Yes - interesting subject, although brutally boring lectures.",
    "Don' take this class it is really hard to make it through the lectures without getting really bored.",
    "If you want to be able to write a paper and take an exam without every having to go to class, this is the class for you. But the paper is not graded as easily as it used to be.",
    "Good background in nuclear politics.",
    "I would recommend the class only if they expected to actually go to the lectures and learn the material, otherwise what is the point.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone looking for an easy fifth course.",
    "I would recommend",
    "Incredibly interesting and not a lot of work. Attending classes and taking notes are all needed to ace the final.",
    "Interesting lectures, a big paper--so be ready for that if you're not a humanities person, and a final that's pretty comprehensive.",
    "Definitely take it, good fifth class.",
    "Easy going history class. Take if you want an easy workload and are interested in the subject.",
    "Be careful",
    "Gut class that involves minimal work. Because each assignment (paper and final) is worth 50%, you have to do a good job on those or you won't do well in the class. But you don't need to do much reading and you don't even need to go to lecture if you don't want to do okay in the class.",
    "Please take this class if you are interested in the topic",
    "As much work as you want it to be. Easy, but we'll see once I get my grade. 50% midterm paper and 50% final. Midterm paper does not necessarily have to be on lecture topics, so it's easy to crank one out with no background knowledge and fair amount of research. The final can be \"learned\" if you have access to one of the study guides floating around.",
    "Okay here's the deal. I wrote the paper before and studied the night before for the final. I shouldn't get below an A-. That said, doing each of these was extremely stressful because they account or 50% of your grade. There are more valuable classes to take obviously, but taking this class is a risky decision if you're trying to get a good grade. I would take something you're more interested in. Lecture's are incredibly boring, so I stopped going.",
    "Total gem. Paper and a final on some good, not too difficult topics. Makes a perfect 5th class.",
    "The class is not difficult, but you really get out what you put into the class. If you want to never go to lecture and do none of the reading, you can get away with that. If you want to learn about the nuclear dilemma and how it has developed into the modern proliferation issue, Schell provides all the resources to do so.",
    "Dilemmas is a solid Poly Sci credit, no work and interesting material to study.",
    "Don't take it. Not worth it.",
    "Take this class if you're actually partially interested. If you are, you should get an easy grade but otherwise steer clear.",
    "Good",
    "Take it if you need a fifth class that is pretty interesting and not a lot of work. Don't take it if you want an intense experience, take a seminar instead.",
    "It is a good class that goes over the nuclear policies over the various presidents, as well as the moral and ethical use of nuclear weapons. Yes I would, you can learn a lot from this course if you read all the readings and go to lecture.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was interesting material, but it was frightening at the same time. It was very eye-opening.",
    "Your grade is somewhat dependent on who your TF is. Keep that in mind. Other than that, interesting material, but pretty boring class.",
    "Extremely interesting. There are not many assignments but the two big ones count for your entire grade so you need to be prepared to do well on them.",
    "Coming from a student who took The Cold War with Professor Gaddis, this seemed like a natural continuation. If you find the topic of nuclear weapons interesting, or found The Cold War to be good and interesting, this course will most likely be a cakewalk (and perhaps interesting\/enlightening) for you. However, if you don't have an interest at all in nuclear weapons, and are thinking about this as an \"easy\" course, reconsider it because it will most likely be a waste of your time.Nearly half of the class never showed up for lecture. Professor Schell's lecturing style isn't the most riveting: sometimes, it seems like a recollection of his thoughts that meander to nowhere. Even as I attended most of the lectures, I struggled to see the common themes or any real continuity among the lectures,which is one of the reasons why I think most people just didn't show up. The workload is easy: one essay, and one final. Both were relatively easy (coming from a person who took The Cold War and barely studied for the final, studying on the same day as it), but be careful: I know of friends who had harsher-grading TF's.However, if you do get the chance to meet with Professor Schell during office hours, please do so. He is great on one-to-one discussions, but his lectures, not so much.",
    "yes, good class with room to present your own thoughts on the topic",
    "I would recommend this course without hesitation. Professor Schell weaves a phenomenally complex, yet approachable, story of the nuclear dilemma. The chronology is very good, and the readings are phenomenally moving. Expect this course to move you, in an existential way. Also, do expect to be overwhelmed by the topic - not in a negative way, but merely because the subject matter is so wide. Professor Schell does a marvellous job of introducing the most important aspects of the dilemmas to his students. He is a marvellous lecturer, and cares deeply about his students. Do take advantage of his office hours, not only is Schell a leading authority and thinker on the matter, but he is one of the most kind and mentally sharp human beings I have ever encountered. If you take responsibility and do the readings, this course will move you in a grand way. Also, it must be noted that a few have said this course it a 'gut' course. I would wholeheartedly disagree - it is one of the most intellectually stimulating course I have taken while at Yale. Recommend without reservation.",
    "It's exactly what you expect. No surprises here.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is committed to go to all the lectures. I learned a lot of valuable history in this class. As I said the course load is very light, but if you commit yourself to the reading and lectures, you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "You will get out of this class as much as you put into it. The subject matter of the lectures and books is very relevant and interesting, so, especially if you are planning to rule the world, please do take this class.",
    "The topics are really interesting, but the lectures tend to be boring most of the time.",
    "Nope.",
    "Dilemmas of the Nuclear Age is a course one should take if they are a Political science major and are both interested in the Cold War era, and have a very difficult semester. This is not to say that Dilemmas is easy, it is not. However, the workload is less than some other courses.I would recommend this course to a fellow student because the mid twentieth century is a time period that should always be studied, especially within the scope of American power."
