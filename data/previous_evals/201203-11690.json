    "I would highly recommend this lab. I really enjoyed doing the experiments, and the atmosphere was great. I'm not really sure how the grading will go, but the important thing is that I enjoyed the experiment. Just make sure you hold out through the Wyman section... you'll still be getting out at 6 instead of 530, but at least it will be 6 and not 7.",
    "A good class overall. Take it if you need another bio lab. Different from other labs in that it is less cookbook-y. Outside of class the work is VERY reasonable, with sets of short lab reports due only a few times during the semester. The one thing to be prepared for is long lab sessions. Thankfully the labs are pretty interesting though, and Brett is an enjoyable professor to work with. Some cool stuff here--overall I'd recommend it.",
    "Good lab but it's really long - on average about 5 hours. But the experiments are intersting and it's not too much work.",
    "This is a really fun lab, provided you aren't afraid of working with animals. You get to hold a human brain! And see the actual firing patterns of neurons! So cool. Just be warned - the labs will often take part 6 PM, especially at the beginning of the year. But sometimes they will give you cookies as a break!"
