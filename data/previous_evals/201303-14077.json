   "comments": [
    "I recommend this seminar for students interested in reading texts on Arabic biblical material. It is not an intro course, there are no lectures, and students are given a lot of freedom to chose texts to concentrate on.",
    "This was a fascinating course that covered a lot of ground, though also allowing for the depth of discussion that texts like those we read deserve.Professor Davis is an incredible teacher and his mastery of the many areas of history, language, philosophy and theology required by this course is clear in every moment of every meeting. He conducts the class in a way that is flexible enough to allow for eye-opening discoveries in unforeseen directions, but not without the overall directions that gives shape and context to the material.",
    "Interdisciplinary and comparative discussion of a Christian Arabic text in its Jewish, Christian, and Islamic contextsI would recommend it, but they should have good Arabic",
    "This class will give you an interesting look into medieval Christian writing in Arabic, both in terms of biblical translations and commentary. It is very specific and limited in its scope, so I wouldn't recommend going in without a decent background in eastern Christian history and theology. If you feel you can get a lot of out of a class by examining a small portion of several texts in extreme detail, this is a good one. If not, it would probably be better to take a more comprehensive survey course on the subject."

   "comments": [
    "This course allowed me to feel more comfortable navigating Christian Arabic biblical texts, and gave me a broader sense of the secondary literature and the field in general.",
    "This course asks more questions than it answers, and opens new opportunities for research the more it is researched. It has given me more of an idea of the sort of studies I hope to pursue at the graduate level, and a great deal of insight into the particular questions that I am hoping to answer as my studies in this discipline continue."
