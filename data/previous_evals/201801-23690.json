    "I learned a lot about reading and writing in Spanish.",

   "comments": [
    "This course has a high workload, but it definitely helps you improve your Spanish.",
    "This course almost moves too quickly. There is a constant barrage of busy-work like activities that make it difficult for the professor to get back to you quickly and help you improve your Spanish. The best part of the class were the large discussion we had, but these were rare and interspersed with activities that felt unfocused and ineffective.",
    "The readings were interesting and the workload was never overwhelming. I wish that the classes were more engaging and that we had more time to practice speaking rather than listen to explanations from the teacher. The 2 debates we had in class were great--I wish we had more things like that",
    "I think we could have focused more on speaking and dialogue in class. Also we often got distracted, wasting much of the short period.",
    "Not enough in class oral practice. Time spent on grammatical concepts was rushed and not revisited after one assignment\/class discussion. Comfortable class setting.",
    "Strengths- high level of cultural engagement, many out-of-classroom activities to participate in Weaknesses- more time needed to practice speaking and under different (informal and formal) settings"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It requires a ton of work, but has helped me with my Spanish a lot.",
    "Yes, this course was a fair and not-too-overwhelming next step for people who took AP Spanish in high school. Having not practiced Spanish for two years, I regained and surpassed my previous level of Spanish by far. That said, the learning curve at the beginning was a little steep for me, but not unmanageable since I was really motivated to improve my Spanish. Workload was not too bad, and we met just three times a week. Tortora is a fun teacher--a little disorganized with assignment deadlines at times, but overall very nice. She always gives detailed feedback on graded assignments and is responsive to emails",
    "While I loved Tortora as a professor (she is so caring and helpful!), I feel as though I didn't learn a ton of new Spanish information. If you're taking this to learn Spanish grammar, it's sort of helpful. If you're taking it because you need an L5 credit, you can find a more interesting class with less work, for sure. It was a less intense continuation of L1-L4.",
    "The course material is fairly easy: no serious grammar, pretty manageable readings. That said, grading is notoriously difficult (this may apply to most Spanish lang classes, I'm not sure), and a quarter of my class regularly failed exams (until some dropped). Personally, I don't think my speaking skills improved much, but the main area in which you might see improvement is reading (given that you do it). Nice professor, and overall a good, well-rounded experience to get your L5 done.",
    "I would say yes, if you like reading and writing. It does not focus as much on oral communication as I had hoped.",
    "Yes - I think this course was a reasonable workload. Since it's not every day I didn't feel like I became fluent or anything but it's a solid class for fulfilling a language requirement and if you don't have a ton of time on your hands to dedicate to a language class. Good balance of a challenging class that's not overwhelming - you get out what you put in but it's not too hard to stay afloat. Most topics of discussion were pretty controversial, so that was engaging but also could be weird. Even if you aren't super confident in your Spanish skills\/ didn't take L4 at Yale (like me), this is a good course for you (probably) if you placed into L5.",
    "Yes, it is a great introduction to the L5 language courses in Spanish",
    "This is a fine L5. Some of the readings are very interesting, but I wish there was more time spent speaking in class."
