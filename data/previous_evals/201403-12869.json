    "Very interesting readings and the professor is great. Definitely take it if you want to improve upon your analytic and speaking capabilities.",
    "The reading list is a madhouse. The Baudelaire-Mallarme-Rimbaud trio that makes people excited about the class isn't actually the best stuff you'll read. Bertrand's Gaspard de la Nuit is a masterpiece, and Ponge has great stuff too. Lautreamont is a really unfortunate mess, but some people really liked it. Expect pretty big reading assignments of complicated stuff. Professor Connolly is a kabbalist. Not really (or maybe? I don't actually know), but you should know that going in. His favorite thing to do is dig up the etymologies of words and then sort of free-associate from there to find connections (and stuff). Whether this counts as ridiculous or super-hip is up to you. I wish he were more explicit about his critical methods, because I'm pretty sure he's convinced of the value of doing wacky etymological derivations - he just won't spend any time convincing you why they may be worthwhile. That about does it - crazy readings, crazy professor - it's loads of fun, but difficult, and sometimes ridiculous.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to another student. Professor Connolly has a lot of interesting, engaging (and very timely) readings up his proverbial sleeves. Some of the poets you read are a little underwhelming, but Mallarm and Ponge (and even maybe Lautramont) are worth your time.",
    "Good survey of the genre, which sometimes gets tiresome. (How many times can you write a poem about poetry?!)",
    "Yes.",
    "Classes generally started off with a mini-lecture from Professor Connolly on the poet we were studying that week, followed by different close reading\/discussion exercises, often done in pairs or small groups. Readings were actually pretty varied in style and all phenomenal. There were definitely a lot of opportunities to practice speaking French through class discussions and the 10-minute presentation each student had to give (which were all pretty fascinating). Professor Connolly is one of the most understatedly brilliant professors I've had at Yale so far. Don't be discouraged by his reading from a stack of printed pages during the first day of reading periodyou get used to it quickly and it just shows how much he prepares for class; he genuinely tried to incorporate everyone's reading responses into class discussion. In short: great syllabus, fascinating subject, incredible professor. Don't miss out on this course."
