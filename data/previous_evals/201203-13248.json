    "If you like Microeconomics, takes this class. In many ways, this is another way to examine economics interactions among a few parties. Useful arguments against the Coase Theorem, mostly theoretical content but make sure you know basic calculus.",
    "This is a very theoretical course. There is only rarely a discussion of real cases and real numbers. It is a micro and game theory approach to contract law, which it turns out is a very interesting subject with implications for legal, economic and philosophical theories. If this sounds interesting to you, by all means take it. It also has the benefit of not having much work: two problem sets, a midterm and a short final, all of which are not very harshly graded. Beware, though: this is not a class for those who can stomach a whole semester of extremely abstract situations.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in economic analysis of legal contractual incentives. This class gives you a very interesting perspective on how law and economics relate to one another. The course consisted of two problem sets (right before the midterm exams so that they prepared you for them), two midterms, and one final exam. The math can seem very intimidating at first (a lot of derivatives and integrations in the proofs), but that level of rigor isn't tested on exams, which are a lot more focused on concepts. Professor Brooks is also a sweetheart. Good econ class overall.",
    "Absolutely not. It was the least interesting course I've taken at Yale, and I feel as though I've learned less from it than any other course I've taken.",
    "If you want to learn about contracts from a MATH AND ECONOMICS perspective, this is probably a good option. HOWEVER, if you are more interested in the LAW aspect, this really isn't for you. There are very few case studies--it is essentially all calculus and maximization functions.",
    "The class uses economics to evaluate different remedies offered by law. Through the models, you examine whether the remedies are efficient and also consider whether or not law is actually necessary. Take this class!",
    "The subject matter of this class is potentially fascinating\u00e2\u0080\u0094moving beyond the traditional economic framework, which focuses on the individual, to one where the basic unit of analysis is the relationship. However, the course was bloody awful.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure why, given this course has been offered in the past, but Prof. Brooks never seemed to have notes prepared in time (or at least ones without typos). I eventually realized that many of his notes were cribbed directly from his papers in the legal literature, which makes this even more ridiculous. We were unable to keep to the syllabus presented at the beginning, which likely was overly ambitious anyways. On the other hand, spreading out the material did not mean it was better presented. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not much of a fan of powerpoint, but the form would at least force Brooks to say what he means and commit to it instead of mumbling and fudging around on the blackboard.This was all made worse by the fact that we were only given two problem sets throughout the term. Problem sets ought to have been at least bi-weekly and should not have required so much guesswork. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m fairly certain Brooks just put whatever he did not get to in class in his problem sets and banked on us figuring it out. Tests, particularly their qualitative sections, were likewise a learning experience. No efforts were made to make it easy for students to attend section. We were literally presented with oneopen time, not subject to reconsideration. The times I was able to attend section (11:30 am on Friday), it was extremely unhelpful. No materials were prepared. It was basically like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cProf. Brooks did an awful job of explaining things in class. Could you do an equally bad job of it? Also, if you could go off on a poorly considered tangent, that would be great as well.\u00e2\u0080\u009dProf. Brooks, while an ebullient personality, also has the rudest email habits on the face of planet earth. He is clearly some form of Luddite, given that he refused to ever put materials on our ClassesV2 (or even initialize the site), but it is not okay in the year 2012 for a university professor to not reply to students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 emails.In short, I implore you to not take this course, the course he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offering next term, or any other with Prof. Brooks at the helm.",
    "Take the course if you are interested in how contracts are made and other parts of econ\/law. Not too much work. 2 midterms, 1 final. Make sure to go to office hours, exam material is usually very aligned with course readings. Professor Brooks is an extremely warm-hearted and knowledgeable professor in contract theory. He teaches the course with a great deal of enthusiasm for the subject. However, be prepared for a little bit of disorganization happening.",
    "I'd recommend this course to any student interested in Law, Game Theory, or Mathematical Economics. However, I would, under pretty much no circumstances, recommend taking this class for a grade. You should take it Cr\/D because the grading system is totally unclear and it will cause you unmeasurable grief if you take it for a grade.",
    "I would recommend it, especially if you are considering law school. This course will give you perspectives on the law that you don't find anywhere else. It will give you a methodology you can apply on all aspects of the law, not only what we work on in class."
