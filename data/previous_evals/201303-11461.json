    "This course will probably never be offered again, but taking something with John Demos before you graduate. He brings such wonderful insights to history, and really loves what he does. The material we studied was interesting and relies heavily on a psychological\/psychoanalytical approach to history \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whether or not you find this sound, it is certainly interesting, and Demos was open enough to other interpretations so that discussion never became too one-sided. Take it!",
    "A hugely interesting course, whether you think you're interested in witches or not! Particularly brought to life by Professor Demos, who is a leading authority in the field, and skillfully uses witch-hunting to frame wider questions on history and human nature. Workload is manageable, and the readings are mostly interesting.",
    "History 110J acts as a course seeking to not only explain the various cases of witch-hunting from the middle ages to now, but also seeks to find various common threads between them. This course not only explains the history of witchcraft and witch-hunting, but also seeks to find an explanation for why these two phenomena have happened so many times throughout human history. I suggest this course to anyone that wants a strong, challenging, and thought-provoking history seminar on the topics mentioned above. It also doesn't hurt that Professor Demos is one of the leading authors in the field."
