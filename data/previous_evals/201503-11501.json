   "comments": [
    "Methods was my favorite class this semester. I would highly recommend taking it (not that we really have a choice as BBSB students). But definitely try to approach the class with an open mindset, I think you will be surprised at the outcome. Don't be afraid to be adventurous in your responses. It's a tough course, but you can only benefit from participating. Even if what you answer is wrong, giving it a shot is more important. Thinking through an answer with your classmates can be highly rewarding.",
    "This is a required course for first year BBSB students.",
    "The hours suck,but it's actually pretty cool.",
    "The class is essentially discussing papers and working through the experimental logic of each one. I would recommend it since it improves critical thinking.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to someone else. I found it enriching and entertaining. I have a recommendation for the course, though. I found the presentations at the end of term to be very interesting and intellectually challenging. I was thinking that if we cut down on some of the papers, we could include presentations more frequently. I felt that the challenge of thinking up our own follow up projects was really interesting. With two or more different presentations in a casual setting you could see us improve in our analytical and presentation skills over time.",
    "I really like methods and logic. This course requires a lot of work if you want to fully understand each article. However, I know some students who got away with skimming the articles because the professors won't call on students. This course forces you to think critically about experiments and methods, and at the end of the class, you have the chance to design your own experiment. You learn to give a chalk talk as well as write a paper about your proposal. This class also allows you to know your classmates better because of the long class time and because you are split into a group of ~10 people.",
    "You get a great background on the scientific discoveries in the 20th century and about biochemical processes and at the same time you learn to think critically.",
    "I highly recommended this class to first-year BBSB students, and I think this is by far the best class I took at Yale.",
    "This class gets you to think about science in a more critical way, for your own research and for reading other publications. I definitely would recommend this class to anyone!",
    "Absolutely, I think every student studying biology (at the graduate or advanced undergraduate level) should take this course. It really develops your critical thinking skills regarding experimentation.",
    "Great class. The workload is not overbearing and the discussions are good. If you are a quiet person, it's best to sit closest to the professors.",
    "In this course, you would have fun reading the papers and discussing them with your classmates. You would also have fun eating pizza every week (until you get tired of pizza...). Highly recommended. 10\/10 would take it again."

   "comments": [
    "This course exposed me to molecular biology techniques that are critical for a broad understanding of my research.",
    "Helped me to think critically of the papers I read.",
    "I learned a lot about molecular biology and general biology techniques that I had a weak background in beforehand.",
    "I feel that this course was helpful in deepening my knowledge of the big scientific accomplishments and how to analyze and be critical of papers in the literature.",
    "This class allowed me to learn how to effectively read articles. Namely, I learned how to better interpret figures, look for pitfalls in methods that lead to false conclusions, consider alternative models\/approaches, etc.",
    "I have a better idea now how research should be conducted and how an experiment has to have specific controls in order to draw true conclusions. I also learned a lot about how to design an experiment and how to structure a good paper.",
    "This class teaches me a lot about how to read literature.",
    "This course was extremely helpful for developing myself as a scientist. It helped develop critical thinking when reading papers as well as a overview of seminal papers in the biochemistry field.",
    "It made me aware of 1) proper controls for different experiments 2) there's usually a very clever approach which happens to be simple which can answer any biological question.",
    "My knowledge of the weaknesses and strengths of various techniques has definitely improved. More importantly, the way I fundamentally approach scientific papers has shifted. In undergrad, I focused on the background and discussion. After this class, the methods section may be the part I scrutinize most.",
    "By reading three papers every week, this course helped me improve my reading skills and taught me the application of various biochemical techniques. Most importantly, it horned my critical thinking skills which would come in handy during dissertation\/research."
