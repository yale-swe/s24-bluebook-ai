   "comments": [
    "ABSOLUTELY. Seriously, take this class if you can. I absolutely loved it. The essays are fun to write, the books\/essays are fun to read, and Linda Peterson is fantastic. Most semesters there is even a field trip to Walden Pond.",
    "You must take this class if you love our Earth! The writers are so important in the history of nature writing, conservationism, and creative non-fiction. My only complaint is that the class cannot continue for me next semester! (But I am committed to reading more of everyone that we briefly touched on)",
    "If you like nature writing, take this class. Professor Peterson chooses a wide range of different styles of nature writing and then leads productive discussions about the writers' stylistic choices. You will also learn biographical information about a lot of interesting people.",
    "I HIGHLY recommend this class. For those of you who already love nature writing and idolize people like Thoreau, John Muir, and Edward Abbey, this class will not only be intellectually exciting, but spiritually refreshing. For those of you looking for a good writing credit and have never heard of Walden Pond, this class may help you discover a new passion!",
    "Amazing class from start to finish. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Nature Writing in the English Speaking World was a phenomenal introduction to the concept, style, and history of nature writing as well as a taste of many of the greatest nature writers of the past several centuries. Although there are creative options for the essays, this class is not one to take if you are interested in a writing-intensive course, instead it is perfect for an introduction to the greatest contemporary nature writers--many of which I will return to and read in full. The class was also a chance for me to think about how we write about nature, relate to it, and place ourselves in it.",
    "Take this class if you are a walker, a wanderer, a woods-lover, or a bird-watcher. The readers are delightful, if you fall into these categories. If you do not, you will quickly grow bored with the syllabus. The first half of the course covers 19th-c nature writers like Darwin and Gilbert White; the second half moves into the 20th-c and basically reads a series of essays from many different writers. Each student in the class gets to pick one writer to present on, and you write a subsequent paper on that writer. I really liked this structure, and grew very attached to my writer. In general, the class is fantastic - but only if you love this kind of writing!"
