   "comments": [
    "I think the course did a wonderful job of communicating the ideas of algebraic topology, but more specificity in the lectures would've been helpful in developing skills. It's also a bit disorganized, but that could just be a function of the fact that it's a graduate course.",
    "I thought the homework and exams were good. I could have used some more details in class, but other than that no complaints.",
    "Our professor sketches the key ideas of the course rather inspiringly. But my lack of background knowledge makes it iemperative for me to read the detailed proofs in the textbook right after classes.",
    "I felt that a number of the homework exercises, while important for understanding the concepts directly, were not useful later on. As such, it sometimes felt like busy work and I did not think there was much gained from these problems. That said, I appreciate the difficulties in assigning problems for a first-year algebraic topology class. Topics were well-chosen, though sometimes not emphasized as strongly as they could have been (e.g. Euler characteristic from homology, Betti #s, cohomology as intersections, etc). Interesting mix of categorical and combinatorial viewpoints. I don't think that peer grading worked very well. While I learned a fair bit from grading others, I found other students' comments unenlightening and sometimes I was less rigorous than I should have been because I knew I could get away with it."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course because the subject is really cool and the professor is good at helping you to get the main ideas, but it's a very challenging course and you'll have to do a lot of work on the side. Not that that's a bad thing! But it is a lot, and you have to be ready for that going in.",
    "Algebraic topology is really beautiful subject in many respects. It provides great geometric insight and allows you to prove really powerful theorems like Brouwer fixed point theorem. It gives a geometric interpretation of many concepts in group theory (i.e. covering spaces). It also provides you with some of the most concrete examples of ideas of homological algebra\/category theory (chain complexes, boundary maps, functors) which are important in a variety of fields. If you're an undergrad planning on going to grad school, you should really take this course, and if you're a grad student, well, you don't really have any choice about whether or not to take this course. Frankel has a pretty informal style when it comes to proving things requiring you to go elsewhere (e.g. Hatcher) to get all the details, but he does a decent job at providing geometric insight into what's going on.",
    "Very interesting material, and Professor Frankel was a good lecturer and was available for office hours.",
    "This is definitely a rewarding course for people to witness how algebra may be applied to understand topology and geometry.",
    "Yes."
