    "Yes. Karen's awesome and chill, and really makes and effort to use different modalities of learning in the class (videos, creative writing, ect.), which is refreshing! Some of the activities we did in class, while fun, seemed a bit pointless (like watching Sailor Moon for 30 min.). The workload is not intense at all (3 small papers and a final research paper with an open page limit), but there is quite a bit of reading. Overall, this small seminar was pretty laid back.",
    "Very interesting class! I didn't know much about Japan beforehand and it was fine for me, so don't worry too much if you haven't taken any classes related to Japan already. The assignments are cool--a lot of the time Karen will give you the option of doing a short story or something creative instead of just an essay. Lectures were fun and relaxed, and there was a lot of opportunity for discussion and not just lecturing.",
    "A must-take if you're ready to uncover the not-so-favorable aspects of Japan. There's a lot of reading, but you don't have to do all of it. Karen's great!"
