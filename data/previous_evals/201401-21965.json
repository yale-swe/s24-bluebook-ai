    "This is a fantastic course!!! It is incredibly different from CHEM 332, so DO NOT let your experience with first semester influence whether or not you take this course. You must take it with Vaccaro. Do it. You will not regret it. You won't be using the textbook from last semester, though, so DO NOT miss lecture. He makes his own psets, his own lecture notes, his own powerpoint slides, and his own exams. They are all clear, and he really works to both get you to understand everything and to integrate everything together. The homeworks are composed of 3 or 4 questions each with a gazillion parts that walk you through the whole problem. They're pretty easy, and most people get high 90's on them. The exams pretty much follow a similar format with one set of (tricky) true or false questions, one graph question, and one regular question. (They don't have the hints like the homeworks do). But still, the exams are once again not that hard. If you are shopping this class, however, do not be mislead by the material he covers during shopping period. Once he hits quantum mechanics a couple of weeks in it gets a lot harder. But seriously, I doubt you will regret taking this course even if you don't do well, because you will learn so much!",
    "You'll learn a lot, but don't take it if you don't have to. It's a ton of work and you are forced to take the exams at night (5 hours) instead of in class, complete a problem set during reading period, and go to class during reading period. It's a real downer when everyone else at Yale is going to Spring Fling and you are stuck doing a problem set. Made my life miserable and depressing.",
    "Really, really interesting course, but if you're looking at it, you probably already know that it is tough. You take the class with some really intelligent students who know their stuff, which makes it pretty tough. I would recommend it, but be prepared to work. I have no idea what my grade will be because the exams are pretty tough, but I am very happy to say that I completed it.",
    "You're probably taking this because it's required and you've already completed the first semester of pchem. Be warned - this class is all quantum mechanics, and it's significantly harder than the first semester! Problem sets are more regular and can take up to ten hours a week, and the material and exams are much more challenging, especially the dreaded true\/false section on each test. The workload is manageable, though, and the material is definitely learnable. Pay attention to the problem set questions, because the exams will be in a similar vein. And go to lectures! The handouts are essential, and you really do learn a lot just by listening to Professor Vaccaro. It was a tough journey, but I came out feeling good about the material and the class. It's fun if you let it be!",
    "A rigorous course that pushes you to your limits with the amount of material and work but is very rewarding in the end. Definitely recommend",
    "Prepare for the best class in the chemistry department, taught by the best professor (though you may want to stay away from it if you hate physics and math). The class is essentially quantum chemistry from start to finish; you start small, with the simplest quantum systems, and you get all the way to molecules by the end. You finally see where all the stuff in gen chem comes from. The problem sets tend to be long, but you can finish most of them in less than 5 hours if you are focused and know what you are doing. As for the exams, make sure you know all the material because magic Prof. Vaccaro will find a way to test you on everything. You will appreciate his giving you essentially unlimited time to finish the two midterms. I imagine the class would be pretty hard if you are not mathematically-minded, but you will get a lot out of it regardless. Prof. Vaccaro will manage to keep you engaged for every minute, from first to last. I would recommend this class to anybody with a good grasp of the physical sciences, interested to learn how things work at the most elementary level and willing to put in a considerable amount of work. The CHEM 332 requirement should also not be a deterring factor: I\u2019m pretty sure you should be able to take CHEM 333 without it, as I don\u2019t recall ever using any of the knowledge from 332 in this class.",
    "Lots and lots and lots of work. Great class, really interesting, definitely recommend taking with Vaccaro, but don't take with a full\/busy schedule.",
    "A truly fantastic, amazing class that is even worth the subpar first semester just to be able to take. The problem sets (although they take an inordinate amount of time) are truly works of art and you learn as much doing them as you do in class (which, is to say, quite a lot). The class is always going and requires quite a bit attention but, if you give it, will teach you more quantum mechanics than you can imagine. I couldn't recommend this class more highly - it reminded me why it is that I love chemistry.",
    "A necessary course for all chemistry majors!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any person who has a background in the physical sciences or math. You won't be disappointed. It's some of the coolest material you will study and explains a lot of what we take for granted in intro-level courses.",
    "I would encourage anyone and everyone to take this class. It's the best class I've ever taken. Honestly I don't think I even did particularly well in the course, but it's such a rewarding class that I don't mind at all. Professor Vaccaro is incredible and he makes the class enjoyable and as understandable as quantum mechanics can be. This class is so good I'd recommend it to Classics majors who have literally no background in chemistry. They might struggle, but it'd be worth it.",
    "Physical Chemistry II was perhaps my favorite class at Yale. It was also the most demanding and difficult class I've ever taken. The course takes you through 300 years of chemistry and introduces you to all aspects of quantum mechanics theory. The course exercises great depth and and great breadth. The strenght in this course is ultimately Professor Vaccaro, who has in some sense dedicated a ton of time and effort in making the course as streamlined and organized as possible. However, that being said, PVH demands as much of you as he demands of himself. The course traverses the tales of many great scientific thinkers and builds up to molecular orbital theory from the very fundamental case solutions to the Schrodinger equation: Particle in a box, particle on a ring, and particle on a sphere. OFten times it is easy to get lost in the lecture, as several new mathematical (as well as chemistry-related) topics are introduced. The only weakness in the course is the difficulty in being able to tie in the vasts amount of information together in a way that one can see the whole as the sum of its component parts. However, by the end of the course you will be required to do this one way or another, so I recommend putting in a lot of effort. The Psets are the most challenging (often ranging from 10-15 hours), but can be broken up during the course of the week if one is so wise. The biggest piece of advice for preparation for the midterm and final: read Professor Vaccaro's binder in the SSSI building. His notes are well detailed and outlined like a textbook, and it is often useful to see someone else's notes other than your own.",
    "Take it. It's the best quantum mechanics class I have ever taken. Professor Vaccaro's teaching is mind-blowing.",
    "The class was really difficult. Professor Vaccaro can be nice and helpful, but fundamentally I found the class difficult and pretty much life-ruining for the semester. Definitely would not take if I didn't have to. But you already probably have to which is why you're seeing this course eval.",
    "Wow. This class. The material is so interesting and rad, and the lectures are actually possible to pay attention to, which for me is AMAZING. I'm usually TERRIBLE at writing down notes and actually paying attention to the lecture at the same time, but Vaccaro kept it non-boring. However, a LOT gets covered, and if you're not on the ball, it can be tough. If you take too many other difficult classes in the same semester, you're probably not going to be able to learn everything. Prof. Vaccaro cares about his students a lot, so don't freak out if he seems concerned about you.",
    "The only class I hated more than this one was pchem lab. Vaccaro is a fine teacher but is just utterly unreasonable. Don't take this class unless you have to. We had class during reading week, a pset due during reading week, midterms that went til midnight, and the psets were ridiculous sometimes.",
    "You'll have to take this course if you're a Chemistry major. Definitely the most difficult course you can take at Yale. The weekly problem sets usually take the whole day to finish.",
    "I mean, don't take this course unless you 1) have to as a requirement, 2) are irrationally good at physics, and 3) are masochistic and want to have your time consumed by a course."
