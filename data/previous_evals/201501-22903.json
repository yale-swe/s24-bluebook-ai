   "comments": [
    "A no-nonsense introduction to ordinary differential equations. This is a very doable math class. Moncrief, while perhaps fitting the archetype of the \"zany scientist,\" is also a genuinely nice guy who wants us to succeed. Many people skipped class regularly, but I think it's easier to just go to class and pay attention--you won't even have to buy the book. The take-home final was a bit of a wild card.",
    "Boring but necessary and required course. It reminded me of a high school BC calculus class where the class was learning different solving techniques and then the homework was pretty simple applications of those ideas. The algebra was tedious at times. The class was pretty easy and not much work. If you need it for your major and don't really care about differential equations I would recommend this class. The ENAS one is apparently a lot of work but they cover more material.",
    "Ordinary differential equations.",
    "This class is not worth the effort - it does not provide a great introduction to differential equations, and enas course probably fullfills this role much better. It is good for those who want some very basic introduction to differential equations without doing actual work. Psets are ridiculously short and easy.",
    "A good course for learning the basics about differential equations if that is applicable to your coursework\/career but it's not going to be your favorite, most mind-blowing course. Be prepared to do a lot of computation.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who generally enjoys math courses. Math 246 is mostly a problem-solving class, although significant time in the lectures is often dedicated to producing (or outlining) proofs. There is one problem set a week (generally pretty straightforward), two midterms (which were very fair assessments on the material covered on the problem sets), and no final. Professor Moncrief's lectures are a little dry (attendance waned by the end of the semester), but they are helpful in motivating the methods required for the problem sets. I would have liked to see a more diverse range of applications (the only ones that Moncrief presents are from physics).",
    "I would recommend this class to students interested in mathematics . It is pretty straightforward and the professor really cares about how well you understand the material",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Work load is not that great, and it will give you exposure at the very least to basic differential equation solving techniques. It was not the most intellectually stimulating, but I do think I have improved as a mathematician because of it.",
    "it was an alright course if you are interested in proofs. but honestly you need to learn most of the proofs by reading the book",
    "Not too challenging of a class, since it's all applied and you don't nees to prove anything if you're not interested in theoretical math. That being said, don't take it too lightly... that's what I did",
    "Relatively easy math class. Convince yourself that it's worth taking.",
    "This is not a bad course, it teaches you the basics of ODE. Professor Moncrief is very clear and concise, but the material is dry and he omitted unfortunately computational techniques, which would have been interesting. Also, despite being a pure math course, it doesn't really have a lot of proofs. Homework and exams are pretty much straightforward computations, which is nice but boring.",
    "I would recommend it to people who have to take diffeq, but if they don't have to take it, its a bit boring.",
    "Math 246 is a good overview of the initial foundations of ordinary differential equations. With Professor Moncrief, lecture was easy to follow and the problem sets seemed to go hand in hand with the material. Occasionally we'd get a problem that didn't seem to fit, but overall I enjoyed the class and recommend it to another student looking to supplement their differential equations background without diving head first into the engineering version that has a much quicker and more difficult pace.",
    "Do it! Definitely one of the better credits especially if you are an Econ\/Math major. As a Math major you probably want something more rigorous though.",
    "Not too difficult of a course, and definitely an easier alternative to the ENAS diffeq. The most difficult part of this course comes in making sure every tiny calculation detail is correct, but asides from that, the material isn't particularly difficult. I found Prof Moncrief to be not the most engaging lecturer, but didn't take advantage of any office hours to interact with him beyond that. Harder alternatives definitely exist if you want a more rigorous and proof-y differential equations course.",
    "Brief course on ordinary differential equation. after this you will pretty much know how to solve most ordinary 1st and second order equation",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is not as much work as other math classes, but the treatment of ODE's is just, compared to a course where ODE's and PDE's are taught in the same semester. The workload and tedium of the homework pick up towards the end of the course, but overall the course is a great way to learn about ODE's and their applications without dreadfully repeating the same types of problems again and again. Math majors should definitely take this course to see how all of the theory learned in math can easily be applied, and any person majoring in a quantitative subject should absolutely take this course so this vital area of study can be a second language.",
    "Take if required, or interested in DiffEq. However, do not expect this to go very deep into theory.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class to any student majoring in any type of stem field. I am a physics major and I found that this class helped me immeasurably in my other classes. In addition, this class is as close to a gut as a math class could be. The material is very straightforward and there arent a lot of surprises on the exams. If you study the problem sets and do some extra practice, you will do well. I would also recommend taking this class with Prof. Moncrief if you have the choice. He was very good at answering questions and seemed to have a good grasp of what the students found difficult, which is saying something for a math professor.",
    "I would recommend it if you want an easier math class. Not that exciting.",
    "If you are taking or took Math 230 and Math 231, as I did, this class will be a walk in the park for you. I took Math 231 at the same time as this class and this class felt so easy. The homework will feel tedious, but it will help you master the material to the point where you wont easily forget it. This was not such an exciting interesting class for me but I took it anyways since differential equations is an important topic because of all useful applications of differential equations. If you struggle at Math I would disregard my review about the class not being exciting and being very easy it may be a different story for you. If you are strong at math my review will be relevant to you."
