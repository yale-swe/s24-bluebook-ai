    "This is the toughest eval. i've had to do- or at least is the really the only one that i truly care about.Bailis has potential to be the best teacher at FES--he learns everyone's name, somehow, he cares about the material he teaches, his lectures are well structured and his powerpoints are professional. He is kind and his time for students. He has all the skills.But I don't know about the model of the course that Bailis has chosen. A three hour lecture for 50 students is a challenge for any teacher, and I'm not sure its working for this class. Bowers sucks as a room-we should be right up in Bailis' face and forced to interact with his material. Laptops should be strongly discouraged. I wish the course could be capped at 20 for the intimacy that bailis' work deserves. But he's teaching broad concepts and many people should take the class.I encourage Bailis to consider how to make his class more accessible...and to consider how to incentivize paying attention in lecture more.",
    "With a class titled \"Climate Change,\" I was expecting more from the professor.",
    "too much information to grasp but very useful class",
    "Question 12:Professor Bailis was a fantastic teacher. He seems to be really invested in students' learning, and always made an effort to facilitate greater discussions and more questioning. One of my favorite professors.",
    "This was an excellent class and exposed us to a wide range of important issues related to climate change. It provides a good starting point for us to dig further into any of the topics.",
    "Professor Bailis is fantastic. I hope to take more classes with him in the future.",
    "The professor and the teaching fellow were very approachable and accessible for this class. We got feedback on our reflections each week before the class.",
    "This course was hurt by its size, time slot, and classroom. These aspects make a huge difference. With half the students in a smaller room (Bowers is not an appropriate classroom for any subject) and a better time slot, the class could have been excellent. No courses should only have one class meeting a week and Tuesday afternoon is probably the worst time slot for most students.",
    "Q-4. the instruction was too fast for me to understand. moreover, it was difficult to make out what the instructor was speaking.",
    "I thought this class was fantastic. It put together so many aspects of climate change into one space.As did most of the students, I am more familiar with sections of the course than other sections. I thought the professor did a great job of giving tangible peaks into many different regions of the climate change issue so that students who specialize in one area are now (at least vaguely) familiar with many areas of research.One point of criticism, however, is that the Mitigation part did not come across as well as the Impacts or Adaptation sections. Perhaps it is because my interests lay with Impacts\/Adaptation and not as much with Mitigation or because it was just that time of the semester, but I thought it was not as engaging a section as the other two were. Which is to say that it was still incredibly well thought-out and presented. (This comment may be a note more about my own interests, but I thought I'd include it in case others mentioned similar comments.)",

    "The breadth of the material",

    "The lectures were great. They carried the audience throughout and were well-presented.",
    "The Impacts and Adaptation sections.",
    "Both the readings and discussions were very helpful. The weekly assignment helped me to keep with the readings and get the most out of the in-class discussions and lectures. In particular, I found preparing for and facilitating the in-class discussion to be very useful. I have not had much previous experience facilitating a class, so this was a great experience, and I learned the material for that week the best by far.",
    "It's range of topics, showing the threads of climate change in so many aspects of science, policy, technology, and humanities. The breadth was helpful especially for putting the conversation in a global context."

   "comments": [
    "Rob's lectures could have been more exciting. Towards the end of the semester, it seemed like he was less interested in the class. Even interesting topics became a bit dull.It would have been great to hear more of the prof's personal opinions on the subject, or his research in biofuels. Anything to get below the surface, get into things below the UN level. I'm much more interested in science, state policy, and case studies than I am in UNFCC stuff, so I found the constant return to the international framework to be frustrating.I realize the class needs to cover a lot, so it's hard to dive in more. I'd suggest skipping or severely cutting the portion on climate science -- this part most people know already, or they can read about ahead of time. Or maybe the class could be solely on adaptation. It just felt really general, and it was hard to debate these topics in the second part of class without feeling a bit silly, given that we had only done a handful of readings on them.",
    "I think this class would be better if it were smaller, allowing for more interactions between Bailis and his students.",
    "Format of big lecture.",
    "Discussion sections got off to a rocky start, but improved later in the semester as students gained knowledge and sessions became more activity-centric.",
    "the lectures are dry and the group discussions are not engaging enough.furthermore, if we are expected to write reading responses each week, we deserve more feedback than a one-line response without a grade.",
    "Screen some information which i dont think will be an easy task given the nature of climate change",
    "Some topics needed more in-depth discussion than others. Attempting to treat them more or less equally was detrimental to those climate change related topics that needed more attention.",
    "I wish there would have been more time dedicated to teaching the science behind climate change itself. Only 90 minutes on the first day of class was dedicated to the reasons why climate is changing.I personally did not get much value out of the class discussions. I would have preferred to have longer lectures and less discussion because the class seemed just too big to allow for any meaningful conversation.",
    "As engaged and enthusiastic as he is, the professor is simply not a clear or engaging lecturer at this point. Particularly as a 3 hour, afternoon lecture this made it difficult for students to remain alert and engaged themselves. Also, I would suggest splitting this course up into 2 or 3 courses. As things were, we just scratched the surface of all topics we covered. My impression was that most students in the class had at least some exposure to climate change issues, and at our pace most probably learned very little that was new to them.",
    "I think this course would serve better as two 1.5 hour classes, rather than as one 3 hour lecture. The class could be set up in a very similar way (half lecture\/half discussion).",
    "the policy paper was very fun to write but the final paper was not structured. on the one hand this is good because it allows for flexibility but many of us were unclear on what was the objective of the paper.. i think that in the future providing guidelines on the objectives of the paper would be helpful. or continuing with the policy paper framework and expanding on that would be great. maybe with more critical analysis of existing literature..",
    "I would have preferred if the class was a seminar with fewer students.",
    "The discussion sessions were sometimes not as useful as they could have been. Perhaps more structure might help.",
    "The course needed more student engagement during lectures. A smaller class in a better room would have helped solve this problem.",
    "Reading materials",
    "reading materials have to be reduced.",
    "The discussions were lacking. I am not sure if this is because it was the second half of a three-hour class, the fault of discussion leaders, or the size of the discussion groups. I would re-consider how discussions are constructed and seriously consider curtailing the discussion leaders' ability to \"be creative\" with their discussion format. I found that the \"creative\" discussions were more often than not a cover-up because the leaders thought the class hadn't throughly read the readings enough to participate. The \"creative\" discussions, therefore, keep the discussion\/games in the abstract and vague level, where even those who did not do the reading could fully voice their general opinions. Rather, I'd have liked to have had an in-depth discussion about the specifics of the readings.",

    "This course covered a lot of ground, and the final assignment was an opportunity to explore a topic of interest in greater depth. Unfortunately, there was not much in-class support for developing our paper topics. I think that mandatory 1 or 2 assignment(s) to prepare for the paper, in addition to or in lieu of the weekly readings, would have been very helpful. I think that a bibliography assignment and\/or an introduction to Yale's resources and tools for research would have given me a better start on conducting research for the final paper. Also, it would have been helpful to have a mandatory 1-2 page write-up to outline my ideas for a paper topic, after I had started the research (and to catalyze that process). That scoping paper could then be used to facilitate an in-class peer-review or review by the instructor and TA. The optional 1-2 paragraph write-up was useful, but could have been improved with any of these suggestions, or an in-class component.Another area for improvement is the length and density of the weekly readings. It often took me over 7 hours to complete the readings, and I often had to skim some of the readings in the interest of time. Therefore, I did not get as much out of the readings as I would have from thoroughly reading fewer readings each week.",

    "interested in climate change.",
    "Answer under Question 20",
    "My research involves REDD+ so a step back and understanding the broad context of climate change is relevant in being able to write about my chosen research topic.",
    "See above.",
    "Climate change is touted as the biggest challenge facing the environmental field. I wanted to make sure that I had a solid base of knowledge regarding climate change as climate change may influence any and all of the topics I ultimately study.",
    "to broaden my understanding of the climate change debate",
    "Because I'm specializing in climate change.",
    "The course syllabus was very interesting to me, and I wanted to take a class with this professor.",
    "Personal and profession interest. See above.",
    "I wanted to equip myself with technical and policy instruments for a comprehensive understanding of the needs of people and the environment to abate the effects of climate change.",

    "My research is focused on climate change, and I heard that the Professor was good.",
    "I am researching climate change and heard the professor was good.",
    "I'm interested in a career in climate change adaptation and consulting. I sought to deepen my knowledge in climate change adaptation and learn about concepts and practices in climate change mitigation.",

    "Yes.",
    "Yes, I feel much more conversant in climate change topics and the issues of translating science to policy.",
    "no",
    "They did. I found all the classes and discussion sessions interesting and informative",
    "Yes, the course sufficiently addressed my expectations.",
    "Not really. As mentioned above, I felt we grazed the surface of the adaptation and mitigation issues so that I did not come away with as much new knowledge as I would have liked.",
    "This class is primarily a knowledge based class, and yes, the class met my expectations.",
    "yes",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, absolutely!",
    "Yes. More class time could be dedicated to debating climate science--a practice that may prove useful for environmentalists.",
    "Pretty much but I will need a specific adaptation and mitigation class.",
    "yes, although learning was too much time consuming. but i think the subject itself is vast and requires a lot of time.",
    "Above and beyond.",
    "Above and beyond.",
    "Yes. However, I wish I had devoted more time to the final assignment and completed research on a topic that was more relevant to my career interests.Further exploration of careers in climate change policy would have been useful. More guest speakers could help to lend different perspectives and experience to the class.",
    "Yes."

    "Too many views within a short time",
    "The topic was something the members of group sufficiently had knowledge of, given their different backgrounds that had to do with the topic. Thus it wasn't an alien concept although not everyone in class was acquainted with it.Given the brief preparation, I believe an opportunity to be more creative will have been helpful if there was more time or had the group prepared earlier than a week before the discussion.",
    "The advantages of group work in this class were bringing people together with different backgrounds and expertise. This made a for a productive class discussion.",
    "it was great...i worked with two students to organize a discussion for the class.. again, it was useful to see how many varied perspectives there are on a topic.",
    "I enjoyed having a small workgroup for the conversation facilitation.",
    "learned knowledge from one another but people who can speak a lot seem to dominate the group and push the points.",
    "Working in a group to plan and facilitate discussion was a great experience. The main advantages were the creativity that everyone brought to planning the facilitation as well as the problem-solving capacity of the group.The main disadvantage was that there were so many great ideas offered, but we had to pick one and execute it in a limited amount of time.",
    "I thought that the small group discussions were the most helpful part, and where most of the learning took place."

    "Do the readings in depth and ask critical questions during lecture.",
    "Take a class with Bailis for sure...think about yourself as a student and whether 3 hour lectures work for your learning style.",
    "It is a sometimes challenging course with a bulk of reading, but if you have an interest in climate change I think you will find it to be rewarding.",
    "meet with rob and alark to receive feedback on your performance. otherwise you won't receive it.",
    "Anyone should take this course. Climate change is real and happening. Learning about is, i believe, is the first important step towards addressing the issue",
    "Be prepared for a general discussion of topics that comprise climate change and not an in-depth discussion of a single topic. Be also prepared for a big class.",
    "This is a relatively low-workload coarse, with short weekly reading responses, one short mid-term paper, and a longer end of term paper. The papers are a great opportunity to explore areas of climate change that might contribute to a broader research project that you're working on.",
    "Good overall refresher on climate change issues, and a good course to interact with other students.",
    "If climate change is your focus, this is likely a useful review course, and the readings and assignments are useful. The same goes for if you have no exposure to climate change. If however you have decent understanding of climate change and it is not your area of focus, I would think twice about taking this course.",
    "take your time digesting the readings, you will gain more from the lectures",
    "Take it!",
    "Shop the course and see if it appeals to you. Consider the size of the class, the classroom, and time slot in your decision.",
    "Please do take the class!",
    "i would advice them to take the course because this course teaches all about climate change.",
    "Read the readings.",
    "Read all the readings.",
    "Start the final paper early, and take advantage of the instructor's and TA's office hours and\/or email responsiveness. The more you put into the research paper, the more you will get out of it."
