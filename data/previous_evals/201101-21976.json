    "CHNS 132 and 142 are designed to be taken together.",
    "Chinese 142 feels like a lot of work because you have daily quizzes so you're constantly studying for the class, but I think once you got past the learning curve of Chinese 132, this semester was easier. The workload is fine for 1.5 credits. The vocabulary you learn is very formal, and so sometimes I felt like what I was learning would not be useful in a conversation with someone in China. At times, I found the course content burdensome at times because I don't plan on using Chinese in the future-- I'm only taking it for the distributional requirement. But you never know, it might come in handy unexpectedly one day, and I feel like I have a much better grasp of the language now compared to a year ago before I took 132 and 142. The professor, Xu laoshi, is very dedicated, and the class is small (we had 12 or so students), so you get to know everyone really well and we're very close because we eat lunch together everyday after class. It's a greatatmosphere.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. I am going into business in China and Taiwan, and before this course I had difficult recognizing and writing characters. I have learned an incredible amount this year, and it has stuck, most importantly. I know this because I was just recently in Taiwan, and I could recognize about 75% of the words on the street--a minor miracle. It's very intense workload, but it's totally worth it.",
    "I would say the class is challenging but worthwhile in the long-run. I would recommend this class to any heritage student interested in taking their Chinese skills to the next level.",
    "This class definitely made my freshman year. You might think it sucks to have class every day, and sometimes it does, but Xu Laoshi doesn't actually care if you skip occasionally. My section became really close - we had lunch every day after class and would go out to eat or see shows on weekends or just hang out. they are some of my best friends from this year, and are probably my only \"group\" of friends. I have made lots of individual friends this year, but it's nice to have a group of people where you can all hang out together.In terms of the actual course - I am not actually a heritage speaker, so this class was probably not the exact right fit for me, but it was a wonderful challenge. It is only as much work as you want\/need it to be, but I had to study a LOT to make it work. There was not a big focus on oral skills, since almost everyone speaks Chinese at home, so my speaking has definitely suffered. But I have learned tons of vocabulary and grammar, and really subtle usage points that I never would have learned in a regular class. It was also a really valuable experience culturally. I learned a lot about Chinese and Chinese-American culture. I love this class and am really sad it's over - min yi shi wei tian!",
    "Xu lao shi is amazing! Take this class; the workload is worth it!",
    "This is the best class I've taken at Yale so far, and it really inspired me to work towards becoming fluent in Chinese. If you take this course with Xu Laoshi, you will work hard, but it will be well worth it. I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "Continuation of Chinese 132 for heritage speakers. Much more formal grammer\/phrases learned, as opposed to 132. The class is geared toward formal writing, about subjects like culture, revolution, and war.",
    "Not a difficult class, but I learned so much and my Chinese ability definitely improved significantly. Xu Lao Shi is an amazing teacher and while she demands a lot from you, she's an extremely understanding and fun person to have as your Chinese teacher. She should make a great impression on you very quickly: I brought some prefrosh to the class during Bulldog Days and they loved her after just one class!",
    "I would definitely recommend Chinese L4 Heritage to a heritage student who is interested in building up their Chinese skills, and maybe fulfilling their language requirement at the same time. Though it is by no means a walk in the park, and requires thorough work, it resulted in a drastic improvement in my chinese."
