    "Learned a lot about the quantitative aspects of certain hedge fund strategies.",
    "I learned a great deal about the hedge fund universe as well as and finance more generally. Great class!",
    "how to apply concepts to real world learning, some technicalities\/financial jargon that will be very useful at one's work",
    "Great classic, laid back professor, would recommend",
    "I have a good overview of the hedge fund industry, learnt about forwards, bonds, options etc and also specific trading strategies.",
    "Exposure to various hedge fund strategies & phenomena, back-of-the-envelope implementations, some options\/fixed income theory, background & history, and excellent speakers from the industry.",
    "Lots of insight into the hedge fund industry--different arbitrage strategies, some calculations (options, stock valuations, etc), cool stories and current news. I definitely learned more useful and interesting content in this course than in any other Econ course I've taken at Yale.",
    "Hedge fund industry overview Short sell mechanism Bond Arbitrage strategies Etc.",
    "Key fundamental concepts e.g. risk, liquidity in finance and capital markets"

   "comments": [
    "A greater focus on the qualitative description of hedge fund strategies.",
    "strengths: very relevant, very useful, highly informative weaknesses: abit too comprehensive, too broad a focus",
    "Not as structured as it could have been but that was refreshing senior spring",
    "Professor pascutti is simply amazing.",
    "Prof Pascutti made the class very engaging, and he is really good at explaining the ideas. But sometimes the class feels a little disorganized",
    "This was an incredible economics senior seminar. Prof. Pascutti communicated a lot of material without cutting corners on substance, and curated a selection of cool academic papers to supplement lecture topics. The class is structured around hedge fund characteristics, strategies, and phenomena, but incorporated some options\/fixed income theory that would be useful to anyone interested in economics or finance. Prof. Pascutti also brought in exceptional speakers (mostly past colleagues from Citadel), who elaborated on current class topics and offered motivating & exciting real-world examples. I liked the dispersed grading scheme (among quizzes, a final paper, a final exam, homework, and a presentation) -- it facilitated learning, and encouraged everyone to stay on top of the material. I would have enjoyed a more mathematical exploration of some of the literature (or arbitrage strategies), but overall thought the level of quantitative skill required was appropriate.",
    "It's a mostly qualitative course. The most interesting parts are Michael's anecdotes, current news, and guest speakers if they are fun.. The problem sets are worded kind of weirdly. You learn the material through lots of different ways (essay, problem sets, presentations, lectures, real life application)."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Any student even mildly interested in finance should take this course.",
    "yes- if you are prepared to put in the work for it",
    "Economics of hedge funds is a really great course in which you can learn about different kinds of hedge fund investments and some of the benefits and costs of hedge funds. It is a must take for anyone interested in working for a fund and\/or going into finance after graduation. The math is not difficult, though familiarity with basic finance concepts makes the course much easier.",
    "Yes, great primer on hedge funds",
    "Hands down best undergrad finance course at yale.",
    "This class is for anyone that wants to do finance and\/or wants to learn more about the hedge fund industry. You get a good overview of the hedge fund business, go through some pretty fun case studies, learn about some basic trading strategies and have some interesting guest speakers.",
    "I would highly recommend ECON 444 to another student, economics or otherwise. This seminar provides exposure to basic financial concepts (like options & bond pricing) that are relevant and useful for anyone, while tracking the evolution of hedge funds' role in modern finance -- a prominent contemporary subject that is not explored carefully (or without bias) in the media. Also, Prof. Pascutti is awesome. He is a highly effective teacher -- I was never bored during any of our 2-hour seminars -- and has some great stories from his time in the industry to go along with the course material. He's also willing to meet with students outside of class (despite driving up from Westchester each week) and brought in a few of his former colleagues as guests.",
    "Yes! Take it if you have at least some financial background but don't want to crunch a billion numbers all day long. This is not a super quantitative course but extremely well-rounded and interesting. Definitely my favorite Econ course at Yale.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes definitely!"
