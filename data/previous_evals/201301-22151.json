    "Yes.",
    "Super hard course. WE ALL SHAKE IN FEAR WHEN WE ENTER AND LEAVE THE EXAM ROOM. Not kidding.Expect to spend minimum 8-10 hours on each weekly psets and to google and look up the game theory notes of other universities who use less crazy Greek notation.But if you survive the course and get an A, then my friend, you can call yourself a boss.Professor Horner is an excellent professor, by the way, he just moves very fast through proofs and problems so it's hard to take notes in class at all. Just focus on listening as best as you can.",
    "This course is very rigorous, but completely manageable. Professor Horner is a great professor and fun\/kind as well, and the material is quite interesting. Problem sets can be a lot of difficult math, but grading is understanding of this and collaboration is encouraged. The exams are straightforward and less difficult than the homework.",
    "Great class if you are serious about game theory and economics, and have a strong math background. A lot of the people in the class will be try-hards; also, they are pretty strict on deadlines for assignments. Otherwise, nice class.",
    "This is a class for those who would like to have a rigorous introduction to the study of game theory, with quite a bit of math. After this class, you will know what all these game theory jargons mean, which is very handy for other branches as well!",
    "Absolutely take this course if you like math. It's undeniably challenging but so rewarding. Professor Horner is an amazing instructor who is always approachable and explains everything clearly (and is incredibly patient, willing keep explaining things to you until you get it). The material is really interesting and I always left the class feeling like I had learned something cool (it can be abstract, though, but that's what I loved about it).",
    "Interesting, difficult.",
    "If you really want a challenge and are really interested in game theory, this is a good class.",
    "I would recommend ECON 351 only if you are willing to put in the time to learn the material. This is a very demanding class, but can be quite rewarding once you finally understand the material. Again, this course is the foundation for micro-theory, decision theory,...etc, and is quite valuable if you can survive it."
