    "Foreign Languages and Maths at Yale are horribly flawed. So many people bomb the placement tests so they can boost their GPA freshman year at the expense of those whom the class is actually a challenge for. In my class, two girls coasted through this course, one guy had an appropriate challenge, and this other girl and I were mired in the B- range. Choose your language classes with utmost care.",
    "I'd definitely recommend the course. In my opinion the most important thing is to actually put in the time to do all the homework exercises. Your homework isn't monitored so it's really up to you to make your life easier by doing all the assigned work. Do that, and you'll be fine.",
    "This was my first French course at Yale, so I can't compare it to L2 classes, but it was definitely manageable and I think my French improved over the course of the semester. Mme. Koundi is great.",
    "If you take FREN130, definitely try to take it with Mme. Koundi! She is an excellent teacher, and your french skills will greatly improve. The class mainly consists of reading novels from a range of difficulties and watching Truffaut films. This is done while concurrently reviewing different grammatical concepts.",
    "I felt like I learned a lot about French, not only grammar but I enjoyed the movies we watched too."
