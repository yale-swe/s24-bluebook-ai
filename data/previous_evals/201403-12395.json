    "I would only recommend this class to a student with significant philosophy background, since the texts were pretty tough. For philosophy majors, though, it's a great class.",
    "Not for the faint of heart. The class didn't have an extraordinary amount of work, but the readings were just so dense, I often felt like I didn't know what was going on. If you want to take this class (and you should, the topics are very interesting), expect to have to devote a lot of time to the readings in order to be able to parse them. The seminar itself is very helpful in understanding the papers too, Greco is good about going through the important bits in detail. Discussion is usually dominated by graduate students, but I felt like I got a good word in here or there. Greco is a really great teacher and effective discussion leader. Very easy to reach and willing to help with papers. Also, ask him about his jiu jitsu.",
    "If you can tolerate the sock-drawer quality of a \"Topics in X\" course, it's an interesting way to get the lay of the epistemological land. But, more than to the average course, come with your own questions and priorities, too; the readings will presuppose rather than provoke them."
