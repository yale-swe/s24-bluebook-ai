The course connected what we learned in class to current issues such as the ongoing trade war and Brexit.",
    "I think I gained a pretty solid grasp of macroeconomics (measures of GDP, unemployment, central bank and interest policies, etc.) and its application to the real world and today's issues. I enjoyed how we both learned about theoretical macroeconomics, but also discussed relevant current events such as Trump's corporate tax cut, the wealth tax, and the social cost of carbon. We also had guest lecturers (an editor of The Economist, etc.) that also added to this class.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The professor is the weakest part of this course. I don't know how to evaluate the actual course layout because the professor was such a hinderance to my learning. He would frequently make mistakes in lecture and ramble.",
    "Strengths - good material, tied to current events Weaknesses - content organized poorly",
    "Strengths: the psets are all graded on completion so you really can't get anything but full credit here. The online quizzes can also be taken multiple times until the answers are all correct (they can be hard though). Weaknesses: the class was very boring at times, the majority of the class left the room confused after each lecture- the material was just not taught very well.",
    "There are absolutely no strengths to this course. It was poorly taught and poorly managed. The professor was constantly unnecessarily deriving equations (and putting students to sleep while doing so), p-set answers were released with incorrect information, and students were seldom given resources to advance their learning in class. It is apparent that Marnix (course director) doesn't care about the student learning, since he never released practice exams until the last minute, days after being prompted to by students. At the time of writing this (a few days before our final exam), we still have not received a practice exam, and have no resources with which to study aside from the semi-useful textbook and old pset responses, many of which have either wrong answers or different questions from those we answered on the psets. DO NOT TAKE THIS! While this is a required course, please do yourself a favor and take the seminar! There are so many better professors in the Econ department that can and should be teaching this course.",
    "The professor is a huge weakness. Terrible at teaching and organizing the class. The course director literally does not care about this class either: take it at your own risk.",
    "Lectures moved very fast and could get very confusing. A deeper focus on the mathematics and more comprehensive slides would be nice.",
    "This is a very standard intro econ class.",
    "Strengths: none weakness: Awful professor whos lectures and psets did not line up with the exam information They do not give feedback on tests or psets so you have no idea what the answers are\/reasoning behind them",
    "Strengths: -It's on a curve -Exams were fair Weaknesses: -P-sets had little to no correlation to what was on the exams which made it difficult to study - Professor: Kortum is literally one of the nicest and most genuine professors I've had, but his teaching style was not the best for me. He spent a lot of time deriving equations on the blackboard when that really didn't add hardly anything to my learning. It's a lot of self-teaching, I felt like the TA's overall weren't super helpful and getting any sort of clarification from the Course Director was a pain, as he hardly ever responded to emails. However, the review sessions with the course director were the most I learned during the class.",
    "While the course material was not extremely difficult, I found the way in which it was presented to be both confusing and ineffective. I found it much easier to learn from using the slides, textbook, and watch online videos than attending a lecture that often left me frustrated and not understanding the material.",
    "strengths: psets were grade pass\/fail. weekly quizzes with unlimited trials helped practice material weaknesses: confusing lectures, poor organization, everything else",
    "The course did a good job of connecting the material that we were learning in class to current events, and I think it would be beneficial to emphasize these real-world connections going forward. I think the course could be improved by increased explanation when Professor Kortum did math on the board. I thought that the work on the board was informative, as it showed the relationship between different economic functions, but it was sometimes hard to keep up, particularly since I couldn't go back and review the derivations as they were done on the board.",
    "Strengths: The course covers some interesting material that could be very engaging. Weaknesses: Though Prof. Kortum is an outstanding economist and it is awesome to be able to learn from him and hear about the things he works on, he may not be the best person to teach an intro-level course. The first 1\/3 of the course was very hard to get through because the lectures were all over the place and not many of us seemed to know what was going on. Prof. Kortum seemed to sense this and eventually stopped doing long, hard to follow, derivations on the board. The class became a bit easier to follow after that, but it still felt like it may have been easier to learn from someone who could relate to the knowledge-level of those in the class a bit better.",
    "This course was taught so poorly. The professor was unfamiliar with many of the concepts. Lectures were a drag and slides were incoherent. The psets were poorly written and section was a waste of time.",
    "Professor Kortum could be more organized with his slide deck, but I think he improved a lot towards the end of the semester.",
    "One strength of this course was that section was helpful in explaining concepts from class, and Marnix's review sessions were incredibly helpful -- they saved me time and time again before exams. The peer tutors were also very helpful. The main weakness of this class was the lecture itself -- more often than not, I felt like I wasn't learning anything by being there, as many times the bulk of the lecture would be the professor writing a lot of abstract equations on the board without explaining what they were, and it felt like what we were doing in class had little relevance to the slides (which were much more helpful) or the material on our exams. There was also not a lot of practice material before exams, and the solutions to practice midterms or the practice final were only posted a day or two before the actual exam, which was incredibly unhelpful since I wouldn't know what I was doing wrong until immediately before the exam. The material itself wasn't super difficult and can definitely be self-taught, which is what many of us in the class had to end up doing due to the disjointed lectures.",
    "Strengths: None Weaknesses: This class was run as well as Zimbabwe's economy. Although he is obviously very knowledgeable about economics, our professor was absolutely incapable of making relatively simple concepts comprehensible. He frequently made mistakes on the board when explaining equations that had to be corrected by students, and neglected to answer questions. The solution sets to the former practice exams were released at midnight the day before the second midterm. The practice final exam was released after reading period had ended. The earliest that the class assistant ever arrived to a review session was nine minutes late, and he always ended the sessions at the scheduled time.",
    "Kortum can be a very confusing teacher",
    "The primary weakness of the course was the lectures themselves. At many points, the class was extremely boring and we were presented more content than was actually necessary for learning the specific content at hand. We were given extremely long and intimidating math equations which were not even needed for the lesson and the lectures were very uninspiring. Ironically, the best lecture we received during the course was when the professor was absent and a guest lecturer had to present the lesson.",
    "Strengths include organized lectures, great practice problems on the psets and quizzes, a great overall flow of the class. No weaknesses.",
    "This course has a good (and free!) textbook as well as helpful sections, but the lectures were hit and missin that 80% missed.",
    "Macroeconomics is utter bullshit, but the lectures were even worse.",
    "The strengths this course has are the amount of people who want to take this class, the guest speakers, and the knowledge the lector has about this field. There are a lot of weakness such as it being very disorganized, the lector felt insecure, and Marnix was just rude to students. Besides that, the Psets were not useful.",
    "Weakness was the teaching and organization of the class.",
    "Weakness is that the slides did not match the lecture so it was sometimes difficult to reconcile differences in material when looking over notes.",
    "The professor did not have the necessary vocabulary to teach the course.",
    "Weakness: Disorganized, psets seemed useless",
    "Strengths: section was well-designed and I found the TAs to be really helpful. Weaknesses: Professor Kortum's lectures were often rambling and difficult to follow. He's obviously a BRILLIANT guy, but he has a \"mad scientist\" demeanor in lecture that makes him difficult to follow.",
    "Strength: Eh Weaknesses: Although it is an essential course in economics, the topics can get dry and boring.",
    "The course was not run well at all. Between the TAs, professor, and course director, there did not seem to be much communication. We learned different things in the non-mandatory section from what was taught in lecture, which meant that lecture was not thorough enough. We were expected to know more material than we were taught for the exams, and were given both inadequate materials and time to prepare for the exam. The lecture was not engaging and confusing, as the professor often seemed lost in his lecture slides and poorly explained the concepts. The problem sets were not graded for accuracy, so it was very difficult to assess my understanding of the material each week.",
    "I would love to have videos of the lectures.",
    "This class wasn't especially interesting, nor was it especially bad. It was, in all senses, spectacularly average. The one exception to that was the last lecture, which was about the economics of climate change; I really enjoyed that. I also really enjoyed the one guest lecture we had, which doesn't say anything good about Professor Kortum.",
    "I enjoyed this course, especially after more of the power-points were incorporated into the lectures as that made it easier to follow along.",
    "The course was structured well, but the teaching was often confusing.",
    "Strengths: TAs were great Weaknesses: Class was poorly organized. Our final exam only had one session of office hours, which were the day of the exam... not very helpful.",
    "very unorganized, didnt remind me of a typical, good macroeconomics course, very equation memorization and deriving equations from other equations heavy, intro macro should be more focused on understanding the underlying concepts",
    "Samuel Kortum, I'm sorry, but he's a terrible intro to macro professor. Every lecture was hard to follow, he would zip around the room from chalkboard to chalkboard with a bunch of equations that were not very well explained, and even when he DID start using slides, the slides were terrible and he often zipped through them, anyway. I learned most of macro outside of lectures.",
    "At times, the course felt disorganized - it was often unclear when psets\/answer keys\/practice exams would be posted or sometimes the pset answers would be wrong or just very unclear or unhelpful. However, I did appreciate the way that the professor posted slides promptly and the supplementary readings and textbook were helpful and interesting. The review sessions and office hours were also very helpful, but it would be better if they were more spread out and frequent instead of just having it once a week.",
    "The strength of the course is that the material is quite interesting. The main weakness is that the lectures can be unorganized at times.",
    "Weaknesses - textbook, section, lecture slides, and actual lectures all provided different information. It was difficult to study and aggregate all the information. Psets, quizzes, and exams often all tested different material, and sometimes psets tested us on material we didn't even learn in class.",
    "The lecture was boring and confusing.",
    "Strength: -textbook -office hours with TAs Weakness: -lectures can be very confusing -a lot of math on the board that isn't explained very well -no clear information regarding the curve for each midterm",
    "Course itself was not terrible, but the significant disconnect between the section material and lecture material made for a difficult experience.",
    "Strengths: Great TAs Weaknesses: Marnix! And Kortum. Marnix was the worst course director Ive ever had. He was very condescending to students, very disorganized, and just didnt care about his students. Kortum cared more but wasnt the greatest lecturer. Used too many equations instead of sticking to overarching concepts on the slides. Sometimes hard to follow lectures"

   "comments": [
    "No, I absolutely would not. I used to love economics but as direct and proximate result of this class I am changing my major.",
    "Take it in the spring if you need to take it. The curve off cycle is atrocious. Only 10 A's for the entire lecture. The course covers good material to know.",
    "Only if you have to take it for the major. If you're looking for a QR credit, take an easy math or Micro instead.",
    "Never take this course if it is being taught by Samuel Kortum, or if Marnix is the course director (Marnix seems to be a very good professor based on his review sessions, but a very bad course director). While the seminar does have a tougher curve, taking it would be much more worthwhile for any student, given that they care even a little about knowledge acquired. I feel as if I would have been much better off taking a basic community college on Macroeconomics, and I mean this with the upmost sincerity. Dating back to kindergarten (seriously), this is the poorest taught course I've ever taken.",
    "NO. This professor will literally make you hate economics. RUN.",
    "If you are interested in economics or an econ major then yes.",
    "If you are interested in global economics but don't want to commit to a hard econ class, this is perfect.",
    "I took this because I wanted to understand macroeconomics, and this just taught me random equations and a few ideas about the economy. Take it, but not with professor Kortum.",
    "macroeconomics the subject is really interesting but it really depends on the professor you take it with. with all due respect, i'm sure prof kortum is a very intelligent man but the lectures were incredibly confusing and hard to follow. i had ignored the reviews saying not to take this course with him, and i learned from my mistake.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to better understand economic policy and the relationships between various economic concepts which are relevant to current events, but are rarely explained in news articles or other similar sources of information.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is an excellent start for macroeconomics and I think it is fairly challenging without being too hard. Also, I would definitely say that section and office hours helps -- if you don't put in the effort it will be a more challenging class, but also the concepts can be learned from the book without too much difficulty.",
    "I don't think I would recommend it to just anyone. I don't think this class would be a good choice for anyone who is not taking it for their major. One would have to be very interested in economics to just take this course for fun.",
    "I would only recommend this course to people that absolutely have to take it. Its a shame because I think that macroeconomics is interesting but this class was probably the worst one I have taken at Yale so far. I only took it for major requirements.",
    "For you econ majors out there for sure!",
    "Unless you're taking it because you have to for your major, no",
    "Absolutely not. Comprehending concepts is extremely challenging, practice final exams are posted incredibly late, and the class assistant has the audacity to always arrive late to review sessions and leave on time.",
    "Yes, the material that is covered is very important to understanding the function of the government and economy.",
    "If you must take this class to fulfill the major requirement, then try looking at Econ 111 instead. The curve is harder in that course, but it is much better taught. If you want a solid understanding of macroeconomics, you're better off going on Khan Academy or something.",
    "Not if Kortum is lecturing",
    "No, poorly taught. He would use the whiteboard all the time and do all this crazy math that we would never see again. We were always confused as a class and it was never clear what we actually needed to know.",
    "Yes, but only if they are an engaged student during lecture.",
    "Recommend it only as a necessity.",
    "Only if you need it for the major; could be more interesting if more organized",
    "If you have to take it for a major, it's not too bad. If you're not taking it for a major, I would look elsewhere.",
    "No. The professor was not good and it was very unorganized. They did not seem to want to help students learn.",
    "I think one should take the course if it aligns with ones academic aims",
    "Prof. Kortum can go off-topic at times but he truly does care about his students and I would recommend this lecture. Sometimes he discusses recent events or talks about economic policy which is outside the scope of the course, but most of it isn't examinable. The psets are not too difficult, but they don't really help to prepare you for the exams. I would recommend going over old exams to understand what the format is like and to test yourself on the core concepts in the course.",
    "Many students have to take this course, but I might recommend that they take it with another professor. I think that a basic economic background could be beneficial for everyone, but I'm not sure if it would be worth taking this class. I might recommend that someone take it credit\/d\/fail.",
    "No, but unless there is a serious overhaul to the structure of the course. Too many review sessions and office hours felt last minute.",
    "yes, but maybe with a different professor and a more structured and organized curriculum that is more in line with what an intro macro curriculum should be.",
    "I mean, if you're an econ major, obviously take it. Just don't take it with Professor Kortum.",
    "Overall, I would say that I learned a lot in this class so as long as you can be patient with the disorganized style, I think it is worthwhile, even if you are not an econ major.",
    "- Again, a very VERY broad overview of macroeconomic principles and can get a bit dry at timestake if you are looking for a general understanding of how the economy and its key players work",
    "If you plan on majoring in economics, you have to take this course and it's really not too bad.",
    "I think everyone should take Intro Macro because you learn some important concepts and get a good overview of how the economy works. That being said, Professor Kortum was not a very good teacher, which made the course boring and frustrating. Also, I'd like the Econ department to reflect on how they teach economics to impressionable Yale studentsfor example, we should have robust discussions about the evidence for and against minimum wage increases instead of just drawing a graph, saying this looks bad, and throwing our hands in the air.",
    "Only if its being taught by someone other than Samuel Kortum. The course is interesting by itself, but Kortums instruction is hilariously poor.",
    "Not with Marnix and Kortum, unless you are pressed for time in the major. I also wished I took the seminar instead of the lecture as I wouldve gotten more out of it."
