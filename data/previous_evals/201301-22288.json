    "you have to take it anyway.",
    "This class is difficult but rewarding. Take it as a prereq.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "Absolute misery. Material is gone through far too quickly, and new material is introduced every day, including the very last day of class, that you are responsible for. 13 psets, with the last one due during reading period just 4 days since the 12th pset.Material covered is lecture is too quick to be learned there, but the textbook is terrible, and learning through it may not be possible. It just assumes you are a math major and only need hints about how to solve new types of problems (so many types of problems have no examples).I found learning in this class to be ridiculously difficult.Of course, you likely don't have any choice about taking this class. Good luck.",
    "I did not like this class. The homework assignments differed too greatly from the lectures. The assignments where edited too frequently. There seemed to be a communication gap between the TA and the Professor.",
    "Take it if you have to, it scratches the surface of a bunch of different topics. In that sense it was both overwhelming and underwhelming.",
    "It's the hardest class I've taken at Yale yet. The workload is insane and the tests are not easy, but if you have to take it, suffer through it and you will be glad you did. You learn a lot and you work together with friends to teach eachother through it.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this course with Charles Ahn. He's incredibly clear, concise and gives you all the information you need to know. Be warned, though: It's very very difficult. Psets take a very long time and the math is pretty tricky. I would recommend taking this course for anyone as long as they know that they're taking a difficult class. In summary: difficult class, great professor, interesting materials.",
    "It's a difficult class with problem sets that easily take 10+ hours a week, so be sure you know what you're getting yourself into. All of the applications in the class relate to differential equations found in physics, so if you're not an engineering major, be prepared to familiarize yourself with some physics topics. Linear algebra is not a required pre-req, but it definitely helps with some of the conceptual material, especially towards the end of the semester.",
    "You probably have to take it, but embrace it. Do all of the problem sets, it helps. Also, the series part can be tough if you skipped 115.",
    "If you have to take it, I've heard spring is better than fall. Get a study group and work through it. Don't take it for fun, and don't waste a Yale credit on it unless you have to. When you're up until four a.m. Thursday morning scrambling to finish yet another problem set you don't fully understand, you'll regret taking it as an interesting, unneeded class.",
    "It's a difficult class and will probably only be enjoyable to those who have it in their requirements or like math.",
    "The class is hard, but organized and well taught. There is one problem set a week which does take quite a bit of time to complete. The midterms were not that hard but the final was, so be prepared. Professor Ahn is a great teacher who I would highly recommend. Most likely you are taking this class because you have to, so you might as well try and get the best teacher and from what I have heard Professor Ahn is the best.",
    "If you're reading this, then you probably have to take the course anyways. Its not fun, but its something you have to get out of the way.",
    "Take it if you need or consider Credit\/D\/ Fail. Unless you want to spend at least five (probably more like ten) hours every week and never slacking off. After you skip some problem sets, it's really hard to catch up and the last part of the course is quite challenging.",
    "Take it if you have. Don't if you don't. The midterms are fine - the final (40%) is impossible.",
    "Most people taking Diff EQ have to for their major, so of course I recommend it to anyone looking at taking it. The problem sets are ridiculously hard and this is definitely the hardest course I have taken at Yale. That being said, it's extremely satisfying to have it done and you learn quite a bit.",
    "So much work. Don't take it alongside other time-intensive courses. Put in the effort each week to really learn the material and be able to solve the problems on the problem sets without having to consult the book and you should do fine.",
    "If you are an engineer, you have to take ENAS 194. My advice is take it with Ahn. He is an excellent teacher who knows his stuff and goes at a perfect pace. He is also a professor who makes tests specifically designed to generate a perfect bell-curve centered around 50-60%. Good thing the class is curved.",
    "Yes if you need to. I thought it was well taught but it is def a hard class.",
    "It feels good to know that I learned some new skills from this class, but I still would not recommend it if it isn't required for your major. Charles is great at explaining the material, but he's to fast in his lectures, so instead of learning you'll actually find yourself just trying to finish copying down the notes. The problem sets are also insanely long. Literally like 8-10 hours for an average one. This class actually made me think Multivariable Calculus was a great class just because it seemed more intuitive. For the most part, I would always feel like I was just applying certain methods to problems without actually understanding what was going on. So all in all, do not recommend this class unless you really want to or have to take it.",
    "Only take it if you need to",
    "If you need to take a diffeq class, this is the one to take. Professor Ahn is awesome-he's a good lecturer and very open to questions. The problem sets and exams are reasonable, but do take some time.",
    "Before you enroll just make sure you know that the amount of work for this class can be staggering at times and the most difficult part of the course is towards the end. Otherwise it is a class that is taught well and if you are considering you already know the risks.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is very serious about wanting to learn A LOT of math, but it's not for the faint of heart. Charles Ahn is very clear and easily to follow, and does a great job walking through applications of the math.I learned more math in this class than from any math course I have taken before - but it was also one of the toughest classes I have taken at Yale. The (full length) problem sets took me upwards of 5 hours a week, but luckily they were graded pretty easily and you can drop your 3 lowest scores. The course is deceptive however, because it gets increasingly more difficult and moves faster and faster as the semester progresses. In studying for the final it felt that we had covered more new material after the second midterm than we had up until that exam.If you do take this class I recommend that you fight the desire to use your 3 dropped homeworks to actually skip assignments. The assignments generally were really good preparation for the exam, and I felt much more lost trying to study concepts I hadn't done homework problems on.",
    "Yes take it if you want to learn anything about diff eq. Every engineer and science major should at least credit\/d this course. It's impossible to come out without becoming great at solving diff eq.",
    "Take it!",
    "Obviously take it if required for your major. Be prepared for manageable material but a lot of work on psets.",
    "Take it. You have to",
    "ENAS194 is a comprehensive introduction to differential equations, a fundamental tool for science. I would recommend it, as it is both well taught and very applicable to other science courses.",
    "THis was hard but I feel i learned a lot i really liked this class even though I don't think I did veyr well gradewise",
    "This is an extremely difficult course. Even if you spend over 12 hours on the psets every week, you need to study and do a ridiculous amount of problems to get even a decent grade.",
    "They teach the course backwards, and ignore all the technology which scientists and engineers use in the day to day.",
    "You should take it if it's a requirement, which it usually is.",
    "ENAS 194 goes through solving most types of ordinary differential equations and approaches separable partial differential equations at the end. If you like calculus, you will almost certainly find this course to be very interesting. You will come to be proficient with some of the toughest parts from calc (eg, power series as series solutions to diff eqs).",
    "I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't need it for their major or who doesn't feel comfortable with their math ability. It's not a bad class, just really time consuming and difficult at times. For everyone that does have to take it, just bunker down and put the time in if you want a good grade.",
    "The class is well taught and interesting but the problem sets are long and tedious after the first few weeks. The class starts very slow and then picks up a lot and is not very consistent in terms if work load. There are also almost no proofs involved.",
    "good! much better than dobbins",
    "This class is absolutely amazing. You feel so empowered after completing this class. You have all these high level math tools at your arsenal, and it feels great. The class is extremely hard. The material itself is pretty hard, but be warned Ahn's tests are extremely hard. You will not get one straightforward problem. Every question has some spin, some trick, something different. But its fine, theres a curve. Also, the P sets do take about 8 hours a week, and we had 13. BUt overall I loved loved loved this class. ANd Ahn is great, amazing actually. Goes very fast, but don't be intimidated to stop him. He likes making sure his students really understand everything.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in math or engineering. It is worth it. I have learned so much math this semester. Although the psets are grueling and you get to drop 3, don't skip any. The process of doing all the psets, no matter how difficult, helps immensely with the exams.",
    "Yes -- but get ready for a lot of work and dedicated time, if you haven't studied differential equations before.",
    "This class is applied differential equations, meaning we addressed linear ordinary differential equations, equations with power series solutions w\/ and w\/o singular points, Laplace transforms, Fourier series, some partial differential equations (heat equation, wave equation, other separable equations), and sturm-liouville theory. This class is by no means rigorously explores this topics but does so in depth enough to really understand solving most applied problems involving differential equations.",
    "It is a class that is required for most engineers. If you do not want to learn theoretical math, then this class is good to take.",
    "This class is extremely difficultand challenging but incredibly rewarding. I did more work for this class than any other class I've ever taken but looking back I cannot believe how much we learned. If you are willing to put in the time and work, I would very much recommend this class. You will learn so much. Take it with Charles Ahn if possible.",
    "Yes, please take this class with Ahn! He is good, the TAs are good, and the curve is lenient.",
    "Not a class to take for fun but is a requirement for a lot of STEM majors. If you have to take the class, definitely take it with Professor Ahn, hes great and so it his awesome TA Ankit! It's a pretty challenging course with a heavy workload but as long as you go to lecture and put the time into your psets (6-12 hours each), you can do well. One of the very few classes I've walked away from feeling like a learned (and retained?) a ridiculous amount of useful material.",
    "ENAS 194 is a necessary evil, but not always an unpleasant one. It starts our a lot easier than it becomes (when series are introduced), and the problem sets gradually take up more and more time. That being said, it is well taught and very interesting and so I would definitely recommend it. I would especially recommend taking it from Professor Ahn, who is very passionate about teaching.",
    "Very hard class. Probably one of the hardest I will take at Yale. However, it may be just because math is not my strong point. It's straight from the textbook. P-Sets take hours and I did not enjoy the experience. However, I had to take it for my major, so there was nothing I could do about that. Only take it if you need it for your major or really enjoy math.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is passionate about applied math, or thinks they might be passionate about it. However, I would NOT recommend taking this class at the same time as another math class, or in a 5-class semester: the problem sets take maybe 8-11 hours per week.",
    "This class is hard and moves fast. If you can keep up with it (or you're required to take it, which is likely) then go for it. I highly recommend starting the PSETs early and going to as many review\/help sessions as possible.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to. It doesn't contribute much to your general education because it is essentially a class of memorizing lengthy procedures coupled with tedious algebra. The midterms were fair, but the final was a bit ridiculous. The problem sets also take an unduly amount of time.",
    "If you want to major in engineering, take it. It's surely a very challenging and stressful course, but a great foundation to skills needed as an engineer.",
    "This is a hard class, but a rewarding one too. You'll learn how to solve various types of differential equations, which are the prerequisites for solving mathematical and physical problems. Be prepared to spend on average 5 hours on the weekly problem sets. Charles Ahn gave us 3 drops for the problem sets. Use them wisely: the course is difficult from the start but it will get exponentially more difficult nearing the end of the semester, especially after the second midterm. You don't wanna force yourself to stay up until 4am because you no longer have the chance to drop the problem sets. That said, a really good class and an excellent professor. That final exam was a killer though.",
    "This class is quite a bit of work, especially learning on your own when attempting to do the problem sets. But you get to drop three homework grades, which is nice, and the tests were fair. I think I learned a lot. So, since you probably have to take it for your major anyway, take it! It's fine.",
    "Only take if required. There's some pretty interesting material (LaPlace transforms are pretty cool), but the problem sets are very long (12-15 hours a week) and very repetitive. That being said, you can drop 3 of 11 (at least this year). The material isn't hard if you keep up with the lectures and\/or the book (which is reasonably good for a math textbook, even on it's own). There's two midterms and a final which are difficult for everyone but they're nicely curved. The only issue is, there is not cheat sheet on any of them, so you have to memorize a lot of stuff or how to derive it.",
    "Take with Ahn if at all possible. Do work early in the week. Good luck.",
    "I would recommend this class because it teaches a lot of useful information that will be useful in higher level courses.",
    "ENAS 194 is the hardest math class I have taken so far, chiefly because of the last third of the course material. I took it because it is a prerequisite, so I would recommend it in that case.",
    "DiffeQ was not as hard as everyone said it would - but it is still a challenging course.The one piece of advice I would give - read the book before lecture. Charles Ahn goes very quickly sometimes and none of it clicked until I read the book for the problem sets.Also go to the review sessions if you are ever lost.This class takes a lot of diligence to keep up with, but the time and effort is rewarding if you like math at all.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in math and the physical sciences. As a student who really loves math, I had been debating whether to take this course or the math department separate ODE and PDE offerings, and while I am sure both routes provide a good background in differential equations, I am very happy with my selection to take this course. I learned a tremendous amount from the class and really enjoyed it as well. I felt that the material was consistently presented in a clear, orderly, and systematic way, covering a wide range of topics and applications, which I am confident will be of tremendous use in the future. Professor Ahn did a fantastic job explaining the connections between the mathematics and applications of differential equations in the physical sciences, and I am so glad I was lucky enough to be in his class to get that perspective. This, I believe, was one of the greatest strengths of the course, in addition to Professor Ahn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clarity, organization, and preparedness for class, which I was tremendously thankful for after quite the opposite experience in my linear algebra and matrix theory course last semester. At times, I wished the class would focus a little more attention on the theory behind differential equations (which we certainly covered but not always in the greatest amount of detail), but of course I understood going in that there would be (somewhat) limited time for attention to theory, given that the course covers both the mathematics and applications of ordinary and partial differential equations in just one semester. Even so, if you are interested in understanding the theory beyond the scope of the course, the textbook is very clear, expansive, and well written, and there is certainly an opportunity to go deeper into the theory on your own time. If you are making the decision between this course and the math department offerings, like I said, you probably can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go wrong, but I will say I was very pleased with the experience in this course and certainly feel I made the right decision. I found the treatment of the mathematics to be both thoroughly and clearly explained and the discussion of applications in the physical sciences to be incredibly useful and highly interesting. I would say the workload was significant but manageable, and the problem sets can certainly be fun if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re someone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really into math. Solid course and solid professor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 highly recommended.",
    "Overall, a pretty tough math credit. Homework takes a ton of time (don't let that first problem set fool you)-- you have to find a study group unless you're keen on spending 20+ hours per week slogging through some very messy problems. Regardless, you will work hard in this class. Tests are not easy (small mistakes are penalized greatly, be careful with your algebra)!",
    "194 is hard the material is difficult, but this is the best class to learn it in. You will have to work hard but you will learn differential equations.",
    "ENAS 194 is a fantastic course, but it definitely lives up to its name as one of Yale's hardest courses. Take it with professor Charles Ahn. He is a phenomenal lecturer and a very personable guy. The only thing would be that his lessons became really confusing nearthe end, which sucked because that is the hardest material. Overall, though it was an awesome class. Just make sure you make friends with other people in the class; the problem sets are near impossible on your own. Also, go to the review sessions\/TF office hours for help. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "This class is tough. It's a lot of work, especially if you're other classes are a lot of work. Problem sets every week (even when you have an exam) that can take as little as 3 hours to as much as 15 hours. We didn't meet over reading week, but we did have a problem set that week. You are allowed to drop 3 psets though which helps a lot. Ahn is a good professor and he's very approachable if you have questions. Material is confusing, but if you're considering taking it you probably need to or should. Textbook isn't great, but lots of review sessions to get extra help. Definitely one of my hardest and worst classes, but I think if I had more energy or time to put into it, it wouldn't have been so bad.",
    "You learn a lot of very practical mathematical techniques to solve differential equations, but there's so much work that I definitely would not recommend taking diffeq unless you have to take it.",
    "Well-taught, but very challenging course. I would recommend to a fellow student, especially if you take with Ahn , he is a great professor. There is a lot of work: 13 psets which usually take 6-11 hours each. Exams are challenging. There is an optional section which is very helpful. The class uses the worst rated diff eq textbook on amazon, so you may need to consult other sources besides the textbook to learn the material. That said, differential equations is essential if you are continuing on in science or engineering and a lot of student like that they are learning something that is so useful.",
    "I enjoyed the class. I thought it was very good.",
    "Sure. It's a lot of material to cover. Easy at the beginning. Grueling at the end. Professor was nice and understanding.",
    "It is a difficult and time-consuming class. I don't know why you would take this class unless you are interested in the applications (e.g. you are an engineering major). The class requires a lot of self-studying since the textbook is terrible and the lectures are not always clear. The teaching is almost entirely by example, so it is often hard to tell where the formula being applied came from or which formula to apply.",
    "This class is a LOT of work. Get as much help as you can, try not to fall behind. Charles Ahn is a great professor, section is helpful, problem sets are killer.",
    "This class is tough. It doesn't start off that way, but some of the later problem sets are real monsters. The tests aren't easy either, especially the final. It's a great class, though, and I'm glad I took it. I've learned a lot, and I thought the material (pretty much just a lot of methods for solving various classes of differential equations) was really interesting. Just be prepared to work.",
    "I enthusiastically recommend this class to any student who is interested in pursuing studies in engineering, applied science, or mathematics. Professor Ahn is a very clear and organized lecturer and the numerous teaching assistants are available and eager to help. Be warned however that there is a problem set every week for this class and the problem sets may take longer than problem sets for other classes. On the plus side, you may drop 3 problem sets and there are multiple review sessions every week and you can always email the teaching assistants for help on problem sets. I wish the class was at a later time however, because 9:00 am is too early for me.",
    "This was a well taught course (Prof Ahn) and it followed the easy-to-read textbook really well. Problems sets varied from 3-8 hours per week, but usually were around 4.5 hrs. Yes, it's difficult to do the problems, but the concepts aren't confusing. Prof. Ahn covered many of the practical applications of the math, and often devoted time to talking about physics, or finance, or cool science-related stories. DON'T GET BEHIND.",
    "Absolutely essential for anyone. This class is engaging and will keep you on your toes so be prepared for the most challenging class of your semester.",
    "A pivotal math class in your engineering career. I've already seen a lot of what we learned in this class in other classes (we just skipped the diffeq part), material pertaining to lab research, etc.",
    "You learn about a really useful and important branch of math, but be prepared to spend 10+ hours per week on problem sets. Both psets and exams are long and difficult. Ahn is an engaging lecturer, but is sometimes not very effective at teaching the material in a way that you can understand it. It's good to take if you're in the physical sciences, but it won't be enjoyable while you're doing it.",
    "I would only recommend this if it is a requirement.",
    "Differential Equations is probably the hardest class you will take at Yale. It requires a ton of time and effort and there will be times you feel completely lost. At the same time, if you put in the time it asks for, you will definitely reap the benefits afterwards and in the future. Outside of those students who are required to take the class, I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in engineering\/math and is willing to put in a lot of time. If you are willing to put in close to 10 hours a week on problem sets at times, than give it a shot.",
    "Good class but very time intensive. Take if you need to or are truly interested in the material. Take advantage of homework help sessions and make sure to start problem sets early in the week, as they can take 10+ hours to finish.",
    "Great course. Great Professor (Prof. Ahn). Great TA (My particular semester - Ankit Disa). I'm Applied Physics and I can say that this one of the best courses in STEM at Yale.The material is challenging (a lot harder than Linear Algebra), PSET's take a long time and midterm\/finals are also rough...but Differential Equations is such a fundamental discipline to science and engineering. The course material will make you appreciate STEM disciplines in a completely new light and there were many moments when I went \"Cool! This is something I've seen before Physics, but I didn't know how to solve the wave equation back then, but now I do and I can see how it all connects!\"TAKE IT.",
    "Professor Ahn is a good lecturer, spending adequate time on every topic, and explaining difficult concepts clearly. The psets typically don't take that long, but be prepared to spend plenty of time studying for the midterms and the final. They're not unfairly difficult, but they do demand a full understanding of everything that was taught in the course if you hope to get a good grade.",
    "This class will expose you to various methods of solving differential equations. Take it if you need to take it, but check out the Math department classes as well.There will be lots of homework. Probably ~10-15 hours of psets per week (which you should work on with other people).To physics majors - you can take this class before or concurrently with Quantum Mechanics. If you take it before, you'll understand QM better. If you take it concurrently (I did), you'll understand orthogonality of solutions, eigenfunctions, etc., better than most other people in the class."
