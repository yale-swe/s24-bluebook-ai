    "If you're interested in cell biology and developmental biology, definitely take it! The material was very interesting to me as an MCDB major and someone who has always been super fascinated by these subjects. This course could be frustrating at times, especially due to a few confusing lectures that everyone had a hard time following. In the end though, despite frustrating moments, it was a journey that was totally worth it for me. If you're interested in these subjects, go for it!",
    "A great intro to many significant developmental mechanisms and a great overview of general development. A very cool class, not very demanding. Only a weekly quiz and three in-class exams.",
    "This is a course with intriguing content and very relevant information for an MCDB major. HOWEVER, this course is very deceiving in terms of its difficulty. Three professors taught us this semester, two of which lectured the majority of the curriculum. Professor Holly is nice and approachable but his questions on the exams are weird (in a frustrating way). Professor Kankel (DUS of MCDB) is also a very nice and approachable professor, but his lecturing style did not particularly appeal to me. His slides are usually only pictures, and if you don't take notes of what he says you will be completely lost. His questions on exams, however, are usually the easiest and most straight-forward. The course has 10 quizzes, 2 that you can drop and I hated them. I always prepared and would have points taken off for weird answer keys that are followed to the dot. The questions are always open ended questions that require rambling. Which could so easily be avoided by ask specific questions and not penalizing students for being concise. In general, this was not a bad course (the TA was great), but it was by far not a great course. No final is kind of nice. But there is no easy grades here, no homework, no attendance, which means every quiz and midterm is heavily weighted.",
    "Good 2nd level bio course",
    "MCDB 210 is a good course. It covers really interesting material and I would recommend it to all MCDB majors.",
    "I would recommend this course as it is clear, straightforward, comprehensive, and appropriate introduction to developmental biology.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The material was extremely interesting. Compared to other MCDB classes, the material was not as difficult. You still had to study hard for the exams, but it was very do able.",
    "If you want a not-so-heavy core class, take this because it makes you keep up with the work and material. The material is also really interesting and there's a lot of comparative material between species; so it's the same concept over and over again, being slightly tweaked between organisms."
