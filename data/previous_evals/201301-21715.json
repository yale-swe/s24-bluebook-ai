    "This is a required course for the intensive physics major, so you do not really have a choice in taking this class. You will pick three different labs and work on them over the semester, so the workload is pretty manageable if you plan it out well (but it can be overwhelming if you leave it all to the last minute...). Prof Werner is very helpful in figuring out what is going on and answering questions related to the labs, and some of the TFs are better than others.",
    "It's a great course to gain experience doing the work involved in actual research.",
    "This is a pretty good class, with interesting experiments, and not much stress. Make sure you get a good lab partner. (Of course, odds are, if you're taking this class, it's required for your major.)",
    "Physics 382 gives some pretty good scientific paper-writing experience, and can be really fun if you have a good lab partner. If you take the class (which you have to do if you're an intensive physics major), pick three topics that you think are cool and have fun.",
    "Obviously don't take it unless you're an intensive physics major and you have to. Not that it's bad. It just takes up a lot of time.",
    "Do it if you have to for the major. The (former) DUS let people skip it in exchange for doing an extra semester of senior project, but I'd say it's good to take it for the major, especially if you like labs and\/or are good at writing (only three) lab reports."
