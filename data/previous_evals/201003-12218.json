    "This course is a great overview of the immune system for anyone interested in human biology or health. Yale's immunology department is among the best, and the lecturers are renowned researchers in the field. Overall, the quality of the lectures is quite high, and the TAs are very helpful. The workload is pretty average (one midterm, one final, and weekly sections where you have to read one paper). The textbook is very helpful, but the amount of reading assigned was often way more than what was actually covered in lecture. The nature of the materiel is such that students learn about applications of processes they already know, which is gratifying but can get tedious. There is also a pretty heavy emphasis on memorization.",
    "Really great class. Taught just enough basics and in depth material and I've come away learning a ton about immunobiology that I would have never gotten the chance to learn about otherwise. The class is about half grad students and half undergrads, but don't let that scare you at all. I was choosing between this and physio and am really glad I chose this. The midterm and final are weighted very heavily so that kind of scares me, but overall I really enjoyed the lectures and each professor's unique teaching styles. The lectures are all hand written on the board too, so that was a great change from reading slides all the time.",
    "I would recommend it. There is A LOT of information to memorize and the expectation on the exam is a little unclear, but the topic is really interesting.",
    "This course is like a Metropolitan Opera Gala for immunology, where all the great divas come on stage to sign their signature arias. Yale's immunology department is full of stars and most of them come to give one or more lectures on topics in which they have undoubtedly made great advances themselves. This course is really a chance to learn immunology from the world's experts and most are enthusiastic teachers. The chalk-talk format means there are no Powerpoint slides to rely on, so count on being in class to take notes. The biweekly sessions in which you read and comment on journal articles also requires substantial preparation as you have to be able to dissect figures in the papers with some forethought. The two-exam format is a bit of a mistake: it's a cram-a-thon and the worst form of enforced academic bulemia, gorge on facts and vomit them up. That being said, this was my favorite class in all my time at Yale; not an easy class, because of the sheer amount of material, but a fantastic one nonetheless.",
    "If you love immunology and learning about diseases and how they are fought, take this! You will learn tons of information.",
    "This was by far one of the best classes I have had at Yale. Although there is a tremendous amount of material, the professors are all amazing and teaching the concepts very well. My only concern is that at times the course can seem to lack aunifying theme due to so many professors teaching. The exams are not bad at all, though learning all of the material was at times overwhelming. The TA for my section was always prepared for class. I highly recommend this class.",
    "This is a great survey of the immune system. I would highly recommend it; there isn't too much work, the professors are very good, and the information is interesting.",
    "Great, interesting course, but lots of material to memorize. It's frightening that your entire course grade is essentially based off of two tests. I'd still highly recommend it.",
    "Immuno can get challenging at times, but I think a good foundation is pretty necessary for any biology major. Most of the molecular and cellular mechanisms are taught in the first half while the second half is more about different diseases and disorders. Studying for the tests is a little stressful, because there's only two and they're worth quite a lot, but they were pretty fair. The professors were hit or miss. Some were great, some were okay, and some you were glad that they only taught 1 or 2 classes. Since I'm doing my senior project in a cancer immunology lab, this class really helped hammer in some of the concepts that were often applied in the lab, so I'm glad I took it.",
    "This course is interesting and the work load is reasonable. The only assessments are a midterm and a final, in addition to mandatory sections and a section participation grade. I actually wish there had been more regular assessments so that I could know better where I stand in the class.",
    "This course was absolutely amazing! If you have any interest in immunology, you should absolutely take this course. It moves at a very manageable pace, without being too rapid or too slow. It's challenging, but very very well-taught, and all the various aspects of immunology that the course addresses are well-integrated. I was able to get an overview of many different aspects of immunology, without feeling like this was a typical survey course where we only briefly delved into each one. I am so, so glad that I took this course, and it is hands-down one of my favorite classes at Yale.In terms of the workload, there's only one midterm and one final, so it's very manageable...just make sure to keep up with the lectures, otherwise there's a lot to study before each test. Also, if Heather is still a TA, I definitely recommend trying to get into her section! She knows the material extremely well and explains it wonderfully, and she was a huge help in understanding the lectures and studying for the exams.",
    "Immuno is like cell bio on crack. I would definitely recommend taking it. Not only is the material super interesting but the lecturers are phenomenal. They really are the stars of the field (yale is a mecca for immunology!) and can really teach it. With that said, it is very difficult due to the detail that you have to know the information and the nature of the students in the class (both undergrads and grad students). ALSO, they teach on the blackboard--old school style! I totally loved the blackboard and love learning that way. I'm so tired of powerpoints and this was a welcome change of pace. I would definitely recommend it as a great option as their upper level bio class. Exam wise, there are only two exams--one midterm and one final, both worth roughly half you grade. With all that said, I would recommend taking it!",
    "A course centered on just on the immune system, the first half or so covered the basic components, with the second half focused on tying things together to explain allergies, autoimmune disease, vaccination, etc. If you think you might have any interest in the immune system, take this course. The professors are all pretty fantastic, and although you are responsible for a lot of material, it's all pretty interesting.",
    "Good class; lots of memorization, but material is very interesting and relevant to medicine and public health.",
    "Be prepared to work very hard, but also be prepared to learn a lot. It's a fabulous course, and you learn so much at the end of it! You can't think of science in the same way ever again after taking this course. It's incredibly well organized into themes, which makes it more manageable to study for.",
    "Great upper level bio in which you will learn a LOT from the top immuno researchers in the field. Seriously, here you're learning from the people who discovered some of the key facets of immunobiology today...pretty awesome. There are only two exam grades--midterm and final--which can be scary if you're not a good test-taker, but don't write it off just because of that. Shop the course. People do well in this class because it's taught well and you want to learn it because it's interesting. Great if you're interested in medicine--immuno is involved in everything!",
    "This is a good class that is team-taught by the experts. It is a bit disorganized but interesting and definitely worthwhile.",
    "I absolutely loved this course. Immuno was great. I felt a little lost in the beginning, but everything came together by the end. This was definitely one of my favorite courses at Yale. Heather McGee is definitely one of the best TA's I've ever had, so get her if you can. Take this course, one of the best bio courses I've had."
