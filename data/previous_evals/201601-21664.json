    "Recommend to take for a writing credit- I don't think my writing improved substantially though.",
    "ENGL 114 is a good course for people that want to improve their writing or for people who are not going into writing heavy fields. If you do write alot I would not recommend this course because sometimes reading other people's essays is quite painful given many students of 114 have written very few essays in their time.",
    "I would recommend to anyone even remotely interested in the topic of American Warfare - I didn't know I would enjoy it as much as I did. Grey does a wonderful job with facilitating discussion and always picks interesting readings. While there was a decent amount of reading before every class, it was definitely worth the time.",
    "ENGL 114 is the quintessential writing course. It's geared towards the basic improvement of academic writing, so most of the course consists simply of writing and revising essays, with required readings to prepare for each class. The course familiarizes you with academic writing and you become very familiar with what good writing is. My writing has improved, but it is hard for me to see how far it has actually improved. If you are able to find a subject matter that interests you, ENGL 114 will improve your writing abilities and also provide a basis for you to explore a topic considerably in depth.",
    "A challenge but worth it"
