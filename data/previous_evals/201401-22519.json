    "It taught me many new things.",
    "It is outside of my field, but it did a good job of developing an appreciation for physiology.",
    "While this course does not have any direct contribution to my research, it was a good refresher of the pathogenesis of many diseases that I had not encountered since my medical school days. I really enjoyed that aspect of the course. I also thought that the workload was entirely appropriate.",
    "Dr. Sigworth's lectures on ion channel physiology will certainly help with my research, as I anticipate doing a lot of electrophysiology."
