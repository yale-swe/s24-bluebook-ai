   "comments": [
    "It was a complete (as complete as one can be in a semester) survey of organometallic chemistry starting with a history and ending with review of industrial processes and catalysis. I would absolutely recommend this to another student. It is a difficult class and requires a lot of time, but the payoff is huge!",
    "A worthwhile class for anyone that will be doing synthesis of any kind. Will come in very handy when taking the cumulative exams!",
    "Great course, with exams that are hard but actually cover all material learned. Problem sets are tricky, but really good to help understand material. Very good course for both organic and inorganic chemists to take.",
    "It's a lot of work, but what you get out of it is well worth it. You'll be really surprised how much you can learn in one semester. Highly recommended.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it because a knowledge of basic organometallic chemistry is necessary for students of most chemistry disciplines.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "Absolutely would recommend it. Great class. Will teach you a lot.",
    "Yes, I would recommend to another student. Useful for both organic or inorganic students.",
    "Fundamental organometallic reactions and their applicationsI would absolutely recommend this course",
    "I would recommend this course to other chemistry students. It was a solid course that provided a good overview of the subject and more importantly, it developed a knowledge base for the students to approach organometallic chemistry from. This will allow the students to better understand the nature of the research currently being undertaken in the area of organomettalics.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student",
    "I would recommend it to all students in inorganic\/organometallics. It might not be particularly necessary for students in organic synthesis or chemical biology.",
    "This course is an intense but entertaining look at a very different kind of chemistry. It requires much more effort than a typical graduate course, and as such is not suitable for everyone. Undergraduates and out-of-field students may find the sheer amount of new material overwhelming. However, I would highly recommend the course to anyone who sincerely wants to go beyond the hard-and-fast rules learned in sophomore organic chemistry and discover the potential of organometallics."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped to solidify my desire to do research in Organometallics. I learned so much in this class that within weeks I was able to better understand journal articles, was able to follow along at group meetings and really started to see how the area of chemistry came together. This was my favorite class not only because of the level of teaching, but also because it helped me become certain about my career aspirations.",
    "Relevant? You could say that, yes.",
    "Learned a great deal about organometallics which seem to be just about everywhere in inorganic chemistry (my field). I have no doubt that I will end up utilizing my knowledge gained from this course at some point in my time as a graduate student.",
    "The most helpful part of the course was the paper because we could apply the reactions we learned to our own interests. So this meant that I learned a lot about a specific organometallic reaction that I could apply to my research.",
    "Helpful to understand catalysis reactions that apply to synthetic organic chemistry",
    "Provides you with a toolbox of organometallic transformations that can be applied to research.",
    "As an inorganic chemist going into organomettalics this course was invaluable for deepening my understanding the area. I expect to be using what I have learned as the foundation for what I will be researching.",
    "This course decisively contributed to my knowledge of my disipline as I will do my lab work in inorganic chemistry. I feel confident enough to tackle the problems that I will have to face in my near future",
    "I had never taken this course before and I gained basic knowledge to continue research in my field.",
    "Chemistry 552 was a required in-field course for me, and related directly to the subject of my study in graduate school. The structure of the course was very helpful in that it first explained the few basic transformations of organometallic chemistry, and then examined complex reactions simply as combinations of these basic steps. I feel fortunate that the course which will be most applicable to my research turned out to be so intensive and informative."
