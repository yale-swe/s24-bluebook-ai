    "This was my favorite class this semester. I found the material both interesting and challenging.",

    "A better understanding of the theoretical foundation of civil war and its application in cases such as Northern Ireland."

   "comments": [
    "In the first few weeks of the semester, I found the student-led discussions kind of disorganized and thought we could get more out of class time if Professor Weir guided the conversation a bit more. This definitely improved later in the course when the professor began participating in the conversation more frequently and the students sort of developed a standard structure for the group discussions. I still think we tended to veer off into topics that weren't necessarily that relevant or important even by the end of the course, but it wasn't a big deal. Overall, I really enjoyed the issues we explored and the special focus on Northern Ireland because we were able to contextualize the things we learned about conflict and reconciliation.",
    "Student presentations sometimes took up the whole class; would have preferred more seminar style discussion with interesting insights and more guidance from the professor.",
    "Excellent professor who does a great job in facilitating class discussions. Very interesting and diverse course material. Could be improved by varying the course structure more -- less focus solely on class discussions and perhaps incorporating professor-led mini-lectures\/discussions\/case studies",
    "Everything was great, but it may have been beneficial to get graded feedback on assignments throughout the course and maybe some more leading of the discussion by the professor.",
    "Sometimes I felt as though the course focused a little bit too much on Northern Ireland. I learned a lot about that subject throughout the course, but would have enjoyed looking at other case studies as well."

    "Bonnie's a sweetheart and the class was super chill, but ultimately was the typical Global Affairs seminar: some class discussion, a few reading responses, and a final paper on whatever you want to write about.",
    "Definitely would recommend this course to anyone who is willing to dive into a specific conflict area (Northern Ireland) and learn through that lens. We had some really interesting readings, some theoretical, some specifically relating to the circumstances of Northern Ireland and a few other regions of ethnic conflict. Class discussions were student-led and for the most part enjoyable, although the conversation sometimes went off-topic. We were also able to speak to people (through Skype) who have firsthand experience in the region and with the conflict, which was really cool and added a lot to course experience.",
    "Yes! Professor Weir is excellent - would highly recommend this course!",
    "Definitely recommend. Dr. Weir is amazing and the course is very interesting. The only problem is that at times I would have appreciated if Dr. Weir chimed in more.",
    "Yes - great survey of various themes related to civil conflict, with plenty of sources from the syllabus which one could further research a particular theme."
