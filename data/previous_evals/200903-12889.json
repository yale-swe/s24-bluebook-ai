    "The course was generally irrelevant to hardcore design, but was a luxury inexamining hand drawing at a times when CAD is so dominating in the workflow. For some students, it was a way out and a good step back to reevaluate the hand drawing as a process helpful to thinking.",
    "Yes.",
    "N\/A- Elective Course: I think that many of the second year\u0092s that took the course this year saw it as a supplement to our first year drawing course. Our first year course focused on Beaux Arts watercolor techniques, so I think that we struggled a bit more than normal with this content, challenging ideas of representation and aesthetics. I really appreciated this offering and believe it is an effective means for greater spatial understanding and developing one\u0092s hand at critical drawing."

   "comments": [
    "The sequence of assignments, especially in the first half of the semester, was very good and covered a lot of important ground. It would have been great if the second half of the semester had drawn more directly on these initial exercises.",
    "The course would be better served by addressing more contemporary theorists\/modes of representation. Too much of the course focuses uncritically on learning archaic methods, while not enough engages with contemporary ways to push representation forwards,and contemporary positions on the relevance and function of hand-drawing.An increase in the time devoted to discussion of the reading, with a specific focus on developing a critical and contemporary agenda for hand-drawing, and representation more broadly construed, would be of great benefit.The transition from descriptive geometry to compositional work (occurring after the case study) was abrupt and somewhat frustrating. The emphasis should be on descriptive geometry (with composition subsumed into this discussion) throughout.",
    "For the most part, I really enjoyed this course. I did not find the assignments after the midterm as interesting as the earlier ones. Personally I liked the earlier assignments because they were more geometrically rigorous and process based. I wish the course continued the same sort of attention to descriptive geometry throughout the whole semester. I also wish the final assignment was more open.",
    "My suggestion, as has been discussed, would be to remove the Analytique section and focus instead of further development of projective techniques (shade, mirroring, three point perspective, projective geometry).I also feel that the individual study of figures was not helpful. For instance, I think Desargues should have been studied by all. The individual study of figures lacked historical placement and real development (and the please remove the modern architects...Hedjuk, Morphosis, etc...) I would much rather had preferred continuing the developmental sequence where each class adds a new layer of knowledge to an increasing continuity.The level of exploration and encouragement to think conceptually about drawing was excellent. I think as we continue to challenge drawing today, this course can find a legitimate place in commentary on today's design environments.",
    "Excellent.",
    "The syllabus and assignments were organized in a thoughtful manner, although some of the end assignments (Analytique) could be introduced earlier in the course.",
    "The material was good but personally resided in a bit more of historical perspective techniques than anticipated. This material is important and not taught anywhere else in the curriculum, but could serve as a foundation created in the first couple assignments. As we talked about at the conclusion of the course, it would be interesting to analyze the representation of contemporary architects, possibly in small groups. This could provide the basis for a much richer discussion of the status of measured drawing in architecture today. The assignments were heavy and it was challenging to understand the procedure and then create a beautiful drawing, but I would not reduce the workload in retrospect. I think that a greater involvement\/availability of the TA is important to push the drawings further."

   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this course and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "My expectations for the course were very well met; I was hoping to gain some exposure to drawing history and technique and I found the assignments to be very engrossing.",
    "As per above, this course was excellent and met many of my expectations. I do feel however, that a more rigorous syllabus could be constructed that lays a clearer class tragectory.",
    "I expected to learn how do descriptive and analytical geometry in this class. I hoped to learn how to use it and when to use it but neither of those problems mattered in the end. It was just fun to know. I don't know how it will be directly applicable to my design process, but I believe it will manifest itself in some way further down the road.I enrolled in the class because I thought that the class of 2011 were cheated of a legitimate drawing class (as opposed to a watercolor class) and believed that hand drawing was something that needed to be practiced. I got more than I bargained for in this class, learning how to see rotations\/ distortions\/ perspectives in different ways.",
    "The drawing class offered a range of opportunities to explore individual aspirations. In that sense, it allowed me to focus on my own interests at a fairly steady pace.",
    "My expectations were to challenge drawing conventions and produce beautiful hand drawings with new techniques. These were met but resided a bit too much in historical techniques than anticipated. I appreciated the course but expected more drawing experimentation and more detailed explanations toward figuring out these techniques and discussion analyzing them instead of just the resulting composition."

   "comments": [
    "This has been one of the most valuable classes I have taken in my time at Yale; I wish that the required drawing course in the first year had been half as worthwhile.",
    "This course was of great value. Given the travesty that was the first-year drawing course in Fall 2008, this course offered the opportunity to explore relevant and potentially useful methods of representation--never mind to actually draw and discuss drawing. When the course did engage with the readings the discussion was fruitful and exciting. The students showed real enthusiasm and the instructor helped to foster a collaborative atmosphere in which there were some meaningful attempts at experimentation.",
    "This course was extremely valuable and should definitely be maintained.",
    "It was a fun struggle. I don't know how useful it will be, but its impact on the semester was definitely negative. Although it was a very enjoyable and challenging class, its workload was so intense that it had a negative impact on the week, frequently requiring an all nighter. For an elective class, this should not be necessary but the final drawings were frequently worth it, even if Victor did not expect the intense effort put in. The class sometimes put studio design in jeopardy, exhausting the student before studio the day after. The intensity of the workload was frequently compared to Eisenman's analytical drawing class.",
    "This course was valuable in helping me to better understand my own strengths and weakness when it comes to communicating my ideas through visual representation.",
    "This course way key in developing my spatial understanding and worked my mind in a way that rotating perspectives in Rhino will never achieve. I think that this is an important elective to keep and develop because it allots time for techniques that are overcome by the computer but better understood through developing by hand."

   "comments": [
    "Victor Agran was very engaged in the course, and was a very supportive and thoughtful teacher. I think he could benefit from widening his criticism somewhat; he is sometimes \"too nice,\" and he seemed to become repetitive, especially near the end of the semester.",
    "The instructor was enthusiastic and knowledgeable, but devoted too much time to the discussion of the drawings. The course should be equal parts seminar and review. His persistent discussion of beauty, without an attempt to establish a basis for such a discussion, was frustrating. The mixed emphasis on technique and final outcome led to drawings that were less than they could have been had the focus been on placed on one or the other (perhaps assignment to assignment).",
    "As teaching this course for the first time, I felt Professor Agran did an excellent job. I do think that hopefully he will be able to take more responsibility of the material and the assignments, ie better command of the subtleties of the techniques. He is very encouraging and responsive to the individual investigations of each of the students as well as able to critique each project on its own merits.",
    "Victor was a very inspirational professor. His calm demeanor and sharp analytical skills and openness to the variety of resulting drawings were key to effectiveness of the course. Students were encouraged to explore and they were committed to Victor because of the way he lead the class, a sort of patient paternal figure that watching the drawings blossom from a distance. In a class that could be potentially suffocating due to the technical aspects of some drawings, Victor was successful because of the emphasis on making 'a pretty drawing'. As architecture students, we inherently tried to infuse these with whatever meaning and priority that makes us tick. Between Victor and the students, there was a generally good feedback. Students were hesitant to disappoint Victor because of the trust he places in them.Terri was a very organized TA and was readily available the night that the drawings were due. However, she was frequently not very helpful in explaining the techniques. She could've been a much more important assett.",
    "Victor and Terri were both affective in providing valuable criticism during class critiques and creating a positive environment for exploration.",
    "The instructor for this course was superb. Victor was personable while critical, helpful while challenging, and understanding while inspiring some beautiful drawings. It was a tough task to take on Sophia Gruzdys content, and this was the first take which I believe he will fully make his own in coming years.The TA for this course is essential as drawings are typically completed late. It is important when you are stuck in one of the procedures to have a person to ask questions. I think that the TA should be a bit more active and roaming, vocal and knowledgeable of the procedures. It would also be great to hold the relevant supplemental resources on their desk."

   "question_text": "Suggestions you may have for course improvements:",
   "comments": [
    "This course is excellent, and could be improved through greater discussion of the readings (in order to foster a more critical discussion of the drawings); a sequence of projects that do more to encourage exploratory drawings (for instance specific, class-wide, case studies--e.g. Scott Cohen, Hejduk, Morphosis, Hadid); and more refined and critical discussion of the work produced (perhaps in relation to the readings and to specific discourses\/theories).",
    "I did not feel that the final assignment was a fitting culmination for the course. I think if the final would have been left open, it would have been a fine opportunity for students to explore what they were most interested in, without forcing a discussion of las meninas. I was more interested in the process of discovering how to understand the different methods to construct the drawings.",
    "See comments above.",
    "Nothing. It is fine the way it is.",
    "Discussions that focus on composition and analytiques might help the class evolve from just learning individual types of drawing techniques, and can be beneficial in thinking about how to apply the techniques in different ways.",
    "The timing of this course within the week is crucial because of its relatively heavy block of time required. As we discussed in class, I think that it is well placed on Wednesday mornings and should continue in this slot if possible.As mentioned in previous answers, I believe the later weeks should be reformatted to encourage greater experimentation and means of representation. Other materials and methods should be introduced to allow for each student to test and develop a strong final project."
