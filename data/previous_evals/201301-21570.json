    "If you're pretty decent native speaker, I would definitely recommend this course. Liu Laoshi is just the best. The course isn't too hard, but the workload is a bit time consuming at times.",
    "Absolutely. Especially if the teacher is Fan Liu.",
    "Chinese 142 is a great class for people with some background in Chinese. The jewel of the course is the teacher, Liu Laoshi. I don't know if she's teaching this course again next year, but she is extremely helpful, funny, personable, knowledgeable, and an all-around great Chinese teacher. She is one of my favorite people at Yale, and she made me look forward to going to Chinese class."
