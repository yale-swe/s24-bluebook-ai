    "nope. there are many more worthwhile classes offered at yale. dont waste your time with this one",
    "This class is great! Though there are a lot of papers they are all really short and easy to write. The professor is great! She is really knowledgeable and very understanding.",
    "This course was an interesting look at different case studies in countries throughout the Middle East. Each ethnography dealt with a different issue in a specific nation, and these ethnographies are then applied to the larger context of the Middle East. There is not a lot of work, but the readings are necessary for class discussions.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone hoping to learn more about the Middle East and North Africa than their political history.",
    "This class takes 5 ethnographies from 5 countries and analyzes them, providing through this analysis an image of an incredibly diverse, particular, yet intertwined Middle East. The final paper asks to tie together the themes of the course. I would without a doubt recommend this class to another student, for reasons listed above.",
    "An excellent class for those interested in the middle east and islamic culture.",
    "I would recommend this course to most students - the Middle East plays such a key role in the current political climate that it is important to understand the culture and society, not only political tensions. Learning about the anthropology of the Middle East gave me a new persepective on a region that is commonly objectified in the news media.I enjoyed the focus on individual ethnographies instead of a broad survey course. This is possible due to the small size of the class. I would have preferred a more intimate classroom setting and more discussion of the material.",
    "Get to know the Middle East beyond the media. Learn about the culture ofIranian youth beyond politics, or about the art world in Egypt. This course provides a nice taste of the field of anthropology, and gets in-depth about practices and the history of the Islamic world."
