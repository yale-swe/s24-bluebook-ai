    "I would recommend this class. Hieroglyphics is a unique way to satisfy the language requirement. Niv was a great teacher and the workload was very fair",
    "Second verse, same as the first. Hieroglyphic Egyptian is great, this semester more so than the first maybe because the literature readings are more engaging than sample translations.",
    "A fun, cool, but somewhat demanding course. It's cool to learn a completely different language system from our own.",
    "Should absolutely take it! Middle Egyptian is a fascinating window into the civilization of ancient Egypt.",
    "A lot more work than I expected. This class is difficult but the grading is really easy.",
    "I would highly recommend this class!",
    "Egyptology 120 is a really cool L2 class. If you have taken L1 Hieroglyphics than I definitely recommend taking this. The material is very interesting and the Professor is great!",
    "Continuation of EGYP 110. You learn the verbal system and begin to translate actual texts. It's challenging at times, but is rewarding and overall is a very good class.",
    "It was a good continuation of Hieroglyphics L1. We read two original texts, which is pretty neat because we just started learning the language a semester before. The work was considerably greater than in L1, but it was manageable if you stay on top of assignments. I took the class to fulfill my language requirement, but I ended up enjoying it. It only meets two times a week, so that's an advantage over other L1\/L2 languages."
