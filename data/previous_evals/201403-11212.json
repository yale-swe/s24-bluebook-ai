    "The IR workshop is really a must for students interested in what's going on right now in the field. Reading the papers ahead of time is nice, but not entirely necessary, as most of the presentations are pretty well polished. Lunch tends to be pretty good, and it's free, so I would recommend coming.",

    "This course offered a nice look at what other IR scholars are doing right now and the ways in which they are doing them (also, the ways in which their theories and methods are criticized). While there were few direct lessons, there was a lot of learning by example that I think will be very helpful.",
    "It has been great to become familiar with cutting-edge topics and methods in IR through this seminar; a very important experience for an aspiring scholar."
