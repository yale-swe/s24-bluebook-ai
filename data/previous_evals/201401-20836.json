    "Please, please, please, take the class. It is amazing!",
    "Korean-Americans will benefit greatly from this course. Professor Lee-Smith creates a safe, non-competitive space to learn Korean so you really focus on your own needs. It is okay if you are weaker in writing\/reading\/speaking--- the class was very mixed bag in skill level and the class addresses all categories well. It was truly a joy and always helped me start my day in a more positive light.",
    "Yes. Take it if you want to improve your Korean.",
    "Although I'm biased because I had a good deal of Korean experience beforehand, I would highly recommend this for moderate-advanced level Korean students--you'll get so much out of the class because of Professor Lee. Although the focus is on vocab and culture, my writing and grammar improved so much since the beginning of the semester.",
    "KREN 142 01 is an excellent continuation from L3 Korean. It concentrates on writing and speaking skills. Because it meets everyday, it reinforces a lot of the information we learn in class and the environment is very familial. I would definitely recommend the class to another student.",
    "I would recommend it to those who are heritage speakers and want to get better at Korean. You will definitely learn, and for me it was helpful in establishing the basics in grammar, vocabulary, and writing especially.",
    "Kren 142 is a wonderful and enjoyable class for helping to further develop skills in Korean writing, grammar, reading, and speaking. You will learn many new vocabulary words, and I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Great continuation of 132, I learned a lot more and after the class, I definitely feel more prepared to have an advanced conversation."
