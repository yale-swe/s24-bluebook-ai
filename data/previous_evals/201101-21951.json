    "Interesting, enjoyable, for the most part very interesting readings; you will look forward going to class. I recommend it.",
    "Take any and every class with Professor Poole. He is the best person in the entire world. Even if this class were about nothing, he would make it wonderful. The workload is pretty light with only three short essays, a final interview, and a final. The final interview was the most fun final I have ever taken and the written final was utterly painless. Readings were very manageable, but class discussions often focused on one tiny passage. Absolutely take it.",
    "This course provides an overview of the history, art, architecture, and literature associated with the Camino de Santiago, beginning with its roots in the Middle Ages and moving all the way through to the present day. I would encourage all Spanish-speakers to take this course.",
    "This is a great class! All about the literature, history, and culture surrounding the pilgrimage in Northern Spain. A fair amount of work for a spanish class \u0097 3 short papers, a final, an oral exam, and regular readings \u0097 but fun and well worth it! Professor Poole is the best.",
    "Yes",
    "Great class with a great professor. I went into the class not knowing anything about the St. James pilgrimage, but was completely fascinated by the material. Also, professor Poole = incredible. Take a class from him!!!!!",
    "I would summarize it as an in-depth exploration of various perspectives surrounding the pilgrimage, as well as a historical overview of Spain from the pilgrimage's commencement to present day. I would definitely recommend it to another student - the work is not extensive, Professor Poole is great and the topic is really interesting.",
    "Spanish 368 was an excellent course; I would highly recommend it to anyone with the necessary Spanish preparation.If you have ever thought about doing the Camino or would like to learn more about its history, you would get a lot out of this class. The class was a great mix of literature, history, art, architecture, and religion; in short, it perfectly achieved the ideal of the study of the Humanities in the context of the 1000+ years of the Santiago Pilgrimage tradition. The workload was very manageable \u0096 4 short interesting novels, 3 short papers, and a take-home exam. Just as important to the success of the class as the fascinating subject material was the awesomeness of Kevin Poole \u0096 he is very knowledgeable, supportive, entertaining, and an overall great professor!",
    "This was a great class. Professor Poole is great, you'll learn a lot and have a great time.",
    "Very fun class with genuinely interesting material and discussions.",
    "See previous responses.",
    "You should absolutely take it. Professor Poole is wonderful, and the class is quite interesting."
