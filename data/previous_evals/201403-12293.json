   "comments": [
    "Credit D if you're taking it for fun. Really really hard for a seemingly easy looking course.",
    "The best science course I've taken at Yale. Extremely interesting and enthusiastically taught. Go to class and get ahead on your work - there are no curveballs or unexpected tricks.",
    "This class is not too much day to day work, but the tests are hard to study for. The professors didn't provide any guide on what might appear on the exams so you have to be very proactive in that sense.",
    "I do not think I would take this class unless I needed it for my major. The final was one of those kind of trick you finals that does not stick too closely to the material discussed in lecture.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "It's strengths are that the information is interesting. I think it can be improved in that the professors can do a better job at preparing you for exams. For example, there was very little preparation for the first exam. We had one worksheet, and that topic was not even on the exam. We went in blind, which I did not like. Also, the professors have no office hours, it's by appointment, which makes it clear that they're just really busy and don't have much time for the students. They don't really make themselves available, they're very occupied with their own work and that shows.",
    "It is a very nice class to have a first contact with ecology. The classes are interesting and the professors like what they are doing.",
    "Above and beyond ecology courses at any other school: this is an in-depth class that covers all the major topics of the field with (simple) mathematical models. You'll be fine as long as you know basic algebra and spend time engaging with the material. This (2014) is the first year Dr. Staver has co-taught with Post, and I'm sure the two of them will keep revising the course together for future years. Both are solid lecturers.",
    "Ecology (from Greek: , \"house\"; -, \"study of\") is the scientific analysis and study of interactions among organisms and their environment, such as the interactions organisms have with each other and with their abiotic environment. Topics of interest to ecologists include the diversity, distribution, amount (biomass), number (population) of organisms, as well as competition between them within and among ecosystems. Ecosystems are composed of dynamically interacting parts including organisms, the communities they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as primary production, pedogenesis, nutrient cycling, and various niche construction activities, regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits, and the variety of organisms is called biodiversity. Biodiversity, which refers to the varieties of species, genes, and ecosystems, enhances certain ecosystem services.",
    "It's not something I'd recommend just taking for fun unless you love the topic, but it's certainly not a bad course. You have to take it for EEB, but it's really quite good as a required course. It teaches you a lot of interesting things and some valuable math skills important to biology (also, I know how to use Excel effectively now! So that's a bonus). So yeah, fine course overall, not extremely exciting, but useful and interesting.",
    "Take it if you know you like ecology. If you're on the fence you may be put off by the variable pace of the course and by the difficulty of tests and assignments. If you have to take it, make sure you have someone to study with.",
    "A pretty thorough overview of a complicated and interdisciplinary facet of science, take ecology if you want to learn about and begin seeing connections between everything in the natural world.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend this course to anyone that didn't have to take it as a requirement. However, to those that do need to take it, I would say it was very enjoyable despite the amount of work.",
    "Superficial. A lot of high school material. Very boring. Only take it if you need to.",
    "E&EB 220 covered a lot of material. Unlike some other courses, it never felt like any of the material was rushed. The professors were very clear. Definitely take this class if you are looking for a good science credit or if it is a requirement for your major.",
    "I would recommend it only to students interested in the major, it was a little too in depth\/required outside knowledge for just a general interest course.",
    "Only take it if you need it.",
    "This course was okay, though sadly not as great as it could have been. I am genuinely interested in the topics, so that helped sustain me, but it could get really dry. It was also far more math-based (all algebra) than a lot of people expected, so be prepared for that. The lectures were often pretty dry, though some parts (the more practical examples\/topics, relevant to real-life; such as fisheries management and global change) were pretty interesting. Not too much work (a few easy problem sets, a paper, two exams, a final), but you'll probably have to use the textbook a lot to parse through some of the more convoluted math models. Overall, not terrible (since you're probably taking this for a major requirement), but not as great as I'd hoped.",
    "Midterms are fine so long as you study, but the final is a slap in the face (even if you study all week). Fortunately everything is curved. READ THE PRIMER. Preferably before you go to class that day. It clarifies things so much and your life will be easier I promise.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class unless it's a requirement or unless you're really interested in the quantitative aspect of ecology. There were some redeemable qualities of the class - certain lectures that were especially engaging - but not enough to make up for the class in general.",
    "Pretty cut and dry intro course to Ecology. Don't take it unless you need to for the major or are really interested in the specific science of ecology. I wish I could have covered the material in a non-lecture setting, but besides that I was happy with the course.",
    "Good class though the writing assignments are pretty tough. make sure to stay on top of them.",
    "Overall very good course; good instructors; good introduction to the topic; well-paced"
