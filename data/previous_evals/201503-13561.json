    "I think the course's primary purpose (as is) is to give FES students a taste of land use issues to entice them to take more courses in the subject. I was very familiar with the subjects discussed before taking the course, so I was hoping to get the land use perspective on issues I generally hear from different perspectives. i think the best part of the class is that I can look back on the slides and find a checklist of strategies that I may want to look up if I'm writing\/working on a project that fits under one of the subjects. However, I did not find the lectures engaging. Perhaps if students were asked to each bring case studies for one class, choosing which they wrote the paper about in advance, it could help make the classes more engaging. The case studies that were presented felt very limited in their spectrum (generally cities of the same size in the CT-NY corridor), and it would have been nice to get students to bring their perspective through examples from across the nation\/globe.",
    "9) Professor Nolon loves student participation. He is enthusiastic about what he teaches, and is excited to engage student questions and talk about whatever topics students are interested in. 12) I was not familiar with this topic before taking the class and thought it would be more about land management rather than zoning and urban planning. For students interested in land management this class may not be very valuable, but to anyone interested in local government ordinances and zoning and planning, this class seems like it'd be quite valuable.",
    "Professor Nolon can get really long winded at times. The quality of teaching is not up to par since there lacks eye contact and student participation. However the range of information covered is still useful. Ms. Jessica Bacher also shares the same style of teaching. Overall, it is difficult to learn and absorb knowledge given the issues of the existing pedagogy.",
    "This course felt mainly taught by Jessica Bacher due to John's health problems. She was a very clear and effective communicator, and was very responsive to student's questions."
