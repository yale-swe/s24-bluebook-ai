    "A fantastic class. You work on two major projects--an independent proposal to do research on a global health project abroad and a group project with classmates (SO MUCH FUN) The class was very atypical in having so much group work, but it really helps you imagine what actually doing research will be like. Take this class if you are interested in doing global health work. Also, Kaveh is a fantastic professor and a super nice and supportive guy!",
    "This class is intended for those who are preparing to do research during the following summer, so if you are doing that, than you should definitely think about taking this class. this was the first semester it was taught so they were still trying to figure out how deadlines should work and the assignments were a little confusing, but it's an interesting course",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in either global health issues and\/or a desire to conduct research. For those interested in global health, the concepts and studies one reads about in public health or medical anthropology classes take on new meaning (and one can better understand those studies\u0092 limitations) once one understands the logistics and working process behind how those research studies came about. For those interested in research, taking a global health perspective on developing research proposals helps translate one\u0092s desire to do research into a physical, tangible proposal that one can use to apply for funding.",
    "I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Important for anyone who plans to do research overseas.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student who is interested in conducting some sort of public health research but who has little to no background in it. It was a great class that made you think deeply about why you wanted to conduct the research and how exactly you would go about doing it.",
    "Yes, recommended, especially if you have no research background (like me) n and are hoping to change that. Class is divided into three parts - weekly lectures from Kaveh and Arian (who are extremely knowledgeable and bring a lot of experience to both the ethical and practical problems in global health research, go talk to them!), an individual research proposal you develop for the entire semester on a topic of your choice (everything from initial research question to a 10+ page lit review to data analysis plans), and a group project that was a sort of \"mini\" research proposal investigating attitudes towards Obama's health care reform plans. The group project was pared down in terms of preparation (eg no lit review), but running on a timeline a few weeks ahead of your individual proposal, so you actually got to try everything as a group first before planning what you'd propose yourself. Plus, the accelerated timeline meant we actually collected, analysed, and presented our data. Our group's project included designing a survey instrument, administering it to 60+ grad students, and using quant and qualitative data analysis software to analyse the results.Work ranged from extremely minimal during initial lectures to very heavy during crunch time on final project. Your individual project - depends on how much you want to put into it, pick something you actually want to be writing proposals on for three months. A lot of work, but very rewarding.",
    "Excellent course if you would like to learn how to theoretically carry out your own research project in public health, and then do it! Kaveh is an awesome professor, always looking out for his students, and I hope Arian stays to TF the next class too--her insights into qualitative research were truly valuable. This was the first semester that this course was taught (used to be an informal gathering held on Fridays), and so there were some scheduling and logistical things to be sorted out (e.g. dates for deadlines), but these should be much more established the next time around. In terms of work load, you get out of it as much as you put in, but the work tends to be clustered around major deadlines.Do try to come in to the class with an idea about what you want to do your project on, otherwise you will have to pick fast and find out later that it was not really what you wanted to spend the entire semester thinking about.Highly recommended course!"
