    "This class is great! I came in knowing absolutely zero Persian, and now I can give a 7 minute memorized presentation, write a several page essay, and have a conversation, all in one semester. It's not too much work (as far as languages go) but you learn a ton.",
    "Absolutely take it! Beautiful language and a great professor. Prepare for an intense workload though, especially in the second half of the semester. A lot of writing! And speaking! - You will work really hard but you will feel extremely rewarded once you realize how much Persian you just learned.",
    "The teaching method of the textbook can seem really weird at first. It doesn't really make sense that they so spread out learning the alphabet instead of doing it all at once, but it comes together by the end of the semester",
    "Persian is not the most difficult language in the world, but this doesn't mean that you'll learn alot of it in this class. The class is pretty slow moving, even after the initial challenge of the new alphabet. (Granted, I am saying this as someone who has an aptitude for languages). There is a lot more focus on writing and grammar than speaking or listening. Professor Shayesteh is a decent teacher but the class structure can seem very arbitrary at times. I would pick a different language to study, unless you are absolutely set on learning Persian."
