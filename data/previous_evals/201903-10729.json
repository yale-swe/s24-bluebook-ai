    "I learned a good amount of chinese language speaking and writing.",
    "I learnt a lot of Chinese",
    "How to read and speak basic chinese. It was really fun and I felt I really improved. is amazing and always brought a positive attitude to class.",
    "I learned more about the fundamentals of Chinese, and improved my tones.",
    "I learned how to write, read, and speak Chinese. The course was wonderful with excellent exams and tests.",
    "I started the year off with no knowledge of the Chinese language or the Chinese culture. I think at the beginning of the semester, the most challenging part of learning Chinese is the pronunciation. Many letters in the pinyin are not pronounced as they are in English. It takes some getting used to. Additionally, it is hard to get the tones right. However, with help from my professor and TA, as well as from some personal effort, I started feeling more confident in around a month. By the last month of the semester, I did not have to think too hard about pinyin and tones because they came almost naturally. As pronunciation gets easier, grammar gets more difficult as we progress through the course. As a result, the difficulty level remains roughly the same from beginning to end, which I consider being a good thing. At the end of the semester, I feel like I can carry a basic conversation in Chinese with correct tones and pronunciation. I can also pick up certain words and simple sentences when I hear two Chinese people talking.",
    "By taking this course, I was able to learn hundreds of Chinese characters and words in a matter of months. I've also learned to put together sentences and my listening skills in Chinese have improved a lot.",
    "I gained an intro level knowledge of Chinese reading, writing, comprehension, and speech. I walked away with relevant Chinese phrases to use in everyday conversation."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There was a lot of time spent on this class, which allowed us to really practice the language. Tutoring every week also really helped.",
    "Youre going to understand a lot of Chinese by the end of the class.",
    "I think there should be more listening comprehension. I can't understand speakers very well.",
    "No idea for improvements. Strengths were everything!",
    "Strengths: I think by being so intensive (daily classes with quizzes, daily homework, regular oral presentations, and chapter tests), the course allows students to learn a commendable amount of the language in just one semester. It is satisfying to think about how much progress one has made. Weaknesses: While I am happy with the daily quizzes, regular oral presentations, and chapter tests, I think the homework assigned is too much. Considering how most students are taking 2-4 other courses also, it feels impossible to manage the work for them and do well in Chinese too. If I started trying to catch up on my other work, I could feel my performance in Chinese going down. Several students ended up dropping one of their other courses (myself included). Perhaps the homework from the workbook should be reduced. Another improvement would be for the class powerpoint presentations to also include the answers for the exercises (or have separate presentations with the answers). It would be helpful for students to check their answers and understanding while preparing for chapter tests alone.",
    "Although the course is intense, you are guaranteed to learn a lot and it's very rewarding to see your improvement in speaking and writing Chinese. The only weakness I can think of is because the course is very fast paced, we don't have much time to spend on a lesson, which is bad if a student finds a lesson difficult (we spend 2 days on a single lesson).",
    "This course will throw a lot of material at you but will also give you a lot of resources to make the most of what you are learning. As long as you invest a lot of time in learning and preparing each lesson, you will excel."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is very effective for introducing Chinese.",

    "Yes! I loved it and it was super engaging and fun. Especially with",
    "Yes, if they are interested in Chinese they should take this course.",
    "Absolutely. It is a great Chinese introduction.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. However, I would only recommend this course if the student feels very motivated towards studying Chinese. It is not enough to simply take level 1 Chinese. So this course leads to a multiple semester commitment. The student has to be ready to put in a little bit of effort daily over numerous semesters. Additionally, the student has to understand that since this is a 1.5 credit class (and it is a hard class), they will get fewer opportunities to explore other subjects. For example, if they wanted to take a total of 5 courses, they can only take 4.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a friend interested in learning Chinese, but I would let them know that a lot of people taking the course do have some previous experience speaking and writing Chinese so it's important to not let that discourage you as you begin to speak Chinese.",
    "Yes! If you would like to learn Chinese, this is the department and the school for it. The course is set up to facilitate student growth and the resources at your disposal will make learning the language so much easier.",
    "Yes. Ms. Wang is a fantastic teacher."
