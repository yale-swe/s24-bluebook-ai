    "The New Iraq has given me an incredible foundation on Iraq's tumultuous history and the ways in which the international community can try to bring the country back to greatness. Emma Sky is an incredible professor and gave us first hand experiences about her time as a governor of one of Iraq's provinces under the coalition government. Overall, amazing class and I definitely recommend this to anyone at Yale. Everyone needs to experience this course before they graduate, especially its relevancy to current events.",
    "Take it. Don't think twice about taking this class. It's the best class I've taken so far. Professor Sky is amazing. The workload is manageable, and so interesting that you will actually want to do it. The class is discussion-based. You get to meet people from Iraq, both civilians and high ranking officials. You also get to meet US army generals, and policy makers. You learn about very relevant, current events, and if you have any interest in the Middle East, you will love this class. There is literally nothing wrong with the class. I actually looked forward to go to it every wednesday, and the discussions we had there always continued after class.",
    "Emma is the most amazing professor I've ever had at Yale, and you should absolutely take this class. We did a project with Iraqi students, which was a great experience. I would absolutely recommend this class. There's a decent amount of reading, but it's all interesting and will help a lot with class discussions.",
    "The New Iraq is a great course. You learn about Iraq's current situation during in class discussions led by students, take on a project with Iraqi students, and most importantly, you get the chance to listen to Emma Sky's own experiences in each class. Sky is an amazing instructor. She always prompted us to think very critically about anything we hear or read in the newspapers. She conducted the seminar very well and her personal experience with Iraq takes the discussion to a completely different level. As a person who lived and worked there first hand, her experiences were invaluable to hear and she knows exactly how to integrate it during the classes. If you get in, definitely take it. Also the guest lectures are amazing.",
    "I took this class Cr\/D. That was dumb. It's so little work and I have a really hard time imagining anyone is going to get a bad grade. Emma Sky is an incredible person and a great counterbalance to the otherwise right-wing foreign policy establishment we have at Yale.",
    "Great class on Iraq since the fall of Saddam. Although the students in the class have a lot to say in general, the biggest bonus is Professor Sky, who has almost unrivaled experience in Iraq while the Coalition was there. Her insights are what made the class for sure.",
    "This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. There is no substitute for getting a policy and cultural perspective on Iraq from someone who has lived there, worked there, and loved the place. It's an honor to take this course.",
    "Awesome mix of the historical context behind the Iraq war + discussion of current developments! With the best teacher on the subject you'll ever have.",
    "Amazing! By far one of the best classes I've taken at Yale! Take it!",
    "Definitely take it!",
    "I would recommend this course. It's a great look into the recent history of Iraq, and not taught in a dry manner.",
    "Take it. Absolutely. No background in the ME required if you're willing to do the readings and keep up with current news.",
    "Interesting class with a manageable workload. If you can get in, take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course. The class gives a very rigorous overview of Iraq since the 2003 invasion, and I feel like I have a much better understanding of the political and social factors that led to Iraq's civil war and the current political situation. A really interesting class, with a very reasonable amount of work. Definitely take.",
    "I strongly recommend to anyone interested in Iraq-also middle east.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course! Professor Sky is awesome, and you get the chance to learn about a critically important country from someone with a wealth of experience in the region. Also very cool final project at the end - it was great to be able to do something other than a paper!"
