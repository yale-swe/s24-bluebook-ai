   "comments": [
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this to another student, especially if they are interested in journalistic writing. It was a lot of fun and improved my writing significantly.",
    "I would not enthusiastically recommend the course to a friend, but trying ENGL 120 wouldn't hurt if you were a freshmen and needed something introductory in writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as it helped me very much with my writing and the kind of thought processes that are involved with creating an effective essay. I believe that this is probably one of the most fun and amazing classes at Yale so I think that everyone should have the opportunity to take it!",
    "I have been pitching ENGL 120 to everyone who will listen. It is definitely a must-take class - even if you don't particularly like writing, this class is a great way to get exposed to great essays and to new ideas. It really gives you a fresh perspective on personal experience and the aspects of culture around us.",
    "You will learn different writing techniques and then learn how to implement them in your writing. I would definitely recommend the course as the skills I gained are so applicable across the spectrum of writing.",
    "A great class to improve your writing skills and create a portfolio of strong essays, only if your able to put in the amount of work to make both rounds of each essay as polished as possible before turning them in.",
    "Take it! It's a must",
    "Yes definitely it was my favorite class",
    "This is a great class. You will read wonderful essays and definitely become a stronger nonfiction writer by the end."
