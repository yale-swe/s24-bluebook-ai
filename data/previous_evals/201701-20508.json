    "Though the material taught in this course is interesting, especially towards the end of the course, Professor Geanakoplos really makes the course stand out. His real life accounts of happenings and his many stories made this course memorable.",
    "One of the most interesting classes I have taken at Yale. I learned so much and understand finance so much more now.",
    "This class was incredibly interesting. It gave me a framework to think about policies like social security and how to dynamically hedge, and just generally was the only class I've taken at Yale where I learned practical skills that I could actually use in the real world.",
    "Knowledge of how financial markets work. After this course, I feel like I could start my own hedge fund and actually make some money.",
    "A lot of financial theory and skills. Useful for finance oriented students.",
    "I think the corse gives you a very practical way of thinking about finance. Through simple examples and models the professor is able to explain how the complex world of finance operates and also how to analyze it. After taking this course I can say that I can analyze and explain how financial markets work and what are the main variables that decide the outcomes of these.",
    "This course gave an incredible fundamental understanding of the finance world and added another dimension to the jargon you hear on wall street. I now have an understanding of the major theories and doctrines behind investing and financial models used everyday.",
    "I learned a lot about the theory behind asset pricing",
    "I learnt a lot about the math and theory behind investment and hedging. This class really explores the interaction between economics and finance.",
    "Excellent intro to financial concepts (CAPM, asset pricing, fixed income) building on general equilibrium. Prof. Geanakoplos is the only professor I know of who teaches finance as a natural extension of economics, rather than a completely separate branch, and it really helped me understand what exactly bonds and options do.",
    "Key concepts in financial theory, such as computing general equilibrium (simple model, one with different states of nature), the CAPM, overlapping generations model (how to analyze social security), asset pricing, present value, a bit of game theory. Also learned how to do a lot of the pricing\/models in excel, how to use solver to find equilibrium",
    "Solid introduction to financial theory and how a hedge fund works.",
    "Basic understanding of the mathematical models that underly financial theory.",
    "Basic bond pricing, Social security, Hedging portfolios - interesting material",
    "Learned mathematical finance - equilibriums, bonds, arbitrage, hedging, etc.",
    "The ability to break financial products into mathematical problems.",
    "Basic and useful financial calculation skills such as stock\/bond\/option\/mortgage pricing, finding yield, interest rate, and zero prices...",
    "Some interesting new ways to think about financial concepts, especially the idea of Arrow prices."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Material is covered pretty quickly, so you really need to keep up on a week-by-week basis.",
    "I would definitely move more quickly at the beginning and go into more detail at the end of the course. It seemed like we missed out on a lot of interesting material because we spent too much time on the early topics.",
    "Very interesting course material. Somewhat poorly organized.",
    "At times more theoretical than seems necessary, but good learning.",
    "The course is fast paced, which means that if you fall behind it becomes hard to catch up. Apart from that I think that this is a great course that challenges you to be organized as well as to think in a quantitative and logical way.",
    "Strengths of the course are Prof. Geanakoplos, who will go out of his way to answer every question and make sure everyone understands what is going on. There was no textbook for the course so we relied entirely on the notes online. The course could be improved by improving the lecture notes, especially the ones toward the end where the explanations need to be clearer and more examples need to be added.",
    "Well organized, all topics very interesting and relevant, very good mind exercise",
    "Professor is excellebt!",
    "Professor Geanokoplos is a good lecturer and balances out the math with real life examples. The TAs are also helpful. Sometimes the math is hard and maybe a math review at the beginning would be useful.",
    "Great class. I wish we had enough time to cover leverage cycles and default as Prof. Geanakoplos originally planned. We spent the entire class building up to default, talking about how our models would dramatically change once we consider default, and then...we didn't get to cover default. I think this is because we spent a bit of each class reviewing previous material. This was very helpful, but honestly I could have reviewed by myself and asked clarifying questions in office hours. That being said, it was somewhat difficult to take advantage of office hours. Prof. Geanakoplos explains ideas really well, and even better in person, but it's hard to get a hold of him. You essentially had to make an appointment for office hours in advance. This year he had office hours Wednesday, class on Thursday, and class on Tuesday. Suppose you didn't understand Tuesday's class at all, so you spend some time thinking about it. Come Wednesday you still don't understand, but you can't go to office hours because you don't have an appointment. You'd ask him after class Thursday, except it's a pretty involved question and you don't want to keep him too long. So now you have to wait over a week, by which point the class has moved onto a new topic that builds on the concepts you didn't understand. It would be amazing if Prof. Geanakoplos allowed students to drop in without an appointment for office hours. I know he's busy and has other obligations, but maybe his secretary could send out updates the day before office hours? For example, if he holds office hours Wednesday 3-5, she can email on Tuesday night \"Prof. G has other appointments from 4-5 but feel free to drop by 3-4\".",
    "Absolutely fantastic course in my opinion; the material can be difficult or non-intuitive at times, but if you put the work in, it is nothing you can't handle. Prof. Geanakoplos is amazing - whenever someone asks him to clarify, his immediate response is \"oh I guess I didn't do it well enough the first time\" - he is ALWAYS willing to clarify and repeat something, and he emphasizes key concepts to be sure that the students understand them. Only weakness I would say is the syllabus may be a bit too ambitious -we didn't have time to cover a few of the topics, so the professor just skipped them.",
    "Comprehensive course, but sometimes lecture did not prepare for homeworks.",
    "Sections were very helpful, lectures were very confusing and disorganized",
    "Lectures sometimes difficult to follow and hard to read tiny subscripts from board, lots of typos in notes and psets.",
    "This course is fantastic, it just needs a part II that continues with mortgage backed securities and develops those further. Maybe that \"part II\" is working for a firm like Elllington, but I wish one existed at Yale! This recommendation is shared by just about every person I talked to in the class, so get on that! If you build it, people will come.",
    "Strength: the class is a very interactive lecture because Prof. Geanakoplos makes sure that everybody asks questions and he was patient with all of us. Weakness: it would be better if we have a general preview of the class before we start each class so the flow of the lecture would be more structured and people will have an accurate expectation of what they are going to learn in each lecture."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely! If you are interested in the foundation of finance, and commodities, this is a great survey course that also incorporates a deeper level of understanding.",
    "Yes, 100%. It is so interesting and John G is a great lecturer.",
    "I would recommend this course as long as you are good at keeping yourself accountable. I tend to not pay attention to lectures that are poorly-taught, and so I missed out on a lot of important material, and so the class was somewhat less enjoyable than it could have been for me.",
    "Yes! If you want to do finance.",
    "Yes! Take it.",
    "Take this if you want to truly understand the fundamentals of finance (stocks, bonds, options, CAPM model, Black & Scholes model, Sharpe ratio, portfolio analysis etc). We derive all of these things and by the end you will have a great understanding that goes beyond memorization. Don't take this course if you have never taken an econ class before or do not like doing math. Finance is all about math so you'll get sick of it if you hate it. Intro (especially interm) micro is a highly recommended prereq. Some of the calculations are straightforward but others involve some interm\/intro micro level thinking when working with equilibrium models.",
    "Yes, a must take for Econ major, also recommended for other majors",
    "Yes! I would recommend either if you are interested in economic theory or Wall Street",
    "You'll learn a lot, but be warned, the workload is very heavy. Professor Geanakoplos peppers his lectures with many interesting anecdotes from his career in finance, but his lectures can get somewhat disorganized at times. If you are lost, go to office hours and seek help! Prof G really cares about his students though! Moreover, you'll come away from the course with a much deeper appreciation of finance.",
    "yes",
    "An amazinng course with a spectacular professor. Gives you concrete tools to develop sophisticated opinions about crucial topics in Finance, as well as basic models that, with some slight tweaking, are used by investment professionals in the real world.",
    "Would recommend Credit D ing it to start with. The midterms and final are tough and confusing, and can be daunting for someone who may not come in with the math background. Also take intermediate micro before you take this, I thought the concepts I learnt in intermediate were quite useful to this course.",
    "Take this class! As a teacher, Prof. Geanakoplos is the Marvin Chun of economics. If he taught intermediate micro\/macro, so many more people would take econ for the love of it rather than the money they'd make doing investment banking.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. I'm an econ major, but I tend to lean more toward Econ\/polisci, so this class was new for me. I found it difficult at times - not because of the math, the math is all very easy - but just conceptually it was not always something I could pick up from the get go. Section and lecture was great for clearing things up, however. The Professor made sure that people who wanted to learn did, and he posted all his lecture notes online, which is extremely helpful when studying and doing psets.",
    "Great financial theory course, homeworks can be tough as lecture doesn't always prepare you, but working through the problems every week are good practice for the exams. Exams are fair. John G is a very funny and charming guy.",
    "Interesting material, but be prepared to put in time to read on your own because lectures weren't amazing",
    "Lots of math and harder than micro, but engaging if you like theory-type economics (or if going to work at a hedge fund). Psets and tests not bad, and expect a self-selecting group of smart people taking it. Worth it for the interesting material; Gean and his antics a bonus.",
    "Definitely take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone who's interested in finance because this is a good intro to finance course and gives you a solid foundation."
