    "This has been the best class I have taken at Yale so far. I learned a lot about the topic and it was very interesting. I always looked forward to the discussions we had. I was eager to do all of the readings, which there were many of, because they were well selected and very interesting. Professor Feimster is amazing! She is, by far, one of the best professors I have encountered at Yale thus far. She has a great enthusiasm in her class that is clear in discussions. She is extremely knowledgable about varying topics. Professor Feimster is also an incredible person and is very approachable. She is happy to just chat about life, and it makes a big difference coming to a school like Yale where so many professors do not maintain close relationships with students.",
    "This course is a freshman seminar that is focused on the Civil Rights Movement. It involves reading a book (biography) a week and writing two short responses each week. There are four long response papers and a final paper. I would definitely recommend the course to another student because it is very interesting and you learn the Civil Rights Movement from a very different perspective than what most people are taught in high school.",
    "Professor Feimster was great! She was really passionate about the material and incredibly engaging. I would highly recommend trying to take this course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is interesting, the readings are enjoyable and fascinating, and Prof. Feimster is just wonderful.",
    "Where do I begin? This class is incredible! Professor Feimster is incredibly warm and insightful and makes a huge effort to connect with each and every one of her students. The material itself is fascinating and forces you to consider not only the Civil Rights Movement, but also American history in a completely different light. Discussions were generally good although they could get a little superficial, especially towards the beginning of the course. I'm going to miss this class and Professor Feimster so much. Workload is very reasonable and the final paper is a lot of fun to write. We took a trip to D.C. to see the MLK memorial on Yale's dime which was also a real treat. Take this class. You won't regret it. This is one of those courses whose material you'll be thinking about for a very, very long time.",
    "This is best class I've taken at Yale so far. Feimster is a gem, and the books are engaging and fascinating. The discussions are even better. The workload isn't too heavy, and the only true assignment you have to worry about is the final paper. A overnight trip to DC didn't hurt either. TAKE THIS CLASS---it made me appreciate history in a new way, and I never loathed the reading.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class. It completely changed how I think about the civil rights movement. You learn a lot and it's a lot of fun! And Professor Feimster is amazing.",
    "YES!! Take this class. You will not regret it.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Professor Feimster is an AMAZING professor (totally engaging, helpful, and a very qualified historian) and this course will challenge your ideas about the Civil Rights Movement and the historical figures within the movement. It was the highlight of my semester and my Tuesdays and Thursdays.Because I took this course, I think I'm going to take many more history courses, and I feel more comfortable writing research papers than I ever did before. It's a great freshman seminar.",
    "An overview of the African American civil rights movement during the 20th century, centered around specific and often overlooked activists during the time period.",
    "This class is a great introduction to 20th Century African American Freedom Movements. The class somehow manages to provide the scope of a survey, while allowing for meaningful study of each topic. I recommend this class to everyone.",
    "Great class. Fascinating material--will forever change your concept of the Civil Rights and Black Power movements.",
    "YES DEFINITELY YES!",
    "YES."
