   "comments": [
    "I gained knowledge about the mechanics behind a variety of probability distributions, hypothesis testing, error rates and their relationship to power, simple and multivariable linear regression, and learned a rigorous amount of matrix algebra to analyze linear regression in matrix form, as well as analyze various estimators utilizing the MSE criterion.",
    "Econometric theory.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of Econometrics, learned about linear regression and matrix algebra as well as how to look at research papers and better comprehend their strengths and weaknesses.",
    "I have never taken Econometrics before and because of that, this class was really hard. You really need a basis in Econometrics if you want to succeed. Overall this course was also really hard because we go really in depth into a lot of topics that would honestly be served better if we did not go as in depth into them. I feel that this has been the number one source of confusion throughout this course and why we have had such a struggle getting though the material.",
    "Statistic and econometric methods",
    "Better mathematical insights into 'how' for example OLS regression works.",
    "The course helped me adopt a very analytical and rigorous approach to Econometrics. I had the opportunity to brush up on Calculus and Linear Algebra. I was also able to learn the basics of statistical testing and research techniques.",
    "proofs of econometric theory",
    "The theoretical basis behind estimators, regressions, independence of variables.",
    "- Stronger foundation in statistics and OLS",
    "I have learnt a lot of new econometric theories as well as methodologies which can be used to evaluate real world phenomenon. These include new concepts such as the Frisch Waugh Lovell Theorem. These statistical techniques can be used in econometric analysis and be used to analyze economic data. For instance, multiple regression can also be used to make predictions as well as business forecasts. These ensure better forecasting as well as empirically informed decision making. The econometric tools can also be used in scenario planning. The course is rigorous and has managed to condense a lot of ideas and coursework within a short semester.",
    "This course was challenging but it was great. The way in which we learned econometrics was difficult, but it built intuition in way that was very different than the way this topic is usually taught. Along with the various tools we used, I finally learned WHY we used them or HOW they worked. Economics is not a hard science and sometimes we forget that, but this course did a great job of evaluating why we did certain things while being frank about the pros and cons. The problem sets felt impossible at times, but they were a lot of fun to work through - and usually gave insights beyond just answering the questions (for example, the pros and cons of using mean imputation and other methods of dealing with missing data on estimates of coefficients).",
    "The ability to look behind econometric practices that we simply accept and understand the 'why' of them.",
    "Econ 558 was a great introduction to graduate level econometrics. It has helped to build a strong skill set of basic statistics, hypothesis testing and its real world applications, and linear algebra.",
    "Understood the underlying framework of regression analysis in great depth to be able to fiddle around with simple linear set-ups on my own"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I would say the only weakness of the course is the unfortunate timing regarding the introduction of matrix algebra\/matrix-modeled regression right before the final exam. This is a crucial, but for me, difficult concept to master. After reflecting on this, the course is structured in such a way so as to allow concepts to build on themselves leading up to matrix regression, so I can't advocate introducing matrix regression earlier in the course, since the fundamentals that we learn must be practiced before moving towards matrices. I also can't comment on the practicality of delaying matrix-model regression until the second semester course, so I must apologize for analyzing a perceived weakness without proposing a solution to fix it. I have every reason, given the layout of other courses from this same professor, to believe that this is in fact the best layout of the course. Ultimately, the course this semester was designed very well; the probability and statistical review was crucial. Without that, I think I would have been sunk in this course. I have enjoyed seeing the concepts build on each other, and even though my mastery is somewhat lagging, I look forward to when everything \"clicks\".",
    "Gives good theoretical background on how the econometrics can be applied to real life. Hope that we can learn how to use the softwares too (some of us didn't know before the class)",
    "The strengths of this course are the notes. A lot of times I have been confused in class by the topics that we are discussing but the notes are very clear and they help to clear up a lot of ambiguity. The weaknesses of this course is that we go far too in depth into a topic which then proceeds to confuse everyone. This leads to a lot of wasted time and us not getting though the material as fast a we should.",
    "I think the course content itself and the lecturer are a great asset. However, the way the course is structured does not foster a welcoming learning environment. First, the registrar (IDE) refused to grant me key card access to the building as \"it was too much work to alter key cards for individual students.\" This greatly affected my ability to attend TA sections because, even having the TA's phone numbers was not useful as connection in the basement is generally poor. Outside of the sections, there were few if any opportunities to obtain help on P-sets.",
    "Excellent and proper course structure",
    "Strength- The course material is highly useful. The skills that you develop during this course are very relevant for research jobs. Weakness- There is not enough time to learn everything related to Linear Algebra that the course requires.",
    "mathematical orientation to graduate level statistics\/econometrics",
    "Sometimes the emphasis of the course is too theoretical and students may benefit from more worked examples, with numbers.",
    "Strengths: - Provided strong and rigorous foundation in econometrics concepts Weaknesses: - Could have spent more time on the 'tougher' topics like power and frisch-waugh theorem",
    "The tutors are excellent and succinct. They are also very helpful and have a very good grasp of the course materials, which helped greatly in my learning. Furthermore, there are also many TA sessions available for students to clarify concepts. In addition, the theories and econometric analysis taught in the graduate classes are highly helpful for forecasting, business planning and real-world data analysis.",
    "The strength was definitely the intuition we built throughout the semester and the notes that Mike provided. I sometimes struggled to keep up in lectures but the notes were a great resource and I was usually able to clarify things by rereading the notes.",
    "The matrix algebra part runs toooooo quick. There could have been more examples or sample questions explained in class, so that we know how to use the theorem to solve problems.",
    "The later part of the course felt rushed, but overall, it was well spaced out and moderately easy to follow.",
    "The course, assignments and examinations are designed to provoke students to tap into their intuition along with what they learn in the classroom. It tackles complicated concepts very well and helps understand contemporary problems in Econometrics.",
    "I think the way the course is taught is simply amazing; I have not experienced econometrics as I have here before. I think the applied approach is a very important factor towards building my understanding towards the subject. However, I think the course went a little slow this semester - was great nevertheless!",
    "The course was very thorough in going from the basics up to more complex ideas. It would have been good if there were more material to review in powerpoint form, and more questions gone through in class."

    "No.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to those who are interested in learning econometric methods. I found this course to be very challenging and quite rigorous, but that is given my personal background and my personal strengths\/weaknesses as a student, but that should not deter students from taking this course. It is another fantastic opportunity to be challenged and to learn, and I look forward to the course next semester.",
    "Yes. This is a core module for IDE students.",
    "Yes!",
    "If you have not taken Econometrics at the undergraduate level then do not take this course. If you have and you want to challenge yourself even more, then this is the course for you!",
    "Highly unlikely. Only makes sense if you have had prior exposure to entry level econometrics as the basics are glossed over.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to students who have done courses in Linear Algebra, Calculus and Statistics before.",
    "Yes, if that students wants to have a very solid foundation for doing econometric analysis",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I will recommend this course to another student as the materials taught in this class are highly challenging and will also be highly helpful for subsequent graduate work. Furthermore, the course is intellectually challenging and will be highly helpful for decision makers who wish to turn to predictive analytics as well as data for insights.",
    "It is a challenging course, but it really does feel like a team effort. Mike is there to help and if you put in the effort, he will make sure you come out of it with a really clear understanding of the topic.",
    "Yes. If the student was interested in understanding econometrics on a deeper level, the course satisfactorily tackles it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students.",
    "Definitely! For someone doing econometrics for the first time, this course is excellent!"
