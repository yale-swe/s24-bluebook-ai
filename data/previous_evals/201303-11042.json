   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class only to a fellow student who was both fluent in Spanish and curious about Spanish lit. It moves way too quickly and is way to challenging for someone who isn't absolutely fluent and very interested in the material. But if you have both, it's a good class.",
    "SPAN 060 is a good, comprehensive introduction to Spanish literature. The way the course is set up into four sections of short stories, poetry, plays, and essays really exposes the student to diversity in literature. The readings are very good, although some of them are extremely long. Although it's a very tough class, it's a really fun and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to take an L5 Spanish course.",
    "I would recommend this class for any student interested in Spanish literary studies because of the heavy exposure to different types of Spanish writing (literature, poetry, and theater).",
    "A challenging Spanish literature class with lots of writing. Depends on the student.",
    "Only take this class if you have been exposed to Spanish literature before. If not, take another class.",
    "A nice transition back into writing, reading and speaking in Spanish if you're out of practice. You get a broad sweep of literary texts, pretty random but it's a painless way to boomerang back to your former Spanish skill levels and then advance past them into critical essay writing, conversational ease and reading (unless you skim, which is also easy to do). Workload is reasonable, discussions are alright, readings are short and interesting.If, however, you feel good about your Spanish skills and aren't just angry about being placed into L5 and having to fill a language requirement but actually want to do some solid, thematic readingin Spanish, I would suggest taking one of the higher level courses. I felt at ease and content in this class but think I may have been able to have a steep but satisfying learning curve in a regular Spanish lit class.",
    "This class requires a substantial amount of work. The readings overall are enjoyable. I would recommend this course because the discussions are quite interesting.",
    "Survey of Spanish literature; I would recommend it if the student is interested in the material.",
    "Difficult for non-native speakers. You need a very good vocabulary for the readings to be easily interpreted.",
    "SPAN 060 is a very interesting seminar that introduces students to the canon of Spanish literature. The four units include short stories, poetry, drama, and essays. It was sometimes difficult at 9:00 am to generate a lot of conversation, but Professor Harkema was able to keep the class engaged. There are many assessments in this class, and it is important to stay on top of the readings. Overall, this is a well-taught and interesting seminar for strong Spanish students (since oral communication and writing grammatically correct essays are essential aspects of the evaluations) who are interested in literature.",
    "This seminar was a survey of Spanish literature and literary studies in general. I would recommend it to students with strong conversational Spanish skills (classes are almost entirely discussion-based) who are deeply interested in literature and literary theory.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 060 if you're really interested in Spanish literature. The readings are great and it's a great introduction to Spanish literary arts in general. The class is not great as a language practice, as the vocabulary we use is not at all conversational, so I wouldn't recommend taking it just to keep up your Spanish from high school."
