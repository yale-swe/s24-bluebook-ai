   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about tectonics and the way that the Earth changes over time. This course was much more intense than the 100 level course I took and I really enjoyed the smaller class size and care by Professor Evans and Professor Brandon.",
    "I not only learned about plate tectonics itself, but also about everything that goes into acquiring that knowledge: -How do scientists create and use evidence in order to support their ideas -How do scientists deal with controversy and contradicting interpretations -How can students interact with the intimidating array and expertise of scientific knowledge that has been published; how can I think about making contributions to science",
    "I learned a little about a lot in this class, all related to tectonics. The field trip helped solidify classes learned in class.",
    "This course provides a comprehensive introduction to tectonics. We covered topics including: a basic introduction to the mantle and crust, accretionary wedges, folding, faulting, midocean ridges, subduction zones, and continental plate motion. The final project allowed for an intensive look at a single orogenic system.",
    "We learned about the basic mechanics of tranform faults, subduction zones, seafloor spreading, and isostasy. In addition, we learned how to identify and deduce meaning from rocks during a spring break field trip to Death Valley."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Evans and Professor Brandon both taught this class and did an excellent job. The material was taught very clearly and they were both always willing to pause to answer questions and make sure everyone understood the topic. There are no weaknesses other than students should be very interested in learning the material. It is an easy class to get lost in if you are not truly passionate about global tectonics.",
    "Strengths: -Topics were interesting and at an appropriately challenging level -Lecture slides were helpful, clear, illustrative Weaknesses: -Organization of topics was slightly difficult for me to follow -I could not understand anything in the textbook; I felt like I was drowning in terminology.",
    "A strength of this class is Mark and Dave! They care so much about us and about teaching, which is great. A weakness is that their lecturing styles can be unclear sometimes, especially with Mark. They're good at explaining things, but it's just hard to follow Mark's train of thought sometimes and then distill down what's most important from it. They could have stopped for questions more often, but it seemed like we were always behind schedule so we couldn't.",
    "Weaknesses: This course often ran over time. Usually, there was a tangent of some sort and we wouldn't get though all of the material for the lecture. It's unclear who the class is designed for. We would bounced from basic geologic concepts to using more advanced terms quickly. This often lead to confusion and lack of clarity. The grading system is weird and uncomfortable. The grades appear to be assigned by ranking the students. Even though it didn't lead to a competitive atmosphere, it certainly could have. It does, however, lead to a lack of confidence. Strengths: Both professors are experts in the field and provide helpful insights into geology. The tangents are often highly interesting, if long. The power points are all available and usually very clear and understandable. Each one has a little timeline for the lecture, which is helpful. The graded notes summaries are good and allowed me clarify my understanding of the material.",
    "The course gave a good overview of plate tectonics; however, sometimes lectures were a bit hard to follow. It would have helped if the lecture slides came with notes describing the core ideas behind each figure. It would also have helped if the professors had repeated the definitions of key concepts more frequently. The field trip was a great addition to the course. It really helped me understand the material discussed in class. It was amazing how willing both professors were to answer even the most basic of questions. I liked the lecture summaries (although writing them was a pain) as they really forced me to spend time reviewing the material."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I would highly recommend this course to other students. I would also suggest that students have a background on geology.",
    "Yes, I think the content is fascinating and the professors are excellent.",
    "This is a fun class, and the course material is interesting. Not much work with just weekly summaries (which are a great trade off since you don't have to take a midterm or final exam!), with a few problem sets earlier in the semester (I don't think we had more than 4 and they were all done before spring break). Mark can be unclear in his lecturing sometimes, but it's ok.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to global tectonics. The course covers all aspects of plate tectonics. The profs are excellent and the psets are helpful in covering the material. The field trip is the crown jewel of the course and allows for a great understanding of field geology. It's a great way for Yale to pay for travel to some beautiful geologic locations, this year Death Valley.",
    "Global Tectonics provides a good introduction to tectonic activities. The workload of the course is managable as a there are no midterms. If you have not taken an intro geology course you will need to spend quite a bit of time looking up basic definitions and will often feel a bit lost in the class. The material is challenging, but it is nonetheless possible to do well. The field trip is a great way to catch up on basic geology concepts. The professors are super accessible and are very willing to help. The trip was a major highlight of my spring break."
