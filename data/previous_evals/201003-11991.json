   "comments": [
    "A great class, especially if you are interested in comparative politics, how governments allocate resources, or poverty alleviating strategies in the developing world. This class is just fantastic.",
    "I found this class in the chaos of shopping period, and really enjoyed it. If you have a basic background in statistics, you'll get a lot more out of the first few weeks of the course, but it definitely is not at all necessary for getting a lot out of the course. Writing the papers really helped me solidify the material covered throughout the course. Also if you do all the core readings (on average maybe 60-80 pages a week) you'll get a lot more out of class discussion. Overall I thought this was great course though I don't think it's for everyone.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is particularly interested in development economics. Understanding welfare regimes is pretty essential in understanding development, poverty alleviation, etc. It's a lot of reading and it can be a lot to understand at first. Overall, it's a good class.",
    "I would recommend it to another student if the course actually spent more time on welfare regimes of developing countries. The course material was interesting, the discussion format was good (a true seminar!), and the course has a lot of potential to be even better. I am glad I took this seminar out of all the economics seminars. I learned a lot about the interesting principles behind welfare policy. The course spends the first half of the semester on typologies which is not what I expected. I didn't think analyzing different typology theories and discussing which typology a country's welfare policy fits were the most interesting or useful things; wish we had more emphasis on understanding and evaluating the effectiveness etc of each country's welfare regime. The focus on the welfare regimes of developing countries was very interesting, still. I especially learned a lot from doing research for the final essay which was formulating own research question by comparing the welfare regimes of any two developing countries. Professor Seekings is incredibly encouraging and nice and helpful! A great discussion leader.",
    "Yes, only if you are interested in the topic. Otherwise, it can be quite dense because there are a lot of detailed readings."
