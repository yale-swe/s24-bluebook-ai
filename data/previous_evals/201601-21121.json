   "comments": [
    "It's a great, low-impact way to explore comparative politics, which I hadn't studied before this class. The workload wasn't at all bad if you kept up with the readings.",
    "Very straightforward course. Adria Lawrence is a clear and concise person. Just three short reading responses (on anything, really), a midterm, and a final. The guest lecturers were fine. The readings were a little unnecessary, but the TFs explain the important ones in section. If you just take notes off the slides and study for the exams, you're good. Maybe a god 5th class if other papers don't conflict with the workload. Highly recommend, especially for a comparative Poli Sci credit.",
    "i would recommend this class because it is easy and introduces you to comparative studies of different international cases of governments",
    "Gut",
    "Boring",
    "Not a hard course - particularly with the generous grading scheme. Appreciated the variety of readings, and the lectures were interesting. Just the right number of essays. I actually wouldn't mind harder, more challenging exams - everything was very fair, though. A note to the wise - although you don't have to do the readings to pass, you're not going to get much out of the course if you don't.",
    "I would recommend this class to students.",
    "Straightforward and simple class. Interesting material.",
    "Pretty gutty class, good introduction to political science or international relations. Readings are not necessary as long as you pay attention in class and participate in section.",
    "I would recommend the course if the student is looking for an overview and broad intro to political science. The material was not overly difficult, the tests\/papers were fair, and the class was overall a low-key but interesting one.",
    "Definitely recommend this class, gives you really good base knowledge of things one should know for further study in political science.",
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student. I feel like the material is something that everybody should know. Professor Lawrence makes the class a good one and I think it's suited for any Yale student.",
    "Interesting, great introductory class.",
    "I would recommend it - good intro polisci class",
    "Comparative Politics was an enjoyable class that had some very interesting elements. On the whole though, many topics covered were not particularly engaging. I would probably recommend this class to another student, though an interest in the subject is very important because if he or she is not interested in political science, I don't think he or she would love it.",
    "PLSC 116 was an easy introduction to the political theories behind many of the interesting events around us.",
    "Make sure you know the readings main points, though no need to do all the reading. The tests are very fair.",
    "I would recommend PLSC 116 to other students who are looking for an easier political science class. Its not the most interesting class you'll take at Yale, but gives you a good foundation for political science as a field.",
    "I would summarize PLSC 116 01 as a great introduction to political science course. I would definitely recommend this class to another student because it is a great way to get your hands on theory in a low-stress environment.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Go to lecture and you will do well. Professor lawrence is a great lecturer and makes the material interesting and easy to understand.",
    "Great and fun class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Quintessential Yale course - teaches you to think critically in a mindset that allows you to analyze research and papers, which is a crucial skill. Adria is super receptive to student feedback and the class, despite its size, is very open to discussion. The material gets very interesting, and I would recommend to any student with an interest in state formation, wars, revolutions, etc.",
    "I would recommend this to people who want a primer into key concepts and works in political literature.",
    "Pretty straight forward political theory course",
    "Comparative Politics gives a fantastic overview of different forms of government, how they operate, and their strengths and weaknesses. Good introductory course. Would definitely recommend to someone looking for a good political science class to get your feet wet.",
    "PLSC 116 01 is an introductory course in the field of political science. The course studies government, specifically comparing democracy and authoritarianism.",
    "Looks at different political science topics by comparing states, you learn less about specific states than you do about analyzing arguments",
    "Classic gut, but interesting if you actually want a basic introduction to some political science terms.",
    "11 Need a Social Science Credit? You found it! Are you a PoliSci major, or any Humanities for that matter, and need\/want to take this course? You will not regret it! LECTURES Great summaries of the readings, which I honestly never did - even when I needed to write my responses. EXAMS Very - very - easy midterm and finals. Pay minimal attention to lecture\/section and you will be more than fine. (PAPERS) RESPONSES 3 short responses (2 pages single spaced) on any reading you \"did\". I wrote all three the night before (for less than 2 hours) and got an A in all 3. SERIOUSLY Take this. Such an easy, yet interesting class.",
    "A helpful overview of the scholarship in this field. You won't learn a lot about how to do comparative politics but you will gain familiarity with who does it and what has been done. There is a lot of memorization for exams but it's pretty straightforward in terms of how you can do well.",
    "PLSC 116 isn't a very taxing class, but I didn't feel as though it really changed me or taught me anything incredible either. Professor Lawrence knows what she's talking about and is a great lecturer, but if you're looking for a class that will give you more substance, you should keep shopping. Still, I appreciated it as a fifth class to round out my schedule. Fairly neutral about the course in general.",
    "Good course. Not very hard.",
    "I think this is a good class for anyone to take. It's not too hard, but it has a lot of interesting and relevant information.",
    "Take it! This course provided a great introduction to the field of comparative politics through a comprehensive overview of many of the prevalent subfields of research and scholarship. The concepts are applicable to a contemporary global context and are extremely useful in other fields of political science. The workload is very manageable, even if you decide to do all the readings (which I would recommend, although not absolutely necessary). The midterm and final are stress-free if you attend lecture. Professor Lawrence is an absolutely phenomenal professor and lecturer, and I would recommend this class without reservation.",
    "Good class not too much work and reading but kept a solid balance with everything we did.",
    "I would summarize this as a solid class that I would recommend to anyone interested in history, politics, or international relations who wanted to learn more."
