    "Take it, but expect to work hard!",
    "Amazing class! Heavy workload, and can be difficult as an undergrad since it is taught at a grad level (where most people have prior knowledge), but really great class. Larry and Joseph go out of their way to be available and helpful. Couldn't recommend more.",
    "About weekly psets (quite hard...take advantage of office hours), a take-home midterm (make sure to make lots of time to do this -- the effort you put in really shows), and a final project. A pretty hard elective, but you learn a lot. Recommend!",
    "Solid advanced class in semiconductors. Starts out with a nice overview, gets a bit confusing in-between, but everything comes together nicely in the end. In hindsight I felt like I learned a lot. Fairly heavy workload.",
    "Good class--can be taken with a range of backgrounds. If you are well versed in semiconductors you will do fine. Lot of hard work, graded harshly on individual pieces but grades on a curve. The class keeps it's focus--everything is directly related to understanding pv tech. If you are interested at all, take this class."
