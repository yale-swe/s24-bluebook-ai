    "Really beneficial and challenging. More discussion held by Teaching Assistant about the homework and exam could enhance the course even more.",
    "I find the subject of survival analysis very fascinating and that was why decided to take the class even though it was not my requirement.I personally have to say the class was the most challenging and convoluted one I have taken so far. It was also difficult for me to keep afloat as the course does not offer TA sessions which I found very helpful for other courses. I have spent a lot of time on my own to read, search the web to get a grip of the problems.",
    "Very useful for strengthening the theory background for survival analysis",
    "Introducing topics outside of textbook.",
    "Theoretical",
    "The slides are too simple. Hope to have slides that explain the theory more clearly. The contents of the course is too much.",
    "There were times when I felt like we jumped around from topic to topic without much cohesion. Also, I think that some of the lectures were not exactly relevant to the course and more relevant to the professor's research interests. The midterm was very difficult. I wish we had more homework assignments that were similar to questions found on the midterm, instead of questions that used SAS and didn't really relate to the theoretical nature of the course."

    "Instructor: Shuangge Ma \u00a0Professor Ma was organized and well-prepared for each lecture.However, I found it difficult to follow some of the proofs written on the board and was not able to find similar proofs or to develop a better understanding of them using the reference materials for the class."

    "Good and I will recommend it!",
    "The class offered a wide range of theoretical foundation of the survival theory and its history. This is very theoretical course and requires extensive prior knowledge of probability, inference, delta method, theory of large numbers. I would recommend the class to students who had taken a few theoretical courses prior to that and who have good mathematical\/statistical background.",
