    "It's strengths we tied to the amount of interaction involved with the course, from public speeches to student led seminars, we were able to contribute a lot to the course. It's major weakness would come from the obvious fact that we aren't given a Yale course credit, as well as some of the seminars being done more in the name of \"we have to do this,\" rather than, \"we should be doing this.\"",
    "Pros: Low course-load, super-chill instructor (CDR Lanzer), easy material given, required if you are in navy ROTC cons: Meets early in the morning (730-845), lectures can often be quite dry. Unfortunately, this is not the fault of the instructor, but of the navy-required way of teaching.",
    "This class has no weaknesses to note. This is an ROTC required class and the instructor and students recognize this, therefore the difficulty is not like other Yale classes. However, the class still pushes students who are not particularly comfortable speaking in front of groups."
