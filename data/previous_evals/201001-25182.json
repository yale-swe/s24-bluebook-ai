    "Tania is the best professor ever, just take it!",
    "YES TAKE THIS CLASS. If you are looking to learn Portuguese, there is no better way to do it.",
    "Similar to PORT 110, perhaps a little faster paced because you learn all of Portuguese grammar that's not the present, preterite or imperfect. A somewhat positive addition to the curriculum were the short stories we had to read; they made me feel like my Portuguese had actually improved so much, and it's good to feel like you're getting some legitimate insight into Brazilian and Portuguese culture. However, the class discussion of the stories was very slow and uninspiring. Basically, like all Yale courses, the quality of PORT 120 largely depends on who's in the class.",
    "Yes--good coverage; I probably learned as much of Portuguese in one year as I did in four years of high school French. Great language too--not really noticed by many, so offers a small class size that provides individual instruction in most cases, and allows for the formation of an intimate atmosphere."
