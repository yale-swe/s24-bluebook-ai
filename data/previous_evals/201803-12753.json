    "I gained a deep understanding, through systems thinking, on the major challenges that we face in water scarcity, quality and access.",
    "Really excellent interdisciplinary course on water resources from a dedicated, thoughtful professor. The course does a great job of providing managerial-level exposure to key concepts.",
    "I learned how to use a lot of online tools and resources to help me evaluate water issues. I also got background on a wide variety of water management problems. The entire class felt engaged and I feel like I gained a lot from my classmates as well as the instructor",
    "I learned a lot of information about water resource management in general that is applicable to other fields as well.",
    "I learned a lot about water management. This course covered such a broad array of topics and gave students a good foundation for understanding the challenges associated with water management, as well as potential solutions.",
    "Many! the course allowed me to gain knowledge on a great variety of topics related to water management (hydrology, infrastructure, policy, ecology, social issues). This is a very complete course that integrates content from multiple disciplines.",
    "I gained an immense amount of knowledge, skills, and insights around how to manage freshwater and tackle global water challenges. Most importantly, I think that Shimi provided a really helpful framework for thinking about tradeoffs in addressing problems like flooding, water scarcity, conflict over water, etc. This was my favorite course of the semester, and I feel like I learned the most from it!",
    "Deeper understanding of the dynamics of several water resource issues that I had been less familiar with.",
    "-I know about the best databases to get water management data -I understand the big water management issues around the world and I have been exposed to some of the solutions that are being offered to these issues",
    "I learned a lot, I'm not sure how to list the 101 terms that I studied for the final.",
    "I developed a broad understanding of water management at various levels. Im now able to speak intelligently about water efficiency metrics, steps that water scarce cities can take to mitigate their water risks, American laws that govern our water resources, and ways to measure scarcity.",
    "This class has increased my understanding of global-scale water resources-related issues. More broadly, it has enhanced my ability to think critically about large scale problems and to incorporate different perspectives when developing equitable and long term solutions.",
    "A comprehensive understanding of water management issues both nationally and abroad. Theoretical approaches were supported with concrete examples.",
    "Everything you could possibly want to know about water management globally.",
    "Broad, sweeping understanding of global water issues, including allocation, sanitation, treatment, government permitting, and scarcity. This course focuses on political and societal understandings of water.",
    "Complete overview of the freshwater system, covering both the macro-perspective (availability, supply, etc.) as well as focused topics such as agriculture use and sanitation."

   "comments": [
    "Very aligned with my expectations.",
    "This course exceeded expectations. I came in with some experience in water resources work, but was impressed at the way the course challenged my preconceived notions and broadened my perspective.",
    "Very well. I thought we covered a large amount of material with great depth, and Ive already seen how practical the knowledge is in other courses",
    "Everything I gained from this class exceeded expectations. Every lecture was really interesting and all of the assigned readings were relevant.",
    "This class generally lined up with what I expected.",
    "The course meet all my expectations. One of the best I have taken at F&ES.",
    "I had heard that Shimi was a great professor, and I wasn't disappointed! The class exceeded my expectations.",
    "They aligned well - it was turned into more of a foundational course this year under the new curriculum which I liked.",
    "It exceeded my expectations. The professor is dedicated and always makes time to answer questions, give feedback, and expose students to different materials i.e. films",
    "I thought this was just the best class for a great overview on a variety of water issues and learning how local, state and federal governments and international agencies actually track different water issues.",
    "I had heard good things about this course, but it went beyond my expectations!",
    "Exceeded expectations, excellent professor.",
    "Very well, if not better.",
    "My expectations were met, though, as a person not specializing in water, this class felt a little tangential\/maybe unnecessary if you don't plan on a career in water. The focus is on global water issues.",
    "Surpassed my expectations. I found so many aspects of the course that I can apply in non-water science settings."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strenghs are Shimi's dedication to the class, his passion to teach and make sure we understand everything. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "Again, course was great at covering a lot of material at an appropriate level of detail. This was an excellent opportunity to learn applied science, policy, economics, and political science--it felt like a thoughtful survey course that was appropriately calibrated for interdisciplinary managers. It would have been helpful to know in advance when sections would happen or not. I appreciated the visual context of movies, but wonder if those are really the best use of time--especially when viewed in non-sequential form. Some homework assignments seemed nitpicky in the science and math of concepts. The unit conversion, for example, felt more like a high school course--and we didn't cover that in class. I would have appreciated more thought questions or mini research assignments to broaden applicable knowledge or make me engage more with the material. I really appreciated how Shimi read the reading responses and thoughtfully, efficiently incorporated them into lectures. His responsiveness was amazing.",
    "I feel like the documentaries could be utilized better. I think that we could more critically assess them, and maybe rather than watching parts of them week to week we watch one in full every other week or a few times a semester in its entirety.",
    "While I loved this course, I do think that there was a lot of time and effort put in for a 3-credit class. Perhaps next year this can be a 4-credit class. I also wished the discussion sections weren't timed so late in the day.",
    "I think this course attempts to cover too much material. There is so much to learn about water management, it is difficult to do it all in one semester. I appreciate that this class gives such a good overview of water management. However, the class could perhaps cover fewer topics in greater depth. I also think this class should be 4 credits. With the field trips and weekly night sections, there is more class time for this course than others. Although the material is manageable, the class time is closer to 4 credits than 3.",
    "The book, selected readings, instructor's teaching style, movies, and field trips are among the strengths. In my opinion, the course include a lot of content on US water regulation (laws, permits, standards, legal cases) that, in my opinion, where too specific the class. Also, the work loas was heavy in comparison with other 3-credit courses.",
    "Strengths: great professor, interesting and helpful readings, great guest speakers, insightful field trips, and thought-provoking lectures. I really appreciated the wide range of water challenges that we covered. Weaknesses: the course requires a lot of time for weekly discussion groups, field trips, homework, and reading responses. I think that it's worth making it a four-credit class even without a paper, although I think that I would've enjoyed doing the paper as well.",
    "Strengths: Organization, Shimi's lectures, homework assignments Weaknesses: Sometimes we didn't get into as fruitful of a discussion as I think we could have in the sections. The films were helpful to watch but I think sometimes we needed more targeted discussion questions to get the ball rolling.",
    "WEAKNESS: The size of class. It was big. STRENGTH: the fields trips and guest speakers. STRENGTH: The film screenings STRENGTH: The way Shimi included student experiences in his lectures through the reading responses STRENGTH: The assignments that required us to explore different water management databases.",
    "I thought the homework was helpful in that it had us do small tasks that explored different water databases. The book was great. The other readings were entertaining when they were highly opinionated. Studying for the midterm and final were the most difficult parts of the course. So much ground is covered in the course it just hits you like a load of bricks at the end all the things you would need the memorize. I wish there had been more advice on re-writing notes or the lists of all the things we learned, far in advance of the final. To that end, usually I feel like homework is reserved for solidifying that information, but the homework in this class was used for a different purpose.",
    "Strengths- Shimi is a truly great teacher. He teaches in a way that you will understand and remember the content. The homeworks are interesting and involve databases that a water manager or ordinary citizen might use. No weaknesses",
    "I really liked having class time and lecture in the evening. Perhaps if certain students were assigned to lead discussions, then there would be more equity in conversation.",
    "The course is very well organized. Shimi constantly let us know where we stood in the course progression. The content was very engaging and the readings always relevant. The homework sometimes felt like busy-work.",
    "The strength is the structure and organization--I always knew how the current topic fit within the larger framework of the class. The weaknesses were (a) the same set of students that constantly took over the discussion. I think it would be better to designate discussion after the lecture. And (b) the discussion sections in the evenings didn't seem necessary and took an entire evening out of the week--which though only 1.5 hours, is a large commitment for students with full schedules. Especially, given that this is only a 3 credit course.",
    "Strength is that I walked away from the course with the sense that I could speak to almost any question that someone might ask about freshwater. Another strength is Shimi! Fantastic professor."

   "comments": [
    "Take it for sure! It is one of the best classes in FES. A great balance between natural and social sciences.",
    "Take this class even if you come in with experience in the water sector. Shimi is a fabulous teacher who excels at breaking down complicated topics into understandable (but not overly simplistic) concepts. He is a strong lecturer, dedicated, thoughtful, responsive, and deeply committed to making a good experience for his students.",
    "Take it. Its a bit of an extra time commitment, but well worth it",
    "Keep on top of the readings and know that you'll have to put in quite a bit of time for the class.",
    "This is a great class and I highly recommend it to anyone who is even remotely interested in water. Do not be dissuaded by the additional obligations (i.e. field trips, night sections). The material is completely manageable and the class was very engaging. Shimi is also an amazing professor and everyone should take a class with him.",
    "I strongly recommend this class! it is a lot of work but it worth it.",
    "Take it! It's an excellent class, and Shimi is one of the best teachers I've had a FES thus far.",
    "It's a good amount of work, but it results in foundational knowledge of various water issues, which I think is important no matter what environmental topic you want to ultimately focus on.",
    "-Do the readings and take the option to write a case study if you can. -If you can't do the readings, save them for later.",
    "Midterms and finals are a challenge! The book reading is clear and straightforward, don't skip it!",
    "Take it if youre interested in water",
    "do not audit, and take for credit",
    "You do not need to be interested in a career in solely water resources to benefit from this class. What you learn extends far beyond the water \"sphere\".",
    "Stay engaged with readings and make sure to do them. They aren't excessively demanding, but offer great amount of insight and inform much of the course.",
    "This is a fantastic class and a great introduction to water issues. There is a fair bit of time outside of regular hours required including section, weekly reading responses, small homeworks but none of it is exactly difficult, just kind of time consuming.",
    "Great class if you are interested in a broad survey of water. This is an introduction class, you won't come away with expertise. You should only take it if water is a specific interest of yours. However, if you are not a specialist, take this class, it's an important piece of the entire environmental pie."
