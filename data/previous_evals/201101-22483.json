    "Amazing class, and if it's offered again I would recommend it without hesitation. This is the kind of course you come to Yale to take.",
    "This class is amazing. The professors are both incredibly knowledgable, not only in the specific subject of the Amarna period, but in every aspect of Ancient Egypt. There is a lot of reading, but it is interesting and helpful in terms of understanding the class and doing well on the exams. The \"pop\" quizzes aren't too terrible -- if you pay attention in class and keep up with the readings you'll be fine. Also, if you go to 10 sections, you don't have to take the final, which is a BIG plus. And finally, I got to watch both The Egyptian and The Mummy in this class, which is an amazing opportunity!",
    "I LOVED this class. The combination of the sterner yet brilliant Professor Darnell combines with the fantastic and full-of-smiles lecturing of Professor Manassa. The material is fascinating, and gives you a whole new perspective on Ancient Egypt. The assignments and sections are varied and ensure that you are always up-to-date and learning stuff, while not having to break you back to do so. An absolute gem, one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Age of Akhenaton was a fantastic class that I do not regret taking in any way. It is a great introduction to Ancient Egyptian history, along with a specific survey of the Amarna period. I learned so much that I'm craving for more, and I think I'll continue taking classes on this subject. A wonderfully interactive and fun course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The subject matter is fascinating. The professors and TAs are great.",
    "Very good class, Pr Darnell and Manassa are brilliant and funny, Pr Manassa is the nicest professor at Yale",
    "This is my favorite class I have taken at Yale so far. TAKE IT! Professors Darnell and Manassa are absolutely brilliant, dynamic, and also just really cool. (For any Whovians reading this--I'm convinced that Professor Darnell is a Time Lord, and that he met Professor Manassa on a visit to the 1920s. Having a TARDIS also explains how they know so much about Ancient Egypt!) This class is an unparalleled opportunity to plunge into a rich, fascinating era and a ultimately an entire different, amazing way of seeing the world. The class is full of a wide variety of information and beautiful, intriguing concepts all soundly interpreted and synthesized from a wide range of incredibly interesting sources (art, architecture, literature, and on and on).",
    "I doubt this class will be taught next year, since the Egyptology classes seem to rotate through a two- or three-year cycle, but definitely take this class if it's offered! Or any class with Darnell and Manassa, really. They canceled the final exam on the condition that everyone had to go to every section, which is probably the best deal I've ever seen. The midterm was pretty easy, as were the few pop quizzes (if you'd gone to lecture); there were also two 5-7 page papers. In addition, the professors organized two movie showings and a trip to the Met in NYC.",
    "This is an ideal fifth course. Brilliant professors, fascinating material, easy examinations, and reading that you're never really held accountable for. Section was optional, but if you attended at least ten sections, you didn't have to take the final exam. No one in our class had to take the final exam. Sometimes I wish that this class had been slightly less of a gut, but, all the same, I probably gained more from it than I have from many non-gut classes at Yale. This is a testament to the teaching ability of professors Darnell and Manassa, who make a perfect good cop bad cop pair in guiding you through the semester."
