   "comments": [
    "It's a great introductory course, and the work is totally manageable. Great for the language requirement or if you just want to learn a language! Also, Professor Alexandrov is wonderful.",
    "It is unfortunate that you have to take 3 semesters of Spanish, being in the awkward situation of having known some spanish, but still having to take the same number of semesters as someone who is starting a new language. Despite this fact, it is a very doable class if one stays a top of their work and puts the necessary amount of effort into the class. I would recommend this class to those who are placed in it.",
    "The course is fast paced and covers a lot of material, though you will actually learn Spanish in the process. I would strongly recommend it, specifically with Professor Alexandrov.",
    "Most of you will need it for the requirement, but if at all possible, take it with Sybil Alexandrov. She is a fantastic professor, fair grader, and has a great sense of humor. You won't regret it; at the very least, shop her section, if you can.",
    "Spanish 120 is a great class. There are a lot of grammar exercises and the class is taught entirely in spanish,but It is surprisingly fun. The teachers do a pretty good job of making the syllabus diverse enough to keep the class entertaining past the repetition of grammar. I also have noticed that my spanish has markedly improved since the beginning of the term. The course is 1.5 credits and meets five times a week, so sometimes it feels like you are always doing spanish, but I did not feel like it was too overwhelming. Overall though, if you are looking to take a language course, I think this was a great one to take.",
    "If you want\/need to learn Spanish, and you either placed in here or just took l1, take this class."
