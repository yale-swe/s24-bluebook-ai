    "English 120 is a basic writing course that teaches students how to evaluate themselves, their interactions with others, and most importantly, their writing. I would recommend this course because it is a fantastic break from typical analytical writing that students often encounter in an academic setting.",
    "English 120 teaches you how to craft a non-fiction essay. You'll be asked to write about personal things as well as world issues that are important to you, and you'll be asked to be very honest in your writing. You'll need to be open to share with your classmates, strong enough to take tough criticism and willing to internalize feedback and put in a lot of time trying to improve your writing. While the reading workload is relatively light compared to most English classes, writing essays every week does demand a lot of time and energy. Of course this pays off when your writing improves every week, and when by the end of the semester, you've produced six pieces you're really proud of.I would absolutely, without hesitation, recommend this course to a fellow student. Even if you're not interested in writing and journalism like I am, it's important to develop written communication skills, and this class provides a fun atmosphere to do that because of the readings and writing assignments. Professor Oppenheimer is fantastic, but as I hear from my peers all of the English 120 teachers are amazing. Every student things his or her professor is the best.",
    "English 120 was a great course, and I believe that every Yale student should take it. It gives students the opportunity to think and write about their own life and experiences in 6 essays, which is not an opportunity that we get very often at Yale. The reading was a pleasure - who doesn't want to be required to read New Yorker articles? I imagine that the improvement in my writing will come across as I take courses that involve analytical writing and formal research papers.",
    "I would recommend the class to students prepared to earn grades lower than they are used to who really want to improve their writing by writing a lot.",
    "This wouldn't be my first choice course. There are a lot of courses at Yale that teach you to write, as well as covering a substantial amount of material. This course doesn't really cover any material. If you do take it, be sure to take it with a professor who focuses on the moves that the writer is making, rather than discussing the topic of the articles, because the articles themselves are not that interesting.On the other hand, it is a nice, relaxed seminar where you get to discuss a variety of articles and essays.",
    "The class is great but I had to accept that my improvement was more visible to me than as a reflection in my grades. You learn to approach writing in a useful, journalistic way and the readings are always interesting and fun. What you put in is what you get from the class",
    "I would absolutely recommend English 120 for all freshmen. The grading might be a bit harsh at first, but the class will make you a better writer. However, I feel that the class might not be the best for older students or advanced writers looking for a more difficult course.",
    "I was say it is creative non-fiction and not very research intensive, despite popular opinion. I would definitely recommend it based on my own experience, but I think how successful the class is depends largely on the professor teaching the course.",
    "This is a great class for students looking to improve their writing, but is probably most beneficial to someone with a background in journalism o that contributes to the YDN. Professor Oppenheimer is incredibly talented, so his feedback on your essays is always very insightful, but he is also harsh on grading and he has very high expectations of all his students in the class. The writing that he teaches definitely has a journalistic focus, so the class is best for someone looking to write in that way. There are readings for every class, but the readings are not any less or any greater than in any other class. If you are willing to put in the work and often times get lower grades, than the class is wonderful and extremely worthwhile.",
    "Yes!",
    "TAKE IT!! Especially if you can get into Oppenheimer's section. It's a lot of writing, but actually not overwhelming. There is an assignment due every other week, and a rough draft due in between. Readings are short and manageable. Oppenheimer is a tough grader but he expects students to improve over the semester (so if you get a low grade on the first paper, it doesn't mean all your grades will be low). I would definitely recommend it! You'll learn how to improve your writing, not just non-fiction but general skills that can help in other courses."
