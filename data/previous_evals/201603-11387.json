   "comments": [
    "It taught what it was supposed to teach well, but its material lends itself to being dry and uninteresting.",
    "The course is typically lecture-based, with meager class participation, excluding maybe a few students answering questions. Depending on the student, this may be considered a weakness. This could be improved through additional seminar-based lessons on various topics. There are quizzes on assigned reading almost every day, which may be a strength because all students are required to come prepared to class.",
    "A lot of content is covered in the class but at the same time it was not difficult to understand what we were being taught. However, I did wish that there was a bit more classroom discussion throughout the semester like there was a the end of the semester. While some of the topics are not conducive to discussion, some are and there was little to no discussion on those topics. As an intro course, I was interested to see more input about why midshipmen decided to join NROTC and more constructive discussion about the different warfare communities."
