   "comments": [
    "I learned a great deal about Eastern European history, which I knew almost nothing about before taking this course.",
    "Learnt about a part of history on a part of the world I knew nothing about!",
    "I gained a deeper knowledge of a zone I was not very familiar with. It was interesting to go through the post-Rome history from a new perspective, and to see how the East interacted with the West and even influenced it.",
    "I learned SO much. Some class you might learn ways of thinking more than actual material, but let me tell you the facts I now know about Eastern European history could fill a book with ease. In addition to the ideas and knowledge I learned, I also gained a lot from the forum questions we had to answer for section. It forced me to talk about consequences and cause\/effect more than I was used to. It opened up to me the idea of thinking critically about history, when before I didn't know what that meant except recognizing bias in sources. Also, I know firmly believe that people who don't understand some of Eastern European history don't understand a lot of what makes the modern age what it is. This course did an amazing job of making Eastern European history applicable to my life (mainly through overarching themes such as religion, class rights, and much later nationalism).",
    "A much better understanding of historical thinking and of the significance of nationalism, a better appreciation for Eastern Europe.",
    "A broad understanding of eastern european history to 1914, integrated with intellectual history of the 17th and 18th centuries especially.",
    "I developed an understanding of Eastern European history from c. 700-1914 as well as an understanding of political theory surrounding the nation-state and nationalism.",
    "Excellent course. AP European History entirely skipped over Eastern Europe, and really glad I was able to explore it",
    "I learned so much in this course. Although it would be impossible to try and remember every single detail that we confronted in lecture and reading, Snyder did an amazing job of imparting the idea of broader themes regarding a history that is often underrated. I've gained such a huge insight into the nuances of this region and why they are so relevant to today's society, and I'm incredibly excited to see how the national personality's we've learned about in this course will play out in its continuation next semester.",
    "An incredible knowledge of Eastern European, and frankly, world, history, as well as the ability to think thematically.",
    "I developed extensive knowledge on the history of Eastern Europe to 1914, obviously, and the skill to read through lots of work by just skimming through it. Also learned that I don't actually have to do all the readings if I attend lecture and take notes.",
    "Learned about a region and era I didn't know very much about which definitely changed my perspective on European history.",
    "This course provides a survey of Eastern European history between ~ 10 c. to 1914. Caught somewhere between a survey course and a more in depth exploration of this region, it is a thoroughly enjoyable class.",
    "Note-taking skills. Understanding of broad historical trends throughout most of CE history.",
    "All about the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and a ridiculous amount of important context and background for understanding world history at large.",
    "A general overview of Eastern European history.",
    "I learned about the development of Eastern Europe from the tribes until 1914. There was a particular focus on Christianity and Judaism, the development and fall of empires, and the rise of nation-states.",
    "Timothy Snyder is one of the best lecturers at Yale and also one of the foremost scholars on Eastern European history. His lectures are traditional (no slides, no laptops, just notes using pen and paper) and he makes the material interesting and engaging. Highly recommend.",
    "I gained not only an incredibly rich understanding of Eastern European history and the trends within it, but a greater understanding of how to think historically and of the importance of language and culture in the development of identity. I also learned about Eastern European geography, which I didn't really know anything about before.",
    "I gained the ability to commit to large amounts of reading and disseminate the information contained within it, that information being a wealth of knowledge about Eastern Europe.",
    "Aside from a solid understanding of Eastern European history, on which I had been a huge ignoramus up to this point, This course equipped me with invaluable analytical frameworks for understanding social movements and historical trends.",
    "I learned a lot about reading vast amounts of material and combining it to form interesting conclusions.",
    "Learned a lot about nation-states' formation, and how cultures asserted their differences from one another through language, religion, and political maneuvers.",
    "I gained a solid understanding of the region and history of Eastern Europe. I feel that I now understand the reasons for the numerous conflicts that have taken place in this region.",
    "I learned so much about a region of the world I had no prior knowledge of. Not only did I learn so much history, beginning with early Slavic conversions to Christianity and ending in the outbreak of World War I and the rise of the modern nation-state, but I also learned a lot of conceptual material regarding modernity and intellectual history. I'm really happy to have taken this class; it was a pleasure.",
    "I gained a lot of insights on the relationship between different events throughout Eastern Europe and how they led to history changing milestones.",
    "Learned a ton about Eastern European history prior to 1914 in an interesting and relevant way. Feel like I understand the background of a geographical area I knew nothing about before.",
    "By taking this course I gained an idea of what happened in East Central Europe before 1914 as well and many new skills of historical analysis and observation.",
    "I learned about early Eastern European history -- something I had not had a lot of knowledge about previously.",
    "general overview of Eastern European history by a great professor!",
    "Lots of knowledge, good note-taking skills, and lots of insights into historical currents",
    "I learned the most in this class out of all my classes this semester.",
    "I gained significantly more insight into the complex and interesting history of Eastern Europe and how that plays into European history as a whole. Overall a new experience for me that I really value.",
    "More knowledge of Eastern Europe.",
    "How to do close reading of historical texts, take notes, synthesize information.",
    "I learned a lot about an area of history that I knew absolutely nothing about.",
    "I thought that this class was a fairly standard history course. I don't mean that in a negative way, at all, but I felt like the skills that were tested I had had experience with before. That being said, the subject matter covered was a topic about which I knew very little going in. Learning the history of Eastern Europe was fascinating.",
    "Everything",
    "Taking this class as a freshman better prepared me for the rest of my time at Yale. In this course, I learned how to read critically a vast array of primary and secondary sources in a historical context. I also learned how to effectively tackle essay questions of vast scale efficiently and in a short amount of time, given the timed nature of our exams. Also, I obviously learned an immense amount of history. Professor Snyder does a great job of explaining the material in a narrative and accessible fashion.",
    "I gained a significant insight into the history of Eastern Europe during this course. In doing so, I also gained insights as to the current state of politics in Eastern Europe.",
    "Broad overview of development of Eastern Europe. Particular focus on Poland.",
    "Got a very comprehensive knowledge of the EE history prior to 1914. Also gained a lot of information about intellectual history and European history context",
    "I learned a lot some very interesting history and the benefits and drawbacks of states and empires.",
    "I learned so much, this class was beautiful and wonderful and Professor Snyder is a star.",
    "I gained a great foundation in Eastern European history.",
    "I had never learned the same history from several perspectives in a course, and I enjoyed seeing how they related in this class.",
    "I learned a lot about the history behind much of Eastern Europe today; political developments and arrangements, class and wealth distinctions, historical relations and the way countries were structured in a way that allowed for their development today. Fascinating course.",
    "I learned how to think historically through the lens of an incredibly important but often neglected area of the world.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about the history of Eastern Europe, especially concerning the development of states and their geopolitical interactions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The weaknesses of this course are that the assessments (3 exams) are set in a 50 minute time slot, but contain 5 IDs, a short answer, and an essay. It is impossible to complete all of these in the time window, so grades tend to be lower than they should.",
    "Lectures are very engaging but sometimes very messy and hard to follow. Professor Snyder wants to incentive people to come to lectures by not allowing laptops and only giving out physical copy handouts, but sometimes it is really difficult to hear what he is saying from the back of the class (and the classroom is always packed). Also, because some of us are hearing many of these terms and IDs for the first time, it is almost impossible for us to catch what he is saying and write it down when we have no idea what and how to spell the word even. There is also some kind of implicit assumption that some of us already know about the history a little and I find myself having to go back and level myself with everyone else.",
    "It's a great course, I really enjoyed it.",
    "This is a great survey course. The lecture is very engaging and interesting and I feel like I learned a lot. I did not think the readings were that great and I did not feel like they helped my understanding of the course as much as I would have hoped they would.",
    "This course was very well arranged. One strength was the structure of 3 midterms with no final. There is simply too much information to expect a cumulative final to be of any benefit. The midterms were incredibly fair, and I thought a very good test of the students' understanding with an emphasis on important things and not obscure facts. The one weakness of the course is I thought the material of the 3rd midterm was presented a little haphazardly, on the other hand, there is so much information from 1800-1914 in Eastern Europe, I'm not sure what I expected.",
    "Classroom was way too small. Interesting lectures.",
    "This course is absolutely amazing and a must-take. I wouldn't change anything.",
    "Professor Snyder is fantastic as a lecturer; indeed, he is engrossing and is one of the few people who can hold an entire audience captive for almost an hour with nothing but his words. However, I disliked how the readings were stressed as important to the class, but ultimately, they had almost no relevance to the exams. It is completely possible to get an A+ in this class without doing any of the readings. The readings are simply too much, too dense, and very few bother to do the readings. I think everybody, even Professor Snyder and TFs, know this issue, but choose to ignore it. This class could be much clearer if the readings were culled, because as it stands, I don't think it's right to make students buy $150+ worth of course readings when those readings are almost unnecessary to the class.",
    "Very frustrated by the paternalistic no-laptops policy because I can't handwrite fast enough to keep up with the professor, but I understand why it's done. Exams could be more evenly spaced throughout the semester (first one had more lectures than the latter two). Some readings were unnecessary, especially those that went extremely into depth on cultural developments or into specific political developments on some countries (ex the one that went into extensive detail on Jan Hus's teachings, death and the subsequent revolt in Bohemia). Otherwise, I had an excellent experience.",
    "Wonderful lectures and very helpful sections that helped condense the at times overwhelming amount of information and helped me see the most important concepts. Readings were often very long\/wordy and not useful to the scope of the class, so I would suggest some mindful editing of the course packet.",
    "Absolutely fantastic lecture with an engaging section. I love the exam format as well! It allows students to really invoke the information they've learned and deliver on it!",
    "Strengths: This course is really interesting! Weaknesses: Despite the topic(s), the lecture format probably turned a lot of people off to the course--the professor lectures really quickly, without the aid of a powerpoint\/visuals, and does not allow computers in the class, even for note-taking.",
    "The weaknesses of this class include the sheer amount of reading that is required and the over importance placed on participation in section. I found the readings to be dull at times and unnecessary, and found it most important to just pay attention in lecture since Professor Snyder sifted out all the unimportant details. Section was not helpful, in my opinion.",
    "Great class, really interesting material from the perspective of a region most of us don't know as much about as Western Europe. Lectures were great: clear, organized, and insightful. Sometimes the timeline is confusing, but it usually comes together at the end. One suggestion would be putting the handouts online for those of us that are not very organized.",
    "At times, Professor Snyder glosses over things too quickly. Names, in foreign language, especially are often particularly hard to catch. It is a lot of information about a part of the world whose history most people are not familiar with. The strength of the course lies in Professor Snyder's humor and wit in presenting the material. An improvements might come from using reading materials from fewer sources. There would be times when you would read three or four takes on the same event from different authors and it would get particularly confusing trying to keep things in order.",
    "The strengths are the lectures - Professor Snyder is a wonderful lecturer and they are always engaging. No real weaknesses.",
    "Snyder's lectures are a clear strength. I also found section very useful. Some of the readings were rambling and not useful and the reading load could be focused more to highlight core texts.",
    "All strengths. I just wanted to be able to write a paper, which wasn't a part of the class, and I thought the map quiz was comically easy. Sections felt unnecessary, and the readings, while informative, weren't on the whole very intriguing (or offered different perspectives.) Strengths: the beautiful personage of Timothy Snyder, whose evocative hand gestures, beautiful Slavic pronunciations, hilarious asides about students and tourist sites in Eastern Europe, and amazing scarves are all helpful in absorbing a great amount of history.",
    "HIST 263 is truly an excellent course. Professor Snyder is a wonderful lecturer, and the content of the lectures and of the readings was interesting. I especially appreciated the 3-midterm format; not having a final made for a much less stressful end to my semester. I will definitely be taking next semester's post-1914 course.",
    "The lectures are definitely the strongest part of the class. Section, however, is not as great. It feels like a 50 minute period in which everyone simply tries to say some tidbit that they remember in order to get a good participation grade. If there's any way to make it more analytical that might help.",
    "It would have been incredibly useful to have had a textbook as a reference source for facts since a lot of the names and dates are fairly obscure. Having a book to provide an overarching narrative and also serve as a reliable source of information would have greatly helped. I really loved how Prof. Synder gave us the key terms and outline for each lecture, which made it much easier to follow his lecture and discern what was important.",
    "The course is taught incredibly well. The lectures are informative and engaging, but not so fast-paced that I felt it was impossible to take notes. The first lecture or two was a little overwhelming, but I adjusted quickly. Snyder is entertaining and illuminating. The only real issue that I had was that the lectures, because they were generally specific to one area or topic, could make chronology confusing. Repeating dates at the end of a statement could be helpful for note taking, and he needs to write more neatly when he writes unintelligible Eastern European names on the board, but besides that, the class was incredible.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Snyder is an excellent instructor, his lectures are usually very logical, coherent and insightful; the workload was very manageable; there is no final. Weaknesses: Many important topics are only touched upon briefly and one can feel that key areas such as the Balkans or Russia are treated in a rudimentary fashion.",
    "There really weren't any weaknesses I could find with the course; the best strength was obviously Professor Snyder. Professor Snyder is an amazing lecturer and conveys massive amounts of information in an engaging way every single class.",
    "Strengths of this class were the worksheets that were handed out at the beginning of each class. This made it easy to know how to write certain complicated names and to follow along with the lecture. Weaknesses were that Professor Snyder goes very fast through topics and speaks it all without use of a power point. So, it was very easy to miss details and to get distracted. Also, not being able to use a computer made it very difficult for me who has terrible handwriting. It would be very beneficial if we could use a computer for this reason.",
    "Disparity in sections, quality of TAs",
    "The lectures are great (snippets of which I think of constantly out of class) and very inspiring. However, the approach to the history without following a uniform chronology can be stressful and took a long time to organize for me. I don't think the lectures should be changed to a chronological account just for the sake of organization, but some additional help from the professor\/TF on chronology early on in the course could have been helpful. The tests were not bad, except for the unrealistic time crunch.",
    "Snyder is an insanely good lecturer. The sections could be a little stronger.",
    "The lectures are amazing -- no qualms there. Snyder is a gem. However, I really think that the volume of the readings is unnecessary. Nobody does all the reading (it's almost impossible) and the readings are incredibly dry. This leads to section being a mish mash of students just trying to prove that they read something based on the small part they read, and it is difficult to deeply engage in the readings. It would be better to have a smaller amount (in the more recent \/ more engaging sources) and then to have the extremely detailed histories assigned as reference, i.e. if material in the lecture is unclear. This way, students could complete the reading and be on the same page, literally, for section.",
    "Amazing course! I don't think there are any weaknesses of the course and it was great. There was interesting readings, although I would recommend cutting down on the amount of reading some weeks, and Timothy Snyder was a captivating lecturer.",
    "Strengths: - generally excellent lecturing - sections were well-led - tests were very reasonable Weaknesses: - lectures could sometimes be confusing and unorganized, especially when the professor tried to cover too much in the allotted time",
    "Lectures were engaging and enjoyable, but I often felt frustrated by their lack of organization. We went off on a lot of tangents in class which, while amusing, often made it difficult to follow the arc of the lecture. I also found myself a bit frustrated by how much of our reading was from a historical atlas. Historical atlases are not the most engaging reading and I felt that a lot of our assigned reading was merely a repetition of what we had covered in lecture, but more poorly presented. I think a lot of the syllabus should be revamped because there has to be more engaging writing out there to choose from.",
    "Readings could have been a bit more interesting, and pertinent to the course. It was apparent that doing the reading was not necessary to be successful in the course. Prof Snyder's lectures though were incredible, and totally made up for any other faults.",
    "Really clear and compelling survey of Eastern European history and histeography from about 600 to 1914. Any weaknesses of this course stem from the quantity of knowledge packed into a mere semester not the structure or teaching. Really grateful to have taken this course.",
    "This was a great course, on thing that could have been developed a little more was the intersection and overlap between timelines sometimes its not clear was events in one place preceded those in another and how they are linked.",
    "Excellent course! Very engaging lectures and the right about of reading.",
    "Professor Snyder's lectures are a fantastic part of this course and are definitely a strength as he is a great lecturer. The readings and section are a weakness. The readings are often very boring and did not feel that relevant to the course. The section was not all that well run by the TA and did not add much to the course.",
    "The only weakness is that Professor Snyder could write more names on the board. I actually liked that we could not use computers, and I thought the lectures were FANTASTIC. Additionally, the tests were fair. I did not love the first guest lecturer.",
    "This is one of the greatest courses I have ever taken at Yale. Professor Snyder is amazing, and the class was always interesting and fun. The readings could sometimes be tedious, but many of the readings were incredibly interesting.",
    "Strengths: Great Professor, interesting material, and fair tests Weaknesses: Doesn't have as much writing possibilities as other courses offer",
    "I thought the content was interesting, struggled with how large the. Kass was and the amount of reading.",
    "I think Snyder's lectures are fantastic. It's a bit annoying that we can't use computers to take notes in class though, because it's sometimes hard to keep up with his pace when handwriting notes and information can get lost. I found the section TA to be really smart and attentive.",
    "Great lectures. There could be more feedback throughout the course though, especially in discussion section.",
    "I really liked how the assessments were all during the class (three midterms and no final). It was nice to finish the class before finals period.",
    "This is a very strong course. I have few, if any, recommendations on how to improve the class. Snyder is an excellent lecturer and I really enjoyed discussion sections with my TF and peers. The amount of reading assigned is just right: enough to reinforce the material in class while not serving as too much of a time-drain. The exams are quite intense, given the time restraints, but by the end of the course, I didn't mind. The material covered is vast but never feels insurmountable. The course is very well designed.",
    "Lectures were super interesting, but the tests were a little too log for the amount of time given.",
    "Lectures were the most amazing 50 minutes of my day. Section should be redone so that it does not consist of repeating what was said in the readings, but rather involve deeper thinking and analysis.",
    "Lectures sometimes didn't fit together well, but still very engaging",
    "Too much reading. It's just not realistic. That's my only complaint.",
    "Brilliant course with no major weaknesses. The only weakness is the lecture hall itself. There are more people taking this course than seats available. So each lecture 5-10 students have to sit on the floor or stand. I think it is a bit disrespectful to students because it is very hard to take notes this way. Please, make sure that the lecture hall has enough seats for both students who take this course for credit and all the people who audit it.",
    "I thought this was a great course.",
    "Professor Snyder speaks really fast and the room we were in was too small and had bad acoustics. That's really the only complaint I had.",
    "This course was amazing. As a STEM major I loved it!",
    "The lectures are excellent, and the tests are fair. The readings are semi-helpful but sometimes dry.",
    "The lectures are brilliant, and discussions in section were fine. Some of the readings were not the best and could have been eliminated. I also wish one midterm was substituted for a research paper instead.",
    "I would love to be able to use my iPad to take notes in class, but I know that will never happen. No worries, Professor Snyder's lectures are worth it!",
    "This course doesn't have many weaknesses. Professor Snyder has honed his lectures to a science, and the course as a whole is structured very well. I very much enjoyed having three different midterms instead of one cumulative final. My TA was also fantastic.",
    "Outstanding lectures, interesting readings, and fair assessments. Perhaps the only weakness was section, but this is common among all history classes I've taken. It's difficult to incorporate critical analysis of the readings with the lectures, especially given students' different levels of background knowledge (and commitment to doing the readings). I feel the best approach is to treat the readings as a more in-depth examination of the topics covered in lecture and to avoid primary source analysis, which felt rushed."

   "comments": [
    "I would. Professor Snyder is an amazing lecture, and everyone should take one \"Classical\" history lecture course while they are at Yale. I strongly recommend this one, because it will expose you to a region of the world that few every have the opportunity to study.",
    "It's a good lecture, but material might not be super engaging.",
    "Snyder is a really great lecturer and his lessons are extremely engaging. There is a lot of reading for the class and the exams are slightly challenging given that you have 50 minutes to write 5 substantial IDs, a short answer, and an essay. The class material is great, though and this is a really great opportunity to take a lecture with one of Yale's most renowned history professors. Some of the lectures were kind of scattered and illogically structured, but pretty exciting nonetheless. I wouldn't recommend this class as a fifth unless you're creditDing it, in which case this is probably a pretty good class for that given that there are ultimately few graded assignments (only 3 exams, a map quiz, and participation in section).",
    "Yes, I think a lot of people take for granted that Eastern Europe was mostly a reaction to the West. In this course, however, you learn that, in fact, Eastern Europe was very important, had its own, unique, history, and how a lot of ideas attributed to the West, were actually born in Eastern Europe.",
    "Professor Snyder is a phenomenal lecturer, I highly recommend this course.",
    "Yes, Professor Snyder is a wonderful lecturer. Even if history has never been your favorite thing, I think this class could instill a sense of the importance of Eastern Europe in your mind. It was lots of fun.",
    "Absolutely; Professor Snyder is a great lecturer, and the material is very interesting.",
    "It is tough class that deals with a ton of information quickly. No laptops are allowed.",
    "A MUST TAKE. This course is absolutely fantastic. Prof Snyder is one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale.",
    "I'd recommend this class purely for its interesting material and Professor Snyder's wry and witty comments. However, I hesitate to recommend it unequivocally because of the issue of the readings. If Professor Snyder made the readings optional or chose to integrate them more into the course, this class would feel much better organized.",
    "Amazing class. Snyder is brilliant. Lots of reading, but if you dont wan't to read, don't take a history class. There is lots of material, but the exams are exceptionally fair.",
    "Definitely, Snyder's the expert in Eastern Europe and a great lecturer. Excellent class which delves into a region that too often gets brushed over or ignored entirely (this course made me realize how limited the AP European History curriculum was). If you have poor or slow handwriting you might have a problem, because no laptops are allowed.",
    "Absolutely would recommend to any student; without a doubt one of the best history courses currently offered, with a professor who is truly a master of his field. Snyder is an amazing lecturer and helps bring a very complex (and thus dismissed) history to life. Learned so much about what is truly an incredible, provocative, and important region.",
    "A definite must take! (I'd take both halves!)",
    "You definitely need to have an interest in history; the topic is pretty niche. If you enjoy history, the topic is rewarding, especially with the little fun facts Prof. Snyder throws in here and there.",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend this course to other students. The material was pretty boring if I'm being honest, and the studying was so annoying. Memorizing all the slavic terms right before the test just to forget them later seemed really pointless and took a long time. Tests are fair if you binge study all the vocabulary terms the two days before using flash cards, and the grading is pretty fair too. Basically, you can get an A- or an A if you want to, but the studying itself was definitely not enjoyable and the material is not that interesting. There's a strong emphasis on Poland even though it seems other countries were more important in Eastern Europe. For example, Russia was not covered enough.",
    "Absolutely, if you are interested in learning about European history from a different perspective. Great lecturer and one of the most interesting classes I've taken at Yale. On the other hand, if European history doesn't interest you, avoid it for obvious reasons.",
    "Yes, definitely. Fascinating history taught in such a unique way by the one and only Timothy Snyder.",
    "This is a fascinating survey course, I definitely would take it! Workload is manageable, but you do need to stay on top of all the dates and IDs.",
    "Certainly worth taking. Snyder is one of the most brilliant professors and talented lecturers at Yale. The tests are fair, readings are manageable, and lecture is always engaging. Also a good Pre-industrial credit. If you're looking for a solid history lecture, do it.",
    "TAKE IT YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A STRAIGHT WOMAN OR GAY MAN.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Snyder is a fantastic lecturer, and the content (of lectures and readings) is fascinating. The class is fast-paced, but I really feel like I learned so much and in a comprehensive way about the history of the region.",
    "Professor Snyder's lectures are fantastic, and he achieves in what he sets out to do: give a general overview of Estern and Central European history until 1914. The workload is very manageable.",
    "Yes. There were shockingly very few history majors (at least in my section and in speaking with people) In this way, the course is fairly refreshing. While Synder is an engaging lecturer, most of the material is notthere was never a point where I was super excited about what we were learning. The format of three tests is super fair and do-ableand completely matches the material. To have the course in a different format would not have been manageable. Take the course for Synder and his brilliant lectures, not for the reading or material.",
    "If you care about Eastern European history, take it. If you think you'll be engaged just because Tim Snyder is a good lecturer, you won't be, so don't.",
    "Absolutely! Genuinely looked forward to the lectures. Amazing professor.",
    "Absolutely. The other reviews say it all, but Snyder is honestly an incredible lecturer. Not only is the subject matter intensely interesting, even when it's not (i.e. cultural history) Snyder makes it interesting and pulls it into the broader themes of the class. His lectures really helped me to think more historically, and I found myself able to relate the trends and themes that he pointed out in the context of Eastern Europe to my other courses. Also, you haven't lived until you've heard him talk about Polish Calvary lifting the siege of Vienna. You're an idiot if you don't take this class honestly. The reading is definitely worth it, and my section was generally pretty good.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The material is pretty interesting (albeit not treated in a very rigorous fashion in my opinion), Professor Snyder is a great lecturer and the workload is very manageable. I would say doing well on midterms requires at most 2-3 hours of studying the lecture notes, so this is a wonderful choice for a 5th class.",
    "I would recommend this course above all others to every Yale student. Eastern Europe is a fascinating region that is often ignored, which is a shame. From marriage politics to the nation state, Eastern Europe did it all before almost everyone else but most people don't know that because they will never study the region. The subject matter, and the fact that you will be learning from Professor Timothy Snyder (he is absolutely incredible) should be reason enough for anyone to take this class.",
    "This class is amazing. Yes, it lives up to the hype. Professor Snyder is by far the best lecturer I've had in my three semesters at Yale, utterly spell-binding in his delivery and with a great sense of humor to boot. He tells Eastern European history like a story, teasing out essential themes from the chaos of history to provide with a framework through which to understand all this history. Prof. Snyder does it so well that it's easy to miss just how complex the history we're taking actually is. Lectures were both exhilarating and stressful, the former because of how fascinating the material is (and how great Prof. Snyder is at telling a story) and how intensely you need to focus to keep up with everything (no visual aids are used and no laptops are allowed, so it's all hand-written notes). The best part is that the class teaches a lot more than just Eastern European history (though it would still be fantastic is that was all it taught, because Eastern Europe is actually a fascinating place with a fascinating history). Prof. Snyder uses Eastern Europe as a gateway to explore more general questions of nationalism, state-building, multiculturalism, etc. It's just great history, pure and simple, that shows that history is a lot more than a dry collection of facts. The tests aren't easy but doable if you study enough, while the readings were generally interesting but could be boring at times. Your workload will vary depending on which TF you end up with, because they don't all assign the same amount of work. I ended up in a more work-heavy section, but ultimately I ultimately think it was worth it because it helped me engage more deeply with the readings, which only improved my grasp of the material taught in lecture (and beyond), which helped come exam time. Take this class. It helped me fall in love with Poland, a country I knew basically nothing about going in, and that should be all the evidence you need that it's a gem.",
    "Eastern Europe to 1914 was a very interesting class with a very knowledgable professor. But, many of the early topics deal with very early history. So before you take this class, be aware that nothing contemporary happens in this course but does so in the next iteration of this class: Eastern Europe after 1914. Also, Professor Snyder does not allow computers and just talks without power points so it is easy to drift off.",
    "Snyder is fantastic and the course is incredibly interesting--much more so than I would have imagined. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "I would recommend it, but go into it with good organization and determination to follow very closely, or it is difficult to end up getting much out of it. Once you follow, though, the course is very stimulating and rewarding.",
    "Absolutely! This class is incredible! I learned so much useful information that I will be able to apply to current affairs! Timothy Snyder is possibly the best professor I have ever had!",
    "Yes, this course is amazing. The lectures are so fabulous that the class is enraptured, scribbling furiously, the entire hour. I honestly felt lucky every class that I could hear Snyder lecture: each class is very thoughtfully constructed, and Snyder is also a gifted and funny public speaker. The readings and section are a pain, but it is not necessary to complete all the readings by any means in order to get a LOT out of the class (you only need to know material from the lecture for the exams, but a lot of the social and economic history laid out in the readings is very compelling material as well, so I recommend you read that, i.e. about serfdom, the pogroms of 1881, etc). One thing that kind of sucks about the class is that it seems that the grading really varies depending on the TA: some required long reading responses on forums before each section and were rather nit-picky about their exam grading, and others only require that you post question and are much more lenient. But they all know a lot about the history and are really smart. But, you are so lucky to take a class with Snyder!!",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The information is amazing, Snyder is a captivating lecturer, and each class presents a new story that draws you in. There is a lot of information, but you really do learn it fairly easily.",
    "yes",
    "Take this class if you're interested in this region's history, want a great lecture course, or do well in a course that's based on 3 noncumulative midterms.",
    "I would definitely take this course for Professor Snyder's lectures alone. The readings are long and fairly boring, but honestly they aren't essential to doing well in the course.",
    "Absolutely. Anyone interested in studying history, especially European history, should take this class. It explores and explains East Central Europe in a way that is novel, provocative, and persuasive. This is an excellent course and I would recommend it to any student.",
    "Excellent class!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student -- the lectures are great and it is pretty easy. This is a great way to fill the Pre-industrial requirement for a history major.",
    "Very much so!",
    "Yes! Mostly because the professor is so great and well-spoken and knowledgable about the topic!",
    "100% yes Snyder's lectures are amazing, and I love the no technology rule.",
    "This is a must take course, even if you do not think you are interested in history.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Tim Snyder is the most amazing lecturer and historian and full of wit and charm. I absolutely loved every lecture and found the topics to be incredibly interesting and stimulating. This class covers a large period of time, so it is always moving. Absolutely loved this course. Take it if you are a history major or if you aren't a history major -- take this class!!",
    "Any student that has a passion for history but doesn't know much about this incredible part of the world should take this course. I have learned a lot about Western Europe in prior schooling, but this course really opened my eyes to how interesting Eastern Europe was and is.",
    "This course is excellent and everyone at Yale should take this course at some point. Timothy Snyder is a giant in his field and is an excellent lecturer as well. He loves the subject and it very clear and infectious to all who take the class. The class only has three midterms, no final, and no papers so it is very manageable. Take this class!",
    "This class was super interesting. Snyder is a great lecturer that keeps everyone listening and taking frantic notes.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course. Snyder is an expert in this area and it's a very rare opportunity to be lectured by someone this knowledgeable. The reading is a lot but I know a lot of people who got by fine skimming it, though personally I found it most helpful to do all of it.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Snyder is an INCREDIBLE lecturer. Captivating, and with a huge wealth of knowledge to draw from.",
    "Professor Snyder is a legend in his field. He is a fantastic lecturer and truly made the material come alive. There is quite a bit of reading, however, so it can be difficult to keep up with the course at times. Also, he does not post or use slides, so one must attend class in order to be up to speed on the material.",
    "YES!!!! Tim Snyder is amazing. You don't have to be a history major to take this.",
    "Favorite class at Yale so far - I'm a junior",
    "I would STRONGLY recommend this course to another student. Not only did this class provide me with a vast knowledge of Eastern European history, but it also improved greatly my critical thinking and analysis skills. This is a great class for any major, any year, and any interest. Synder makes the material fun for everyone.",
    "Yes! This class is super interesting and fun. Don't take it if you are bad at memorizing dates or if you are a slow hand notetaker (professor Snyder talks fast and does not allow computers).",
    "Yes!! This course was incredible and one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Prof. Snyder is extremely knowledgeable and his lectures are amazing. Eastern Europe is also super interesting. Highly highly recommend taking this course.",
    "Although the course was perhaps a bit too broad and didn't focus on Russia nearly as much as it should have, it was still incredibly interesting and great. Take it for Snyder and his lectures, at the very least.",
    "Yes, particularly non-history major students.",
    "EE to 1914 is absolutely wonderful. I entered the class knowing little about the region and time period and could not have asked for a better learning experience that what EE to 1914 offered. Snyder is a superb lecturer who ties material together and brings out themes like no professor I've yet had, and the no-electronics policy is extremely refreshing.",
    "If you are the tiniest bit interested in this part of the world, or simply want to see who the best lecturer at Yale is, take this course.",
    "Simply brilliant! Definitely take it if you even slightly interested in Eastern European history. This course provides a very comprehensive overview of the Eastern European history. I really appreciate that Prof. Snyder looks at events from multiple perspectives, considering global context. His lectures are plentiful and entertaining. He is the best lecturer I have ever met. Keep in mind, this is one of the most old school courses you can take at Yale. You have to go to every single lecture and take notes -- otherwise you will miss essential information. Remember, there are no slides! Exams are very fair and cover exactly what was in the lectures, on sheets and in sections. I would advice to memorise all the terms from the sheets that they give you before every lecture. And use dates where possible on the midterms -- will help your grade a lot. There is no curve and no final exam. Readings are great, but you don't have to read them all to do well on exams.",
    "If you are interested in the subject matter I would take it.",
    "PREPARE TO HAVE YOUR MIND BLOWN. Where were the first Christian states in Europe? Czech lands. Was Poland secretly democratic? Yes, sort of. Were Polish revolutionaries trying to imitate George Washington? YES. Was the Habsburg Empire actually a better protector of rights than small nationalist states? YES. The two step plan for greatness: Take this class to get rid of your misconceptions, then become a history major.",
    "Absolutely! Snyder is amazing and tells things in an incredibly interesting way!",
    "Yes, because Professor Snyder is a great lecturer.",
    "Absolutely take this course. It's a must.",
    "I would highly recommend this course based on Snyder's lectures alone. The readings may be a struggle if you're not interested in history, and studying for the tests was a little overwhelming, but if you put the work in you will come out of the class with invaluable skills for any field.",
    "Professor Snyder is an absolute legend.",
    "This is one of those class you can't leave Yale without taking. Professor Snyder is a legend. You can't use your computer in his lectures which can be unfortunate but you get so much more invested in the class by writing your notes out. The midterms are all straightforward, and they are not cumulative which is clutch. The TAs for the most part are all on top of their stuff. Definitely a well-organized class that you should take even if you aren't a history major.",
    "Absolutely: Snyder is among the very best lecturers at Yale, the material and readings are interesting, and the workload is reasonable. Also, splitting the material into three non-cumulative midterms made exams relatively stress-free."
