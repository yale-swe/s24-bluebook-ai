   "comments": [
    "Data analysis. Basic quantum optics instruments.",
    "This class taught me how to rigorously approach experimental physics in a broad range of topics, allowing both the opportunity to explore new fields and dive deeply. In addition, we learned important tenants of scientific communication and publishing through our assignments.",
    "Lab",
    "This class was a good lab preparation. I was able to learn more about writing lab reports and using Latex.",
    "The labs are interesting and you'll learn how to write up labs like actual researchers.",
    "Definitely improved my ability to do error analysis properly. This was kind of glossed over in the other lab courses, and it is a very subtle topic for most experiments. But here you got to talk it through with the professors and discuss the weaknesses and strengths of different approaches. I also developed a lot of knowledge about the particular topics my labs were related to",
    "I learned how to carry out basic lab experiments, physical and computational. I also gained experience writing longer lab reports.",
    "Phys 382L extends the rudimentary techniques of the intro lab sequence by offering longer, more in-depth experiments with more complex setups, physics, and analysis. Most of these experiments are what I would refer to as \"very cool.\"",
    "I learned a bit about critical phenomenon, some details of calculations in atomic physics, and the actual method by which a violation of Bells inequality can be shown. I gained a lot of experience with MATLAB and the front-end data processing required when building instruments from scratch.",
    "Before taking this course, I had no idea how to perform error analysis (beyond propagating expected errors and calculating percent deviation from theory). The labs we did gave me a great practical introduction to chi-squared analysis and minimization techniques. Also, I feel 100% more able to perform independent research to an acceptable level of quality."

   "comments": [
    "One of the better Yale physics courses because it feels like the professors actually came up with the course(!). I have taken a lot of physics class where the teacher just basically teaches out of the book and it is quite unsatisfying. This was pretty good. A lot of work, to be sure. The quantum optics experiments were awesome and the hand-holding was sufficient while not being excessive. I think the Ising model lab needs some more development. It is super unclear how we are supposed to get the right error bars. It seems like getting the right error bars requires going far beyond the handouts and reading a bunch of extra papers on these error bars. Submitted the first draft of the report with these chi-squared values that were extreme but there didn't feel like much I could do without going well beyond the handout and what the T.A. knew.",
    "The emphasis on clear communication and writing were extremely helpful, and gave a very good view into the academic field of experimental physics. The initial direction given for some of the assignments could be improved - particularly outdated or vague directions in the lab handout. This will definitely be improved through iteration.",
    "The experiments are the best part of this class.",
    "Some of the grading was inconsistent and most groups had to do the ising model lab which was kinda boring and not particularly enlightinging in my opinion. Otherwise the class was quite good.",
    "Many of the handouts were rather confusing. This is mitigated by the availability of professors to ask questions, but it can get confusing when you come home and actually do the writeup. The very strong point of this class is the opportunity to talk to professors, which no other physics course at yale has. As a sidenote, it is a shame all other majors have seminars, and we only have lectures.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is that students can perform famous, textbook experiments. One weakness is that the expectations are not always clear, and vary from professor to professor.",
    "Phys 382L was awesome. Learned a lot and, more importantly, got a peek at a lot of things I don't know so well. The experiments are very cool and challenging enough to require the physics background from 410\/20\/30\/40\/41. Having a longer period of time to work experiments allows more opportunity to dig into the analysis and understand the actual physics of what's happening without feeling rushed to collect data and just \"get something down.\" The gaggle of professors and TAs all around offered plenty of help whenever needed.",
    "Strengths: Broad range of experimental physics covered with options to tailor to the preferences of different students. The organization of the lab is also such that students at all levels can learn something new since the lab is really what you make of it. Weaknesses: While the open-endedness of the lab does allow interested students to dive deeply into the material, it also allows this class to consume ones life. LET ME BE VERY CLEAR, SAYING THAT YOU ARE LEAVING THE DIRECTION UP TO STUDENTS TO ALLOW THEM TO FORGE THIER OWN WAY IS AN EXCUSE FOR POOR TEACHING. Moving forward, you must: (1) create clear, reasonably attainable objectives and provide students with resources and support for how to achieve them (2) limit\/regulate the work-load on different labs and (3) standardize grading and feedback. I know yall are balking right now. So, calm the heck down and just listen to reason. If you made the lab such that there were many optional sub-objectives that students could choose from (like, here are 10 values you can calculate from the Ising Model or 10 parameters you can estimate from Rb spectroscopy, choose 3), students would have both direction and a reduction in work-load. This would also make expectations clear and the grading more transparent. I cannot possibly tell you why over half of the points removed from my assignments were removed throughout the semester. This will require work. This will require you to write a single guide book (rather than being lazy as all hell by copy and pasting a multitude of lab guide books from other people) where in students are given clear options and direction. Now, if you really want to achieve the sort of self-direction you have claimed then you can point students towards a concept (like a specific computational algorithm to improve performance) with a name and a few (FEW) selected resources (WHICH YOU HAVE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT AND FOUND THE ANSWER IN). This will enable students to do self-exploration without wasting valuable time during their semesters. Basically, this class was way way more stressful than it needed to be. At the end of the day, I think this lab has good material you just need to buckle down and actually do some of the supporting work to help students through it.",
    "The quality of each experiment is strongly dependent on how detailed the lab handout it, as well as how helpful the TAs are. Most of the difficulties we encountered would have been fixed with an updated lab handout or better guidance.",
    "In general it was really well taught!! I thought Ising could have sued more direction\/ a lot of the comments received on the final report were questions we had asked beforehand but never really received satisfactory answers for. I thought the labs were appropriately long though and we really got to explore the topics"

    "Don't need the class for grad school and just want to chill? I suppose you could do that. But if your mission as a Yale physics major is to become a real quantum physicist (not just talk the talk) and prove the Bell inequality experimentally, take it! Lamoreaux is the man. Okay, not everyone will necessarily be able to do the Bell Inequality lab, but it's pretty cool.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in pursing research in physics or any experimental field. The fundamentals taught in this class is very valuable, especially for undergrads who have not had research experience in the past.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any physics major.",
    "Take it if you're a physics major. Even if you don't have to, it's much better than the two introduction labs and it's a full credit.",
    "This is a really fun course. You only do 3 labs throughout the whole semester, so you spend a ton of time on each of them unlike 205\/206. You pick a partner in the beginning and do all three labs you are assigned with this person, so choose wisely. There is a bunch of different professors basically just walking around the rooms to answer questions, so you get a lot of time to talk to professors, which you never really do in any of the other physics courses here. Great course, would recommend",
    "If you are not a physics major and don't have to take it, then I'd say you shouldn't take PHYS382L. More likely, you're an intensive major and have to. My recommendation is that you elect labs carefully. Read up on each one before the first class meeting (you can find reading material on the Canvas server as soon as you sign up for the course) and choose labs that you will be able to devote yourself to, because you will be spending a lot of time on each experiment. My personal favorite was the Bell Inequality lab. The experiment is very clean, and the expectations are clear.",
    "Phys 382L extends the rudimentary techniques of the intro lab sequence by offering longer, more in-depth experiments with more complex setups, physics, and analysis. Most of these experiments are what I would refer to as \"very cool.\" Overall, I learned a lot and, more importantly, got a peek at a lot of things I don't know so well. Having a longer period of time to work experiments allows more opportunity to dig into the analysis and understand the actual physics of what's happening without feeling rushed to collect data and just \"get something down.\" All around great course that's worth the time and effort.",
    "Yes. I found it a nice science related WR. Some of the material I was exposed to in this lab came up in courses before and during my enrollment and thus provided a nice interconnectivity between theory and experiment in my studies.",
    "This class should probably be called PHYS 382L: Error Analysis. If you take this course, you will spend days poking holes in your experimental technique, working out the exact mechanism causing your residuals to \"act all wiggly\", and beating your head over the fact that your chi-squared values always seem to be 50 times smaller or larger than you want. When you start to hallucinate chi-squared symbols floating around your field of vision, you'll know you're doing the lab correctly. ...actually, in all seriousness, this is a phenomenal course that all physics majors should take (not just the ones who are required to do so). The sheer breadth of possible experimental topics makes the class a good fit for someone looking to specialize in any number of topics. The fact that you spend over a month on each experiment means you gain an in-depth understanding of the system you're studying, which provides a solid foundation for independent research in the same field. One piece of advice: choose experiments not just based on the topic but also on the assigned TA. When you inevitably need to ask for troubleshooting guidance, a quick theory reminder, or clarification on the (sometimes confusingly written) lab handouts, you will be much better off if your TA can convey their insights in a way that is understandable to a human being. Ben Brubaker was fantastic at this; unfortunately, I think he's graduating after this semester.",
    "I really enjoyed it! I don't know if I would recommend it to non-majors, but it's definitely the best lab course in the sequence"
