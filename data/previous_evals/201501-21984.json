   "comments": [
    "It's an intro literature course. There's a mix of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction. It's heavy on race and politics, and light on close-reading.",
    "A touch and go of most of the syllabus authors except for Moby Dick.",
    "ENGL 127 is not a difficult course. It fulfills your writing requirement, and helps you improve your writing. You are introduced to many different writing techniques that the authors and poets use, and everything ties in with everything else. ENGL 127 is definitely a good writing course to take. Every person, including STEM majors, will find this class fun!",
    "In this class, we read American texts, many of which I had not read previously. My section read more poetry than the other sections, which I really appreciated. We did a great job of analyzing Moby Dick, and I feel like I have a solid grasp on the major themes. We had three or four short response papers (~3 pages), two longer papers (~6 pages), and a super fun final assignment wherein we had to write a forgery of one of the poets we had read during the semester and then analyze our own poem to determine if it was a plausible forgery. Overall, I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "Take this class with Prof. Berger if you can! His class will focus on poems and essays rather than novels, which I really liked because I got the chance to read a wide range of styles and themes. Discussion is very relaxed and Prof. Berger is a kind grader. You won't regret this class!",
    "Overall, this is a good course for American Lit, and this section in particular tends to be rather poetry-based, which may appeal differently to different students (I personally lean towards prose, but enjoyed both in the course). The amount of writing is not too unreasonable for a WR credit (3 3-4 page papers, 2 6-7 page papers, and a 6-8 page final paper, all relatively evenly spaced out), and perhaps with the exception of Moby Dick, I did not think the readings were too excessive. The instructor did an effective job of encouraging class discussion and keeping discussions flowing, engaging, and interesting, as well as in ensuring roughly equitable discussion time and active participation amongst everyone. However, on the writing side, I felt that there were few instructions on papers (they were too open-ended), and this lack of structure could make writing difficult at times. Furthermore, while a fair amount of comments were provided on papers, they were often difficult to follow, and this combined with a rather vague grading system for papers made it difficult to gauge the instructor's expectations for written assignments. Overall, this was a good course, though I feel that those who are comfortable with English courses at Yale, with American Lit in general, and with writing poetry analysis will get the most out of it."
