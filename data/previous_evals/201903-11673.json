   "comments": [
    "I learned how to balance engagement with a subject with the demands of recording data in the moment. Moreover, I learned to think critically about language as a critical factor for emotional communication, and how language barriers exist in different forms based on cultural context and a child's upbringing.",
    "Through my work at the Yale OCD Research Clinic, I had an opportunity to have a behind the scenes look at what clinical research looks like. I have gained experience and skills in patient-doctor care, research methods and practices, and scheduling\/organizing larger projects.",
    "I learned a lot not only about my lab in particular, but how psychological research is conducted. It was such an amazing experience.",
    "I did not really learn any skills or insights by taking this course. Do not recommend.",
    "research",
    "I learned how to conduct a literature review, and I learned about the basics of conducting research.",
    "I learned how to work independently to explore my ideas and instincts as a researcher. I learned how to do this with the help and guidance of a mentor and how to maneuver within that relationship.",
    "How to work independently on a project with a graduate student and P.I.",
    "This is always a great opportunity to learn what studying psychology actually looks like. I continued to learn more about the field and how to conduct rigorous studies.",
    "I learned about my senior thesis.",
    "Working in Dr. Rutherford's lab was an incredible experience. I learned so much, specifically about working with EEG data, learning the different neural components, and learning how to interpret variability within data. She was also always willing to make time to meet with me when I had questions or just wanted to check over data. I learned how to use NetStation and began learning SPSS, which will continue next semester.",
    "I learned how to modify my research design through numerous iterations and how to apply for Institutional Review Board approval",
    "I learned about the research and study process that goes into each psychology experiment I have learned about in my psychology courses. I learned the specifics about gender related psychology which I was not very informed about prior to this position.",
    "Insight into how to compile research, analyze data, and write an empirical literature review",
    "I researched under Professor Baskin-Sommers at the MoD lab. I learned how to conduct certain aspects of experiments and manage communication with participants."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Given that this was a research course, I had to be proactive about when assignments were turned in, arranging for carpools to data sites, etc-- but I considered this a strength rather than a weakness. It cultivated my skills as a collaborator and self-advocating researcher.",
    "There was not enough work for me to do throughout the semester because the project was not going as planned.",
    "I loved everyone I worked with and really felt like I was making a difference in the lab.",
    "good course",
    "I received great feedback on the drafts of my papers, and I learned a lot about the process of research and about the field of clinical psychology.",
    "This course allows students to get first-hand experience with psychology research, which is invaluable when considering graduate school and careers. The student gains mentorship opportunities and exposure to cutting-edge questions and methods within the field.",
    "It was good for my senior thesis project.",
    "Doing Directed Research in Dr. Rutherford's lab was structured in a great way. I had weekly meetings to go over the progress of my data and to check in with the overall timeline of my project. I also gave a mid-point presentation in our weekly lab meeting, turned in a midterm report, and submitted an outline of my thesis, which I will be writing in the spring. Dr. Rutherford is a great mentor!",
    "I enjoyed the degree of time flexibility, meaning that it was nice that I wasn't required to go to the lab every time I wanted to work on my thesis. The course design is also great in that you get a lot of individual attention in discussing your project with your adviser. The course design might be improved by requiring the student to present their preliminary research design early on in the semester at a lab meeting",
    "I really enjoyed this course and did not think there were any weaknesses. It facilitated deeper learning of psychology and group discussions which I very much enjoy.",
    "Strengths: 1-on-1 attention from research advisor, hands-on research experience to complement classroom learning Weaknesses: Only worthwhile if you establish a relationship of effective communication and adequate support with your research advisor, as well as if your personal goals are aligned with the research project and its methods",
    "These research experiences depend on the lab you will be working in and your relationship with your PI. Professor Baskin-Sommers is brilliant and truly cares about her lab members. A strength of researching under Professor Baskin-Sommers is her flexibility and willingness to assign lab work that aligns with your interests."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend working with the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence to any student who is interested in child development. Getting to interact directly with subjects is critical to understanding childhood development as it is realized in real children.",
    "I would not recommend this group to work with, but I would recommend doing research to anyone interested. The people at the clinic I worked at were quite disorganized which made instructions and feedback confusing.",
    "Absolutely. If you want to get involved in a lab, this is the best way to do so.",
    "No - It was a waste of time and I didn't learn anything about research.",
    "yes",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a student who is interested in research in psychology, as it was a great introduction to the process of conducting research.",
    "Yes, if you would like to set aside the time in your schedule to work on an independent project",
    "Yes. Definitely take this if you are considering pursuing psychology academia.",
    "Yes, I would recommend to another senior writing their thesis to satisfy the senior requirement.",
    "Absolutely! It's a great way to get some individual attention on your project while also acquainting yourself with the structure of lab meetings",
    "I would, I think it was a great way to lean more about the field of psychology.",
    "Hands-on research is a great way to engage in a different kind of learning experience and to participate in a project with real-world significance. Before embarking on a research project, take time to think about the personality of your research advisorconsider whether their labs work merits your involvement and whether they will make themselves accessible to you with useful feedback throughout your research process.",
    "If you are interested in research, I highly recommend getting involved in a laboratory at Yale! There is no better way to understand the nature of research, data collection, data analysis, and study design."
