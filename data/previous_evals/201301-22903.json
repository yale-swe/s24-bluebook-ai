    "A great introduction to painting for those who have never painted before. Sometimes a bit of work, as we had a painting due each week that had to be completed outside of class. Overall, a great experience. A nice change of pace from test-taking and paper writing. Anna was awesome--super nice, helpful, knowledgable, and laid back. Learned a lot and had a lot of fun.",
    "This is a great introduction to painting! It was very beginner friendly with a good pace, and the in-class exercises all contribute to one's growing consciousness of how one views the surrounding world.",
    "I definitely recommend this class if you like painting as long as you have time to do a good job - homework is one painting a week",
    "Very nice class. If you are interested in simply dabbling with painting, I would recommend this course. Be prepared for what you signed up for though; there is a bit of outside-of-class work involved.",
    "Somewhat time-intensive class intended for practice in painting. I would not consider it a \"basic\" painting class as there is a certain skill level expected upon arrival in class. Much easier to take if you have already taken basic drawing.",
    "It is a great intro art class that allows you to explore a passion or interest in painting to any extent that you choose fit. I would highly recommend this course and I would encourage any fellow student to take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in painting, whether or not you have experience. The class is fun and useful for everyone. The workload is very reasonable.",
    "Absolutely take it. I'm an art history major, so this class counted towards my major, but if it hadn't, it still would have been worth it. Anna Betbeze is fantastic and so supportive of all skill levels. The workload is manageable with approximately one painting due every week, which took me about four hours to complete. The final painting is on canvas and understandable takes more time (5+ hours). But, at the end of the semester, you have 15+ paintings to show for it. It was so relaxing to come in twice a week and paint for two hours.",
    "Yes.",
    "yes, do it if you want a fun class that is relaxing and a nice break from the daily grind of Yale. You will pick up a new skill and meet some great people and learn to see things differently.",
    "Take it, take it! So much fun, so much painting improvement. It's really awesome. Be prepared to spend about $100 on supplies, plus the class fee. Upside is of course, you get to keep your paintings and leftover materials.",
    "A very easy introduction to the fundamentals of painting, good for someone just looking to take an easy 'elective-like' class. Fun, anyone can take it and do well. You definitely get better over the semester, no matter where you start."
