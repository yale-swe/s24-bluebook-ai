    "DRST 005 05 is a good class, but it lacks structure. The workload is quite high but very rewarding.",
    "DRST 005 is a wonderful introduction to the historical and political thought of the classical and medieval worlds. I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. For anyone interested in politics, government, or history, the class will be an engaging survey of many of the great histories of the Western canon. In addition, my class often compared political issues in the texts with contemporary political issues, which was not only interesting but also showed how relevant the works we read continue to be. Overall, I would recommend this class.",
    "I think that H & P is the weakest of the three DS courses.",
    "Like all other Directed Studies classes, History and Political thought is a lot of work. However, if one is willing to put in the time and effort, he or she will receive decent grades."
