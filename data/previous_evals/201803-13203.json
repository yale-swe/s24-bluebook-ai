    "Somatic education is relevant to healing processes and should be incorporated in therapeutic methods as much as possible.",
    "I learned somatic education and movement of the body through motion.",
    "How to teach and learn material in an incredibly engaging and interactive manner",
    "In addition to learning more about the human skeletal system, I also learned a lot about the field of somatic education- a field I'd never been exposed to before. Through this, we learned about new methods of injury prevention and new ways of thinking about the human body.",
    "I learned a lot about my own bodily awareness and about somatic educations regarding its founders and principles.",
    "I gained a different perspective on the human anatomy and medical treatment in general.",
    "Movements and many other useful pieces of information",
    "I developed a feel for the condition of my body and a general understanding of human skeletal anatomy. I also got to better my writing skills."

   "comments": [
    "The course doesn't really have a focus. This results in very vague ideas for papers and discussion questions that were only topically used. However, the professor is really nice, and you really bond with the other people in the class.",
    "Strengths: student-directed, independent learning in a cool subject. Weaknesses: too much weight on the quizzes and projects\/essays have little to do with in-class content.",
    "The course was very free flowing. The learning was not rigid which was one of its best features.",
    "The strengths were the engagement of the class in the dance studio which allowed for movement. I wish we spent more time reviewing the parts of the body in class.",
    "Strength- Very knowledgeable, easily accessible, and kind professor. Very hands-on class, each day is different and fun. Weakness- Schedule changed a lot from the original syllabus",
    "A strength is that it is always interactive. There's never a dull moment, and being a small class you get to form relationships with your classmates.",
    "It is a very hands-on course but could benefit from more written materials related to anatomy.",
    "Very good course",
    "This course is highly engaging, always changing, and never boring. There are no weaknesses to this course."

   "comments": [
    "If you want to try something you've never done before, like dance or take a class on movement, then sure.",
    "No, the course is marketed as a first-year seminar which seems special but in reality is not worth the time.",
    "The course was amazing for promoting conscious awareness of the body.",
    "I recommend this class to every first year student. It was my favorite class so far.",
    "Yes, these are the types of creative courses that make Yale stand out as a school with unique offerings",
    "I would- college is about new experiences, trying things you've never done before, getting outside your comfort zone, learning about things that don't necessarily tie in with your chosen career\/major, and in this class you'll get all of that.",
    "Yes I would. This class is great to take as an incoming first year. It gives you experience with reading responses as well as getting to learn fun material in an interactive environment.",
    "Yes, it was something different than I was used to.",
    "Absolutely professor is great",
    "I would strongly recommend this course. It is very low-demand, yet the material follows you outside of class. The material is intriguing and is easily applied."
