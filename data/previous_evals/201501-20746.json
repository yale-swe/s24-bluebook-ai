    "CHEM 565 gives an introduction to scientific glassblowing. There is no work outside of class, but you often find yourself staying late or going in on additional days to work on projects. The only way you can get better is through practice. I would recommend CHEM 565 to another student as long as they are willing to put in the time. It is quite hard! But it is definitely a lot of fun! It was a treat to take senior spring!",
    "Yes, this class is great.",
    "Great introduction to glassblowing methods. If you are going to be using a glass vacuum line or torching glassware at any point in your academic career, I would highly advice taking this class."

    "This course did not deepen my knowledge of my discipline or contribute to my research, but it was a lot of fun! It was one of the first times I took a class without any intention of applying to a wider area. I just wanted to learn a new skill!",
    "The techniques from the class can be used to make absorption cells, which would be useful.",
    "Gave me specific skills that not even my advisor necessarily was exposed to allowing me to learn techniques so that I can do minor fixes to our laboratory equipment."
