    "A MUST TAKE CLASS!",
    "This is a great lab! Barry was a great instructor: he was very clear and helpful. This is a great class to take if you enjoyed cell biology - it really illustrates the concepts that cell bio teaches.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this lab course and it is my favorite lab at Yale. I learned a lot about histology and especially like that I had the chance to study one organ for an entire semester. It is also the most hands-on course I've had at Yale and it forced me to do research, consult secondary sources, and discover things for myself. It does require additional time outside of lab, so be sure that you will have time to dedicate to it."
