    "If you have an interest in reading fantasy, sci-fi, pastoral poetry, or desert island fiction, take this class. Your writing also gets better- Tony puts incredible effort into revising your papers, to the tune of 400-word responses.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 115 02 to another student. Anthony Domestico is a great instructor and makes the material interesting and approachable for all students. Workshops focus specifically on developing the individual's style which is useful in the development stage of writing a paper. The course itself is also very diverse, exploring writing from the pastoral world to sci-fi to fantasy. If you are looking for a unique blend of the traditional with some more modern and funky materials then this is the course for you!",
    "It you are looking for a fun but challenging literature course, choose \"Other Worlds\". You will see poetry and Shakespeare like in other courses, but you also get to read a lot of science fiction. The couse does have A LOT of reading, and since there are reading responses every week, you will need to do a lot of the reading. Overall, the class is great and Professor Domestico provides great guidance, but your classmates will make or break your experience."
