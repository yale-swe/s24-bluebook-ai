    "Strengths: a great deal of leeway to explore topics of interest in the thesis; the EP&E consultants feedback was helpful. Appreciated the experience taking charge of my own research project and exposure to the practice of social science research. Weaknesses: I felt like the senior essay process could have used significantly more structure. I would have appreciated closer advising on topics in junior year itself (as I came into senior year with an unclear idea of my topic), and better advice on how to formulate questions and integrate the three fields earlier on. Taking on independent initiative definitely provided a better learning opportunity but proved to be much more stressful; better scaffolding (i.e. periodic check-ins) would be helpful. Could be better (and earlier) guidance for those doing empirical topics, as well as on how to integrate normative ethics into those types of essays.",
    "The Senior Essay had nothing but strengths. The course strikes a perfect balance between freedom to think and structure to implement. It guarantees student success at every level."

    "This is a requirement for the EP&E major, so my best advice is to start developing your topic and build your relationship with an advisor very early on (i.e. end of junior year at latest). For those doing empirical topics, the major largely leaves you on your own to figure things out, unfortunately; taking Prof. Reyes Empirical Microeconomics course in the fall is quite helpful. As a strategy, find an interesting dataset first and let your topic ultimately be developed from that (rather than the other way around). Schedule weekly meetings with your advisor and ideally have progress to report each week. This is (and ought to be) the most time-consuming academic commitment of senior year so make sure to take a light workload in addition. Overall, Id say Im satisfied with how my thesis turned out in the end, and I appreciated having initiative on me in writing this essay in retrospect, but though the whole process proved to be quite stressful and frustrating given how hands-off EP&E senior essay advising turned out to be.",
    "If you manage to find a senior thesis advisor--which you should--do take this unique opportunity to write your senior thesis independently. You will not only foster your academic independence, but also grow a close relationship with a professor."
