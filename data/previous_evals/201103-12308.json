    "Great class! Take it, its a lot of fun and not too much work.",
    "Yes -- most people have a fairly good idea of what they're getting into and get a lot out of it. Of course, it's a fair amount of work - finding interesting places to shoot and working with the digital images takes time. And art classes themselves take more class time. But overall I found this course to be only a little bit more intense than my other classes. If you're willing to put the time in, you will gain familiarity with a digital camera and with photoshop .. and maybe even become a better artist!",
    "I would recommend digital photography as Cr\/D, otherwise it can be a lot of pressure if you're not artistic and feel like you don't know what you're doing. Overall, I enjoyed it a lot (taking it Cr\/D) and definitely thought my skills improved",
    "You'll learn the basics of digital photography and develop your own artistic vision. You will definitely improve as a photographer by the end of the class, even if you think you are already pretty knowledgeable about photography. It is a decent amount of work, between shooting and printing. I would absolutely recommend the class, especially with Professor Maida, who is a fantastic professor.",
    "If you have never touched a DSLR camera before, this course is a good introduction to the medium, and you will definitely see improvement in your camerawork over the semester. It is a big time commitment, though, so be prepared to spend long hours each week shooting and editing. If you have other major commitments or priorities, then I would probably recommend taking this course at another time unless you take it Credit\/D.",
    "Definitely take it. one of the best classes at yale. You learn a ton - in an enjoyable way. you'll walk away with a new skill and hobby; i haven't put my camera down since."
