    "I developed a sound understanding of the historiographical\/ debates (objectivism, subjectivism, narrativity, etc.) I also learned some interesting facts about the state of the discipline.",
    "I gained a helpful foundation for understanding the field of history, especially its many phases, priorities, and debates. My close-reading and writing skills were also challenged in this course due to Professor Lofton's extensive feedback. It was especially helpful that all of the written course assignments worked toward our final papers, which gave time for my ideas to develop over the term, rather than having the pressure of producing something I was proud of during reading week. My one suggestion would be to make assignment descriptions more specific; I never quite knew what she was looking for, even after discussing my written assignments during office hours (although these discussions were helpful for working through my ideas re: course readings, my project, etc.).",
    "This course was an intellectual challenge! It helped me understand the role history plays in cultural consciousness and contemporary politics. It also taught me the beauty of certain histories, where I had previously seen history as cut and dry, maybe a bit stale and boring. I certainly developed critical reading skills as many of the readings operated at very high levels of thinking. The final paper was also a fun opportunity for me to apply these different historical lenses to a subject I am very interested in."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: readings and class discussions were informative and engaging. Professor was amazing. Weakness: the papers didn't seem to serve a broader purpose. I thought that they would all culminate in the end to the final paper ( or at least make it easier to write). To some extent it did, my close reading was really important, but the others weren't.",
    "The loose format of the course was both a strength and a weakness. I appreciated Professor Lofton's use of the seminar as a \"deconstructing space,\" which left open the possibility of several avenues of discussion during each meeting. However, I felt like the course would benefit with a more explicit arc. The reading selections were a definite strength; however, during some weeks, I had to really ponder their connections to other readings.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Lofton is an amazing professor and I loved listening to her speak. Sometimes, I wanted to hear even more of her thoughts. An interesting format change could be seminar discussion for the first 1.5 hours and maybe a 30 min wrap-up \/ lecture at the end (or have it in the beginning). I really liked the readings, thought it was hard for me personally to get through all of them and usually there was one that I couldn't get to. The assignments were also very interesting though I think sometimes they could be a bit clearer while still allowing the same amount of creative space that Prof. L wanted! Loved this course and I can't even grasp how much I learned from it yet."

   "comments": [
    "This course should be taken by any student in a historical field, not just religious history. Prof. Lofton leads her students to interrogate the terms and rhetorics of historiography. This course, more than any other I have taken, has inspired great rumination on what my place in this field is and what the effect of my work can be.",
    "This has been one of the best courses I have ever taken! I wish that there was a something similar that I could take after this!",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, especially students of history. I particularly think this course would make a great intro course to the history Phd program.",
    "Yes. It does not matter if you don't like history or religion, Professor Lofton's approach allows you to take from the course what you most need and\/or want. You do have to enjoy academic thinking and profound and confusing thoughts, so definitely not a course to take if you're looking for something easy!"
