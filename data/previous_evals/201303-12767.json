   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is very important course to understand physical concepts and it is strongly related to many of the research fields.",
    "A 2 part class that focuses on classical thermodynamics in part 1 and statistical in part 2. Much better than undergraduate thermodynamic courses I have taken in the past. Would recommend if pursuing a degree in chemical, environmental or mechanical engineering.",
    "The class is a thorough introduction to upper level thermo. I would only recommend the course to someone who (1) had some prior background in thermo (undergrad chemical engineering or physical chemistry thermo) and (2) had thermodynamic principles relevant to research to justify the large course load.",
    "It is a more involved approach to classical and statistical thermodynamics, a subject that I think every engineering graduate student should be proficient in. I would recommend this class to any graduate student in the engineering school that is ready to take the workload.",
    "Yes if the student os self motivated to learn.",
    "It's the first time Loewenberg has taught the course so the structure was a little free flowing. It'll only get better with time",
    "A very important topic, but the class is a lot of work. So, if this is an elective choice, you need to be sure that you really need\/want this knowledge before you sign up.",
    "I would tell a friend that the professor is very open to helping you out in office hours or any other time. I would say it is a big workload with extensive problem sets and that it will take a big time commitment. I would recommend this to a friend but not during a \"heavy semester\" As its a big time commitment.",
    "Yes. My personal experience with this course was extremely positive, and I felt like I understood thermodynamics from the ground up in this course. I would recommend it to any other student who feels like they do not have a through grounding of the fundamentals of thermodynamics."

   "comments": [
    "It was very helpful to my research field.",
    "Much of my work necessitates the understanding of thermodynamics applied to chemical systems. This class gave me the tools to build a framework for my system.",
    "Working in engineering and materials science, thermodynamics is always an important aspect. Though it is still a bit early for me to make any comments about my dissertation, I believe I will refer to the class notes and texts in the future when I have to consider the theoretical side of my work.",
    "Helped me gain confidence on algebra.",
    "Thermo is definitely beneficial . Stat mech will be too in the long run",
    "The class deepened my knowledge of thermodynamics, a crucial topic in chemical engineering. Hopefully I will get the opportunity to conduct thermodynamic analyses in the future, which would be directly applicable to this knowledge. Otherwise, it was good to get fundamental knowledge and a better understanding of thermodynamic concepts."
