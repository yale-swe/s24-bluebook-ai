    "Greek is a great class. You become very close to your classmates and Maria because it is a small and close-knit community. You'll learn about the culture as much as you learn to speak the language.",
    "I would summarize it as a great class.",
    "I would definitely recommend L2 Greek, and not just because it is mandatory. The class is fun and you will be surprised by how much of the language you know at the end of the semester.",
    "I would summarize it as a good way to learn a completely foreign language if that's what they wanted to do. It's a good way to learn something new without being completely overwhelmed by the differences from English.",
    "Greek 120 is a great continuation of MGK110. I would recommend this class as a fun and informative way to learn a language."
