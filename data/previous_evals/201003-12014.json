    "Awesome class. I learned a ton about important writers and really enjoyed it. I wish the class hadn't been at 9 am, especially on Thursday mornings when I was still drunk sometimes, but overall it's a great introduction to Foscolo, Leopardi and Manzoni and I'd highly recommend both the course and Mattia.",
    "I would recommend this course for sure! It might be one of my favorite courses at Yale. It's a small course, which allows you get to know the teacher well and really get comfortable with the material and speaking up in class. Although I was a bit hesitant about the three poets you study: Foscolo, Leopardi, and Manzoni, I have enjoyed reading all their works.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course-- it's a great survey of Italian romanticism that goes in depth to the three great Romantic authors-- Foscolo, Leopardi, and Manzoni. Take it! It's great.",
    "It depends how serious you are about Italian. If you care about literary history and Italian literature, this is the course for you.",
    "Absolutely wonderful seminar."
