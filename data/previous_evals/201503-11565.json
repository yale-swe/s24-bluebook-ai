    "It was a great experience. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to experience arts.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to other students! I was at first intimidated by the fact that we would do actual weekly art projects, but you really don't need any technical training\/skill to do well in this class. It's an amazing class with a great atmosphere.",
    "An incredible class for people of all levels of artistic experience. All that you need for this course is creativity and enthusiasm - you'll be astounded by what this class inspires you to create. Beyond even that, you'll also grow to deeply appreciate the brilliance and creativity of your classmates.",
    "The best experience",
    "",
    "Yes! A very challenging and helpful course for anyone interested in making art.",
    "Weekly art projects with different requirements that pertain to the integration of words and pictures. Definitely would recommend. Requires absolutely no prior artistic experience. Your performance in the class is based on how thoughtful you are in your work.",
    "Words and Pictures is a class you definitely should take if you want the challenge of introspection and want to be inspired from the material and other students to create meaningful work. The people in the class are extremely important in making the class enjoyable and successful (my class was smaller but the people were amazing). It helps to have some experience in art (digital or traditional). I learned about myself taking this class; don't procrastinate on the final project; this was my favorite class.",
    "Words and Pictures is a great class! We formed a cohesive, friendly class group. Make a groupme for the class so you can communicate about projects, etc.",
    "I definitely recommend this class to all freshmen. Success in the class correlates with individual effort and dedication, and each student is given great freedom with their weekly projects. Throughout these weeks, I have learned much about art and about how I could improve myself week after week. The entire class itself has been an unforgettable academic experience for me, and I believe it's a strong class to introduce any undergraduate student to Yale."
