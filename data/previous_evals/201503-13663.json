   "comments": [
    "It's very disorganized, expectations are always unclear and it's a waste of a freshman seminar.",
    "HIST 020 01 taught me more about the ancient world than I ever could have dreamed. I learned that civilizations are hopelessly dependent on water and heavily affected by climate, which carries through to this day. The lessons I learned in this class are ones that will continue to shape my worldview. I would certainly recommend this class to those interested in connecting history to the modern day.",
    "Take this class!",
    "This class is entirely dependent on your investment into it. If you do all the readings, and pay attention in class, the content will make you think. If you don't put in the effort, the class discussions will mean nothing, and the readings are essentially impossible to cram. Go hard or go home. The teachers are fantastic, don't hesitate to reach out to them and have chats outside.",
    "Lots of readings and you will probably be at least slightly confused the whole course.",
    "Very interesting class. The teaching style was a little bit disorganized, but the subject matter was fascinating.",
    "The class material was interesting and fun. I would definitely recommend this class, with the caveat to skip technical geological readings because they just confuse people.",
    "This is an incredibly interesting class, and I highly recommend you take it in particular to learn about how civilizations began, which I think is still relevant today.",
    "The course was interesting and thought provoking. I would recommend this course to any student interested in history, geology, or geopolitics.",
    "It is a lot of reading (it's only reading). The catch is, the readings are necessary. There are only three grades the whole semester which was daunting. I did learn a lot, and I'm on the fence about if i would recommend this course to another student. I would go with my gut and say no, look for a more inclusive and easier to understand course.",
    "Rivers and Civilizations is a comprehensive survey of the history and archeology of the Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations. Cultural history is supplemented with geological and climactic data that sheds light on the various ups and downs and evolutions of the people of these civilizations. I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to understand the origins of two of humanity's greatest civilizations and their connection to the natural world."
