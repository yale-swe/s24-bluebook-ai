    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class. great seminar",
    "Yes, if you are even a little bit interested in social policy or politics take this class. Professor Kahl is great, the class is not that stressful but you still learn a great deal. One of my favorite classes at Yale that really challenged my political beliefs and what I think about many social policies.",
    "Again, even if you're not a polysci major and you're not interested in public policy in general this would be a great course to introduce yourself to a particular topic that effects all of us and stirs large debates in our country. On the heels of the health care bill it would be a great class to see such a bill and other laws in the context of not just US history and culture but in an international dimension as well. It's not a particularly hard class with the topic likely stirring a lot of emotion and passion from students inside and outside of the class. Lots of mock debates which help you asa class learn together without doing all the readings by yourself. There are several writing assignments but they won't kill you and you will enjoy them as you learn a lot about the different welfare regimes. Take it!!!",
    "What a wonderfully insightful course! The readings were excellent.Class discussion lacked. However, this was not Professor Kahl's fault, but rather because there was an overpopulation of individuals who did not read the material.Professor Kahl really knows her material and is incredibly thoughtful and accessible. Two thumbs up for her!",
    "If you're going for the grade, take this course. It's incredibly easy, no one does the readings and if you're halfway intelligent you can just talk about your general intuitions for two hours a week.This class wasn't soul-crushingly boring or completely irrelevant but I do think it falls short of its potential. Professor Kahl is amazing and super nice but she really needs to push her students more\/set higher expectations for them in order to motivate the class to actually do the readings and participate in section. Also, I felt that the course didn't have a tremendous amount of structure. We would just sort of show up and talk about things that were tangentially related to the readings.The group presentations were the only truly terrible portion of this course. Not only do they force you to work with people who do not pull their weight on assignments but they were boring, too long, and covered useless statistics that were never mentioned again in the class. If these are axed and if Professor Kahl sets her expectations a bit higher, this could be an amazing course. As it is, it's a pretty easy A that provides you a decent opportunity to gain a cursory understanding of some of the literature surrounding welfare policy.",
    "I recommend it. The subject is of course an interesting one and I think the course does enough in terms of both breadth and depth to do justice to the topic. Professor Kahl is nice and helpful but also fairly knowledgeable, especially about the European states.Course requirements are actually really easy for a Poli Sci seminar. One group presentation and two short papers (she doesn't believe in papers longer than five pages) based pretty much entirely on the reading on the syllabus. Reading load is very reasonable and compared to other Poli Sci classes, the reading isn't too dry.Fun, interesting, and worthwhile without being stressful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in welfare policies. It wasn't too much work - the weekly readings were interesting and there were two short papers and no final. A lot of emphasis was placed on discussion in class. This was a very comprehensive and interesting course, though it was very Euro-US centric so the \"across nations\" title of the course is a bit of an exaggeration.",
    "This class was a wonderful surprise for me. I learned so much and the information challenged me to reflect on my views. The topics were also so relevant to issues today. Prof Kahl is very kind and the way she uses lists and diagrams on the board is very helpful. Yes, it's not a ton of work but don't leave it at that-- do the reading and participate and you'll have a very rewarding experience.",
    "I would cautiously recommend this class. If you are interested in welfare states--what they should look like, the theory behind the various types etc--then you will probably enjoy this class. There isn't very much work (nearly 1\/3 of the grade was determined by a 10 minute group presentation) and Professor Kahl knows her stuff. Be sure to shop it and see who will be in the class, though, as with any seminar, if a substantial proportion of the other participants are not committed to the course, it makes class discussions difficult."
