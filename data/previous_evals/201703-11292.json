    "I learned a lot about women's and men's fashion throughout history. This course also acknowledged feminist, race, and gender issues that tied into the reading.",
    "I learned about the material of the course (obviously) to a certain extent. I also think I became a better writer, not due to the Professor Conekin's direct input, but her harsh grading and criticisms of my papers.",
    "I learned how to approach research papers. I also learned how to read assignments critically. I also learned a lot about the relationship between fashion and women's rights.",
    "Essay format skills along with primary source research",
    "Analysis of fashion, historic and contemporary.",
    "I learned much more about the history and development fashion industry, which I am very interested in. I also learned more about writing history papers, as I did not have much experience writing them before.",
    "Writing skills improved immensely throughout the course and public speaking as well."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: interesting readings, class meets for roughly one hour twice a week, enjoyable conversations that tie into present day fashion.",
    "While the material was interesting, I think a weakness of the course was the reliance on Homework as the only material we learned.",
    "I think that we could have taken more trips as a class to learn about fashion as a whole. We talked (in class) about fashion shows continuously, but there was never a chance to go to the city or even a local show, despite them happening during the semester. Most of the students in the class agreed that we would be willing to give up a Saturday to go into the city, but no plan ever came to fruition. Additionally, the class (after the first week), was lead by the students who did presentations on the reading assigned for class. This lead to many students not doing the reading, and not paying attention to the speaker. I'm not sure how this could be changed, but the class functioned well when it was almost purely discussion-based, not lead by one student who gave a presentation.",
    "The writing assignments were a great introduction into college level writing. The information was super interesting as well expecially for people interested in fashion and women's issues. However you got out of the class what you put in which might not be what everyone is looking for.",
    "The syllabus of the course is very interesting and has a lot of potential. The readings are engaging, and the session with the guest speaker was exciting (more of this!), but the professor did not teach her own course. The course was taught by her students through class presentations, with no guidelines on what is expected of class discussions and very vague feedback on papers.",
    "The course was very discussion based, and I was very satisfied because I believe that discussion allows for the most variety of opinion and I learn best through it. I don't think this course had any weaknesses. The assigned work kept students immersed in class discussion and more prepared to contribute to it as well."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student because the course was not time consuming, and very fun and interesting. The class was mostly student run. Each day a student would give a presentation which was a unique way for learning which is more enjoyable than a boring lecture.",
    "Yeah, the course is interesting, and the friends that I've made through the course are some of my closest friends now. I don't regret taking the course, I just wish it had been taught and directed slightly differently.",
    "I would definitely recommend it as a great writing credit if you are interesting in the subject. However if you are not interested in fashion, do not take this class.",
    "For students who have a genuine interest in fashion, yes. The readings will stimulate thought, the professor, less so.",
    "One hundred percent. It is very interesting and the professor is cool.",
    "Definitely!"
