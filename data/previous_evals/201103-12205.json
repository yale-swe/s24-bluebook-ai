   "comments": [
    "This class is very interesting and not too demanding. It is a great class to take if you're looking for one to finish off your schedule for the semester. I would recommend it.",
    "I thought it was a great class to see what the major is about. I'd recommend it.",
    "Strengths: Two knowledgeable professorswho contribute different perspectives to similar topics, big-picture look at the co-development of health and media, interesting guest speakers!, and a very low workload.Weaknesses: It's not always clear what the important things are in the lecture because it moves so fast, so going to section is really important. Very large class so consistent TF quality might be a concern, but my TF was great.Overall, I definitely recommend this course. Great humanities option for premeds. Weekly reading responses of 150 words or less, an essay-style midterm, a 7-page paper on anything, and an essay-style final. I rarely did the readings and I'm doing awesome. Very interesting material, do take.",
    "I would recommend this class as a fifth class or maybe a class you take credit\/D\/fail. I never really thought about the class other than on lecture day and during section. You only have to skim the readings before section to be able to discuss them in section, so the workload is ridiculously light.",
    "The work for this class is almost exclusively reading so it is important to have some interest in the history of medicine. It can be a gut as if you skim the readings, but your TA will love you if you actually read everything. Overall, it is not a stressful class and is especially good if your other classes require doing problem sets.",
    "Broad overview of the history of medicine in the US in the past century and a half, course literature taken from articles and reports written about incidences and issues throughout time.",
    "Interesting reading material and an opportunity to write a pretty cool paper. However, yeah, this class is a gut. I did the reading and went to section, but only went to about 5 lectures and managed an A on the midterm. The paper is fun and can be about any topic that interests you. If you're really into the topic, take this and you can probably get as much out of it as you put into it. If you're only mildly interested\/need a distributional credit, you should still take it. But read the coursepack online, it's ridiculously expensive.",
    "I would recommend this as a class for anyone interested in health and food policy. It is very relevant today, as food and health industries have become a hot topic. The work load is quite manageable and the lectures consist of mostly analyzation of ads and movie clips, which is lots of fun.",
    "Great course about some really fascinating issues in history of medicine. Definitely take it!! This will change the way you watch tv, see commercials, and read the news.",
    "It's a good class to take if you're looking for a humanities class, especially if you're pre-med (and even if you're not, it's still interesting).",
    "Easy humanities credit for premed students.",
    "Painless Hu credit. Not amazing, but potentially engaging depending on your TF.",
    "I would recommend the course, it was a great HSHM course and it covers topics that are relevant to any student.",
    "Take this class. Now! It's really interesting, really fun, really useful. The grading is not terribly difficult, the readings are not terribly long, and the material is fascinating. You get to watch a lot of old, funny, appalling video clips. You'll actually have to do the readings, but you'll want to do the readings. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale!",
    "Yes but some lectures can be dry.",
    "Midterm, 7 page essay, and a final. Grading really depends on your TA. Definitely a gut course, but some of the material is pretty interesting if you care about the impact media has on public perception of the medicine.",
    "Yes! The material is quite interesting and the class isn't too hard. Watch out for the midterm though \u0097 it's graded a bit tougher than expected.",
    "Yes I would recommend the course to another student. It's a great class to get some history on medicine and how the media has played a part in it.",
    "A really good class. Not very difficult. There are a lot of readings but they are all really interesting. The mid term and final were both not very difficult.",
    "I would recommend HSHM 202, but make sure you get a good TA. The class is entirely TA-dependent, everything that you do for that class is graded by the same person, so be sure to get a good one \/ easy grader.",
    "OH MY GOD TAKE THIS CLASS. One of my favorite classes at Yale. The material is really interesting (if you're interested in science and medicine). I can't remember a lecture, section, or reading where I felt myself becoming bored. The class isn't a huge amount of work either.",
    "A really fun history of medicine course, perfect for both science and non-science majors.",
    "Take this course!",
    "Absolutely. If you have any interest in history, medicine, or the role of the press, it is a must!",
    "The topics covered are very interesting, but the class does seem to be a bit disorganized. It is hard to tie all of the topics together. Overall, I would recommend it, though. It was a very interesting subject.",
    "You are a fool not to take this course. As a senior it makes me sad that I only have one semester remaining to take HSHM classes...really. The professors are fascinating, section discussions are lively (depending on section leader, ofcourse). The only downside is that the course attempts to be both chronological and thematic in it's organization--which is confusing until you come to the end, then the light bulb switches on and you have an \"I get it\" moment. Enjoy.",
    "YES TAKE IT",
    "Yes this was a really interesting course and relevant to today's society. It wasn't too much work (reading responses for section each week, a midterm, final, and 7 page paper).",
    "Definitely take this course! It's really fun.",
    "I took this class to get a Humanities credit. It was a pretty good class. The topics covered are all quite interesting. You should definitely look at the syllabus and see if the material interests you. That being said, contrary to what the syllabus says, the READING IS NOT LIGHT. It is a LOT of reading (as evidenced by the massive course packet, which you don't have to buy because all of the readings are online. But some people did). Granted, you don't have to do all of it, I didn't read most of it. You can do fine in the class with reading only some of the articles and going to lecture. Pretty generous grading, and it seems like most people get B+ or A-.",
    "Yes, it is very interest to see just how much media has changed people's perception of health in the past century. Course load is not too much, pretty manageable.",
    "Great course, the material is really interesting and interspersed with lots of cool videos and clips so it never gets boring. Both professors are really nice and the midterm and final are really doable.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to other people! John and Gretchen were both amazing lecturers! All of the material was extremely interesting as well. The workload was fairly light. Weekly responses, midterm, 7 page paper, and final. Not stressful at all and I really enjoyed the lectures.",
    "Fun lecture, interesting material, not too demanding.",
    "Awesome class. Would definitely take again. Teachers are nice and understanding and discussion section is worth it. Learn a lot from both sides of medicine and media.",
    "Easy class and pretty interesting. You definitely have to go to class though because they'll ask you to talk about images and video clips from lecture that they don't post online.",
    "This course is a pretty easy history credit. Essentially, just skim some of the readings before section, write a short response, particpate a bit and you're fine. I didn't study much for the exams, and I think I did pretty well overall. It's a not a demanding course, though the lectures can at times be a bit dry. Some of the readings are also boring, like the ones on older vaccines and medical heroes, but others are really fascinating, like the ones on social media, obesity, and advertising, which appear in the second-half of the course.",
    "I enjoyed the course: the subject matter interested me and the workload wasn't too hard. There is a bit of reading each week but you can just skim through them as much of the same information appears in lectures. The weekly responses were very short and more of a check that you knew at least something about that week's topic so they weren't high pressure. Even the research paper near the end of the term is very low-key. I recommend you take it if you want a slightly easier course to balance out your schedule and if you are actually interested in the material (otherwise, you might get a little bored).",
    "Yes I'd recommend it.",
    "This course discusses many interesting events in the history of media and medicine, and I believe that anyone who takes this would come out with a informed understanding of the American medical establishment. It is accessible to non-humanities majors and there is not much work besides the readings.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's a very interesting history course on the relationship between media and medicine in America from the 1880s to the present time, which may sound dry, but if you are at all interested in either media or medicine (or America, for that matter), this course is definitely informative and enjoyable.",
    "Yea I guess. I took it as a humanities and a break from the pre-med requirements and it was pretty ok. Didn't require much work, only really focused on the class for the midterm final and paper. Lecture was pretty mindless, generally entertaining (but I just have difficulty keeping my attention for the whole 50 minutes). Kind of a cool history of the role the media has played in American medicine (a good amount is common sense though) and you get a nice history of big medical events in our country's history. An overall pretty easy class.",
    "If you are looking for a gut humanities class, it is not as easy as you might expect. There is a lot of memorizing of names, dates, and events necessary if you want to do well on the exams. I would recommend taking the course if you are genuinely interested in the history of media and medicine in America, but not if you are just looking for an easy class.",
    "if you go to lecture and are enthusiastic in section you will do well.",
    "Overall an average class. Not much coursework despite the large course packet. It's not necessary to read everything. The subject is interesting and I did learn things that I never knew before. Take it for a nice easygoing class. You watch a lot of videoclips.",
    "Yes definitely. For anyone even if they are not interested in the topic.",
    "Not really. Gets boring quickly",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone. It does a fantastic job of incorporating current events, medical issues, and the technology we are all familiar with to bring out issues we were never aware of. Fascinating readings and historical cases as well!",
    "It's a panoramic view of the public's relationship with the American Health Establishment as defined through media. It's important to understand media's impact on our opinions, especially when concerning health. Especially for students interested in history, public health, or media and advertising it's a worth-while course.",
    "It is a class that looks at the recent connections between the medical world and modern media. It is very informative and interesting. I would recommend another student to take the class.",
    "It was Wonderful! I absolutely suggest taking this class.",
    "This class is great. A really chill 5th credit which covers interesting and relevant material in our dailylives. If Heidi Knoblauch TA's the course again, certainly take it with her. I would advise, however, against skipping tooo many lectures, for Warner and Berland don't provide PowerPoint slides with their presentations. But cool classmates (although there are a fair amount of those who are definitely taking it for the gutty atmosphere), a well-structured curriculum, and competent instructors make this a solid choice for anyone interested in the way media portrays medicine to form a dominant narrative in American society. You get to watch fast-food advertisements and Disney clips in lecture- how cool is that?",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because it's something we encounter everyday. It's really interesting and it's not too hard. I don't see why someone wouldn't like it.",
    "Really interesting class that has prodded me to become interested in public health. Really chill, too. The paper is super easy because it's such an open-ended prompt (\"write about something that involved media and medicine\"). Readings are interesting but you don't need to do them... reading responses are really short. Extremely, extremely interesting material in class though! Perfect class to balance out a rough schedule.",
    "I would recommend this class, it was fairly simple and the reading is not difficult to do\/catch up on.",
    "definitely! it made me realize the bigger picture of why im going to med school and has pulled a lot of things together from other coursework\/ contemporary health care issues",
    "Take it!",
    "Great class, super interesting, not much work but you still learn a ton!",
    "I would recommend it because it was interesting without Too much work.",
    "I would recommend this course. It makes you think a lot about the way we view medicine and health today and how media was used to shape a certain image of medicine in the past. Some weeks have a lot of readings and they can get repetitive, but all of the lectures are very interesting.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it. It's an interesting, reasonably-graded class. Lectures are good and it's not too hard.",
    "Yes, but it wasn't anywhere near one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, despite its reputation.It was very interesting and illuminating, but it is very much a collection of phenomena in Modern America related to media and medicine.",
    "If you're interested in medicine (specifically American medicine) and its presentation to the public, you'll find this a very interesting class. The readings are interesting, but you don't have to do them and the only evaluations are a midterm, paper (7 papes), and final (all are very straight forward).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is interesting and relevant. Take it no matter your major.",
    "Most of the things that you will learn in the class are things that you already know but never thought about. It's a good class, even if it's a little (or a lot) repetitive. You're probably looking at this class because you a) have some interest in medicine and\/or b) heard it was easy. Both of these are legit reasons to take the class.",
    "Take this class!! If you're pre-med and you're looking for a class that's unlike the millions of science classes you've already taken YET want something that's still relevant to the field of medicine, this is the class for you. Even if you're not pre-med, this class gets into so many different, interesting topics involving politics, journalism, marketing, etc. As long as you go to lecture and do the readings, you'll get a great deal out of the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! It was extremely interesting and the lectures were very enjoyable! Professor Berland and Professor Warner combine for a very unique and enjoyable class.",
    "Chill lecture with a midterm, final, and 5-7 page paper. Lectures are interesting, but make sure you get a good TA. Ask around for people who have taken it - some TF's are great and others suck.",
    "Great class definitely worth taking",
    "Great course. Not hard. Take it.",
    "It's a decent class - the material is pretty interesting, but the professors are kinda boring\/dry so you don't really realize how cool what you're learning is until you study for the exams. There are quite a few readings, and some can be lengthy, but don't waste your time reading closely for every detail - I did this at the beginning and it was pointless. Just skim and note the main idea of each reading, as well as key words or interesting quotes, and that's all you'll need for the exams. Just a midterm, paper, and final. The exams are essay-based; not too difficult but I feel they didn't really test what I knew that well - the questions can be broad and the tests are long for a short amount of time. But it's not too difficult. And the paper was actually pretty fun to write - you get to pick basically any topic related to the class and write about it, no more than 7 pages.",
    "It is kind of mind-numbing at times but a good Hu credit for a pre-med. Certainly gets you thinking about things. The paper is fun to write if you pick something you are interested in.",
    "This is an awesome class. The material is very interesting, and you come out of the class feeling like you really learned a lot. The stuff you learn is both interesting to know historically but also applicable to daily life. The class was not that much work, and the work that you do have is not that bad. I definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in medicine or in American history and the ways in which media can influence it.",
    "Media and Medicine is a great way to examine public health crises in modern-day American through the lens of the media. At first, I thought this class would be a little wishy-washy because of the focus on the media. Though it was a little disorganized, in the end I definitely gained many insights about American public health. It's true that I think our approach to the material was a little more relaxed since we were focusing on the media's impact instead of the sociopolitical issues at hand, and about midway through the course the lectures became a little repetitive. I would definitely recommend it as a good fifth class, interesting but not too much work (a midterm, paper before Thanksgiving break andessay final). Also Kate Irving is a great TA!",
    "If they are interested in medicine's representation to the public, then yes!",
    "yes i would. very interesting, not too complicated",
    "Highly recommend it!Great as a 5th or extra class, interesting and manageable amount of reading.",
    "Interesting class with alternative look at the medical world. Get in a good section to make it worth your time!",
    "good HSHM class, modern day issues as well, interesting if you're thinking about a career in public health or medicine",
    "yes i would so recommend this course. it is interesting and not that much work. a midterm a final and a 5 page double spaced paper on basically anything you want. huge amount of reading but seriously it is on what was in lecture so if you go to class you are fine and even if not just skim. for the test do memorise some authors and titles and a bit about topic but otherwise you are set.",
    "I would defintely recommend this course. The material is fascinating and shows why medicine is the way is it today, through the use of mediawhich is all around us. It's a course where you don't break your back over and get a lot out of.",
    "I would highly recommend AMST247 to another student!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! I learned a lot in a very fun and relaxing way. The workload is minimal (a weekly response and reading each week with a final paper at the end and a midterm and final) and the professors are amazing lecturers. If you're interested in how medicine and media intertwine (in movies, ads, magazines, etc.) this class is definitely for you. It's also a great way to get rid of your HU requirement.",
    "not too much work, readings are very interesting. The midterm paper interesting and enjoyable to write if interested in the subject matter.",
    "yes! this class is really fun, and as long as you pay attention to key points form lectures youll be fine! the readings are interesting too, although you wont have to read all of them to succeed in the class. warner is a bit monotonous and his material is not always taught in chronological order, which is confusing sometimes! but overall both lecturers are really good :)",
    "Media and Medicine is a great course! I took it as a sixth course with my normal pre-med curriculum, and it was challenging and informative but not too tough. The weekly responses helped; otherwise I really would have slacked on the reading, which is normally pretty interesting btw.",
    "Good class about American History (1890-now) and medicine",
    "It was a pretty fun and relaxed class overall. There was definitely a good amount of reading, but the lectures did a good job of covering everything for the most part. However, doing the reading helped with your general understanding. It wasn't absolutely necessary to get by from week to week as reading responses could be very vague, but definitely helped for the exams (which were just timed essay prompts). I originally thought it'djust be an easy gut class, but I ended up really liking it and therefore wanting to put more work\/effort into it because I was interested in learning as much from the class as possible. I especially liked analyzing all the interactions between the media and medicine today, through TV shows, movies, trailers, Twitter, video games, etc. (all of which we would see snippets of in class). I would recommend this course.",
    "Media& Medicine is a pretty interesting class. I recommend it to anyone interested in the social aspect of medicine, which is just as important to consider and understand as the scientific aspect. The lectures are generally interesting but not extraordinary. I think what makes the course attractive is that it critically examines material that we're all familiar with at some level, such as advertisements and films. As a pre-med, it was intriguing to learn how the public's perception of American medicine has evolved over time. It was also fun learning about some of the politically incorrect public health campaigns from the early 20th century. There is a lot of reading, most of which are long and boring, but you certainly don't need to read every single article to do well in the class.",
    "Overall pretty good course, I'd recommend it.",
    "I took it for the Hu credit because I'm pre-med! It was actually a wonderful lecture course; I definitely feel that I learned a lot. The lectures were interesting and section was actually fun! I didn't do the majority of the readings. Do not buy the course packet, everything is online. The workload is pretty minimal, just weekly reading responses (paragraph long), a paper, a midterm, and a final. Neither the midterm nor final were that bad. Take it! Very interesting course, especially if you plan to go into medicine.",
    "It wasn't as great as everyone hyped it up to be. It'll basically tell you things you already know (yellow journalism, media made the medicine look good, then it made it look bad, don't trust everything you see, blah blah blah) and just add details about events which makes you think you learned something. Not that great. Take it if you need a HU credit. Otherwise, it'll get boring and repetitive.",
    "I would take this course if you're interested in medicine and how it's changed over the years. You will look at many different media images, such as House, ads, and many commercials. Good course!",
    "Yes, take this course if you need a fifth class and have any interest in medical history. You get to watch a lot of interesting clips in lecture and not too much work at all.",
    "Rumors abound that Media and Medicine in Modern America is a gut class (defined as a class in which a student receives a grade of A with minimal work). This is entirely untrue. The class seeks to discuss the interplay between media and medicine in the United States since about 1880 and while it does this, it does it quite sloppily. Because of the two lecturer format of this course, it often appears that one lecture doesn\u0092t quite logically follow the preceding one making the course itself confusing. While on the surface the class seems easy with only a midterm, final, and a 7-page paper, this written work is actually not that easy and there is very little guidance on what is expected for any of these assessments meaning that it is very easily to do poorly even when completing the task completely adequately as per the given guidelines. It almost seems as if there are no actual standards to which students are being held, rather these are just being made up as the course progresses and subject to the whims of a few teaching fellows. While attending lecture is often not too burdensome (with about 10 minutes of media clips per lecture), the lectures are often very dense with many facts, the importance of which is often enigmatic, although a regurgitation of these minute details, and those from the course readings (about 70-100 pages per week), is sometimes expected in section. Overall, the class is constructed poorly despite the fact that the lecturers are enthusiastic and knowledgeable. I would advise against enrolling in this class until such time that the deficiencies are remedied and a clearer framework for the class is established."
