   "comments": [
    "Strengths-applicable to thesis.It was very theoretical. and I got lost in the textbook and lecture, but understood the overall concept of the class.Weakness -- should include a lab session not a session that focuses on sas in a classroom setting.",
    "The project was an excellent means to apply the material. More material to prepare for the exams would be helpful. Labs were very instructive for completing SAS.",
    "Very good course material, and worthwhile to pickup, but a lot of work.",
    "This class is excellent. This is the class I learned the most from.",
    "The strongest portion was the the well crafted homework assignments and labs. They drove home the point that was being studied.I thought some of the lectures\/labs were a little long. It was hard to stay focused for the entire time.The SAS code and notes provided were very good and an invaluable resource.",
    "Course materials including lectures and labs. TA sessions were awesome.",
    "Strengths: TA's and Lab SessionsWeaknesses: R Lectures (not mac compatible and didn't seem to be organized well within the class structure - stick with explaining regression!)",
    "Very good course, mainly because of the EXCELLENT TA's. The book is also very good.",
    "The textbook for this class is fantastic, and I found it VERY helpful that the instructor followed the textbook directly. I also liked the format of the class - alternating between lecture days and lab days.I think it might be better to just stick with SAS for the course - rather than introducing the R code. It seems that not many people in biostatistics are using R, and if students really needed to learn it, the appropriate resources are available.",
    "The course is very usefull and interesting for me, and the professor helps us a lot in this course",
    "Strengths: the textbook was well-written, the lectures were well-taught and fairly interactive for a biostats class, the TA's were extremely helpfulWeaknesses: the project was really helpful in applying all of the concepts we learned throughout the semester, however, it would have been really valuable to receive in-depth feedback afterwards (unfortunately the semester was over). Would be great to convert this to a year-long course... keeping the first semester as is and then adding a spring semester that covers the second half of the textbook (and maybe continues work on the project).",
    "I enjoyed the course but would have wanted more rote\/elementary problems on the sets rather than a few involved problems. Some important techniques we only practiced on one problem or subproblem all semester.",
    "excellent course - despite the heavy workload, I do feel like I learned regression analysis",
    "In-class interactions and lab sessions are this class's biggest strengths",
    "Well organized, good text."

    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Dr. Zhang brought a great attitude and excitement to class. He engaged students and tried to keep them up to speed, while challenging us to continue to master new concepts.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Solid explanations and knows material",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Very good instructor.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Professor Zhang is very knowledgeable and willing to help students outside the classroom. I have no complaints.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Very easy to interact with. Good teacher.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0A good energetic and clearly knowledgeable professor - though sometimes difficult to understand.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Professor Zhang was very approachable and really seemed to care that we learned the material.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Heping is a nice and approachable person. It is clear that his priority is to help students learn the material. His notes and lecture slides are very clear and useful, as they reflect the material in the book. The one weakness is that I had trouble understanding his English some times -- but he makes up for that with the lecture notes. Also his jokes are funny, which is appreciated given that the subject matter can be dry at times.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0The professor is very good in explaining the concepts and methods in this course.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Strengths:Tried to engage students as much as possible, he was very knowledgeable",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Very responsive",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Dr. Zhang definitely presented what could be considered dull statistics in a very interesting way. In the latter part of the course, he performed some analyses using R which seemed a bit puzzling since we were all accustomed to using SAS.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0He delivers excellent class speeches."

    "I e-mailed them a few times and did not get a response. They had asked to e-mail both of them at the same time, and I think this is how e-mails get lost through the cracks.",
    "TAs were very helpful and responsive by email. The lab sessions were great, although it seems that at times they were overloaded with preparing the lab materials and grading the assignments- they did a great job of managing all our questions in regard to the homeworks. The midterm contained some questions that seemed confusing and perhaps could have been better constructed.",
    "excellent TAs and handouts",
    "Both Martha and Owais were excellent",
    "The TA, Owais Gilami and Martha Skup, are excellent.",
    "The TA's were very accessible and provided great supplemental instruction.",
    "The TA's were great: very helpful and informative.",
    "Martha Skup and Owais Gilani were great TA's. The lab sessions were very helpful in understanding the material and with homework. They were always willing to help either through email or in person.",
    "Very intensive and comprehensive lab sessions conducted by the TAs who gave great lectures.",
    "TA's (esp Martha who lectured most) were great!",
    "These TA's were phenomenal. Their lab sessions and the associated materials were great. They worked very hard on this class and it showed. They were very approachable and were accessible at almost all times.",
    "Martha and Owais were fantastic TAs - probably among the best I've ever had. They both worked very hard to prepare useful lab materials for the class (the instructions on the lab worksheets were great!) and to help students with any questions. I found them to be approachable, friendly, and knowledgeable. I wish they could be my TAs next semester too!:)My one suggestion would be to make it clearer when points were taken off from the homework. (But even then, that only happened once or twice.)",
    "They are very helpfull in helping us understand how to practice with the knowlege we have got in the class.",
    "The TA's were terrific - they both put a lot of effort into the class. The SAS lecture notes were detailed and really helpful in completing the homeworks. They were both really responsive to any questions.",
    "Very helpful and responsive and accomodating",
    "Both Martha and Owais provided outstanding assistance with the class material. The labs were very well presented and simplified when it came to understanding the problem sets.",
    "TAs are very helpful.",
    "The TA's were excellent. Martha was always well prepared for lab. Her notes were very thorough and helpful, and she was ery responsive to my questions. She is definitely the best TA I have had at Yale. Owais was equally wonderful- smart and responsive."

    "great course - i would recommend it to everyone who has done intro to biostats.",
    "It was more of a review of BIS and EPI from first year courses than i would have like and expected but a helpful class to expand on SAS learned and regression techniques",
    "I would recommend the class.",
    "I would recommend this class to any EPH student who might use regression analysis for their thesis work. This method of analysis is extraordinarily useful.I thought that the midterm exam was pretty difficult - but in the end the grading was very fair. The final exam was very easy. (I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, it feels good to know that I did well on the final exam, but on the other hand, it is a little frustrating to study so hard and then not be able to show what I'd learned.)But all in all, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Would definitely recommend the course - it's a lot of work but I feel like I learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend taking this",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who thinks this may help with analysis for their thesis. This is the reason why I took the course.",
    "Yes.I would.",
    "Great class- maybe more emphasis on the hat matrix."
