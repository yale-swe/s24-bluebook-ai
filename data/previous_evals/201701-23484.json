    "THIS IS THE BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE. I repeat: BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE. As a Vietnamese American, half Caucasian and half Asian, and I had always felt like I didn't connect with my culture enough. This class allowed me to understand my background more and connect with my Vietnamese side of the family much more. Professor Quang is the best and the sweetest person. He made every class fun and interesting. The workload was very relaxed, and you got to choose which readings you did short, 1-2 page reflection papers on. The readings are all very interesting. There is a lot of poetry in the course, so be prepared for that! Every student came prepared for class which made seminar super interesting and engaging. We all got to talk a lot and share our opinions, etc. We celebrated Vietnamese New Year and Professor Quang's wife made us food and brought us candy. The final week of the course, we had several guests, two very famous Vietnamese poets. We also had a banquet with amazing Vietnamese food. There is a midterm book report and a final project. For this project, you get to choose anything you want. I chose to make a film and interviewed my grandparents for it. I am so thankful for the opportunity to connect with my grandparents on a deeper level and to be able to document their life stories. I would call home every day after class and just rave about how happy I was to be in this course. I think every halfsy out there or any Vietnamese American should take this course. There were also non-Vietnamese people in the class who thoroughly enjoyed it as well. Really just a fun, relaxing course, and I recommend to everyone.",
    "I have garnered a deeper appreciation of Vietnamese literature and culture. As a Vietnamese American taking this course, it was a perfect class to become immersed within my cultural heritage. From reading classical Confucian poetry to exploring the modern Vietnamese American identity, this class has been a wonderful intellectual experience.",
    "I gained a better appreciation for the Vietnamese language, literature, and poetry. I learned a lot about Vietnamese experiences during and after the War.",
    "Learned about Vietnamese history and culture over time. Early lessons on legends and old cultural identities, and much focus on the Vietnam War and refugees toward the end. Great readings! Loved some of the poetry we read, and Paradise of the Blind was a great book.",
    "Viet 220 was a highly engaging, contemplative, and rich look at Vietnamese literature over the ages and its reflection of and influence on the country's culture, values, and history. We began with ancient myths, legends, and poetry about the origin of Vietnam, then moved through Confucian and Zen poetry, The Tale of Kieu (Vietnam's most historically important piece of literature), refugee war stories, post-war reconstruction (Paradise of the Blind and the Sympathizer were incredible novels), and the Vietnamese American experience. All pieces of literature read were translated into English. There are weekly (and sometimes bi-weekly) two-page, double-spaced reflections that seem daunting at first, but become more manageable as you realize that you can really choose to write about whatever interests you in the readings, and Professor Van will be fine with your choice. For the midterm paper, you can pick and interpret whatever novel about or having to do with Vietnam and its people. The final paper has even a wider range of personal choice - if you're Vietnamese, you can choose to do a lengthy translation of short stories or poetry, or you can read and interpret another novel, you can write a paper on any topic you choose (having to do with Vietnam, of course), or you can put together any sort of multimedia project. This class is all about individual experience of the literature and self reflection upon its meaning - Professor Van makes it as easy as possible to love and appreciate all that you read.",
    "Its a great starting point for someone that is interested in learning about major literary contributions to the Vietnamese community.",
    "For me, this course allowed me to get in touch with the Vietnamese identity that had been so far neglected at Yale. In a place like Yale, it can be very difficult to get that same cultural experience. I was able to learn more about the myths and literature that have shaped Vietnamese culture, as well as engage more directly with personal stories of Vietnam.",
    "This course really taught me a lot about Vietnamese and Vietnamese American culture through literature. I was able to sample a lot of different forms of literature and take a close reading and assessment of them for myself. Professor Van is fantastic and he does a great job of facilitating learning through lecture and discussion.",
    "I learned much more about my own culture in this class than I ever did at home.",
    "I learned so much about Vietnamese culture--from folk tales to poems to modern writings of Vietnamese Americans. This class opens your eyes towards Vietnamese heritage and you really reevaluate the Vietnam War and the tensions that Vietnamese and Vietnamese Americans continue to face today. I also learned how amazing the professor is! Seriously, Professor Van is SO amazing!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course could be improved with better communication from the teacher to the students about assignments, lecture plans, etc. With that said, a strength of the course is the flexibility of the discussions; we might have not always stayed on topic, but our discussions were very comprehensive.",
    "Only strengths! No weaknesses",
    "Very well taught by Thay Quang. In the beginning, I wish we had more direction on how to write our reflections, but we eventually were able to figure out how to do them properly.",
    "Good readings, and the professor knows a lot from personal experience that enhances class discussions.",
    "Don't be thrown off by the slower pace of the class, if you're one who likes to move quickly through literature - by the end of the semester, you'll have covered so much more than you imagined. Professor Van is patient, thoughtful, and encouraging: he does his best to quickly learn every student's name (despite admitting that he has bad memory), and addresses each student with their name every time you speak. Once you realize that the class is facilitated largely by students' personal responses (Professor Van makes a point of this), you'll build up courage to participate - this'll make the experience so much more engaging and fun for everyone.",
    "The class is facilitated such that students are able to not only learn through text, but also through the opportunity to meet notable poets that are contributing to the culture itself. Great course.",
    "There were several guest speakers which made the class very unique! People I would have never been able to meet in my life, Professor Quang brought to class.",
    "Strength: Very meaningful class, great professor who really cares about his students. We covered a lot of material and observed Vietnamese culture through different mediums, from poems to movies to even in-person visits from well established Vietnamese professors and poets! Weaknesses: Sometimes class goes way beyond the end of the class (sometimes 30 min over) but you'll love the class so it won't matter to you too much, I promise! We didn't cover everything in the syllabus--pop culture was neglected but instead we learned about famous Vietnamese poets so I think that was worth the exchange. You write reflections on all the readings, but often it's hard to know how to do them at the beginning and you'll lose points until you realize it."

    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student.",
    "This is a wonderful class to learn about Vietnamese experiences through literature and poetry. As a Vietnamese-American, I've gained a much greater appreciation for my culture and the sacrifices my parents made to get to the United States. Many moments from this class have touched me and made me reflect on my Vietnamese identity.",
    "It's a great class! Take it to learn about and appreciate Vietnamese culture. Most students are at least partially Vietnamese, but a few of us were not, and I am grateful to better understand other people's experiences.",
    "100% would recommend, if you have a personal interest in Vietnamese culture and want to explore it further. I'm a second-generation Vietnamese American student who grew up in a highly traditional Vietnamese home, so having a place at Yale to be in touch with my identified culture, language, and people was exceptional. Other students in my class included other second-gen Vietnamese Americans, second-gen hapas (half Vietnamese), as well as non-Vietnamese students. Don't be afraid to try out the class if you're not Vietnamese! This course is made for everyone - no matter what, you'll come out of it with a new perspective on and appreciation for the Vietnamese people and their rich, varied history.",
    "The course is not like others because Professor Quang does well to engage students and he will invest time to make sure that topics everyone can enjoy are included.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you're interested in Vietnamese and\/or Vietnamese American culture. You'll learn so much and have a great time with a wonderful professor!!!",
    "Yes",
    "YES PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS!!",
    "YES. You don't have to be Vietnamese American or Vietnamese to take this course. If you have an interest in Vietnamese culture at all, or just want to learn more, take this course! Work isn't much, but intellectually, it is so enriching."
