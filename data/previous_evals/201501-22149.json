   "comments": [
    "I recommend this class to perfect your grammar. They say it's for students who are majoring in French, but I'm not, and it's a great place to end my French language education.",
    "Take this course if you really want to polish up your French grammar and writing and have a lot of fun doing it. The class has a lot of work, but you'll make a lot of progress in the end. Madame Sherak is a wonderful professor -- she's creative, funny, and uses engaging activities and examples (like fun short stories) to make the class really enjoyable. She also cares a lot about her students and will provide really detailed feedback on your writing. I really enjoyed this class and would absolutely recommend it!",
    "Great class, although a major time commitment. You will have to put in a lot of work with writing assignments, grammar exercises, studying for tests, etc., but you will learn so much. If you are looking for an advanced grammar class to home your skills, this is the one. Professor Sherak is fantastic.",
    "A good review of essential French grammar.",
    "It is a truly incredible class. It is quite labor intensive but worth the time. I would absolutley recommend it for anyone who hopes to improve their grammar and overall French language proficiency.",
    "A review of french grammar with some new topics along with writing essays to incorporate the grammar and reading literature that showcases the grammar. I would recommend this grammar for advanced french students who feel a bit rusty on the grammar front. It is an engaging and useful classes. Worth every bit of work you do."
