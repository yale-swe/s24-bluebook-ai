    "This course introduced students to a history of identity formation within the south, which at times complemented and other times contrasted the (many) narratives we already know about that region's history. Course assessments helped develop skills in primary and secondary source research, and allowed for space to grapple with both traditional history and WGSS\/ethnic studies theory.",
    "Great mix of diverse historical sources using different methodologies, researching primary sources, making broad connections",
    "I learned so much about the history of the American South. I also learned how to be more critical about the role of race and gender in history.",
    "This course taught a lot about the process of doing researching and then writing a longer paper. Through this course I gained better awareness of the diversity of historical thought on subjects, and that evaluation of both the primary and secondary literature can help to make some interpretations seem stronger than others."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - I enjoyed coming into section each week! Prof. Proctor led great discussion and everyone was always very engaged. Weaknesses - all assessments pointed very directly towards the final project. While this was helpful in the long run I think it could have been more interesting\/helped us engage with broader themes in the course if the assessments were more diverse in topic",
    "An overarching timeline would have been helpful - really wide time span, liked the mix of sources but wish we focused more on one runnning theme - seemed to encapsulate a little too much material , the readings were great but often we would have a whole book a week or many chapters from one book, which was a little unrealistic to expect us to get done - would have been helpful to focus the workload a little more so it was manageable \/ knew what to focus on, a shorter paper (maybe instead of a book reciew) would have been nice so that we could research more than one topic and have the final paper feel a little less thesis-like",
    "I think the major strengths was the syllabus. We read a great selection of books that each brought something new to the table. I think the biggest weakness-- and this really couldn't be helped-- was the small class size. I think the class would have benefited if it had been just a little bit bigger. More voices circulating, less pressure on each student to carry the conversation. But again, can't be helped and I wouldn't fault the course material or Proctor for this."

    "This was Professor Proctor's last class but if he ever teaches at Yale again yes! The course was a fascinating look at how memory, narrative, and identity play into history (as well as a great look at the history of the south in general).",
    "YES",
    "Yes, diverse materials and sources that don't often get when looking at the South and appreciated flexibility for the final research paper",
    "I absolutely would! I know Professor Proctor won't be at Yale next year, but a course that has to do with race and gender in the South is a fascinating lens by which to study history."
