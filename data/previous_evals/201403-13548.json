    "I would not recommend this course.",
    "If you aren't a geology major I would not recommend taking it. The professor is great, but it assumes a lot of previous knowledge even though there isn't any pre-requisites for the course.",
    "This class can be a headache because the topics are interesting, but nothing is organized and most lectures are filled with ramblings about unrelated things. I feel like it was a bit of a waste of my time.",
    "This class is not for everyone. I liked the material of this course, but this class was somehow not very organized. It didn't follow the syllabus and I didn't find the textbook helpful.",
    "Take this class if you're a G&G or EVST major, or are considering going into one of those fields! Mark is a great professor who is really interested in the subjects he's teaching and has the ability to engage students in the material. The lectures are very interesting but quite complex; meeting with Mark and staying on top of the material is crucial. This class assumes some previous G&G experience, so I would recommend taking it after at least one intro class, like Dynamic Earth. It's certainly possible to take this as your first G&G class, but be warned that you'll have to work a lot harder to understand what's going on."
