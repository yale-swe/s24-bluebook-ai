   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about early eastern european history.",
    "A deeper appreciation for Eastern European history. I also definitely improved my note taking skills throughout the semester.",
    "Not only did I learn the historical events as they occurred with a high degree of accuracy and retention, but I also grew to understand the historical trends which led to events occurring as they did, not only in Eastern Europe but throughout the Western world, over the time period discussed in the course.",
    "I learned a lot of European history before 1914 from a new perspective",
    "I learned an enormous amount about Eastern European history from the middle ages to 1914. Additionally, there were many interesting themes conveyed by Synder that apply more broadly to other historical contexts.",
    "Pretty broad overview of Eastern European history. The time period this class covers is pretty huge but it's a fun way to get the preindustrial requirement out of the way while contextualizing what was going on in Eastern Europe with prior knowledge in Western Europe. At some points it got to be pretty chaotic only because there was so much going on at one time and the timeline got confusing but if you go to lecture you should be fine.",
    "I learned a significant amount of Eastern European history over the second millennium.",
    "I literally knew nothing about this region and period of history, and now I know so much!",
    "I learned a lot about trends, important individuals, and events in Eastern and Central Europe History from the medieval age to 1914.",
    "An overall survey of the history of Eastern Europe from medieval times to 1914. The beginning part of the course is very muddled and difficult to follow, and although Professor Snyder is an excellent lecturer, he did not do very much to detangle the knots. I'm much happier and more confident with my knowledge from 1650-1914. The second half of the course was much clearer to follow, in my opinion.",
    "This was a great course with very entertaining lectures. We learned about Eastern Europe from the early middle ages up to 1914.",
    "I learned to analyze Eastern European history through a objective lens.",
    "This is an area of history for which I really did not know much. I had taken a European history course in high school but it barely, if ever, covered much of what we learned in this class about the eastern part of the continent. For this reason, almost everything I learned was new, and I gained a lot of insight as to what the complete history of Europe looked like as opposed to that of just the western nations.",
    "I learned about the history of Eastern Europe from the start of written history (around 800) to 1914. There was a lot of coverage of Kievan Rus, Poland-Lithuania, and Austria Hungary. Mostly we covered political history, but there was also a good deal of intellectual history towards the end of the course.",
    "Good knowledge of eastern european history from a variety of perspectives",
    "Eastern Europe to 1914 is a survey course of Eastern Europe that will provides knowledge about the area from the middle ages to 1914. It is a good course that provides knowledge to a relatively understudied region while connecting to larger themes and world events.",
    "An overall view of the development of Eastern Europe to World War I",
    "The history of Eastern Europe from about the 800s (the Christianization of pagan Slavs), through the rise and fall of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Habsburg, Russian, and Ottoman Empires, the establishment of Balkan national states, and nationalist movements, among other historical processes.",
    "I learned a ton of history and new ways of thinking about history, especially in the second half of the course when the spread of ideas becomes important."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the class is not really taught towards the exams but thats fine, you learn a lot.",
    "The lectures in this class are truly outstanding. You won't want to miss any of them. Most of the readings were tolerable and helpful for understanding the material, but it seemed like roughly one reading a week was extremely boring and held very little relevance for the material that was being covered in class and on the tests.",
    "This course is gripping, fascinating, and incredibly fast-paced. Every second of every lecture is filled with wonderful details that reinforce the larger trends observed throughout the class. However, the fact that everything is so packed means that there's little time for questions or student participation in lecture. Additionally, discussion section rarely if ever adds content or understanding, and mainly serves the same purpose as reading over notes from lecture.",
    "Synder's lectures are so well-structured, engaging and inspiring, and his particular brand of humor adds so much to the content. Weakness is probably the 200$ reading packet that I barely read, which is definitely my own fault, but the lectures barely made any reference to them, a lot of them were long and dry and we did not discuss in section either. Section is rather dull and honestly pretty unnecessary; the TAs are very nice and try to be helpful but I think sections should either be refocused or removed.",
    "The lectures are fantastically done - Professor Snyder blows the competition out of the water - but the sections were often unhelpful.",
    "Timelines would be incredibly helpful",
    "Incredible lecture. Fast-paced and leaves you wanting more!",
    "Great, entertaining lectures. Reducing some of the IDs on the sheet would be helpful, because there were many that wouldn't be touched on each lecture.",
    "Lectures are amazing because the professor is an extraordinarily engaging speaker and provides a printed outline for each lecture. Sections and review sessions held by the TAs are also well-organized and help reinforce the material.",
    "The course has two midterms and a map quiz. Aside from those events, you really don't have to interact to deeply with the class, which makes it a great side class when you have a heavy schedule. You MUST go to lecture; I can't see how you'd survive if you didn't. Section was also helpful in a lot of ways, but there were definitely some times where it got dry. In my opinion, however, the biggest weakness of the class was Professor Snyder's aloofness. Being in class with his was a true privilege; it's extremely clear from the start why he's one of the top scholars in his field, but he is completely inaccessible and unapproachable to his students, which is a bit of a shame because it'd be really nice to get to have a conversation with him about course-related topics.",
    "I enjoyed this course greatly. I perhaps would have enjoyed having one assigned paper instead of no assignments at all, as I feel that that would've given more of an opportunity to learn more deeply about the topics and improve our writing.",
    "The lectures are very good. Concise and to the point, they easily held my attention and were very interesting. The readings were mainly good, but very long. Many contained a lot of unnecessary detail. Section was sometimes useful, but only a few people really talked so it ended up being more of a review lecture by a TA.",
    "Professor Snyder makes sure that the course is well structured, and material from each lectures fits together perfectly when you look back through your notes. Its a very engaging class.",
    "Snyder is a great lecturer, but he assigns a reading load that isnt super manageable and doesnt feel super useful when you do all of it",
    "I think the lectures are amazing and Professor Snyder does a very good job of connecting each lecture to construct and overall picture. The weakness of the course lies in the disconnect of the readings and the lectures. I think the syllabus and readings need to be updated to improve the course.",
    "Lectures are very interesting but very fast-paced. There is a usually unrealistic amount of reading assigned. Exams are fair. Be prepared to memorize a ton of information.",
    "Eastern Europe has been my favorite Yale class. Brilliant lectures, intriguing reading material, fair exams, and just all-around great atmosphere. No complaints.",
    "The lectures are really interesting. Snyder does a great job of explaining things well and telling interesting stories during the lecture. Definitely the best lecturer of any class I've taken at Yale. However, sometimes he does go quickly and its hard to write everything down. The readings were mostly pretty dry, though some of them (the ones not in the packet) were better. I also didn't like the packet and wish the readings were available online. My TF was great but the section was mainly people who didn't read and didn't speak and just a couple of people who spoke all the time, so there wasn't much discussion. The tests were a lot of time pressure but very fair anyways, since there were plenty of essay prompts to choose from."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, fantastic class. Super interesting!",
    "Yes. As a STEM student this was a pretty manageable way to attain a humanities credit. The class was interesting and I always wanted to attend lecture. Also, only having midterms made the workload very tolerable.",
    "This course is an absolute must-take. The content might seem niche, but the way in which it is taught opens the door to understanding world history itself. Though most history classes make an effort to connect the content to larger and more abstract historical motifs, in this class the particular and the general are inseparably linked, and as a result highly reinforced and understandable. A person who sat through every lecture of this course would never view history, or the modern world, the same again.",
    "If you are a history major\/very interested in history, yes. I always looked forward to going to lecture and the course provides a great introduction to Eastern Europe. Many of the familiar topics in Western European history (renaissance, reformation, revolution) are discussed from a different perspective and will lead you to look at these themes in a new way. However: at the start of the semester I was deciding between this class and another lecture course that was in my major, and ultimately I think I should have taken that one instead. This class, while engaging and interesting, did not challenge me intellectually, and ultimately the exams were about memorizing the facts given in lecture. The workload is pretty low other than the few days spent cramming for the two midterms, so if you're interested in the subject matter do take it.",
    "Yes! I came in not knowing anything about, or having inherent interest in, Eastern European history, but this course kept me consistently engaged and taught me loads.",
    "Pretty broad overview of Eastern European history. The time period this class covers is pretty huge but it's a fun way to get the preindustrial requirement out of the way while contextualizing what was going on in Eastern Europe with prior knowledge in Western Europe. At some points it got to be pretty chaotic only because there was so much going on at one time and the timeline got confusing but if you go to lecture you should be fine.",
    "Absolutely. If you like history, you'll love this course. If you don't like learning history, you will by the end of this course.",
    "Never. Timothy Snyder is the biggest asshole I have ever met. He clearly does not care at all about his students. He knows that he is a \"famous\" professor and he can do whatever he wants. I also didn't learn that much about Eastern European history. It was more just a collection of anecdotes and fun facts Snyder assembled so that he could reference obscure texts and military leaders in his obnoxious Polish accent.",
    "Yes!! Great course. It is one of those courses that you feel the privilege of being at Yale at every lecture mostly thanks to Tim Snyder. Also, if you put in a decent amount of time for the exams and do the readings every week, you are almost guaranteed a good mark as the testing for this course is really straightforward.",
    "Take this class! It isn't a gut, but you can get away with not doing all of the reading and the lectures are really interesting and entertaining. Shop it to see if you are interested, and if you study for the exams and participate in section you will be fine grade-wise. Taking detailed notes in class is key, because the lecture content is what is on the exams. Really glad I took this as my first yale history course.",
    "Yes, you learn a lot without being swamped with work. The professor and TAs prepare you well for the exams, which are very fair in terms of both the content covered and the grading.",
    "Honestly, kind of a hit or miss. The course was interesting because most of it was new information for me (and for most people) because Eastern Europe is a relatively untouched subject. However, it's not a to-die-for class and it is pretty stressful around the midterms. As long as you're aware and prepared of the setbacks of the course, you should be okay.",
    "Not really sure. Obviously Snyder is very well respected and a smart guy. But the class tries. give an overview of 1500 years of Eastern European history in 14 weeks. That is really hard to do. And it shows especially at the beginning of class when one 50 minute lecture would span 400 years and several nations. Snyder is smart and it might be worthwhile to have this as background for the 2nd half of the class, but wasn't crazy about it.",
    "Absolutely! It is less work than an average Yale class (no papers!), and Professor Snyder is incredibly engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course. The lectures are very exciting to listen to, and the workload isn't too heavy. For this reason, it's a very enjoyable class. I feel like I learned about an area of the world that I didn't know much about beforehand.",
    "If you can work and study independently, you will do well. Otherwise, it is impossible. Professor Snyder is also a wonderful lecturer!",
    "Yes, this course was very enlightening (pun).",
    "Yes! This course was great. I looked forward to the lectures each week because of how engaging Professor Snyder made them. I thoroughly enjoyed the class all the way through, and feel like I learned more than I could have imagined about eastern Europe.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in Eastern European history or just want to try something new. I took it as a first-year and it was an interesting class that challenged me but not too much.",
    "Absolutely, this is a must-take course.",
    "Probably, its a fine lecture course and you study the development some important historical themes in eastern europe.",
    "Yes. Most of the information you will learn will most likely be new to you and very interesting. Prof. Snyder is an outstanding lecturer but goes very fast, so keep pace with the readings as best as you can.",
    "Absolutely. You need to take a class with Timothy Snyder. Enough said. Also... if that hasn't convinced you.... learning about Eastern Europe is very important! It changes your frame of reference from the Western European perspective, and Eastern Europe was a major hotspot in the 20th century, as it is with Ukraine and Russia in the 21st! You won't regret taking this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to everyone, no matter their major. This was my first history class at Yale and I learned a ton. I would recommend this course as a good first history course even if you're not specifically interested in Eastern Europe (I wasn't at first and it turned out to be very interesting). The workload is pretty chill because you can get away with doing very little of the readings, but I recommend putting time into reading because it makes the class more interesting. This class was so good that it made me consider adding a history major.",
    "Yes! Professor Snyder is an excellent lecturer. Readings are interesting and manageable. Overall, I felt I learned so much and this course made me consider majoring in history."
