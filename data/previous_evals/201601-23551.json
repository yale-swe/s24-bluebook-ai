   "comments": [
    "It is a well taught, well structured course. You will learn Spanish, you will learn it well, and that's about it. The cultural exploration part of the course is the most \"exciting\" and \"new\" part, but because it is a basic level Spanish course, most of it is just grammar and speaking and practicing - not really discovery based. So, obviously not the most exciting course at Yale, but really solid course, and could set up potentially more exciting courses on Spanish lit or culture, etc.",
    "This class is a requirement, but is very helpful and interactive with both the language and the culture. In you have any interest in one or more languages, you should take it.",
    "SPAN 120 03 is a continuation of the SPAN 110 course, finishing the second half of the Aventuras book. The class is small, so this gives everyone a chance to speak and interact as well as providing each person individual help during the instructor's office hours or after class. The daily class allows each student to hone their Spanish skills in class and retain information over the course of months. I would definitely recommend any student looking to study Spanish to enroll in this course because it's a great course that's taught very well in a good class environment.",
    "A good class if you want to learn how to speak Spanish comfortably. I would recommend this class, but only if you're interested in the language not a class I would take just to get the requirement, since it's a lot of effort if you're not very interested in learning about different tenses and vocabulary.",
    "A very fun and engaging class. If you can get into Bryce Maxey's section, you will have an absolute blast and learn a ton of Spanish. As a warning, the workload is significant, at around 2 hours 5 nights a week, and is definitely much harder than L1 Spanish. Regardless, this is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and you will feel accomplished and satisfied when it ends."
