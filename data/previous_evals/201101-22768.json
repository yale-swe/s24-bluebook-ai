    "Of course I would recommend Rogers's section to another DS kid and DS to any kid. Rogers is fabulous, DS is fabulous, and Rogers for DS is fabulous.",
    "Tons of reading, not that you have to do it all. Rogers is actually pretty aware of this, I think, and discussions are always lean heavier on the first half of books we read.",
    "This semester of DS lit begins with Petrarch and Don Quixote and ends with Borges. I enjoyed the works this semester much more than first semester. I would recommend the course because there are so many works that are definitely worth reading and discussing.",
    "An excellent course.John Rogers is a very good teacher. The way he runs section is a bit unorthodox, but it works. After each comment, he regurgitates what was just said - but makes it smarter and sharper. When you try to respond to the original comment, you end up responding to Rogers's version, and so the conversation reaches a high level very quickly. He is also very skilled at balancing close examination of passages with deep discussion of broad questions about literature and the canon.",
    "If you made it through the first half, you've got to stick around for round two. To watch Western thought walk its way all the way into the 20th century is an invaluable experience.",
    "I would not necessarily recommend this course to another student. A student should only take it if he or she is incredibly enthusiastic about the great works covered during the semester and is willing to put in all the hours of reading required to truly make the most of the course. If a student does that, then he or she will likely feel as if it was a worthwhile experience. But if not, the class is reduced to not a lot more than trying to push your way through a course without much of an understanding of the material. The authors covered in this course are definitely worth reading at some point, but it is awfully difficult to effectively cover War&Peace in two weeks."
