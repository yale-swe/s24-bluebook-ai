    "I improved my Spanish to a conversational level in all four skill areas of speaking, listening, writing, and reading. I have reached a level at which I could be mostly functional in a Spanish-speaking country without using any English, and that is fascinating for me, having started this language only two years ago.",
    "My knowledge of both written and spoken spanish improved vastly over the course of this excellent class",
    "Outstanding emphasis on advanced verb forms. Useful vocabulary. This course is tops in terms of challenging us and offering meaningful, systematic growth. I developed my speaking, writing, and reading skills without a doubt this term. Awesome!"

   "comments": [
    "The course was well organized and ran smoothly. My class only had 9 people which was wonderful, and every person got to speak often. I wish we had more time to converse freely or about relevant topics rather than very decontextualized topics, prompts, or photos. This would help us to be more prepared to use spanish in our own lives.",
    "I liked the professor. It's a lot of busy work though",
    "This course was near perfect, and there are practically no weaknesses I can think of.",
    "My only complaint is the high level of online course work. Otherwise, this class was great.",
    "Dr. Leon is tremendous---very knowledgeable, highly organized, and outstanding in her communicative teaching abilities. She was never tardy for class (not even once) nor did she miss a day (not one from January - May) -- wow! Outstanding syllabus--very clear and consistent. All of the keys to doing well were placed in our hands. Thanks!"

    "I would recommend because I feel so much more comfortable conversing with others! I started spanish at Yale in L1 and chose to continue an extra semester, and I'm very glad I did. L4 helped to solidify my spanish.",
    "depends on what their goals are. It won't make you fluent in spanish, but helps you improve for sure.",
    "If you want to take your Spanish to a conversational level after L3, definitely take this class. It is harder than previous levels, but you will get an immense improvement in speaking, listening, writing, and reading ability out of it. Parts of this class will be quite tough, but it is always doable, and you won't regret it in the end.",
    "Yes -- I would recommend this instructor and this class. It is efficient, well-organized, and engaging. It challenges and moves. Brava!"
