    "This class was really fair, interesting and worth the time. I definitely recommend it. Definitely take it over ENAS 194 if you have the chance. You go more in depth with things and there's not a cramp to learn both ODEs and PDEs in one semester.",
    "If you have any interest in math, take it",
    "This is a great class. Though, if you aren't a math\/physics\/engineering major, I don't see why you would take it, as it might only be interesting to people with majors that require the class anyways. However, very important for global applications. Class was structured very well.",
    "For me, it was a very good experience. My professor is definitely the biggest factor in making it so good, but the material is interesting too. I would recommend this class for a student who is looking for a good ol' math class after linear algebra and multivariable calculus. Of course, this class is also great for students pursuing math, engineering, or physics majors.",
    "I would recommend 246 as a solid introduction to techniques in differential equations.",
    "It's ordinary differential equations. If you're really into math and science, you'll have no trouble with this class, but you should only take it if you're really passionate about STEM and are sure that you're going to need to know how to solve differential equations further down the road.",
    "TAKE IT IF STEINERBERGER IS TEACHING IT. I almost took ENAS 194, but I didn't regret for a second taking this class. I feel like I learnt how to solve multiple types of ODEs, which is the goal of the course, but also how to understand their behavior, which is not necessarily the type of knowledge you're going to come out of an ODE class knowing. I thought the professor would be average, since it was his first time teaching at Yale, but I was completely surprised about how good of a teacher he actually was. I'm sure everybody did well in this class, but not because the material was easy, but rather because Professor Steinerberger was a very clear lecturer and a very approachable professor. He was so careful in making sure that everybody knew the material and gave his students so much attention, that we didn't even notice that not having a TA for this class was a problem (which would definitely be the case for all other STEM classes I ever took at Yale if we didn't have a TA). He replied to e-mails with doubts within minutes, no matter when you sent the e-mail. He also made sure that you would come out of class knowing not only how to solve ODEs, but also concepts that we'll apply to other subjects in math in the future. He was a very funny lecturer and going to class never felt like a duty, even though it was in an inconvenient time in relation to the rest of my schedule. I came out of the semester really thinking of switching my major from physics to math and it's highly due to the quality of this class.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "Take it with Stefan if you can! Fantastic guy, very approachable, funny, and definitely a closet genius. For a semi-dry subject like ODEs, the professor really makes or breaks the class - and Stefan definitely makes it. Just keep him on his toes by asking questions when he rips through difficult problems too quickly!",
    "Yes I would. It is a very good course and differential equations has a lot of applications in the real world.",
    "It was a great class, which focused mainly on techniques - or \"tricks\" - as Stefan called them, for solving different kinds of ordinary differential equations. I would recommend this to a fellow student.",
    "Definitely take Math 246 with Stefan! He connects really well with students and makes class pretty entertaining considering the subject. Not a heavy workload for an applied math\/physics class.",
