    "This course made me more conversant with both theoretical and experimental work in pragmatics and showed me the bearing that experimental work has on theoretical work. I also learned to conduct my own original analysis of pragmatic phenomena. A pleasant surprise was that the course required no prior familiarity with semantics or the technical machinery employed therein, although those who were familiar with that literature could pursue their interests in the term paper.",
    "This class gave me a good sense of the debates and areas of research in pragmatics, mostly focusing on scalar implicature."

   "comments": [
    "The primary strength of this course was its sheer scope. I felt by the end of the semester that I had a very good sense of where the pragmatic literature on implicature stood; at the same time, I did not feel our treatment of any of the topics we covered was superficial. Another strength of the course was its embrace of experimental work; this is something I wish more courses in philosophy would do, since experimental work has (or should have) great bearing on theorizing. One last strength of the course was that I thought it was accessible even to those without prior background in semantics or pragmatics (then again, I did have such background, so perhaps I am not the best judge). The primary weakness of the course was that it did not demand enough from students on a week to week basis. Too often class time consisted in simply summarizing or presenting (either by the professor or other students) of assigned reading. I feel strongly that students should be expected to have done and understood the reading prior to class and that class time should be used to evaluate the arguments presented in the reading. One other minor criticism was that although we spent a substantial amount of time on experimental work, that segment of the class arrived too late in the semester. In particular, I wonder whether some students might have pursued experimental work for their term projects if we had started looking at experimental prior to Spring Break.",
    "Great readings and good class discussion. I would have liked slightly more structure, and maybe one extra assignment earlier in the term."

    "Probably. I definitely would recommend taking a class with Professor Horn to anyone interested in Pragmatics or philosophy of language. I felt like the class had a lot of thought provoking discussion but never felt overwhelmed by busywork or anything.",
    "This course offers a comprehensive overview of the state of the current scholarship on implicature. Although a lot is covered, it is done so in an in-depth and non-cursory manner. One highlight of note was the segment of the coursed devoted to experimental pragmatics; it was intriguing to see Larry, a theoretical giant in the field, consider the bearing that experimental results had on theoretical work. Despite what the Blue Book might say to the contrary, this course requires no prior exposure to semantics or pragmatics; Larry made this clear on day one. One feature of the course that might frustrate interested philosophy students is that there is not much class discussion.",
    "Yes, take this course."
