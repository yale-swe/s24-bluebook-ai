   "comments": [
    "This class is great if you want to do the reading -- and it's not that hard to do. Additionally, it's a really, really, really good way to get a rest of world credit. Most ROW's are boring and\/or on a highly specific sub-field. Professor Van Vleck is really fun, and her class is accessible to someone with little formal background on the 1960s.",
    "Definitely",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I knew next to nothing about the sixties coming into the class, and by the time it ended I had a wide range of insights about what the sixties meant for people around the world. The readings were different and interesting, class presentations were great, and I even enjoyed writing my term paper because we were encouraged to really find a topic we loved and were guided through the writing process. This was my first junior history seminar and it was all-around excellent.",
    "HIST 411J examines social movements around the world in a single decade, the 1960s. Topics included the Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam War, the SDS, Paris& Berlinin 1968, Chicago '68, Mexico City '68, the right-wing movement in the U.S., and feminism& sexual liberation.I would definitely recommend the class because it will change the way you understand the 1960s. We all seem to intuit some understanding of the 1960s, but most of us haven't grappled with the decade in a scholarly way... and such examination leads to surprising insights and conclusions about the left-wing (and right-wing) movements.It's also a great class to learn more about historical methodology, historical memory, writing, and analysis. Professor Van Vleck structured the class in such a clear, organized way that it's easy to extract broader themes, approaches to history, etc. She gives such fair and thoughtful feedback on papers that it's easy to integrate her suggestions into your final paper.In short, take it!",
    "Very good class in which you get a very good sense of rebellions in an international and domestic context.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I thought that the Global 1960s was a fantastic course! I learned a lot from the amazing syllabus and thoroughly enjoyed the guidance provided by Professor Van Vleck, both during class discussions and in working on my term paper. I thought one of the courses' greatest strengths was the syllabus. It was one of the best I have ever had in a course of Yale due to the variety and diversity of primary and secondary sources that lent themselves to meaningful conversations each week and a cohesive feeling week to week. The class opened my eyes to seeing transnational history in a whole new way, helping to inform my understanding of the interrelatedness of the events that took place in the US, France, Mexico, Germany, China, Vietnam, and the USSR during the Sixties. Definitely take it!",
    "Amazing."
