   "comments": [
    "Dr. G is a very entertaining lecturer, and the labs as a whole are not too bad. Writing up reports can be really time-consuming, but the concepts are not hard. Don't dread it, don't procrastinate, and you'll get through OK.",
    "An easy introduction to lab work at Yale. If you want a course where you would like to familiarize yourself with Yale's labs and expected lab techniques, this is an easy way to get that exposure. The labs are boring sometimes though.",
    "It teaches you how to do titrations and various other experimental procedures but you don't really learn about chemistry.",
    "Yep definitely.",
    "The class is an introduction to using various lab techniques to analyze chemical properties through experimentation. This class should definitely be taken alongside a chem class.",
    "This course is pretty transparent. You know how much work you need to do to earn good grades on the reports and pre-lab quizzes, and there are few surprises. Sometimes the labs can be a little frustrating or boring, but overall this course is a good exposure to lab procedure. Might be a little too much work for .5 credits unless you're pre-med, though.",
    "DEFINITELY take this class concurrently with 114 or 112. Dr. Ganapathi is incredible, and it also makes a lot of sense out of the lecture. The lab reports can be time consuming, and often this half credit is as much work as other full credit classes.",
    "I would recommend this course without hesitation. Chemistry 116 will introduce you to the laboratory and get you primed for higher level labs for sure.",
    "Chemistry 116 is a lot of work and tedious while you're doing labs. But in hindsight, it wasn't that bad and teaches you interesting techniques that you rarely hear about. It helps cultivate a scientific mind and also helps with your scientific writing.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It is a fairly easy and straightforward way to get the lab credit, but is also interesting when you understand what you are doing.",
    "The labs get annoying and the quizzes are also not too easy. Do not take it just because you think it would be fun.",
    "It was a fun course, which really taught me a lot of practical skills and theoretical knowledge in a very engaging manner. I would whole-heartedly recommend it.",
    "This is a fun course, as I think most labs are. It is a pretty large time commitment for only a half a credit. Most labs don't take the full four hours to finish, but the lab reports and preparation still take a pretty decent amount of time to finish. Dr. G is a great professor and if you are taking chem114, you should definitely take this lab since it clarifies a lot of concepts that you learn in class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Most of the labs are relatively interesting, and taking this course means that you get a lot of experience with common lab techniques, as well as writing extensive lab reports. The final practical exam is also not very difficult as long as you follow the direction in the manuel to a T.",
    "This is a fine lab course. Just make sure you get a good\/lenient TA! I had a very difficult TA and the entire course was a frustrating uphill battle, trying new tactics and spending hours every week to get a better score on my lab reports (but to no avail).",
    "A great lab course that should be taken concurrently with lecture. While the write ups were long, they were completely manageable.",
    "CHEM 116L was probably the class I had to work the most for, mostly because of the la reports. They require a lot of time and the grading is hard. I recommend the class to a fellow student as an accompaniment to the CHEM 112 or 114 lecture classes.",
    "i wouldn't recommend it to someone who didn't need to take it for a pre-med\/major requirement",
    "Good first lab to take to understand how lab classes work at Yale: reasonable workload, pretty reasonable grading system.",
    "It's alright. I wouldn't take it if I didn't have to, but it is not that bad. Some experiments are actually pretty fun. The only thing that kills is how much time each experiment takes. Prepare to be there for a couple of hours.",
    "Chemistry 116L is the lab with either Chem114 or Chem112. It is a very understandable course that helps you learn the applications of what you are learning in your chemistry course. I found the class very enjoyable. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "I dreaded going to this class every day of the week, but when I actually got there it was never that bad. The labs are usually fun and not too hard, and you are given far more time than you need.",
    "I would only recommend this course for someone who needs it for their major.",
    "Only take the lab if you need the credit. otherwise it is too technical and time consuming for only .5 credits",
    "Required lab course for most science majors. It has some very fun experiments, but takes up a lot of time. Don't do a Friday lab.",
    "yes it is not too hard and it is great to learn how to use all the lab material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was fun, useful, and the professor has been my favorite at Yale so far! Dr. G's funny comments make it easy to remember the lecture content, which is also clear, concise, and easy to understand. Chem 116 Lab was a great experience!",
    "This class may seem like a waste of time sometimes, but stick with it, it is pretty beneficial in retrospect. The lab reports can be pretty annoying but do deepen your understanding of chemistry.",
    "Something you have to take. So yes I would recommend it.",
    "It is a very useful lab when paired with chem 112.",
    "Chemistry 116 was an excellent class and I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student. Dr. G was a very engaging professor who put helped me apply concepts that I learned in Chem114.",
    "Definitely take this if you're in CHEM 112 or CHEM 114-- it's easier than lecture , in my opinion, and will help your performance in it.",
    "If you are interested in chemistry and science in general, take this class and you won't be disappointed.",
    "Great class to test your knowledge of Chemistry. It really helps you understand the topics covered in 114 a lot more.",
    "Most of those who are looking to takethis lab are probably doing it for their major or for pre-med. Many of the labs are based on titrating and the reports are sometimes a pain to write, but overall, it's a good introduction to carrying out experiments in a lab.",
    "At the beginning of the semester, I was told that chem lab went hand-in-hand with what we were being taught in class, and therefore reinforced the material. I did not find this to be true. However, I think lab experience is important, so I would recommend this to anyone taking chemistry. It's a whole side of chemistry you don't get in just a lecture.",
    "Practical Lab Course. Puts concepts learned in class, into effect.",
    "I definitely recommend this lab. The lab work isn't too hard and the lab reports are manageable even if they require some time. You also get a lot of help if you need it.",
    "I would recommend taking 116L along with 114 or 112 because it was helpful to practice the concepts we were learning about in lecture.",
    "i would only if you have to for pre-med or something. it can be a pain. Dr. G is a delight, but it is a fair amount of work.",
    "If you need to take it for requirement, its doable and a managable A- (though the 95% and up A is tough). If you don't have to take it -- dont. You wont enjoy it and its too much work.",
    "A lot of work for a half credit, but necessary if you want to be pre-med or anything like that. The lab really does help with Chem 114 though, as you remember concepts much better after you do work and calculations with the material in the lab.",
    "I would recommend it, though I would caution that the student always start lab reports ahead of time, as they often took more time than would be expected at first. The course was effective as a reinforcement of concepts learned in Chemistry 114, and it also taught lots of necessary skills for any student wishing to go further in the sciences.",
    "This lab was an ok lab course. Most of the time you were basically given the conclusion for the experiment beforehand so conducting the experiments were rather repetitive.",
    "I would recommend 116L; it really helps with the concepts in class, and, if you're pre-med, you need it anyway.",
    "I would recommend this course for students who feel that they need a refresher on basic lab techniques.",
    "I would recommend it to visualize and understand a lot of the abstract concepts learned in Chem 114.",
    "I would recommend this course to be taken along with chem 114. It relates the concepts well.",
    "Take it if you need it for premed or a major. it doesn't help reinforce concepts in lecture, and reports are a drag.",
    "A good introductory lab course-- I learned many lab skills and found it extremely useful. Also, the experiments generally took oly about 1 and a half or 2 hours maximunm, so it doesnt drag on forever.",
    "Great course, take it as a prerequisite but helpful!",
    "Yes, Dr. G is ilarious.",
    "Chem 116 is a good class to take concurrently with Chem 114. The grading is easy (most people get As or A-s) and Dr. G is very entertaining. The class improves your confidence and skills in the laboratory.",
    "I would tell the student that as far as lab goes, 116 L is very manageable and almost even enjoyable!",
    "Chemistry 116 is a good course to take simultaneously with Chemistry 114, because it deals with topics at the same time and is a very good supplement. It is sort of a lot of work, because some of the lab reports take a while, and this can be frustrating. However, it is very easy to do well in the course if you understand what is going on.",
    "I would recommend taking this lab in conjunction with Chem 114 because some of the concepts covered are the same, and it makes sense to fulfill both requirements at the same time.",
    "This course is a great companion to the lecture course.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who is interested in chemistry, or who wants to go to graduate school.",
    "This is a fun lab course that will provide a well-rounded lab experience without too much stress. Read all labs beforehand and avoid missing any days. While some lab reports are lengthy, others are simple or nonexistent.",
    "Yes. Fulfills the requirements and interesting, but requires a lot of work and planning to complete the lab reports and prepare for the weekly test on time.",
    "Chemistry 116 is worth it! I liked it much more than Chem 114 and would take it on its own if I could. Labs are very long and tiring, but they are also very interesting and fun-- its cool to be able to focus on something for a long stretch of time. However, if you dread labs and long hours in them, you should not take this class.",
    "The labs are a fair amount of work, but it's worth putting the time into doing them.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It was, overall, a very informative, fun course.",
    "I would recommend Chemistry 116L 01 to a student who is pursuing a science based major or interested in chemistry.",
    "Yes, it's a great course with experiments that are actually quite fun. Just be prepared to kind of cram information so you can do well on the quizzes (like memorizing equations and such). Also, be prepared for easy lab reports that just take a lot of time.",
    "For those who have never worked in a serious lab before, Chem 116 is a high-stress, nerve-racking lab course. The pre-lab quizzes are always difficult and the experiments allow plenty of room for error that can force students to simply start all over--a very, very stressful but frequent occurrence. However, Dr. Ganapathi is a witty and insightful lab instructor who provides straightforward direction about how to complete the experiments. And, although they are not the most positive experiences, the experiments teach self-reliance and development of individual skills.",
    "Seriously, take this class only if you have to. I actually more or less enjoyed it, but it is way to much work for a half-credit, and by the end of each lab, you will want to punch something. It is just too long and too time-consuming to be actually fun.",
    "This is a basic lab course that gives you a great introduction to the lab techniques and equipment used in Chemistry. It helps to solidify concepts from Chem 114 so I think it does help to take them together. The material is laid out for you and so if you're good at following directions and understanding the purposes and concepts of each lab you'll do well.Yes I would recommend the course to another student. The workload is manageable and Dr. G is a fantastic lecturer. I wouldn't take this course on a Friday though if you can avoid it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it because it is interesting and the foundational teaching of lab work is essential.",
    "This is a course that you should take only if you are pre-med or having trouble conceptualizing the topics in 112 or 114. It's an unnecessarily big time commitment that only counts for half a credit, so if you're looking for a hands-on science experience, you're probably better off working in a real lab somewhere. That said, if you do take 116L, make sure you request (schedule permitting) a Tuesday or Wednesday lab day, because the lab reports can be a huge pain in the neck without the weekend to work on them.",
    "Although the course is very time-consuming and frustrating in that it is only worth a half-credit, it's a great course to take. Taking the course makes the regular Chem 114 make more sense. The labs are relatively easy--Dr. G explains them really well--but the lab reports can take anywhere from 1 hour to 5 hours to complete. It can be fun though--the procedures aren't complicated at all. You'll love titrations after the course.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone who could avoid it. It is a necessary hurdle for those who want to get into higher level courses or have an eye toward pre-med or something of this nature. But it was generally a lot of tedious grunt work.",
    "Chemistry 116L is an effective course that introduces many basic and essential laboratory skills. The course, especially due to the lab reports, can be very time-consuming at times. The expectations for laboratory write-ups can often be confusing, due to a lack of explanation by the instructor. The course is necessary and has my recommendation to other students.",
    "Good lab course. Not too difficult but not boring. I would recommend the course to other students because it actually is helpful in understanding what's going on in Chem 112 or 114.",
    "Chem 116 is a good intro lab course, and it should definitely be taken in conjunction with Chem 114 because it reinforces a lot of the same material, but from a different perspective, which is interesting. Lab reports do not actually take as long as expected, and it is very easy to get a good or perfect grade on them. On the other hand, you actually have to read the lab manual before going to lab, since the pre-lab quizzes can be difficult. I would definitely recommend taking it with Chem114. Dr. G.'s a great professor. Some of the T.A.'s are better than others; some are really lenient with their grading and others are harsher, so your grade can also partly depend on your T.A.'s style.",
    "This course is a great way to start lab experience at Yale. The T.As are nice and very helpful. Dr. G is amazing and extremely funny. Although lab is long and sometimes very frustrating, it is a change of pace from the normal class. It is nice doing some hands-on practice on what we go over in lecture.I would definitely recommened this lab to another student.",
    "I would recommend it because it was very enjoyable. Althoughit did take a lot of time, it taught me the basics and techniques of working in a lab.",
    "If you are taking Chem 114, I would definitely recommend supplementing the lecture with the lab. Chemistry 116L let's you perform some basic laboratory skills, and, although it's a lot of work, it definitely pays off. Try to find a friend to take lab with because the time will pass by much faster and be really enjoyable.",
    "It's not that much work. Lab reports probably take about 2 hours to complete, then you have to study for the labs beforehand. Not a lot of work and if you complete all your assignments, you get an easy A - B+",
    "Yes, I would recommend the Chemistry 116 Lab to another student, especially one taking the Chemistry 114 lecture because I feel like it really helped me understand basic concepts of chemistry and made chemistry as a subject seem more interesting.",
    "This course is great for those interested in chemistry at any level (as a subject, major, career, etc). Lab is definitely manageable and enjoyable and is an excellent complement to Chem 114.",
    "Chemistry 116L can be a good experience if you make it one. Some of the labs were kind of fun while others were just tedious. Expect lots of titrations, which seem to be the theme of this course. Dr. G is great.",
    "Half credit course that is alot of work and pretty pointless but most people take it because of some requirement. So take it if you need it or want to do annnoying and pointless experiments.",
    "There's no way around it; chem 116L is tedious. Dr. G is fun (but anal when it comes to grading, so watch out!), so at least that makes it a little more enjoyable. Hope that you get a good TA. The lab reports can take up a lot of time if you procrastinate. Try to get into a section with friends; that will make it slightly more tolerable.",
    "Standard chemistry lab. Lots of work in that those lab reports will take up a lot of your time. Take it if you have to.",
    "This does require a lot of work, but it is a fun class. The labs aren't particularly entertaining, but it is nice to use the knowledge gained in the chem lectures in the lab.",
    "I would say that Chemistry 116L 01, more commonly known as Chem Lab, was your basic introductory course. Professor Ganapathi is a joy to have as a professor (this statement may change based on my grade...jk). It seems that one's TA really determines how one perceives of the class. If you have a good TA, you will surly enjoy the class more than if you didn't. I can't tell you much about how to tell apart a good TA from a bad one, for I had a good one. The lab reports could be tedious and the weekly quizes are truly annoying but also truly necessary. In all, I would recommend Chem Lab to another student based on my above comments.",
    "Chemistry 116L is a comprehensive laboratory component to Chemistry 114. Concepts introduced in lecture are explored further in the laboratory and each experiment is both interesting and challenging. expect one \"lab report\" per week that may take up to 5 hrs or more to complete. I would recommend Chemistry 116L to any student taking Chemistry 114 with an interest in the applications of general chemistry.",
    "Chem 116L is a great confidence-builder. It makes you feel more comfortable carrying out experiments on your own. Also, it makes the Chem 114 Lecture come to life. You can observe what is being taught in lecture. I highly recommend it.",
    "Yes, most organized science lab at Yale",
    "It is a basic introduction to the chemistry lab. It is fun, easy to get an A in, and it really isn't a lot of work outside of the lab. Yes, I would recommend the class, especially if the idea of a lab intimidates you.",
    "The labs aren't that difficult. You could definitely make an A if you wanted to. You just have to skim over the lab procedures beforehand and remember to study for prelab quizzes. I took the class because Im premed, and sometimes the lab reports were stressful. In fact, the lab reports were very difficult, but as long as you don't wait until the last minute you will be fine. The lab reports usually aren't that difficult; they're just kind of long and boring. They just require you to type a lot of information from your prelab notes and sometimes a lot of calculatations. However, if you come to Dr. G with a question, he is more than willing to answer it.",
    "I would recommend Chem 116L to another student. It should only be taken with another chemistry course and should only be taken if the student is willing to commit a lot of time to the course, but it is an enjoyable course, and makes Chem 114 more interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class to pre-med majors. It is required for admission to med school. It is a very time consuming class for only .5 credit.",
    "This was an intro lab course for Chem. I would reccomend it because I learned some important lab skills that I hadn't known from high school.",
    "This course is a great way to better understand the concepts of general chemistry.",
    "Try to get the 1-5 pm lab rather than the 12-4 pm lab, because its more convenient. Also, try to get Jennifer Nguyen as your T.A. She's great and very helpful. You can also e-mail her after the lab to get further help. do NOT put off the lab report until the night before its due; do it while the material is still fresh, it's much easier.",
    "It's not exactly difficult, just time consuming. Make sure you put forth the effort...but if you do, an A or A- is definitely within reach.",
    "I would recommend taking this class along with 114 because the two go well together, but it requires a substantial amount of work to do well on the lab reports.",
    "This course is very manageable: the quizzes can be easily studied for and the lab reports can be finished within 2 days.",
    "Chem 116L covers largely mundane, but necessary, information and skills. It was often difficult to understand the relevance of our lab tasks. However, it is relatively straightforward and can be managed if one needs to take it as a requirement. I would not recommend it to another student if it is not a requirement. The instructors do a lot with very dry material.",
    "Chemistry 116L is a fun course that'll help any student (who seriously applies himself) gain a greater understanding of the world of chemistry. I would recommend it to any student that has an interest in the subject of chemistry.",
    "This was a really good lab. I would recommend it.",
    "It is challenging but at the same time rewarding. And if you have to do it, approach it with excitement, it makes it all the easier.",
    "Yes, take this course. It is fun and you learn a lot. It is challenging at times but also very rewarding.",
    "Yes, I definitely would recommend this class to another student because it is a great way to expose yourself to a lab surrounding and learn the basic concepts of chemistry and how to handle essential equipment in the laboratory.",
    "It makes for a long day, but is ultimately a good course. Fun and hands-on.I would recommend it.",
    "Chemistry 116 L is a great supplement to Chemistry 114 and I would recommend this course to anyone interested in pursuing a science \/ pre-med track or anyone who is generally interested in research. Chemistry 116L attempts to introduce the general student body to many of the skills, tools, and techniques that are necessary in order to fix real life problems and better understand our world.",
    "I recommend this course to a student who enjoys being the lab. Also, if a student is looking to simply fulfill a lab requirement, this course is not very time-consuming since the accompanying lab manual provides step-by-step directions to write up the lab report.",
    "It seems very easy but the grading curve is high and annoying. The final felt like it was based on luck and most of the grade.",
    "it is a year of inorganic chem lab, with good skills taught.",
    "Yes",
    "Chem 116 is an introductory lab class that builds your knowledge of lab procedures.",
    "Fun hands on course. Take with a intro chemistry class. Easy if you are good with your hands and can follow directions well.",
    "It is a useful course to take along with Chemistry 114, and very manageable. I would recommend taking the lab.",
    "Accompanies Chem114 or 112, and is a pre-med requirement. Therefore is somewhat of a necessity. Not too bad though, once you get the hang of certain things. Don't be afraid to ask the TA or Dr.G questions. Lab reports don't take too too long but are sometimes a major time preoccupation. Overall, an ok experience, if you like labs then you will definately like this one.",
    "I would suggest taking it only in order to complete a requirement.",
    "definitely take this course. great for pre-med freshmen",
    "you need chem 116L for most science majors and it's a fun experience, especially compared to the lecture course.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chemistry 116 and I would definitely recommend taking it concurrently with Chemistry 114 (or 112)because alot of the concepts you discuss in Chemistry 114 or 112 are realized in Chemistry 116. Being able to use concepts really reinforces the lesson and allows you to better understand situations described in the text book or on tests.",
    "The lab is much more fun than the lecture, but really doesn't provide any knowledge that helps with the lecture.Dr. G is very fun!",
    "Chem 116L introduced me to basic lab techniques. It was much easier and more fun than I thought it would be. The labs are pretty basic, but I found it really satisfying to see my accuracy improve as the semester progressed.",
    "I would say it's a good class to take. I'd tell them to always come to lab prepared. I would recommend it because it's a great intro to other lab courses.",
    "A great laboratory course! Really helps with the basics of laboratory work and appropriately combines experiments with chemical concepts learned in class. The experiments are actually pretty fun and the 4 hours go flying by!",
    "wouldn't take it just to take it, because it is a lot of work for just a half credit."
