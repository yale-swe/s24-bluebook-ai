    "Maria is a good teacher. It helps if you speak up in class and try to participate even if you get some answers wrong. Some days there is a lot of homework and other days their isn't, and sometimes it is checked in class and sometimes not. All in all, it's a fine req class. I recommend taking the quizzes and tests seriously because their aren't that many and it's very easy to skip studying on one and see your grade drop greatly.",
    "I think Spanish L2 is a good course to take if you want to continue learning Spanish.",
    "A lot of homework\/preparation for next class, but it means you get more out of each class period. The class periods, though they meet every day, have a tendency to go by quickly.",
    "I would summarize Spanish 120 as a fun class on which to build upon the foundation of Spanish 110. It's enjoyable and the work load is very manageable. In addition, it's incredibly gratifying to realize that after only 2 semesters of Spanish, you are able to read passages of famous Spanish books, converse on a wide range of subjects in the past, present, and future tenses, and to cover cultural material in a formal presentation.",
    "L2 is definitely more work than L1, but still manageable of course. If you are thinking of taking Spanish you likely are doing it because you need to, so now it comes down to which professor, and I definitely recommend Professor Asensio. Most Spanish teachers seem to be very good, and Professor Asensio is a great teacher who truly wishes for her students to understand the material. What I found most beneficial was how understanding she was. She helped make class very enjoyable. I have learned a vast amount of grammar this term and did so in a fun, friendly environment. You will not regret taking her section.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to learn Spanish grammar. If you want to be fluent, take the class, then go to Spain."
