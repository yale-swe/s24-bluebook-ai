   "comments": [
    "I found this to be a good section, well-lead, definitely a solid choice. Professor Gilmore is exceedingly competent and willing to steer the discussion and to share his ideas as well as making insightful critiques of the points that others make.",
    "Yes, definitely. Although its usually the most unfamiliar section of DS, Philosophy definitely grows on you and turns out really interesting.",
    "Gilmore is an excellent professor. He is very nice and very good at explaining complicated philosophical concepts; I would not have understood half of what we read without his help.",
    "Ended the semester feeling much more comfortable with philosophical inquiry. Prof. Gilmore makes the material stick with you.",
    "DRST 003 is a survey of Western philosophy from Plato to the 13th century, with much more emphasis on Plato and Aristotle than on the Roman and Christian writers on the syllabus. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in philosophy; the course is one good way to learn the vocabulary& methods of philosophy, albeit from a fairly specific perspective. Rumors to the contrary, the workload is moderate and shouldn't discourage anyone seriously interested and reasonably well-prepared in the humanities from taking DS.",
    "It's pretty much boot camp in the western tradition. I would recommend this class if you are willing to put up with the 2-3 insufferable students that you will have in your sections.",
    "It's a great introduction to philosophy.",
    "Directed Studies Philosphy is a good class. I learned a lot about the subject of Philosphy, which is useful because I realized that before I did DS I didn't really have a good grasp of what philosophy actually entails. I feel much more informed now, both about the philosphers we studied and about the subject in general. The papers were difficult at first but very interesting to write.Professor Gilmore is very good. He talks a lot in class, so the members of the class speak relatively less, so if you are someone who absolutely needs to be discussing things all class then you might prefer someone else. However, I really liked that he talked so much because he actually knows what he is talking about, and many of the texts were complicated enough that I would much rather hear what Prof. Gilmore has to say about them than my classmates' less reliable opinions. He is helpful when you contact him for extra advice outside of class.",
    "It is the most thought provoking experience in the whole of DS. Enjoy the ride.",
    "Philosophy is very new for most of us and for me it was very confusing. Professor Gilmore is very nice and very witty and knows philosophy very well. I found the readings to be very challenging and constantly felt confused in DS philosophy, though this was somewhat due to the quick pace and incomprehensibility of the philosophical texts we were reading and not so much due to Professor Gilmore. The lectures were sometimes very helpful but often confusing.",
    "Directed Studies Philosophy was an excellent introduction into philosophy. Impressively, reading the books in context, supplemented by lectures and section, allows seemingly inscrutable philosophical concepts to be relatively easily understood. Often, the lunch after section would be spent discussing the big issues the professor and the text had raised.The workload was far and away the least of any of the DS courses, consisting of about 60-90 pages of reading a week. That said, they were very dense and complex pages.Ultimately, I would recommend this course to anyone looking to study philosophy",
    "It's hard to answer this question outside of the context of all of DS. If you want to be challenged and work hard but take a huge amount out of your freshman fall, do it. Philosophy probably broadened my view of everything the most out of the three courses, mostly because everything was new to me. It was far from easy, but well worth the effort."
