    "Excellent guest speakers!",
    "Frances B was the instructor of this course, not Mr. Crane. Frances is the Bomb. She's the best. And this class was awesome.",
    "The reason I mentioned that this course is a particularly valuable is because as a scientist I don't think that there was a lot of focus on how people who are in the scientific field can help in the fight against climate change. Heidi Cullen was really the only representative, in the course had a pretty distinct policy bent.",
    "This course is obviously unique, but I am very glad that it was offered. It helped me to think about the type of environmental career I hoped to pursue. I was very pleased with the course.",
    "Frances was our instructor not Peter--it was obviously a very non-traditional course but a fantastic array of speakers and conversations for those interested in environmental justice and environmental communications.",
    "Firstly, Peter Crane should NOT be listed as the instructor but instead it should be Frances Beinecke. This is an unfortunate error because the dean was only there a handful of times and the course was clearly run by Frances. There is no way to evaluate Frances' excellent leadership in this course because of this administrative oversight and so I'd like to state here that she commanded each week's lecture very well, able to respond to students' comments and questions and linking it back to the speaker very gracefully.",
    "Peter Crane was generally absent from the course sessions. Frances Beinecke introduced all speakers and hosted the discussion afterward. The questions would have been more relevant had they asked about Frances.",
    "I declined to answer Q's 8-10 because Dean Crane wasn't really present in this class. Frances Beinecke was great and I would give her... Q8 - 2 Q9 - 3 Q10 - 2"

   "comments": [
    "The diversity of the speakers. Consistently interesting and organized.",
    "I really enjoyed our discussions about the importance of diversity \/ the current lack of representation in climate change discussion. Many of the speakers were both inspiring and informative.",
    "The diversity in the backgrounds of the speakers and areas of focus on addressing climate change.",
    "Loved Rev Yearwood, Cullen, Mair",
    "The best aspects of this course were the extremely knowledgeable people who were brought in to speak and the interactions between speak and the audience.",
    "The food. Also offering up such an awesome panel of speakers on climate change. This class was a lot of fun. And I don't mean that in a pejorative way. Policy is made by schmoozing. And this class offered us the opportunity to get together, over food and drinks, with friends, members of the community, and distinguished speakers, and share ideas. It was a blast.",
    "The opportunity to hear from and interact with individuals working in different spheres of climate action was invaluable. Being connected to what is happening off campus makes on-campus learning all the more important.",
    "Simply the diversity of different people that came to speak at FES this fall. They all give very enlightening talks all very different but very thought-provoking. I wish we would've had more time to discuss the speakers with Francis throughout the semester, I was really disappointed that only four people showed up to the one discussion section that was scheduled. I also would've really like to talk about the personalities and skills of the individuals that came to speak and how those skills in experiences that they had ultimately led them to the career that they have. I think more of the focus was on whether each organization had positions and skills that they were looking for. But I found that I would've liked to know a little bit more about the speakers that didn't share so much about their background.",
    "The diverse array of speakers with different theories of change was this course's greatest asset. It allowed me to leave this course with a newfound understanding of the complexities of making environmental change and the myriad ways of seeking that change. Frances Beinecke's participation in the course was also a huge asset. She brought a helpful and realistic perspective to all aspects of the course.",
    "We heard from so many fascinating people about so many fascinating things!",
    "It was great to be exposed to so many different environmental leaders.",
    "Really fantastic set of speakers brought in!",
    "A true diverse selection of speakers were presented. From ethnic to professional diversity, it was very well put together and every week had a different angle of the story. There were those with more power than others or more experience than others, but it was a welcomed breath of fresh air from the traditional FES courses in that it was grounded very much in reality and it painted the way the world will look when all of us graduate from FES. It provided a sense of real world issues, even oftentimes in arenas outside of the environmental sciences.",
    "The ability to hear from a multitude of speakers currently in the environmental arena was great. The one-on-one dinners after some of the sessions provided great opportunities to talk to the speakers and become more familiar with their work.",
    "Great networking opportunities for students interested in the field.",
    "This class was great--best aspects were bringing in people of color working in the environmental field and hearing what they're doing, their stories, and what they think needs to change.",
    "The amazing group of speakers that Frances put together and getting to have dinner with a few of them.",
    "This course was a fantastic introduction to issues of diversity and climate justice within the environmental sphere. I felt this course exposed many to the intersections of race, class and environmentalism for the first time. It was amazing to have the opportunity to talk to such important people within the movement and I learned so much!"

Especially when thinking about how to summarize one's ideas in the position paper, discussions like this would've been helpful.",

    "It was a great half course to supplement an undergraduate environmental studies course I am taking called Climate Change Communications for Public Policy.",
    "Climate change and its impacts are of grave concern for public health. All MPH students should be required to take this course!",
    "This course I think is valuable not so much for my program but just for general understanding of the climate change realm. I think many students are focusing on this topic in their studies in FES but I'm not one of those people.",
    "As an undergraduate hoping to pursue a career in the energy field, I found this course helpful in thinking about the costs and benefits to working on issues of sustainable energy in different sectors (government, NGO, business).",
    "I am interested in environmental policy and before FES I had a very different set of experiences that led me to look at the grassroots environmental movement differently. By the end of this course, I have a newfound respect for what all the different leaders of the movement are doing and furthermore, I have incorporated their ideas and successes directly in my other classes. I think the views presented were very well done because each person came from a different path that led them to their current position and each one had a story that people could relate to in a different way. During some weeks perhaps I identified with some more than other speakers, but I always respected what they had to say and it was evident they were passionate about their occupations. It was both educational and inspiring to hear and learn from them and it provided a strong, complementary discourse to my other foundations classes.",
    "I am interested in policy and governance, so hearing about some people currently involved in this arena was helpful. It was also useful hearing about the different things people are doing to combat climate change.",
    "This class was a nice supplement to my courses and a great was to hear from professionals in the field.",
