    "Intersectionality and Women's Health is a fantastic course! It exposes you to a very important framework for understanding health challenges faced by women in the USA. Marcia is great and it is an honor to take a class with her!",
    "you will regret not taking this class.",
    "An exploration of different intersections of class and race and how they impact the lives and health of women.",
    "This was an exceptional course. The curriculum was varied, challenging, and looked at marginalized and frequently ignored groups - predominantly poor women of color. Marcia is an excellent professor, who, despite being one of the most senior and well-respected faculty at Yale, truly cares about her students as individuals. She brings food every week! The structure of the class involved reading a book every week (a lot, but the reading is so interesting that everybody did it and it never seemed remotely like a chore) and one student each week gives a short presentation on the book, and bring prepared discussion questions. This is great because the discussion never goes off on irrelevant tangents. The grade is based on class participation, weekly short (150 word) reading responses, two 2-page book reviews, leading seminar and preparing questions once, and a 10 page final comparative paper. A truly wonderful academic experience.If you can get in (something like 120 people tried this semester, and she took 15) then TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Yes absolutely take this course. Lots of reading but all of it is necessary to your life and to the course.",
    "Definitely would recommend. One of the best class I've taken in undergrad.",
    "Summary: Close-knit reading seminar of ethnographies about women's health and poverty. Would recommend--an enjoyable space to think through issues of women's health and systemic discrimination in any field.",
    "ANTH 651 is a course that involves reading works primarily written by sociologists and medical anthropologists that explore questions of race, gender, class, and health in the U.S., writing brief responses guided by a question, and discussing the works in class. The class also entails completing three reviews of individual works as well as a final comparative review of multiple books. I would recommend the course to anyone interested in public health, urban ethnography, medical anthropology, and intersections of health, gender, race, and class.",
    "This course is an intensive look at several categories of women's health and the structural inequities that disproportionately affect some groups over others. It is highly recommended.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone interested in how issues of race, class and gender affect health care outcomes.",
    "10\/10 would recommend. A lot of work, but well worth it if the topic interests you."

   "comments": [
    "This increased my knowledge of the field of medicine immensely. It showed me the shortcoming of not only health, but of doctors and nurses. It highlighted how certain policies of healthcare are not conducive to truly helping these populations, highlighted many of the biases that health care workers have towards women of color that ends up affecting the type of care they provide, and how certain treatments do not take into account lifestyle.",
    "As a first-semester anthropology double major (undergrad), this was the most helpful seminar I could have taken. Probably didn't do incredibly grade-wise, but it was worth the rigor.",
    "I'm not a graduate student, so I can't really comment. But for me, it was a great introduction into intersectionality and women's health!",
    "This course is broadly useful, even outside of anthropology. It raises important questions for anyone studying contemporary issues in the urban US. Marcia's own insights regarding ethnographic fieldwork were also very helpful.",
    "The course provided me with a greater idea of the theoretical and methodological frameworks used within the field of medical anthropology. Although I do not plan to write my dissertation primarily within the field of medical anthropology, I do plan to utilize aspects of that field in my work. The course provided me with a solid understanding of the discipline of medical anthropology and provided me with a starting point to find additional works in the field relevant to my specific research interests.",
    "I have been interested in women's health and intersectionality for some time, but I had not had the opportunity to read so many works on the topic until this term. I feel far more prepared to delve more deeply into my research interests now that before taking this course. I know what I have learned will stay with me."
