    "Decent class",
    "This class is good if you want to participate in a lot of class discussion. The readings are very interesting, and the class goes at a good pace. Professor Harkema is very kind and approachable!",
    "Definitely take it! This was a phenomenal course. The readings were fantastic, and the parallel between the literature and Spanish history was interesting and well-presented. We had a small class last semester of like seven people so it was essentially a seminar, and we had a lot of amazing discussions. Profesora Harkema is wonderful and leads discussions really well. It is not an easy class - there's a ton of reading and the papers require work and thought - but definitely worth it! I will really miss this class next semester.",
    "The course is a decent survey of Spanish literature from the 18th to the 20th century, though discussion remains fairly superficial, so you should turn somewhere else if you're looking for intense literary discussions. Leslie Harkema is one of the sweetest, most encouraging teachers around, so you should take her class if you feel nervous about your Spanish skills and need to be taught by a kindly soul. The short assignments are straight-forward and fun, the tests are open-book and fair, and the final research paper requires a good deal of work but was really worthwhile. That being said, I found the class as a whole fairly boring and I do not think I learned much.",
    "I found this class a great way to expose myself to some Spanish authors and practice my Spanish without going through the grind of a grammar class. This class is much more free flowing. Lots and lots of opportunities to speak. Akin to an English lit seminar, only in Spanish.",
    "This course provides a way to look at the history of Spain through the lens of its literary canon. Even though the purpose of this course is not to focus on the mechanics of the language itself, the literary styles covered in this course do serve to improve one's reading skills considerably. The texts are stimulating and relevant."
