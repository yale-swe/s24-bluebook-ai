    "A very informative class! It is quite different from MB&B 300, so watch out! This class is focused on nucleic acids, which seem to be FAR FAR MORE complex than proteins. At least when judging by the amount of material covered in the respective classes. They do emphasize experimental design, technique, and data analysis, so that is pretty interesting. This is not for the faint of heart, though. You will come out of lecture and think, 'holy sh*t, what were they saying?!!?' But then you go back and read the lecture notes (provided by the professors in paper form at each lecture) and do the homework and go to section, and you realize that it is understandable (and really cool). It just takes a little while and a lot of effort. Each lecture is jam packed with info, so keep up! Similarly, the exams cover pretty much anything they cover in lecture, and you better know it all! Watch out, our year there was a severe time crunch for the exams, but there's really no way to prepare for that except for hoping that the professors cut down on the questions. Study those ribozyme and analogous enzyme mechanisms! But overall, you will come out of this class and say, \"Wow, I learned SO much!\"",
    "good class, but you have no choice if you're a MB&B major",
    "Don't take this course (with Steitz, at least) unless you have to. It's incredibly high volume and speed, and the volume isn't even from anything that's relevant. If you need to take it, definitely consider taking molecular biology or genetics beforehand, because only hitting the prereqs for this course will leave you woefully underprepared. They will test you on details that are not emphasized in lecture. Also, you can get the Voet and Voet textbook for free online, so don't waste your money on it.",
    "Extremely difficult, by far the hardest class I've ever taken. Lots of scientific reasoning and thinking involved - make sure you know how to read a gel (a lot more complicated than that sounds=) and always know how to answer the questions asking \"what are the data\" and \"what are the conclusions.\" I don't have much biochemistry lab experience, and it was overwhelming, but don't let that deter you because it's actually a very well taught class, and you realize the material is quite interesting, even when you're overwhelmed to the point of seriously contemplating switching majors. You learn lots about DNA and RNA.",
    "Great, great class! Tough for sure, but excellent.The professors were terrific, the material is fascinating, and the way the content is presented really makes you think critically and helps you become much more science-literate. They constantly present experiments and ask what-are-the-data\/what-are-the-conclusions and over the course of the semester having this all the time was helpful in developing scientific thinking skills. We often learned material by looking at the original data that provided evidence for it, which was cool. Bottom line is biochemistry is amazing, and this class helps you appreciate that.",
    "Mostly MBB majors. Lots of material, but like all classes like this, its mildly cool how much new knowledge you'll have stuffed in your head after the final. Even if you'll likely forget most of it within a week. Tests were a mix of straight memorization (which I'm sure all MBB majors excel at) along with some questions about interpreting data.",
    "This class was a challenge - the most amount of cumulative material I've ever had for a class. The second midterm was probably the second hardest test I've ever taken(the first being that orgo 2 exam where the average was a 19). The class\/tests can be particularly frustrating because I'd spend all week trying to memorize facts and understand concepts, and lots of the time, that wasn't even what was on the test. The tests (mainly the 2nd midterm) kind of test your science intuition and your ability to complete a 2.5 hour test in 1 hour and 15 minutes. It was also REALLY REALLY ANNOYING to have the professors tell us things that we did not need to know, and then see those pop up on the exam (this literally happened three different times). The class was much less organized that MBB 300, and a million different things in the lecture slides blatantly contradict each other. Did I learn a bunch? Yes. Did I get better at understanding experimental data and making conclusions? Yes. Was it worth all the pain, frustration, and endless amount of time studying? I'm not sure, but I'm an MBB major so I didn't really have a choice.",
    "Boring, too much info",
    "Hard, challenging but rewarding.",
    "I'm probably one of the few people in this class that took this class not because I had to for my major (I'm MCDB) but because I really enjoy the style of biochemistry teaching in this department. It is comprehensive, no doubt, and it can really be a struggle to remember all the intricacies that go along with many of the processes we learn. This is a very tough class, but it is also taught very well, which is honestly half the battle. Try and stay on top of your work as much as possible - you do not want to be backed in a corner the day before the exam and realize just how much detail you need to know. Be prepared to memorize but not have the luxury of throwing up facts on the test. These tests really test your ability to think and deduce like a scientist, which I think is a huge huge skill to understand and grasp. Take this class only if you are determined to commit to it, but if you do you will feel incredibly satisfied by the amount of knowledge you have gained.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed this more than MB&B300. The material was just much more interesting (besides the last few lectures, which sort of went a bit off-topic). However, the amount of material builds rapidly. After the 2nd midterm, for example, each lecture had enough material a new midterm could've been written for it, and the tests reflected that. As they couldn't really cover everything, some things were stressed more than others--but there was no way of knowing what, so sometimes the tests felt a bit unfair. Even though there were practice tests, the actual midterms were pretty different, and the topics covered were quite variable. But in the end, though I bet my GPA will take a hit, I feel that I've learned a good amount, and it was a worthwhile experience.",
    "Do not take it unless you absolutely must. The material was interesting, but the class itself was frustrating. The professors didn't explain the material clearly. Homework and test questions were poorly worded.",
    "Very interesting material. Not too much work (problem sets, 2 midterms, 1 final, and quizzes based on that day's lecture which are more for attendance). Midterms were kinda hard but not outrageous. Final was long but decent. Professors are great, and they love engaging with students despite being big names in the field. I definitely recommend taking it, although most of you probably have to.",
    "Incredible class for learning biochemistry--take if you're very interested or an MBB major, though, since it's a lot of work and very difficult.",
    "You're only gonna take this if you're a major. It's really hard, probably the hardest class you will take even as a premed. Really a molecular biology class that is based in teaching you to analyze data and draw conclusions. Fun stuff but you gotta memorize alot and also be able to apply it. If you're not a major but really interested in biological\/biochemical research, you might consider it, but it's probably not worth the B+.",
    "We learned a lot of interesting things in this class, but it was difficult figuring out what was important and what was supplementary. Professor Steitz and Professor Schlieker were great: very approachable and patient with questions. I will say though that I didn\u2019t quite enjoy their lectures as much as in MB&B 300 with Professor Koelle and Professor Simon. There were weekly psets, daily in-class \"quizzes\" (participation grade), two midterms, and a final. The exams really kick butt. Really. Be prepared to try to absorb a LOT of information--some that people in the field don't even know if it's true.",
    "If you are an MBB major, then clearly you must take this class. However, as an MCDB major I recommend taking the class pass\/fail or not at all, unless you are highly interested in DNA\/RNA and are prepared to spend far more time on this class than in the fall 300 lecture.",
    "If you are passionate about biochem or an MB&B major take it.",
    "This is the most information-heavy course I've taken at Yale. However, the exams tested less on regurgitation and more on scientific intuition. It helps if you've worked in a genetics lab before or had experience reading gels. The people in this class are intense but smart; do your best but know that the curve is tough. This course was ultimately rewarding--I've learned so so much about biochemistry!",
    "MB&B 301 is a great class and you learn a lot. However there is a lot of material and we cover it all quickly. A lot of the exams are problem solving and applying what you have learned in lecture which I think is a great alternative although challenging alternative compared to pure memorization that is in a lot of other bio classes. Also almost all of the students are premed or MB&B majors so the curve is kind of hard. I would definitely recommend this course though!",
    "Only if you're up for the challenge. It is a pre-med heavy class, there is a lot of material, but it is very well taught and you will learn a lot.",
    "This is a really interesting course. The material was pretty fascinating. Sometimes I felt that we rushed through the lectures a bit too fast--I wish we could have made sure to answer all the questions on the lecture slides, and I often felt the need to stay after class to understand particular slides we had run through very fast. I think it would have been helpful if outside material was provided for getting used to analyzing the experimental techniques, as it would have made learning that analysis much easier. That being said, I felt that I learned a lot. I found that I was much more adept at reading Molecular Biology papers late in the semester--really understanding what they were talking about and the relevance of their techniques and findings--than I had been at the beginning of the semester. The professors were engaging, passionate about their work, their subject, and their students. The TAs were phenomenal--I think the best I have ever had at Yale.",
    "You probably need to take this class. It is a great class for preparing a foundation for further study.",
    "I thought this was a really terrific course; I learned an enormous amount and enjoyed the class tremendously. I would definitely recommend it to another student, but be aware that it is definitely more challenging than the first semester course and you should only take it if you are genuinely interested in learning about nucleic acid biochemistry and experimental biochemistry and if you are willing to put in the time to make the experience worthwhile for yourself and to really learn the material because there is a lot of it. I found the material to be extremely interesting and comprehensive, providing a fantastic overview of nucleic acid biochemistry and biochemistry in general. I also really appreciated the way that the class really challenged us to think like a scientist, asking the types of critical thinking questions scientists ask on a daily basis while also providing a terrific background in experimental biochemistry and in the many great experiments in the history of the field. Professor Steitz and Professor Schlieker are both moreover exceptional instructors. They are extremely caring, approachable, and endlessly patient with questions. Phenomenal class and phenomenal professors. Enough said.",
    "Take this course! Lots of work, but you will learn so much!"
