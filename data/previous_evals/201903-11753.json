    "Practice in engaging the seminar structure better: preparing my own interpretations as well evaluating the texts over and again - ruminating. Additionally, the structure of the course highlighted the degree to which we are readers\/scholars search for\/enforce coherence in interpretation.",
    "I developed a greater appreciation of Nietzsche's philosophical method, and how it can be read alongside certain post-colonial texts. I also gained a greater sense of what it means to read as a collective, such that the reading develops out of interactions centered on the text. This both expanded my sense of how meaning can be derived from a text and my sense of how different texts themselves can be read together as grounding a similarly collective 'sense.'",
    "The course challenged me to work with texts differently and thoughtfully.",
    "Hard question to answer succinctly! It allowed for practice in engaging with texts closely and deeply without wrestling them into a single timeline or school of thought. It was also one of the best-run seminar environments I've had at Yale, and this is my fourth year taking graduate courses here. Besides a few instances where personal dynamics between classmates seemed to unnecessarily dominate discussion (which the instructor turned into teaching moments once or twice, without it seeming inappropriate or hurtful, which remains truly impressive to me), the seminar was maybe the most collaborative environment I've experienced. It invited commitment, I think.",
    "Close reading, how to lead a class discussion.",
    "Close reading, discussion, analyzing."

   "comments": [
    "It encouraged deep and involved discussion, and had an expansive syllabus. Having the time to dwell'ruminate'on texts was also invaluable, and provided opportunities to really zero in on complex questions. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "\"talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.\" Lady Gaga Truly a brilliant course. And the shit\/vomit part of the Gaga quote are part of Gaga's praise, to be clear. Some strengths I've listed above. Others include the (generally) slow pace of readings, which allowed for actual engagement with ideas and minimized the sort of bullshitting students feel they need to do when their reading is too heavy but participation is required; an evocative mix of authors and genres; an overt pedagogical bent. The only real negative I can think of was the occasional personal dynamics highlighted above.",
    "Less writing makes it harder for students to grow written analysis skills over the semester, but it also allows for deep thought on a single idea.",
    "Prof. Levene is wonderful, she creates a pleasant environment in class that lets the discussion organically grow. Her insights and comments are always very insightful and helpful in organizing, developing or clarifying issues."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Professor Levene is excellent at fostering critical discussion, and any student who has the opportunity to work with her should do so. The readings were thought-provoking and challenging in all the right ways. Each rendition of this course is also likely to be slightly different, depending on what the group brings to the discussionso there's a real opportunity for exploration and pursuing a new, shared intellectual project.",
    "Absolutely. The class is certainly a challenge but it is a unique kind of class and Professor Levene demands a different kind of thinking.",
    "Yes. I took the course on recommendation of two of my professors in a different subfield, not because it looked particularly relevant to what I considered to be my \"project.\" But the course at the bare descriptive minimum is a course about thinking well, both in articulation of one's own thoughts and in collaboration with peers (and the professor, who treated us like peers without forfeiting the appropriate authority relative to her students). On that basis, I would recommend it to anyone with interest in modernity, even if \"modernity\" isn't a conceptual category with which they regularly engage.",
    "Yes. The syllabus organization was excellent.",
    "Prof. Levene is wonderful!"
