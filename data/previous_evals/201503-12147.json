    "Yes I think so, but it is not as amazing as the capstone is projected as being.",
    "This was my first choice capstone project and it was an awesome one. There were not many options for development-focused projects but this was by far the best one that was offered. We had a chance to speak with a lot of development professionals from the field and we got to focus on health systems management which is applicable to a wide variety of development fields; additionally we got a lot of insights into how development projects are put together since we were working on preparatory materials and briefings for a real project that is under development right now. It was very empowering to feel like a part of the project and during the final presentation the client really validated our efforts which was very motivating.",
    "This capstone project was one of the more difficult and frustrating experiences of my Yale careersometimes in good ways, sometimes not. I think part of that was a function of the project that was handed to us by CHAI and the Jackson Institute: it was really problematic that we were working on a project, under the tutelage of someone affiliated with the Global Health Leadership Institute (GHLI) at Yale, that the GHLI was itself bidding to be a partner to. That incestuous aspect of the project really rubbed me the wrong way and made me wonder how much of the extra work we had to go through was simply a function of Yale's\/GHLI's desire to impress CHAI. The exact aim of our project was also not very well defined until more than halfway into the semester, which made it a bit of a moving target. That said, the project was certainly formative and productive. I had never before worked so extensively on a single project in a group of 9 people; while I hope I don't have to ever do it again (group scheduling was an absolute nightmare), it was nonetheless a good exercise in teamwork. Generally speaking, I think a lot of the benefit I derived from this project was non-academic in nature, and so while I appreciate having had the experience, I wish it weren't the sole summative experience for the Global Affairs major.",
    "GLBL 499 is a bumpy ride! Sometimes it feels that we have a direction and know where we are going. Other times we feel lost and this feeling creeps up even the last few days before the final deliverable is due. The strengths of the course, to put it simply, are its students and professor. What team one ends up in greatly shapes the dynamic and experience one has with the capstone. Additionally, it is up to the Professor to guide the students and ensure that they work as a team and that they have an appropriate methodology with which to approach the case at hand. The weaknesses have to be, that it really depends on a single professor whether or not a course is enjoyable. And also that it really depends on the students in the capstone, whether or not the capstone team works as a team. Overall, depending on the capstone the work can be a lot more or a lot less than you expected. My capstone had to put in a lot of work and sometimes into the unholy hours of the night. Just be prepared for the unexpected and speak with seniors\/previous seniors, if possible, to see which professors actually support their students in the capstone.",
    "The course was unstructured at the beginning - the deliverable took some time to shape up. However, thanks to Professor KTS's tireless efforts and the team being AMAZING, everything turned out to be absolutely awesome. Could not have asked for a better capstone experience.",
    "I really enjoyed this capstone course. It teaches you very valuable skills about working in a team and learning about your own strengths and weaknesses. I think that the end product will be very useful and valuable and I felt as though our work could make a tangible difference. This course provides you with skills that will be applicable in any field of study or profession."
