   "comments": [
    "In this course, you learn how to think thoughtfully and engagingly about the Latinx community in New Haven and around the United States. This is one of those life-changing courses offered at Yale, do not miss the opportunity to take it!",
    "Through this course I learned more about the history of latinx presence in new haven and the structural ways cultural racism pervades communities as well as how identity formations take shape in latinx identifying communities.",
    "I learned so much about Latinx history, which is so much broader and incredble than I knew coming into the course.",
    "I really enjoyed the Community Based Learning aspect of this course. It was awesome to have a class that deeply valued community engagement and gave a forum for discussing the actual things happening in the New Haven community, and how the students are engaging with these. I also really appreciated reading fundamental literature in Latinx Studies. The final project was also great because it allowed me to create something that I think will be very valuable, and is very relevant to the work that I am doing. I also really liked taking a course at Yale, of all places, that legitimizes my personal knowledge and experience and gives credit to the work many of us are doing in our communities. Professor Camacho and Professor Rodriguez are amazing and understanding and fantastic professors!",
    "I learned a lot about the city of New Haven but also about the history of latinx immigration to the US and US immigration policy more broadly.",
    "I was able to engage with a number of texts that I had not before, the weekly student presentations were so phenomenal and a great way to learn more even if we don't do the readings ourselves. I appreciated hearing all of the work students were doing in New Haven. I learned about different organizations in New Haven.",
    "I learned how to truly immerse myself in a new and different culture.",
    "Latinx New Haven helped me conceptualize of the formation of an immigrant community with attention to space and diversity."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The reading list and dynamic of the class was always really compelling and the discussions were so good. One weakness was the schedule of the class while I liked the oral presenataikns sometimes they would end up dominating most of the class and discussions became limited because of time constraints.",
    "This is such a great course! The atmosphere is very pleasant, and Camacho is a gem. Everyone participates and you all learn so much from the course material and each other. The community based project is an awesome way to both get involved with local work and learn from the community.",
    "The Community Based Placements were incredibly valuable learning experiences but were somewhat stressful because they were not always very organized. This was mostly a result of factors outside the control of Professor Camacho.",
    "I wish we could have started on our CBLs earlier in the semester. Or I would have liked the class to focus on the CBLs and the Latinx community in New Haven, supplemented by additional readings. At times it felt like the other way around. Like we were reading texts and finding ways that New Haven had connections to the text.",
    "I really wanted more assignments for this one -- just having readings and a final project is bascally a recipe for disaster. With more assignments I would have been better able to critically engage with the material, and I think I would have been able to get to know my instructors better as they gave me feedback. Sometimes I felt like I was wondering around blind in the course material and that what I got out of this class was abstract and superflous.",
    "Strengths: incorporation of various materials, working on projects in the community, looking at a variety of scholarships. Weaknesses: class was a little too large for conversation flow, and at times the conversation was repetitive."

    "In this course, you learn how to think thoughtfully and engagingly about the Latinx community in New Haven and around the United States. This is one of those life-changing courses offered at Yale, do not miss the opportunity to take it! Professor Camacho is amazing and perhaps the best professor you'll ever have.",
    "Yes I would because the CBL project was so interesting and professor camacho is wonderful",
    "This is such a great course! The atmosphere is very pleasant, and Camacho is a gem. Everyone participates and you all learn so much from the course material and each other. The community based project is an awesome way to both get involved with local work and learn from the community.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students because of the community based learning component. I think a lot more classes at Yale should allow\/require community engagement. This class also did it in a fantastic way because it encouraged LEARNING from our community and not going in and trying to make changes and assumptions about the New Haven community, which many Yale community service programs do. The course readings were also valuable in providing a deep understanding of many of the issues Latinx studies engages with, although they were a little dry sometimes and could be on the longer side for some weeks. Overall, it was a great course and was definitely one of my favorites I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "Yes- Professor Camacho is amazing and so is Yami. It was incredibly relevant to current political and social issues.",
    "Yes! Alicia camacho is amazing!",
    "YES!",
    "I liked this class mainly because of the people it attracted. Everyone had some type of tie to the latinx community, and so it was really eye opening to be able to hear their stories of a group of people so close to the class's heart. A necessary, community building class I'd highly recommend!",
    "I think this class is the kind where you get as much as you put in. If you are invested in looking at the formation of the Latinx community in new haven through an academic lens then you will learn a lot and be challenged. However if you choose not to engage you wont learn much."
