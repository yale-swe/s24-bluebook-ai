   "comments": [
    "This is one of the better intro bio modules. Lectures are well taught and straightforward, though sections are quite the opposite. The quizzes actually keep you on top of the information, which feels awful during the semester but is super helpful in the end. The material is really interesting, and Irish discovered much of it herself which makes the course that much more legit. The homeworks are a bit tedious, but reading is definitely not necessary so the course isn't an unreasonable amount of work. Definitely would recommend.",
    "It talks about genes and development and it is very interesting if you pay attention. Study for the quizzes you can do well if you put the time in as the questions are very fair.",
    "I would recommend it to another student if it is a prerequisite for their major or an upper level class that they want to take. It covers a lot of concepts that you probably have to know before going on to take upper level classes in MCDB, MBB, or EEB.",
    "I think that BIOL 103 is as good as an intro class can get, and I would only recommend if it's needed for a pre-med requirement or for a pre-req for other science classes.",
    "The class was a general overview of development and genetics--some parts were more interesting than others. Weekly quizzes were very time-pressured but made studying for the final easier. The research proposal that took the place of problem sets was not as difficult\/overwhelming as it first seemed. Easier to understand and take than BIOL 102.",
    "I would recommend Biology 103 to any student interested in biological sciences.",
    "Yes, it was my favorite of the Biology modules so far, however, it could definitely use some work in terms of lectures and quizzes",
    "BIOL 103 is one of the best classes you will take at Yale, especially if Professor Irish is teaching it. The material is presented in an easy-to-learn fashion, and it never feels like it is too much. Piazza helps when the professor or the TAs answer your anonymous questions. Overall, this is a great class for pre-meds, bio majors, non pre-meds, non-bio majors and non-science majors.",
    "BIOL 103's structure is similar to BIOL 101's structure taught by Anthony Koleske. The lecture slides are clear, the material is sophisticated but also easy to understand, and the quizzes really helped keep students up with the material. I would recommend BIOL 103 to other students.",
    "Professor Irish is, by far, the best BIOL sequence professor. That being said, the bar is incredibly low. Information was interesting, but after the course you come to realize you didn't really learn anything. Best sequence so far; again, the bar is low.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to. Sad that I have to say that... I actually really like biology. The concepts were interesting, however the teacher failed to focus on interesting, technical details. The class was very open ended and supplemented with confused TAs that made it worse. Grading was frustrating as well.",
    "Take the class! Dr. Irish is excellent. I found myself learning new material, despite already having a strong background in this area. The quizzes were much more manageable this year, and I thought the homework was a refreshing change from p-sets. It was a good experience overall, and if you truly like biology, you'll enjoy this course.",
    "Biol 103 was a good review of development and genetics. All material was presented in a clear and very cohesive manner. The weekly quizzes were fair and ensured that you kept up with the material. My only complaint is that every assessment was always a time crunch, including the final.",
    "BIOL 103 is a class on how a embryo develops and how genes relate to it. I would recommend the class to other students because it is a good introduction to interesting topics in biology and it doesn't go overboard on information.",
    "Not fun for a non-science major; perfectly functional as an introductory science course for MCDB etc. Students do one problem set and one scientific paper a week, two lectures, and section. It goes by really fast. Like all the BIOL 101-104 courses, it's very organized, with an active Piazza Q & A website and a course director who makes deadlines etc. super clear.",
    "An epitome of the misery that is the required biology sequence, Bio 103 was no exception to the quizzes that leave no time for thought and excessive workload. It is unfortunate that students are forced to endure yet another module that does not reflect the evolving and thrilling field of science, but leaves students dissatisfied.",
    "The third course in the intro bio sequence, gives a solid foundation for genes and development. Should probably be taken if you want to get to the really cool higher level courses.",
    "If you like genetics and developmental biology, or if you're not sure whether you like or dislike those topics go ahead and take this course. For many people of course this course is a requirement for either medical school or a degree, but as an intro course it covers a lot of the bases and is taught reasonably well for a lecture.",
    "Yes, I would recommend. Worthwhile information, not just for bio majors, and well-presented.",
    "Chances are you don't really have a choice in taking the class (premed life). It's not that bad. Vivian Irish is a good lecturer, the topics are interesting, and overall, it's a pretty good class. Weekly quizzes are kind of a pain, and the final is brutal (so ambiguous). The homework takes a long time to do (but it's not that hard), and it's actually rewarding to finish. Instead of random weekly psets, you write up a research proposal and do some research on a gene and a transcription factor -- I found this a lot more fun than doing psets.",
    "The best of the BIOL 1-3 modules so far, development and genetics are extremely interesting and I hope to take a more in depth course in the future. Definitely don't skip this Module!",
    "This course is okay. Going to lecture is the best way to learn the material, as the lecture slides are designed to not give you enough information for all the quizzes and final exam. It is definitely better than 101 or 102 though.",
    "103 is definitely the best of the modules so far. It is still a solid amount of work to get done each week, but not impossible, and the material is interesting. If you can, take it with Professor Irish because she's great!",
    "Don't do it if you don't have to.",
    "I actually really liked BIOL103 - I think it's my favorite module so far. Aside from interesting content, I think Prof. Irish is a very good teacher. She's one of the few professors that I've had so far that explained things in a way that I could almost fully understand in lecture. I really like how she summarizes the concept on difficult slides before moving on. Piazza was also pretty active and we got our questions answered pretty quickly. The quizzes were definitely fair. The lecture summaries helped a lot. The homework was original and interesting. Some things I didn't like: 1) sections weren't long enough to fully explain the research papers we had to read. I honestly still don't feel like I understand them. We always ran out of time. 2) The final was a little.....unfair with the multiple choice questions. I felt like we hadn't gone over them enough in lecture. There was definitely a decent amount of guessing with the multiple choice questions, although I studied the lecture slides meticulously.",
    "Most students taking BIOL 103 are presumably taking it for major requirements or premed prereqs, in which case the best advice is to just go through all the slides and study guides thoroughly. The material is not well organized from lecture to lecture, so be prepared to deal with that.",
    "Decent class. Interesting material but lecture can be dry. The final was very hard and quizzes can be long\/stressful.",
    "BIOL 103 is a comprehensive class that covers genetic and developmental biology--the lectures are very clear and supplemented by scientific manuscripts that are discussed at section each week. I learned a tremendous amount and liked the structure of the course!",
    "Better than 101 or 102, but people will take this course because they have to, not because it's an exceptional class.",
    "Of all the modules, I think Bio 103 was the best. However, the you are always pressed for time on the quizzes and don't get to show how much you actually know the material. However, I strongly believe Yale has to change this entire module curriculum, it does not work for students.",
    "Biol 103 has some very interesting materials. I think this module is the best one of the three modules I have taken so far. Prof. Irish did an excellent job in explaining things. Take Biol 103 with her.",
    "Difficult but you have to do it so keep your head low and push forward.",
    "This is a course worth taking even if you have taken AP Bio. It goes into greater detail that most APBio courses and moved at a reasonable pace.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in studying biology as a major. The course was not too demanding, the proposal project taught necessary reasoning\/writing skills for science, and the subject matter was relevant and fascinating.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "A. Professor Irish wasn't really great at explaining things throughout the slides. My least favorite of the intro bio courses so far.",
    "If you don't have to take it, please don't. There are far more interesting courses in science at Yale than this one.",
    "Bio 103 is a decent course with a lot of reading and memorization.",
    "Bio 103 is a solid course with a manageable course load. The lectures are generally very clear and build upon each other well.",
    "If you are a STEM student, Biol 103 is an interesting and well-taught course. The best of the introductory Biol modules so far.",
    "Awesome course. I never knew I had such an interest in developmental biology until I took this course. Lectures were never boring and the things we learned were just amazing!",
    "BIOL 103 was my favorite Bio module thus far. This is probably because I was already used to the format of the modules and more importantly, I enjoyed the subject manner of this module better. I thought it was a good introduction to genetics and developmental biology. I think genetics and development is super interesting so I totally recommend this module!",
    "A good overview of the subject -- yes, would recommend"
