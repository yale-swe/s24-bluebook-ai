   "comments": [
    "Strengths - broad understanding of how music works and how it can be internalized through the ear Weaknesses - bit disorganized. I wish I could have practiced some skills more in class",
    "I think one problem was that there were different levels of knowledge about music among the students and this meant that what was clear for some was not always clear for others. But a strength I would say was the attention given to all questions and the dedication to answer them. While not a weakness, I think this course could be improved by incorporating Canvas more, that way submissions and homework are more centralized in one place.",
    "Weakness: ONLY HALF A CREDIT FOR THE WORK OF A FULL CREDIT COURSE! I do not understand why this course is only 0.5 credits. The material learned is very important, and also, in order to succeed YOU MUST practice outside of the course. Learning how to sight-sing is like learning a new language. Imagine if your language course was only worth 0.5 credits. That's what this class is like."
