   "comments": [
    "I really struggled with this course, mainly because I went into it unsure if I liked Queer Theory and very quickly realized that I definitely didn't like Queer Theory. It wasn't the fault of the class or professor, it was just a result of my misjudging my own interest in the subject. It's a hard course with theoretically heavy reading, though, so be sure you're interested.",
    "Overview of queer theory, interesting if you're interested in it, beware of making arguments that are based in the real world that disagree with queer theory. It's a good class there are no distinct issues with it, I just did not find it super engaging and often forgot I was in it over the course of the semester (although I did all of the readings and only missed one class).",
    "This class was fantastic, and I would recommend it very, very highly. The readings were really interesting, the assignments all seemed to aid comprehension and learning in helpful ways, and Michael Warner is a fabulous discussion leader (and extremely kind - because there was so much interest in this class, he decided to make two section, which I've never seen a teacher do. I don't know how he feels about this decision now that the semester is over but we were all extremely grateful). Seriously - if he's ever teaching a seminar that looks even remotely interesting to you, definitely consider taking it.",
    "I liked a lot of the readings, but in general felt very overwhelmed because I don't have a strong background in political theory, psychoanalysis, or anything else that everyone seemed to know. The level of discussion was a bit over my head. Think carefully about whether taking this class for fun is a good idea. Queer theory is cool, but extremely confusing.",
    "A chance to take a tour through the history of queer theory with one of its founders! Great opportunity!"
