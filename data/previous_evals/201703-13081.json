    "I gained a significant amount of knowledge of Norse sagas, Icelandic culture and literature, and immense insight into Norse society beyond just the vikings. Throughout this course I also got to develop reasoning and literary analysis skills, as well as improve my ability to partake in and contribute to group conversation.",
    "I learned a lot of fun things about Norse vikings, old Icelandic laws (they were so crazy but cool) and about how to read ancient texts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A relatively relaxed class with reasonable amounts of reading and a low paper load, just three three page papers and one eight to ten page paper. The professor is easy to get along with and the class is flexible in that the text can be applied to a lot of different facets of life and culture, which keeps it interesting.",
    "One of my favorite aspects of the course was the excellent pairing of fresh, modern themes, namely the subject of gender, sexuality, masculinity, and violence, with centuries-old literary works, showing how relevant they still are to this day. Prof. Fridriksdottir is excellent at both guiding conversation and letting it flow naturally among us students, maintaining a consistently high level of quality throughout the entire course, as well as equally high levels of personal engagement. If I had to criticize one aspect of the course, it was the Canvas discussions: some good points were made on there, but these points were often reiterated in class, where conversation was a lot more natural. As a result, Canvas discussions petered out midway through the course, though this did not decrease the course's high level of quality."

   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you're looking for a class that will be interesting and allow you a lot of creative freedom in your papers but won't bog you down with huge reading lists or difficult texts. The texts are interesting if not the most fascinating things ever written, but they allow for great conversation. You won't spend too many hours slaving over your papers, though they will have to be concise, and you'll get to really dive into Icelandic culture, which is eye-opening. You'll never watch Game of Thrones the same way again.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I genuinely believe some of the literature is on par with commonly-known great literary classics, such as the works of Shakespeare and Chretien de Troyes, and the experience of discovering such a rich and intriguing body of work is unlike any other. In addition, the course material is tremendously stimulating, and has offered me fresh insight on very current topics and conversations. Prof. Fridriksdottir manages to establish the ideal balance between free-flowing conversation and guided, directed thought, in a manner that feels effortless and always enjoyable. This, I think, is the perfect atmosphere for a seminar course, and this course itself has been one of my all-time favorites.",
    "Yes. Johanna is really nice and cares about her students. The class had 6 people when I took it, so it was a really fun, engaging but also relaxing seminar. This was one of my senior-year-fun-out-of-my-field classes and it was perfect for that. I got to read some awesome 1000+ year old stories and then talk about them. It was awesome.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who may be interested in reading good, old literature with clear prose. If you like Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings, those authors found inspiration in these sagas. The stories are engaging. I loved this course especially because there was only six of us, coincidentally all seniors. The discussions were great and Professor Fridriksdottir is a wonderful seminar leader and helpful professor."
