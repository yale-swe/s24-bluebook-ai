    "Really excellent course in political philosophy. Professor Kapustin is a great seminar leader, class discussion was strong, and the topic is fascinating. Wholehearted endorsement.",
    "This class is excellent - Kapustin has a way of speaking that emphasizes the importance of the points he is making - and they really are important points. This means class is always interesting. Kapustin is also extremely polite and considerate and really values what his students think and are interested in. There's a lot of textual analysis, but if you like that, the texts are generally very interesting (though a few are quite dense). The midterm consists of two 3-page take-home essays. Note: don't wait until he brings up the final paper to start thinking about it\/working on an outline! That will only leave you a week and a half to write a 15 page paper at the busiest time of the semester.",
    "Professor Kapustin is incredible. He genuinely cares about each student, and strikes an amazing balance between discussion& his exposition of readings. Readings are incredible as well--some of the most interesting ones I have ever read. Readings can be sometimes dense, yet no worries, Professor Kapustin really teases out essential elements of it. I have to say it has been one of the most intellectually rewarding classes I have ever taken, and anything that Professor Kapustin teaches, you should go for it.",
    "This was a great class - really interesting, but there was definitely more philosophy than politica science (but that was what I was looking for). The discussion were really interesting and the readings never too burdensome but sometimes a bit challenging. However, Prof. Kapustin always did a great job explaining the materials and answering questions - definitely take it!",
    "Absolutely, though its very continental philosophy based.",
    "If you are interested in continental philosophy and want to know what it's like, or if you like continental philosophy, take this course. Professor Kapustin is one of the most engaging seminar leaders I've had. That being said, know that, being continental philosophy, many of the readings in the course are what you might call \"BS.\" See G.A. Cohen's Deeper Into Bullshit for a fuller explanation. It's quite different from Analytic Philosophy, so just be prepared for that. Also, know that Kapustin reveals his sympathies with certain authors and sometimes with the students who agree with those authors to a greater extent than many other professors I've had.",
    "If you are interested in this sort of analytical thinking, go right ahead. the class addresses important questions that i imagine are applicable to a wide range of interests. the reading is too much in quantity but it is highly theoretical which i found frustrating.",
    "Without a doubt, take it if you get in.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to those willing to engage in heavy political philosophy (grading is not difficult, however, in spite of Kapustin's intimidating personality)."
