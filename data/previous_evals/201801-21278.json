    "A great deal of knowledge concerning China during the periods under study. Knowledge concerning techniques historians employ in their research. Improved writing",
    "I gained first and foremost a very good introduction to a region with which I was not very familiar when I began the course. The course is very good at getting one up to speed across a broad range of topics. Alongside that it was an excellent broadening experience and helped me to think comparatively about European and Chinese societies in the period."

   "comments": [
    "Excellent structure. Readings tied together well. One-page handouts helpful for understanding readings",
    "It is very effective at getting to the important questions and points quickly, cutting away extraneous details, so you get a good structure with which to think about the period further. It's also excellent at highlighting methodological differences in approaches to the subject. If I were to suggest an improvement, it would be to set some essays on the general questions of each topic through the semester (as well as at the end), to encourage thinking in more detail and depth about the individual topics."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Seminar was engaging, readings were diverse in nature and (almost) always interesting. Dr. Hansens ability to teach is impressive, and her recall of information even more so",
    "Certainly; obviously for specialists of other periods of Chinese history, but especially for Europeanists looking to broaden their comparative thinking.",
    "Yes. It's a good opportunity to have an overall look at the existing scholarship on pre-modern Chinese history. At the same time, we could also learn many practical skills such as how to write book reviews."
