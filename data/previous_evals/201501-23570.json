    "Maureen is by far my best professor since I enrolled in Yale. She has a great talent in teaching.",
    "Extremely valuable course for all environmental managers. I wish I had more opportunities to practice this type of financial analysis in other courses.",
    "Maureen is a FANTASTIC teacher, and condensed core financial concepts into clear lectures. Though the pace of the course was rather quick, it was understandable given time constraints, and I have zero complaints on my end. I hope to have her as a teacher next year to teach intermediate\/advanced financial concepts.",
    "Lectures were fast paced but notes provided online were very helpful. Felt like lectures were unnecessary and most of the homework was trying to find the answers in the notes and powerpoint lectures. A lot of work for a one credit course. Felt like I didn't understand much material and ended up copying and pasting from in class assignments and examples in the notes and powerpoint lectures.",
    "Maureen is an amazing teacher, runs through a great amount of material with clarity and ease. Is very good at bringing concepts down to earth and giving students individual attention.",
    "Question 4: The material was very useful but the pace of the course was too fast. It should be made into a regular full-semester course and be offered for more than one credit as the coursework load was also quite heavy for one unit.",
    "Great class!",
    "The course is large so it is difficult for the professor to respond to questions in class. The lectures generally follow the slides so I feel the lectures are somewhat redundant.",
    "The class moved at a fast pace and could benefit from a culling of topics explored.",
    "I was unable to get a good handle on the material because it was too substantial for the time period during which it was taught. I recommend that the professor teach only the most important concepts so that students have time to actually absorb\/retain the material.",
    "This is a good course but goes way too quickly for people who do not have a background in this field."

    "I really liked the assignment where we used Google Finance.",
    "Covered a variety of topics",
    "Great exercises and class-content. Very complete and helpful for career and future class work.",
    "It is VERY important for FES students to have a grasp of financial concepts.",
    "Range of topics covered.",
    "This course provides a concrete skill set, especially for only a one-hour time commitment. Maureen is kind, funny, and understanding. Online resources and office hours provided useful support.",
    "Though the course material was very basic, it was extraordinarily helpful for someone with no accounting background. I now feel like I have at least a minimal grasp of important considerations and terminology that will help me in my future career field.",
    "I feel the topic of the material- although not my favorite- is practical and will be valuable in my life after FES.",
    "The exercises were helpful, but some of them were so rigorous and the instructions were sometimes wrong and or not helpful.",
    "A lot of material was covered in a short time period. Instructor was receptive to student queries.",
    "The course presents basic financial concepts in a very practical way and makes it easy for anyone to join a financially related conversation, as well as read and analyze the basic financial documents.",
    "The ability to practice the problems in class before engaging with the material for homework was key.",
    "Maureen is a great instructor and very helpful and attentive to the students. This was impressive especially given how large the class is.",
    "Well organized clear explanation of concepts",
    "The homeworks were good practice.",
    "I gained a decent amount of exposure to a variety of topics in this field.",

    "The time. Should be changed from 6 - 8pm to 4 -6pm",
    "While this is somewhat the nature of a 6-week, once-per-week course, it was difficult to keep up with the pure volume of information. The content is pretty dense and requires a lot of practice.",
    "Clarity of pdfs of the lectures...additional material from what's simply presented in the ppts may have been more helpful?",
    "Many of the lectures were slow, repetitive, and confusing.",
    "I wish it could have been a few weeks longer.",
    "Please make sure the instructions are clear for assignments. Sometimes they lacked clarity and sometimes wrong information was given. That get confusing more than anything else.",
    "Slower pace? Otherwise, none.",
    "The good fish example was a little annoying.",
    "This course could be taught as a flipped course and more time spent in class on the in class assignments and working through examples. I felt like I didn't understand most of the concepts introduced in this class. This course should be two units.",
    "Needs to be made into a full-semester course and offered for more credit.",
    "Because the class is rather late (6-8pm) it is hard to concentrate with the current format of 1 hour lecture and then in-class exercise. Is there any way to involve students more in content or break up the 1st hour of lecture?",
    "This class should be a semester long and offered in the Fall. Often FES students do not have adequate finance and accounting background to meaningfully participate in SOM classes. Having a full semester FES course on finance and accounting would help, possibly as core class for certain specializations like business or energy. Also, the class was offered from 6-8pm which is not an ideal time for learning!",
    "Cut back a few topics and focus in on a few others.",
    "A very brief introduction to Excel formulas with the first couple of classes would be very helpful.",
    "It's great that we have access to Professor Burke's powerpoint slides, but the clarity and explanations on the slides could be improved.",
    "It's difficult with such a large course and so much material to go through, but more interaction between the students and professor would be helpful to ensure uptake of the material and enliven the lectures. Perhaps this means offering this course both semesters.",
    "More TA's and more hours for help with the assignments.",
    "Too fast paced and heavy on excel.",
    "There could be more sessions of the class: besides the general lecture and the office hours of the TAs, it will be nice to have actual sessions with the TAs. I am still not 100% confident in my ability to understand indicators such as ROE, ROI etc.",
    "I really think this should be a semester long course. It is far too much material to meaningfully understand in just 6 weeks.",
    "The powerpoints are painfully boring",
    "Amount of material (number of topics taught)- needs to be reduced.",
    "The pace is too fast. It might have been caused by the amount of information and the length of the course (6 weeks), but it could be valuable to check if all the information given is fundamental or if there is any chance to still tailor the concepts to make it more digestible.",
    "It should be a whole semester."

At the same time there is not too much depth into the material, but rather a basic understanding so that environmentalists from diverse backgrounds can be on the same page with business people for example.",

However, I am not just focused on business, but also in the third sector, which is missing in this course.",
