   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "This course has given me a better understanding of the ancient philosophers from the Western Canon. The course itself has given me much food for thought and reading all the works of philosophers like Plato and Aristotle is just so intriguing.",
    "Jason Stanley's Philosophy section taught me that on many occasions, I could find the information for the philosophers from the Stanford Philosophy Encyclopedia. In class, Stanley often pulled out his laptop instead of the required readings for the day, and would pull up the Stanford Encyclopedia so he could summarize thinkers such as Epicurus or Arabian philosophers. Certain times he would lecture instead on concepts that did not seem relevant to the subject, for example, he described the mathematical concept of infinity with certain proofs in class instead of discussing Epicurus. Overall, I think Jason Stanley cares a lot about students, but in terms of knowledge and skills I was able to obtain from this course, I found it was minimal.",
    "Directed Studies Philosophy is a great course for introducing students to philosophy that they have not previously been exposed to the subject. Its a great overview of western philosophy, with most of the class devoted to Aristotle and Plato. Coming into this class, many students had not been exposed to philosophy, or writing philosophy papers before, and this course is a great introduction to prepare students for further studies in philosophy.",
    "I learned how to reconstruct and evaluate philosophical arguments. I am familiar with major writers in the Western philosophical tradition and many of their arguments. I realized that ancient philosophy is still relevant, especially in today's politics.",
    "In theory, this course should have taught me how to perform basic philosophical analysis and write a philosophy essay. To my knowledge, every other section of this course learned these skills and also were helped to understand the arguments of several important philosophers. Unfortunately, my professor was unable to teach me these skills.",
    "I learned Philosophy",
    "I learned to write a philosophy paper, gained an understanding of the course material (with some gaps), and learned some practical applications of the material.",
    "A good foundation in early philosophy in relation to western thought. An overview of major philosophers.",
    "How to clearly map out an argument step by step"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is solid and does not need improvement.",
    "I do not think Jason Stanley should teach Directed Studies as he has often appeared late (up to 35 minutes late) to section and would often be unprepared to discuss the reading material. I enjoyed Directed Studies greatly and the level of discussion with which other students engaged in to discuss philosophy, but I think the strength of this course would've been stronger had the professor been someone who actually did the reading as well. In addition, I would often receive my graded old papers after the subsequent paper deadline, which I found did not help me in improving as a writer.",
    "Overall, this course is fantastic. The readings are interesting, and the seminar style discussions provide a good opportunity to learn more about the texts. If anything I think that more emphasis could be put on connecting the development of ideas from one thinker to another, rather than making them seem separate from each other, with minimal connections made. However, I do recognize that with the fast pace of this course, that can be difficult to do on top of forming an understanding of all of the readings.",
    "Strength: great survey of Western thought. Weakness: skim through the Muslim and Jewish philosophers (sometimes not even a full class), while giving weeks to the christian thoughts. I hope they can integrate middle eastern thought better into the course, at it is also part of the Western philosophy tradition of Plato-Aristotle and onwards.",
    "This course familiarized students with a huge body of philosophical works. We had to go through them very quickly, but ultimately I felt like the survey format was right for an introductory philosophy class. The lectures that reconstructed arguments were very helpful, and the others were interesting.",
    "The course as it is designed is very strong and seems to be an excellent introduction to philosophy.",
    "At the beginning of the semester i could not understand Philosophy in the very least. As time passed, it became easier to read and comprehend. I learned to think.",
    "Professor Stanley is very disorganized, but can be very helpful and engaging when he's at his best. A great deal of personal work is required to fill in the gaps. But when the class went very well, as when we studied Plato or Sextus, it was great. Nonetheless, no matter what we discussed, I always left class with something thought provoking to chew on for the rest of the day.",
    "This course provides a good overview, but it is a bit surface at times because we had so little time to discuss significant works in relation to the depth of the reading. Difficult to fully appreciate and understand complicated subjects.",
    "This course was incredibly disorganized. My professor was routinely late to class and showed up without understanding of the reading that we needed to have done, and the material we needed to cover.",
    "We read a lot of material, which is good because we get a fairly complete picture; however, we moved through the texts so quickly that I didn't feel like a got a solid grasp of many of them.",
    "Strengths: -material is interesting -emphasis on reconstructing and analyzing arguments is good for development of key skills, makes the material more engaging Weaknesses: -volume of material made it incredibly difficult to cover everything to the extent that I would have liked (many arguments that I found incredibly interesting in the readings were covered minimally or not at all)"

   "comments": [
    "I would most definitely recommend Directed Studies philosophy to other students. It opens up your mind to endless possibilities and theories.",
    "I would most certainly recommend taking DS. I think it expanded my horizons (especially as a prospective STEM major) and helped me realize how to approach texts. I do, however, think the section professors are crucial for facilitating the success of the classroom, and with that being said, I do not recommend taking this course with Jason Stanley unless no other section time works out.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS Philosophy to another student. It is an incredible program and I think that every student should take some type of philosophy course early on in their college careersDirected Studies is a great option for that. However, I would not recommend this course with Professor Stanley. He is not as knowledgeable or dedicated to the course as some of his fellow professors. He is clearly incredibly intelligent about the things he works on, but those things are not what is covered in Directed Studies. Take one of his other classes if you want, but I would recommend another professor for DS Philosophy.",
    "I would recommend this course. DS Philosophy is usually organized, focused, and grounded in the texts. Also, usually people get their grades back in a reasonable amount of time, which helps to facilitate growth as writers. This just wasn't usually the case for my section. However, regardless of professor, the readings are rich and fascinating, and learning how to analyze philosophical arguments is a very valuable skill.",
    "I would recommend Directed Studies, and thus this course, to any student. I would, however, urge anyone I knew to avoid Jason Stanley's section.",
    "Yes. For the same reason I would recommend Directed Studies to anyone- makes us more empathetic.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this to every student, but certainly to those up to the challenge of doing the personal work to fill in the gaps and keep up.",
    "I would recommend Directed Studies as a whole, but philosophy is probably my least favorite component. It is a subject most freshmen are largely unfamiliar with and was difficult to grasp at times. Professors could have been more understanding of this and could adjust the syllabus in order to make it easier to focus on a smaller number of works.",
    "Yes, you get a great background in western philosophy."
