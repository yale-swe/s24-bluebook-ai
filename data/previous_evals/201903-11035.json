   "comments": [
    "I developed many skills this semester. Most importantly, I was pushed to approach my work (in-class and written) with rigor and precision. Professor Schuwey pushed us to support our statements in discussion with precise moments in the assigned texts, a demand that pushed me in my reading, and to develop my thoughts and arguments with clarity. This expectation lasted throughout the semester, and made me set a high standard for my work in this course and in other part of my coursework and academic life.",
    "overview of 17th cent literary field critical thinking close reading to inform historical analysis",
    "This course was a great asset in furthering my knowledge of 17th-century literature, which I was not all that familiar with or rather, which I had come to know and analyze through well-established, little-discussed theoretical and historical tools. Professor Schuwey's approach to both our primary and secondary readings was highly critical, to an extent that I have rarely experienced before: deconstructing the rhetorical fabric of those texts proved immensely useful, and helped refining my apprenhension of the century while teaching me not to accept secondary literature too readily. The other great takeaway of this course was the initiation to digital humanities it provided, both in conceptual and practical terms. Professor Schuwey took the initiative to organize a workshop at the Digital Humanities Lab to present us with the fundamentals of TEI before getting to our individual projects, which he supervised very constructively, helping us every step of the way. I had never dabbled in TEI or graphic design beforehand, and the skills I acquired throughout this class will prove infinitely helpful throughout my PhD.",
    "A stimulating exploration of the \"querelle des Anciens et des Modernes\", based on personal reflections on primary sources and critical assessment of secondary sources; DH training; skills related to the ideation and implementation of a digital interface; deepening of team-work skills."

   "comments": [
    "This course was one of my favorites in my time at Yale. I really appreciate the workload (a perfect amount of expected reading for the depth that we explored in class discussions), and the variety of assignments. I think that this is one of the only courses in which I can say that I know exactly what skills I am developing through each assignment. I also appreciated the practical aspect (specifically with regard to the Digital Humanities project and the pedagogical exercises). Not only was my knowledge of the corpus and subject strengthened, but I feel that I developed greatly as a scholar and critique.",
    "Strengths: critical thinking, discussions (content and form) Weaknesses: we could read more primary sources",
    "The main strength of this course was definitely the very fruitful conversations it prompted. All four of us quickly nurtured a lively, constructive dialogue underpinned by stimulating readings. The organization of each class definitely helped: each of the student successively took one session in charge, around a theme and bibliography set by Professor Schuwey in advance, but that we were free to slightly adapt regarding our own interests and what we deem most interesting and thought-provoking. This very empowering approach, which refused to infantilize graduate students, was also a great preparation for teaching. Another great strength was the innovative, collaborative digital humanities project we led with the University of Washington, which enabled us to present our own interface and personal interpretation of a canonical text, La Bruyre's Characters, through a lens I had never had the chance to experience before.",
    "The biggest strengths are the seminar discussions, in which we are always encouraged to elaborate a personal reflection, and the DH component, including the collaborative project with WU."

   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this course to others. The reading assignments gave me a clear and solid understanding of the period in question, and an ability to speak about the topic with a large amount of certainty. The course sessions were engaging and well-organized, and the amount of guest speakers was truly perfect! We had the opportunity to access a diversity of specializations and scholars' perspectives, both here at Yale and at other institutions. Finally, the digital humanities project was very useful, as it allowed me to develop skills that are important in the field.",
    "yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, be them a specialist of 17th-century literature or not. Its critical approach to the topic was enlightening, but also very refreshing. Its systematic effort at undermining and questionning the assumptions that lie at the core of our literary and historical perception of the century is a great methodological prism that will definitely enrich one's scholarly perspective.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It constitutes a precious opportunity to learn more about 17th century literary history in an innovative way."
