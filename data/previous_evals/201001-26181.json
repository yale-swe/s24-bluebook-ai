    "I would definitely recommend Spanish 120 to students especially with Professor Maripaz. The course is a smooth transition from Spanish 110 and covers most basic grammar and vocab. By the end of the course students can read easy books in spanish and their listening and oral skills also improve. Professor Maripaz knows how to maintain the students interest and so I really enjoyed her class!",
    "L2 is basically a continuation of L1, with the same textbook and everything. The homework assignments were slightly shorter but we had one more exam. Maripaz is a good professor, and is especially good at explaining grammar patterns and coming up with useful activities for the class. But in reality, all the professors have their own strengths--some emphasize conversational skills more, for example--and there's really no need to rearrange your entire schedule or pick a less convenient classroom location just to get Maripaz's section. In the end, how much you learn realy depends much more on how much time you put in, rather than who your professor is.",
    "Shop Prof. Garcia; she is a no-nonsense, tough Professor, but I (and a lot of other folks as well) love her. Still, she is definitely not for everyone so make sure you shop her.",
    "This class takes up a lot of time and is stressful, but I learned a lot."
