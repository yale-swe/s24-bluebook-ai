   "comments": [
    "Unrealistic expectations work wise from this class. We read like a bunch of books and plays that had some crazy french theme underlying. The class lacks organization. There is a general plan of what will be covered in the semester but you rarely will know what is due for the next week until the end of your current week.. Makes it really difficult to plan work for your other classes around it. Basically, the attitude is that french is the only thing you should be focused on during your semester. The director of French at Yale, Madame Schnieder, has been consistently late to every involvement that I have had were her thus far. Students need more than a few days notice to know what is coming up in the class... And I did well in 150 so I am not just ripping the course because I did poorly. The class was just a huge pain in the ass.",
    "The course is a lot of work, but is manageable if you truly care about French. I would recommend the class to someone who wants to experience an intensive language course, and wants to become a stronger speaker and writer in the language. Maybe take it credit\/d.",
    "FR150 will definitely improve your language skills, but you have to put in the work in order to see any improvement. I would definitely take it if your willing to put in the time and effort."
