   "comments": [
    "Yes, yes, take it",
    "Origins of the British Empire is a great class for history-minded students. I would definitely recommend it for those who are interested in the subject matter. However, if you are only peripherally interested in history, do not take this class (it is almost all names and dates and would be very dry).",
    "Really interesting class. Unfortunately there were days missed due to the snowstorm. Would recommend taking it.",
    "Origins of the British Empire is a course that specializes in how and why Britain acquired an empire beginning from around 1600 up until the American Revolution. The material is fascinating, and Professor Pincus has his own unique spin on the empire story. I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "This class gives a detailed account of competing views within the British Empire in the 17th and 18th centuries about how the empire should be. The class starts with the founding of the first colonies and the English Civil War, Restoration, and Revolution of 1688 with a focus on imperial policy. After 1688, we have a nice, detailed account of British politics (Whigs vs Tories and later Patriot Whigs vs Authoritarian Whigs and Tories) and how it related to imperial policy and political economy. The class ends with the American Revolutionary period and the establishment of empire in India by Clive. Professor Pincus is of the opinion that the great imperial questions were a political debate (largely over political economy) that spanned across the entire Empire, that the British Empire was a single, integrated entity and he makes this view known.",
    "Strengths: Lovely subject matter, professor's confrontational attitude to conventional wisdom, fair examsWeaknesses: Structure very fluid and confusing at times (perhaps because it was the first year it was offered)Take Alyssa's section!!!",
    "Good topic, solid lectures, and not a lot of work.",
    "Absolutely, take this class.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend this class \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you can do well in it if you apply yourself so it's pretty straightforward, and the material covered is a fascinating part of British history.",
    "Interesting material but a disorganized class in general. Might be better its second time through.",
    "Really interesting examination of the birth and development of the British empire. Pincus is a good lecturer and the TAs are awesome. Take it.",
    "If you're a history person then take it! Professor Pincus is great and the lectures are very enjoyable",
    "A class that places information over presentation, but does so effectively. If you like history, or the british empire, or taking notes, then this is a solid class. but if sitting through a painstaking lecture on imperial political economy doesn't sound fun to you, think twice before taking this class.",
    "Professor Pincus's view on why England developed an empire. I would recommend it because of the fascinating lectures and interesting way the information is presented (every event discussed is basically a tenet of Pincus's over-arching argument).",
    "A big disappointment at many levels. The course started wonderfully, with a great professor and a topic I was passionate about. Yet the poorly-xeroxed readings written in ancient English, never discussed and required to be remembered for the exam (really absurd!), lack of any structure in the section and an overemphasis on the detail as opposed to general picture totally killed my vibe. However, there was discussion bout historical perspectives... Overall, this course has all what it takes - an amazing professor, leader in the field of British history, and a very interesting topic - the British Empire. Why not make it into an amazing course? I really hope that will happen in the years to come..... I'm disappointed that didn't happen in my case. Maybe it will in yours? Definitely shop it, but I can't say \"take it\".",
    "The overall course is very interesting, but it is still somewhat of a work in progress. There are some kinks in the organization that need to be addressed, but you will get a lot out of the course. I would recommend it."
