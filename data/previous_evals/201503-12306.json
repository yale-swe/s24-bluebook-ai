   "comments": [
    "You'll learn lots about films! Professors Andrew and Bromwich are very good and very knowledgeable, and you basically get to sit around with them and talk about what interests you in the movies you watch (which are very carefully selected). Very worthwhile.",
    "Great films and great discussion. Know ahead of time that you will have very little guidance going into the final paper, so it behooves you to be thinking about it early on.",
    "Overall, a good class. The films you watch are excellent and discussions are usually pretty good. Be aware that you have less opportunity to participate than in other seminars, as the professors tend to talk a lot, but they are quite smart and you'll learn a lot about film criticism from them.",
    "Take it!! The selected films were a lot of fun to watch and challenged my way of thinking. The professors were a really great duo, balancing each other out on the film and literary analysis. The discussions were engaging and I really liked the journal format. Every two weeks we had to write a journal entry about the director and analyzing the films we saw. The journals provided a really nice medium to explore your ideas without the pressure of writing a formal essay, which encouraged a deeper and sometimes more daring analysis that I really appreciated. The professors were really invested in the material and you could clearly say that they wanted to be there, to share their thoughts, and to hear yours. Prof. Andrew and Prof. Bromwich were really insightful, and the course was a really memorable experience!",
    "A wonderful gem of a seminar where you watch a great film every week and get to do a lot of reading and discussion on the director in depth. Both professors are extremely knowledgeable and bring great insight to the films. You walk away with a completely new level of appreciation and understanding of films."
