    "Lucky you, doing chem research. The 490 lecture was pretty chill, as was the actual lab work. Neither were particularly exciting, but maybe you majored in chemistry because you like research?",
    "Yes. In theory the \"class\" part of this meets for an hour each Monday, where people present their research in an informal group meeting-style way, but actually Dr. Parr canceled class all the time, so I think we only met like 5 times this semester. So basically this is really chill, and if you're going to do research during the semester, you might as well do it for credit.",
    "Definitely take it. It's a good opportunity to do research and to become involved in a lab.",
    "I worked in lab for 10 hours a week and met once every few weeks with the other 490 students to watch someone present.",
    "CHEM 490 is a great way to get credit for research, especially if you ware already working on something anyways. The experience, however, depends mostly on who your PI is and what kind of work you end up doing.",
    "You probably know all of this, but definitely make sure you like the PI you are working for, the graduate students in the lab, the overall environment\/atmosphere of the lab, and the work you'll be doing - it could make your experience awful or it could make it wonderful. For the record, I very much enjoyed my lab experience and I am glad I did it, the long hours did not seem so bad, but I did have excellent mentors as graduate students and post-docs in the lab."
