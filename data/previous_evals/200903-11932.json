   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this course to a student who really understands Chinese well and wants to learn more about literature. The lecture is entirely in Chinese, so don't take it if you aren't fluent. You'll be in over your head.",
    "Unfortunately, there isn't a wide range of courses to take at the fifth-year level in Chinese (for those of you just coming back from a fourth year summer in Beijing or another course of study), but this is an alright course. Su Laoshi tells amazing stories and is extremely enthusiastic. However, the course itself is disorganized, the book is riddled with typos, and there are few chances to practice your speaking. That being said, you should at least look at the other courses available, but this one is worth taking as well, if only for Su Laoshi's incredible stories.",
    "A comprehensive overview of recent Chinese fiction that covers rather scandalous topics of love\/marriage, and cultural ideas of traditional male\/female roles. Su Laoshi is very engaging, and the textbook is unlike any other.",
    "If you are extremely proficient in Chinese essay writing (for a native speaker), or have a very advanced handle on listening\/speaking (non-native speaker), this class was quite interesting. Not easy though.",
    "Chinese 158 is an intensive survey of modern Chinese fiction that challenges students with a broad vocabulary, with in-depth writing assignments, but otherwise little work. Homework assignments are very easy, while essays are more time-intense. For those coming from CHNS 151, beware. Your Chinese may have become too rusty to take this course right away. I would recommend this to anyone over CHNS 151, especially with Light Fellowship experience, directly. To all others, caution.",
    "This class is great for anyone who is at a high level of Chinese, and who wants to broaden and deepen his\/her knowledge of not only the Chinese language, but Chinese as a whole. The class operates as both a language and a literature course, and discussions regarding Chinese traditional and modern society are frequent. Although the readings may be challenging to understanding at first, taking the course will accustom students to the \"normal\" level of Chinese writing and allow studnets to use their Chinese skills in a very concrete way.",
    "Recommended if you want to have a chill time with Chinese after a grueling time with the lower level classes \/ intensive summer programs-- this is your reward for being a good student and getting up to L5! However, if you're looking to improve your speaking ability or learn lots of new vocabulary, this isn't necessarily your course.",
    "Great class if you want to learn about chinese culture and literature. Not a very good class for actually improving on your speaking. You learn some vocab and sentence structures.",
    "Chinese 158 will be what you make of it. You can learn very little or you can learn a lot -- it's left up to the student. In any case, Wei Su is awesome and cares a lot about his students!",
    "Chinese 158 is a great course. It is more close to a Literature course than a language course, as we use excerpts from the most important modern works of Chinese Literature as text. I learned a lot about Chinese culture, history, and Literature throught this class.",
    "This course will not give you many opportunities to practice your oral Chinese. The class is worthwhile only for Su Wei's big personality and storytelling. He is a very friendly and generous teacher. I would recommend the class to anyone looking to have a easy-going way to be in a Chinese-language environment twice per week. The actual work of the class will benefit your Chinese only so much. The vocabulary is very literary and not extremely useful. These things aside, I found the class very enjoyable. Listening to Su Wei talk about his experiences is always interesting.",
    "I would not recommend this, though I enjoyed it. The best part are the readings, but the worst is the professor who doesn'treally teach, and having no section in a language course. I could follow the course, but I would rather have taken Chinese 154 anyway because there seems to be more \"teaching\" and practicing Chinese in that class. My spoken Chinese is much worse now than it was at the beginning of the course - if you value speaking, stay away from this course.",
    "Professor Su is extremely easygoing and lenient, so you should never hesitate to ask for an extension or a retake of the test\/quizzes. He enjoys telling anecdotes of his past experiences, and while this provides a much-needed cultural context for the texts we're studying, it also means that he likes to go on tangents. Self-discipline plays a huge role in this class if you are serious about Chinese learning, as people tend to fall behind in readings.",
    "Very fun class. Readings are very difficult, but anything that is not understood is discussed in class. This is not a standard language course, as you will not drill in class. The focus is on the texts, and it often feels more like a lit course than a language course. Very interesting lectures.",
    "Chinese 158 is an interesting course with a very interesting teacher. While the material might not all be covered in class it is a very interesting course that I would recommend because it covers very interesting texts.",
    "Readings (in the original) from famous Chinese novels of the last 40 years, aka the original texts for a lot of the Zhang Yimou movies that feature Gong Li. If you've ever wanted to read the literature behind \"Raise the Red Lantern\", \"Judou\", \"Red Sorghum\" ect, that's what you get to do in this class (while learning the occasional sexually suggestive chengyu). Make sure to study for the quizes.Attending Su Laoshi's end-of-semester dumpling party is highly recommended.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep up with their Chinese. The course can accommodate students with various levels of chinese, so don't be afraid even if you feel you are not as good as other students in the class. You will still learn something.",
    "A good class, not too difficult, and just right for those who want to keep their Chinese in decent shape."
