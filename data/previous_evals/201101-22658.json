    "Lots about water and water policy and how to implement water treatment technologies in different places.",
    "This class had interesting lectures, but the lectures did not feel like they all fit together. The course needs more of an overall structure or direction, which I presume will happen since this was the first year it was taught. Not a lot of work, and if you are interested in water, then you should definitely take it. The final project was really awesome.",
    "GREAT CLASS. I recommend it. It's fun and you learn information that is useful in many contexts. It's also not as quantitative as most other engineering classes; it adds nice variety to an otherwise technical schedule.",
    "Yes, it's a really great class for enve and evst majors, and others who want to learn how we use and abuse our most fundamental resource!",
    "ENVE 330 is a fun and more interdisciplinary (read: easy problem sets) than your average engineering course."
