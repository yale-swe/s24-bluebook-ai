    "Human trafficking and how to work in a group with individuals who are at different points in their education from myself",
    "This was the first class at Yale that I took where I felt that there were concrete things that I myself could do, as a humble citizen and student, to combat widespread human trafficking. The class was project based, designed for students to complete work on deliverables for clients by the end of the semester. I was lucky enough to work with a group of engaged students on two projects: a data collection project, and an ongoing legal advocacy project. In terms of the course material, readings, discussions and speakers were all extraordinarily helpful in introducing me to the discourse surrounding global human trafficking. This is perhaps one of the most controversial classes at Yale, and I think all students, regardless of academic discipline or major, should consider taking it. A true staple in the Jackson Institute.",
    "First and foremost, I learned about the nature and extent of human trafficking internationally and within the U.S. I think to feel as though I gained a good grasp on human trafficking in such a large scope was a huge accomplishment of the course. I also developed my presentation skills, and learned how to initiate legal research."

   "comments": [
    "Casey king is great!",
    "Prof King takes a topical current issue and asks the class to deliver a tangible and actionable solution. This \"Consulting\" seminar tackled Human Trafficking and the class was rewarding and challenging. We worked in teams and came with a product which will help law enforcement and prosecutors in the future.",
    "Strength: Opportunity to do work that matters, create your own project, open discusssion, feedback from professor on work Weakness: Last minute communication Improvement: Clearer expectations set out once final project has been determined so that everyone can be on the same page",
    "The class exceeded expectations in terms of its coverage of relevant issues to global trafficking. Our readings and discussions delved into case studies from around the world, but the class also felt incredibly local in that our projects were catered to assist the American endeavor to combat human trafficking. It handled this balance extraordinarily well without spreading itself too thin.",
    "The course was incredibly strong. One of the greatest strengths was Professor King's leadership, which made all other aspects of the class flourish. This includes how seriously he took the subject material, his expertise in the area, his ability to give us readings to delve deeply into the material yet giving us a broad scope of it, and his belief in and kindness towards his students. This fostered an environment in which students were deeply invested in the material and took risks to take on projects they might not have otherwise, therefore learning a ton. The other great strength was the class's flexibility, in that we decided to focus on capstone projects instead of final papers. It was incredibly exciting, fulfilling, and extremely hard, yet worthy work to work on the capstone project. The other great strength was the class's students, who came from diverse backgrounds and fostered interesting conversations and great friendships. I also really enjoyed the weekly responses as a way to think critically about material that piqued our interest, and I appreciated how Professor King allowed us to write about anything that we found interesting. I think the only weakness was a byproduct of the flexibility of the course, being the lack of structure in the capstones. Although I felt ready to rise to the challenge of figuring out our project, I think it would have been helpful to spend a bit more time thinking strategically and logistically about what we wanted to accomplish. Although we made timelines and plans of work at the beginning of the semester, those changed greatly as we learned more about our project and the material, and ultimately left us with little structure or accountability. Furthermore, although we talked about our project in class, I wish we had time to meet in individual groups with Professor King. It felt a bit like we were stabbing in the dark, trying to learn as much as we could about the subject while also trying to enter the field as actors ourselves. Lastly, since the project was constantly evolving, it was easy for some team members to duck out of doing the brunt of the work, and to put it on the shoulders of one or a few people. Because of this, I sometimes felt that I didn't have as much time as I would have liked to put into my reading responses, which were initially some of my favorite parts of the course. However, I really really enjoyed the capstone, and am so grateful for the opportunity to have seriously engaged with such important material so early on and while still learning about the subject.If anything, I would recommend that the class be scheduled with a capstone right off the bat, so that shopping students understand what they're getting into and can be ready to commit to the level of outside work needed to successfully complete a capstone. I also think that especially since the students in our class were mostly new to the area of human trafficking, it could have been helpful to discuss more in depth what the options for a capstone would be."

    "Yes. Take it!",
    "Take it! Prof. King makes the class memorable and the guest speakers are A-list practitioners.",
    "Yes, the professor and course material are fascinating!",
    "Yes, I would. Human trafficking, also referred to as 'modern slavery' to give the problem more urgency, is perhaps the most evil, pervasive issue that we have yet to comprehensively tackle. It takes devoted researchers, scholars, and thinkers to engage with it. If you believe that you as a Yale student have the power to save the world, take this class. It might show you a way.",
    "This course is excellent if you're willing to work hard and seriously engage with the material. I left the first class trying to hold back tears because I was so inspired by the work that Professor King had done and how he was asking us to engage in the field. Professor King routinely brought in leaders in the field to talk to our class of ~15 students, such as a member of the Presidential Task Force on Human Trafficking, and multiple leaders of NGO's in the field. Instead of final papers, we did capstone projects in groups for clients in the human trafficking field. If you want to be thoughtful about your responses, which will help you get the most out of the course, the weekly responses require a lot of close reading and creative thought. At the same time, since your capstone projects are uncharted territory, you need to put in a lot of work to do it thoughtfully and successfully. However, if you're willing to commit and learn quickly, you will get so much out of this course."
