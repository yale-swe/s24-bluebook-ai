    "Arabic 110 is a decent intro to modern standard Arabic. The curriculum itself is, I feel, a little skewed; I can say that my uncle was an officer in the army and now works for the United Nations (which he wasn't and doesn't, by the way), but I never learned how to say how old I am. However, I can honestly say that I've made a lot of progress in this semester. You'd be surprised at how much grammar and vocabulary one can learn in a short four months.Although it takes a lot of work to get through the class in one piece (don't foget to study for those weekly quizzes!), it's definitely worth it. I'd recommend the class to anyone who really wants to learn how to speak Arabic. And when case endings rear their ugly heads, just grin and bear it; I hear that when you've advanced enough to learn colloquial Arabic, they don't even matter anymore. :p",
    "Yes I would recommend Arabic 110 01 but with the understanding that taking this course requires dedicated work done daily to keep up because Arabic is not an easy language to learn.",
    "Arabic 110 01 is challenging, a big time commitment, frustrating at times, and ultimately satisfying. I would recommend it IF you are willing to get the most out of it by committing to it and if you have a strong desire to learn Arabic.",
    "If you want to learn Arabic, I definitely recommend taking it here! It seems the Arabic program here has improved a lot over the last few years, because I was pleasantly surprised by how much I learned.Do take note, however, that the vocabulary you learn is very limited at first--you'll know a lot of fairy tale termininology, and how to say United Nations, but you may not know how to ask where the bathroom is. You don't learn much colloquial. Doing MSA will eventually help you with learning colloquial later on, though.Each professor gives a very different vibe to the class. Shady is a little more laid back, and Sarab is more strict, though she's really nice and fun too. In the end, it seemed all sections learned just as much.If you want to actually get good at Arabic, you'll have to study more than just what the class requires. The grading focuses a lot on the writing, so you can get by with not being that good with reading. So if you want to be a good reader or speaker, it'll require extra effort.But I recommend it a lot!",
    "A small classroom setting where everyone must participate. A lot of work consistently. Yes I would recommend it.",
    "Arabic is not an easy language in general, but I think this is especially true at Yale. Though I have always considered myself a \"language person,\" this class was definitely a challenge. There is an average of about an hour and a half of homework per night, though it was not unusual to have more. Most of the bulk of the material was condensed into the first month of class. A lot was expected from the students early on, which was helpful in pushing me to work harder in the class, but was difficult to manage.That being said, if you are willing to put in the effort (and often not get perfect grades), take this class because Arabic is a very interesting language and is worth the effort. The more I learned and the more comfortable I felt, the more I enjoyed the class. Take this class if you have patience and a true desire to learn Arabic.",
    "HW each night. Don't underestimate the weight of the tests.",
    "Arabic is a difficult language to learn, but the first few weeks of the course are the most difficult. The instructors are really kind and understanding, which improves the class overall, but the homework and tests are demanding.",
    "Really enjoyable course. You have to put a lot of work into learning Arabic, but it is definitely worth it. The teaching is good, the classes are fun and the language is very interesting.",
    "The course requires a great deal of daily work and preparation, but is doable. You must be willing to put in a lot of daily, constant effort! But it will pay off.",
    "I would definitely recommend Arabic 110 to someone who is serious about learning the language, and prepared to work really hard to o so. The syllabus says that for success in the course, you are expected to devote and average of 2 hours to arabic per night. I didn't take that seriously when I started the class. I thought it was just a scare tactic or something. But no, you ACTUALLY do. You really actually do",
    "I would certainly NOT recommend this course to another student, unless it was the ONLY course they were taking and only if they had prior knowledge of Arabic. In my section--and from what I gather, in other peoples' sections as well--the only students who made even moderate progress or had any idea what was going on for the last month of the semester were students who have already had a LOT of exposure to Arabic already. If there weren't so many students taking the course that fit that description, the grades average would be way lower and the teachers would be forced to change the speed at which they go.",
    "It is extremely challenging and demanding but extremely rewarding. It is a very high quality course."
