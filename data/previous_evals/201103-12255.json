    "Recommend it",
    "I would not recommend this class to a fellow student. Professor Thompson is funny and makes the class intersting, but that does not compensate for the lack of structure in the class, which seriously hinders the experience. It can often be very stressful anticipating the topic for the two tests. I'd recommend taking Credit D Fail if you take this class, and try to shop TF's!",
    "I would recommend this class as a way to learn about Afro-Atlantic Art and to get an overview of the various styles of dance, music, and art that have been influenced by African traditions.",
    "If you're into music and culture its a great class you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "Take this class before you graduate.",
    "Definitely take this class!",
    "Take this class while you can! It is fun and easy. While you don't actually have to attend class to be able to ace the course, you'll probably find yourself there anyway because Master T is the best.",
    "Good 5th class to take. Interesting subject, great teacher.",
    "History of Art 379 is an amazing class. Master T is one teacher you should have the honor of taking. The class turns into one of your favorite things to do during the week rather than some boring lecture. Master T's comments and actions will have you engaged and laughing.",
    "A great easy class. Master T is extremely entertaining and lecture was always fun.",
    "If you are used to knowing exactly what you need to study, then this class probably isn't for you. There is only a paper and two tests, and so there is basically no work outside of when you are doing those. Your grade will depend on what TF you get - even though it's an easy class, your TF can be a really hard grader.",
    "Yesyesyes",
    "Yes, this class is definitely one you need to take before leaving Yale.",
    "AFAM 112, or \"mambo,\" is definitely a broad overview kind of class. Be prepared for hands-on lectures with participation.",
    "Please, shop this class before you take it because it's not as broadly appealing as the tremendous class size might suggest. It's pretty easy, as long as you have a good TA, and the midterm and the final allow you to, for the most, part just regurgitate everything you've studied (which means that you'll also forget what you crammed for the test the day after). But half the time I couldn't even hear what Prof Thompson was saying because his voice gets lost in the videos he plays over his own voice, which is already incoherent and EXTREMELY mumbly in the first place. Prof Thompson's lecture style is very much either one of a few things: 1) \"Here's a dance \/music\/art style, and this is a list of the characteristics for you to identify it.\" or 2) Play a video of people dancing, and briefly comment on it with exclamations of \"Pow!\" \"tu-ku-tu-KUN!\" or other onomatopoeia, or 3) bring in capoeira masters from Brazil or Gnawa musicians from Morocco and allow them to deliver an entertaining performance for the entire class (which was actually the coolest part of the class). And then there are about six, 1-inch thick books you have to read - my biggest advice is to find others' notes (that have seriously been passed around for years now) for them, because it's a ridiculous amount of reading that most people won't ever do. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this course - coming out of it, I'm not really sure what I learned at all because of the somewhat unorganized lecture style... Ask yourself, do you REALLY want to spend an entire semester studying the Black Atlantic cultural tradition? For some people, it's yes, but really think about it before taking it just because it's a gut. It's tedious and maybe you could spend your time taking classes you are passionate about and not just taking because you want to cram a bunch of African dance moves in your head the night before and spit it out again for the tests.",
    "New York Mambo traces the history of dance in the Americas and Europe back to its roots in the African tradition of dance. It was definitely a class worth taking because it was very interesting, even for people who do not have a dance\/music background.",
    "Defies summary. Just take it.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT NOW. you learn about the caribbean, africa, new york, and how to get girls (and guys). so sexy",
    "Yes its a great class. Lectures are fun and the class is no work for most of the year. However days before tests are stressful. Also its not a guaranteed A. It depends on your TAs grading which sucks. Good class though",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student that wishes to take a humanities class. However, I would warn him that the course is not very specific, it goes over a broad spectrum.",
    "NY Mambo is a great way to be introduced to the Afro-Atlantic tradition and it's impact on art, music, and dance across the globe. With an array of guest speakers and the wisdom of RFT himself, Mambo is a fantastic course that teaches you a lot about Black culture around the world. RFT is the man.",
    "It is a really enjoyable class, and very interesting and entertaining.",
    "It's a fun class, although towards the ends the lectures are just him shouting out random info while we watch a video. Essay questions for the test are very general.",
    "Fun. You'll learn a lot but also kinda not that much.",
    "It is an interesting class with a great professor. I would recommend it if you are looking for a fun class.",
    "Most people who take this course do not take this course. People in the other reviews worship RFT as if he were Jesus Christ. This wouldn't be so dubious if they went to class (and they didn't).(#1)Metaphor: Jesus Christ has 12 disciples. Immediately after meeting him, 10 of the disciples disperse and sing praises of how radical Jesus is, occasionally being brought to their knees with emotion, telling others of his celestial holiness while tears stream down their cheeks like teardrops.Yet, Bartholomew and Simon decide to stick around and realize that they can't actually understand what Jesus is saying. When he speaks to them, he mumbles with emotion or speaks in other languages. He also screams at the man desperately trying to control Jesus's powerpoints.(#2) Meanwhile, Jesus totters around the auditorium and occasionally stops to ask someone to perform dance moves. He shows you some groovy vintage movies and brings in guests,(#3) but that's about it.You may gain little from taking this class. The end result is not concrete, and you are free to Choose Your Own Adventure.If you plan on skipping lecture frequently, turn to page 35.If you plan on attending lecture, turn to page 72.PAGE 35You do not attend more lectures than you need to. Like 60% of the class, you skip all but the most important lectures. You still pass the class by reading others' notes but do not absorb the material.PAGE 72You attend every lecture (as the author of this review did). You are in the minority. You absorb the information (much of which cannot be cross-checked with other sources [#4]) and genuinely want to become enthralled by the material.Due to RFT's haphazard method of stealthily hiding the assigned chapters of the course readings in the middle of a lecture (#5), you will struggle to scribble down the correct chapters down while he competes with himself, spitting out numbers so quickly you wonder if he's broken a world record.#1: On any given day, only 40-50% of the class will attend lecture. I will leave this sad fact and its implications for the reader to interpret.#2: God bless that man's soul. Any technological mishap resulted in a loud, thorough scolding, despite the fact that many times he deserved no blame.#3: Shout out to Jacqui Malone, her lecture on tap dance was poppin'.#4: This will inevitably cause you to sink into a state of deep dispair come midterms and finals seasons; you can and will have moments where you Google terms from the class, only to come up empty handed. You will question the legitimacy of what you are learning. Regardless, the notes you take in lecture and the handouts he gives you are your key to studying for the exams in this course.(##1)#5: RFT disguised the reading assignment for one book within a relative clause in a sentence begun in Portuguese. It blew my hair back.##1: You will only turn in 3 assignments for this class: 1 midterm, 1 final exam, and 1 10-15 page final paper. This can be a good thing, but it also multiplies the pressure on you tenfold come exam day.",
    "This course begins by describing the main qualities of African art, music, and dance, and how they traveled across the Atlantic and influenced these disciplines in the New World. The course is organized so that each day, a different dance or type of music is discussed. Some of these included merengue, tango, bomba, bossa nova, capoeira, rumba, flamenco, gnawa, tap, and mambo. I would definitely recommend it to other students. Master T is an amazing professor. The course has two in-class exams and one 10-15 page paper at the end of the semester. The readings are also very enjoyable and complement some of the material covered in the lectures.",
    "This is a very entertaining class. Not much work, but beware you will find yourself scrambling at the end. Also--your TA might not think it is as big of a joke as you do, so you could get screwed by harsh grading.",
    "This course is loosely structured. If you need a set outline and a rubric to follow, this is not the class for you. There is reading and attendance to the lectures should be mandatory. Not a lot of work, but it's a fun class.",
    "New and different understanding of black atlantic culture, tradition, dance, and art. Shows how they are all interrelated and can be seen in today's world.",
    "There is interesting content if you feel like reading the assigned material but if not, you do not really have to. I would recommend this class for someone if they have time to put in a little effort and are interested in the topic.",
    "The course is great. It is easy but make sure you attend lecture. I thought it was incredibly disrespectful how so may people took it as if though it wasn't a course at all. It is a legitimate class with an amazing professor. Attend lecture!",
    "Amazing.",
    "A fairly easy course that's low key about the history of the afro-atlantic slave tradition",
    "Definitely recommend it.",
    "Take it!",
    "This class is terrific. Lectures are wild and exciting, and you really see how modern culture evolved. It's one of those \"change how you see the world\" classes.",
    "Good class to take for a humanities. Class is not intense and laid back, and only two test and a paper. The paper is pretty open ended which is nice. As are the tests",
    "Highly interesting course. Take just for the fun of it with Professor Thompson.",
    "Must take.",
    "Yes - the class is informative and you'll learn a lot just by sitting in during lecture and listening to Master T do his thing.",
    "I would recommend it for another student. It' an interesting yet easy course. Lectures are enhancing but they are not necessary to go to.",
    "Take it. You'll learn interesting things about black culture and you'll get a good grade without doing much work.",
    "yes",
    "This class is a breeze. Two in-class essays (which have extremely easy questions) and a ten page term paper and that's all. Thompson is a great guy.",
    "I woud recommend that other students should audit this class since it is so much fun, but extremely disorganized and might not be worth it as an actual class for credit. This class was hilarious and fun and I ended up learning a lot about the history of dance and how african customs influenced them. The main problem with the course was that it was very disorganized and no one had any idea what the tests were going to be on or what the paper was supposed to consist of. It was not that much work, but when there was work it was sort of stressful.",
    "I would recommend this course if disorder doesn't stress you out. Master T is so great, he himself is enough of a reason to take this class.",
    "An awesome class with an awesome professor and minimal work.",
    "Definitely take this class. Mr.T is very upbeat, and his lectures are always interesting!",
    "This class is fun, but not much of a class. You don't particularly need to do the reading, although I did end up spending a fair amount of time on the final paper. The material is super interesting and Prof Thompson is great, but I'm not sure it was worth spending a credit on. Audit this class.",
    "Very easy, not a lot of work, interesting",
    "I would recommend taking this course",
    "I would recommend Black Mambo. It gives a general overview of the African roots of Black Atlantic dances.",
    "Definitely!",
    "I would recommend this class to a student because it is laid back and still gives a vast amount of material to learn.",
    "ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND IT. Take it - just take this class and be graced with the presence of an amazing man and his wild antics. It also is not a lot of work so it is a nice breather from other classes.",
    "It was entertaining, so much fun, and a great experience. I would definitely recommend it! If you go to class and put in some effort, you will do well and learn a lot of neat facts too.",
    "Definitely take it! It's fun, laid back, and you actually end up learning quite a bit about something you probably didn't have much background in. The exams consist of one essay each and are very straightforward, and you can write the final paper on basically anything you're interested in.",
    "This is a great class. Very easy and informative.",
    "Just do it. And don't worry about grades. Study one or two topics in full detail for each test and you'll be fine. ENJOY!",
    "Yep. Take it! It's a must. Legend of a class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS .",
    "Yes, take this class with Master T",
    "Good class. Fantastic, engaging lecture. Start the paper early.",
    "I would recommend this course. I really enjoyed it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student to take",
    "If you want an easy class",
    "I would definitely recommend it because it is something very different and interesting.",
    "This is a fantastic class if you read the books and attend the lectures because it is so different and so interesting.",
    "Absolute must-take. Take this class before Master T stops teaching it.",
    "Although the lectures were entertaining, they were very difficult to follow. Most of what I learned was from researching for the paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "One of the best courses that are offered at Yale. Take it if you like to enjoy a good lecture and somewhat like art and philosophy and have an open mind. Do not take it just because it's easy. You'll lose on something.",
    "beauty class",
    "This class is filled with Athletes because it is a known gut. However, they are the only ones that can succeed in the class because it often take 15 people to know what is going on in the class. I would be cautious about taking this course if you do not know anyone else in it.However, Master T is amazing and should not be missed seeing durring your time at Yale. He is inspirational, funny, and amazingly knowledgable. If you want to see a professor who has changed the way the world views each other and see a truly great man speak sit in on the lectures as often as possible.Amazing class to attend, but horrible class to be graded on.",
    "If you want a class you don't have to sweat but for 2 days the whole semester, you found the right course.",
    "its an easy and very interesting course. The most important thing is attending the lectures, they are always fun and dynamic.",
    "take it for a 5th class or if you are interested in the subject!"
