   "comments": [
    "The instructor gives one lecture on electricity. Then groups of four students each give a presentation on another matter. I would not recommend the course. The teacher and students were all very nice but the material was not very interesting.",
    "It is an overview of the best technological advancements of the 20th century. It is a good survey course that is recommendable to any non-science major or individual generally interested in an overview of technology.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn about how things work. It is very interesting to learn about how everyday electronics and inventions function.",
    "Applied Physics 050 01: Interesting at times, but in general not worth taking--it's a course that would be more beneficial as a summer course,simply because it doesn't have much purpose, so as a semester long course it gets frustrating.",
    "An interesting class discussing relevant topics like spacecraft, electricity, flight, etc. It gave me a much better understanding of things I use everyday. Also a good class to take my first semester. The work is not challenging, only occasional problem sets. The class revolves around presentations from other students, which help to give the class a more informal feeling. The final paper was not as bad as I thought it would be, it was fun and interesting to write a more nuanced paper on something I had briefly covered in class. At times the class can drag, but definitely an interesting class that helps to place scientific achievements and technologies in a real-life context.",
    "I would recommend this course as it gives you a working knowledge of how much of our technology works today. Do you know where your electricity comes from? Your water? How planes or maglev trains work? This course provides instruction on these things and more.",
    "I think that the class is good if you want to merely glean a general understanding of a few specific topics in the field of modern technology. It can be very boring at times during lectures, but the work load is always manageable, and you can learn a lot if you're motivated. Definitely a good freshman seminar, and a great science credit if you're not a science person.",
    "A science class for people who dont do science. Very intuitive and you can take it in any direction you want with projects and papers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It is fascinating and relevant way to do science, especially if you are not particularly science focused. You learn a broad range of topics, and the course really improves your understanding of some key scientific and technological issues of the modern world.",
    "I would recommend Applied Physics 050 01 to some students. Those who already have intensive schedules and need a break should take it, I think, but it's unlikely to provide the type of careful, difficult, and frustrating critical thinking that another class might.",
    "I recommend this class to anybody who either struggles with science or would like to study a more qualitative and relatable aspect of it. The class is made up of mostly lectures, with a weekly homework assignment that isn't toodifficult to complete. Many of the lectures are by students with assigned weekly topics. If you need to fulfill your science credit and don't know what to take, definitely consider this class."
