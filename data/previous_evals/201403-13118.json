    "Dr. Hopper is one of the most caring professors I have met at Yale. She is passionate about teaching, always willing to answer questions or provide suggestions beyond the requisite office hours. Her classes were engaging and effective. Take her section if you can!",
    "One of Yale's must take courses!! It's a wonderful writing credit that allows you to write personal non fiction essays and explore different techniques like defamiliarization and split self. Don't be daunted by the perceived heavy workload, it's definitely manageable and Dr. Hopper is a great teacher.",
    "Engl 120 is an amazing course and one I would highly recommend, especially if you love expressing yourself creatively. The class does include a paper or revision nearly every week, but this is something you get used to and is very manageable.",
    "I would very highly recommend English 120 to any student. If you want to improve your sense of voice, gain exposure to cutting-edge modern essays, and learn concrete skills in communication, English 120 is an excellent choice. Although the workload of essays seems daunting, the volume decreases toward the end of the semester, and the work is manageable. If you take one English class at Yale, take English 120!",
    "I would because it improves ones writing"
