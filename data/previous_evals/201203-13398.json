   "comments": [
    "I would totally reccomend it. It was a hard class, but rewarding, and shapes the way you read and analyze articles, and the way you wrtrite essays as well. Beware, you cannot just sit quietly in the class, you will need to dedicate yourself.",
    "You get a few essays assigned to read for class, you read them and then discuss them. Then you write papers. Its a pretty straightforward english class.",
    "English 120 is a must take---even for STEM majors. Your writing will improve through this class and Professor Kinder was especially great. If you need a writing credit and don't know what to take, your search can end here.",
    "English 120 is a survey of many styles of nonfiction\/creative essays. You will do *a lot* of writing for this course, and it will improve your creative nonfiction writing greatly, although it doesn't deal at all with academic writing, which I somehow didn't quite realize beforehand. Different professors teach very differently, so shop different classes if you can. I would definitely recommend it if you like writing and want to focus on a style of writing that you likely didn't do a lot of in high school.",
    "In english 120 you write a series of non-fiction, non-academic essays on various predetermined topics. You write a draft, receive feedback on it, and then incorporate that feedback into a final draft which you turn in to for a grade. I would recommend it, I think it really improves your writing skills.",
    "I would recommend this course if you like writing more than analyzing literature, and if you enjoy creative writing (sort of -- it's still non-fiction) more than research papers. Also, be prepared to participate in discussion every class period, and make sure you do the reading before each class (which shouldn't be hard as they aren't that long and they're usually pretty interesting).",
    "English 120 is an excellent class if you want to improve your non-academic writing, or writing in general, or are interested in becoming a writer\/essayist. The readings and discussion are helpful in identifying different techniques writers use, and Professor Kinder is passionate about writing. The five essays can be a little overwhelming and seem to be quite a bit of writing, but Professor Kinder really tries to help you improve your writing and essays and wants them to be the best they can be. In the end, a really great English class!",
    "Yes. ENGL120 would greatly help you improve your writing. And non-fictions are not that boring. Some of the pieces are very gripping in fact - I was surprised.",
    "Yes. Take it, without a doubt. Shop for the Professor who jives with you, be prepared to write, but definitely take it.",
    "If you're serious about writing, take this course. The professors treat you like a writer, and give you detailed feedback. Highly recommended, but be warned, it's a lot of work.The class meets two times a week to discuss assigned essay readings on whatever unit the class is on -- profiles, place essays, personal essays, satire, and cultural criticism. These discussions are supposed to assist students in writing their own essays -- there are five in total, but you must turn in a first draft of every essay. Each student also has one essay workshopped by the class over the course of the term.",
    "Yes. Take it. You'll learn things about yourself and become a more sensitive person in the process. Take it with Kinder. She's one of the newer instructors, but I can't recommend her highly enough. I haven't had a professor at Yale that cares more about the course she's teaching or her students. She completely invests herself in the class and it shows. How many professors do you know would, stranded in Brooklyn, Skype into class instead of cancelling it? If you're going to take the course, be sure to make room for it in your schedule. You'll get a lot out if you put a lot in. And do put a lot in. It's worth it. It's so, so worth it."
