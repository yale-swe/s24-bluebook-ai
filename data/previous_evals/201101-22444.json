   "comments": [
    "definitely more difficult than SWAH 110, but still doable. do well on the homeworks and it can help balance out the occasional unfavorable quiz grade. the professor and TAs are super nice and the class is so small that you feel like you're part of a family. you'll end up hanging out with your class and planning events, its like a built-in group of friends. you'll learn a lot about noun modifiers and those can be a little tricky, but if you study well, you should be fine.also, the african languages department skit night at the end of the semester is SUPER FUN!!!! (they feed you awesome african food and you get to dress in traditional stuff) skit night is a reason in and of itself to take 120.",
    "Hey, its your only choice if you want to learn swaz!I enjoyed it. individual resuls may vary",
    "Kiswahili 120 is an amazing course! You\u0092ll learn a lot of Swahili in a laid-back atmosphere and get to know the other students in your class. Swahili is such an interesting language, and you\u0092ll be amazed at how much you know by the end of the year. I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in learning Swahili.",
    "Kiswahili is a fun language to learn and I highly recommend it for the teachers and the beauty of the language.",
    "I would definitely recommend Kiswahili 120 to students who already completed 110. It is more challenging than 110, but you develop your vocab and control of grammar so you appreciate the language a lot more. Even though the class meets every morning of the week, the professor, TFs, and other students make it worthwhile.",
    "This class is great! Definitely take it!",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend Kiswahili 120 as a very good language course that will provide a solid grammatical and vocabulary base to work from.",
    "Yes because the community is great and the language is really not that hard to learn. I believe that this is a great class with great instructors and worthwhile to take.",
    "I would highly recommend this course and Kiswahili as a language. I would summarize it as a truly interesting language that isn't too difficult to learn and could be very useful to know."
