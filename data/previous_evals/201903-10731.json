    "I learned the basic grammar and structure to Chinese and an overall excellent introduction to the language. I learned hundreds of characters as well as learned how to do basic speech.",
    "I've learned so many characters and Chinese sentence structures this semester. I've learned to develop better study habits and push myself to always improve.",
    "I learned how to speak, read, and write in Chinese.",
    "A surprisingly strong background in elementary Chinese.",
    "I have gained a basic knowledge of Chinese grammar, vocabulary, and speaking patterns.",
    "As the title of the course would suggest, the class teaches basic Chinese for people with no prior experience at all. You learn a lot of vocabulary, grammar, and speaking skills, as much as one could reasonably expect to learn in a semester.",
    "I gained a very thorough introduction of the fundamentals of Chinese, deepening my understanding of its culture and of its linguistics.",
    "The basics of reading, writing, speaking and listening to Mandarin.",
    "Good knowledge of grammar, listening, reading and writing",
    "basic grammar, conversational skills, vocabulary Over all, I would say that the course put emphasis on active conversation, rather than on passive knowledge of grammar or vocabulary.",
    "I feel that I learned a lot of essential vocabulary and grammar that will help me to hold basic conversations already. I also trained myself to memorize and adopt habits and tricks to remember large amounts of characters."

   "comments": [
    "I thought this course was excellent. It provided a lot of practice and really drilled characters into us that made me feel like I really learned the material. There were occasionally times were it felt like we had to learn unfinished lessons on our own, but overall I thought we were taught really well.",
    "The teachers are absolute gems in this course, and I appreciate everything they do. There are no weaknesses.",
    "The class is very well structured and very engaging every day. Sometimes, we learn lessons before we learn the new vocabulary and that becomes difficult.",
    "I really liked how many different styles of learning there were in this course. We were constantly asked to speak in class and practiced with a wide variety of exercises.",
    "This course is excellent. It is very straightforward, and, although rigorous, never felt unmanageable. The teaching is great. I can think of no improvements.",
    "Strength: professor's interaction with students",
    "Over all, I highly enjoyed this course, and I already feel comfortable having basic conversations in Chinese. The strengths of this course are the high level of engagement with students, the daily quizzes that really force you to study characters\/vocabulary. While I think this course is excellent as it is, I wish I had learned more about Chinese culture.",
    "I think there is a lack of cultural learning that would be interesting to have but there is just not enough time for it alongside the great amount of the language needed to be learned. The course teaches a lot of important grammar crucial to the understanding of Chinese, and the textbooks are really good for helping you memorize."

   "comments": [
    "I definitely would to someone whos interested in learning the language. The classroom environment was excellent and my professor was really invested in us learning, which made me really motivated to work hard and do well.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to whoever wants to learn a new language from really great teachers.",
    "Yes. If you are dedicated to learning Chinese, you will learn a lot.",
    "Absolutely. This is a great way to start learning such a fascinating language.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. If you want to learn Chinese, taking this course will put you on a great start. It's a grind, but never too much, and i say that as a pretty lazy student. The teaching is great, and class is very fun.",
    "If the student is interested in pursuing a very rigorous, but very rewarding experience, I strong suggest that Chinese is a suitable language course for them.",
    "Absolutely. The challenge is worth it. This class does as intended - it teaches Mandarin.",
    "Students who have an interest in Chinese language and culture",
    "Yes, if you are determined student, I would highly recommend to take this class. While the workload can be really intense, it is all the more rewarding to be able to engage in basic conversations in Chinese and know 400+ characters just after a few months of learning the language.",
    "Yes, it does a great job of making you learn a great amount of Chinese vocabulary and grammar in a short amount of time. The class is also entertaining and can be made fun. However, it is a lot of work and often requires lots of time dedicated to straight memorization."
