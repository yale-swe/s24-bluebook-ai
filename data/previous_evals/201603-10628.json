   "comments": [
    "I learned so much in this class! I no longer look at plants the same way and am so proud of how much I learned about plants as a whole. I will take the knowledge that I learned in this class with me forever.",
    "I was thinking about this the other day, and I think one of the most valuable skills I took away from this class is how to look at a plant. I feel like now I know to look for if the leaves are toothed or not, compound or simple, how many stamens a flower has etc...",
    "Learned how to identify plant structures on samples and to depict them in drawing, learned to look at plants more closely and recognize variations in vegetative morphology, reproductive morphology, etc.",
    "Learned a lot about how to identify certain plant structures, families, etc.",
    "I learned how to ID plants and plant traits.",
    "I learned about plants in a practical lab setting",
    "l learned how to identify plants! The most important skill ever.",
    "Learned to identify plants and apply knowledge from class",
    "I learned a great deal about various plant families and how to identify them. I learned about the beautiful Marsh Botanical Gardens that are free and available to the public. I learned a greater appreciation for plants in general and think I have overcome my \"plant blindness\" as Prof. Donoghue calls it.",
    "I was rid of plant blindness! There are so many cool ways to be a plant, and plants change the world in big ways! Really reinforces\/adds finer points to my previous evolutionary knowledge (i'm an EEB major)",
    "Plant identification and enthusiasm for plant diversity",
    "Learned how to observe small differences between plants that to a layperson may be imperceptible",
    "I learned a great deal about plants in this lab; how to identify them, what their structures are, how they develop, how they function and how different plants and plant foods are related.",
    "I went from knowing nothing about plants to knowing quite a few things about plants, and also was able to better grasp concepts in evolutionary biology that I had never really understood before."

   "comments": [
    "I loved this class! I thought it was very well taught. I really enjoyed how hands-on the lab was and thought that it was really helpful for learning the material.",
    "I honestly don't have any complaints about the course. I thought the ratio of guidance to independence in the class was really amazing. I really appreciated how knowledgeable and willing to help Sarah, Maddy and Michael were and I also really appreciated that they gave us freedom in how long we wanted to stay, what we wanted to focus on etc. Loved the food!! And really appreciated the time and effort put into organizing the plants and foods.",
    "The strengths of the course are the instructors and the unconventional nature of the class. Prof. Donoghue is incredibly supportive, engaged, ready to answer questions (or approach you if you don't have any questions). It was just a delight to be able to go and draw for a few hours a week, and it was a valuable learning experience to get hands-on experience identifying structures and morphological differences every week. The only weakness I would identify is lack of clarity with regards to expectations. During lab, all I knew was that there was stuff to draw, so I went and drew it and labeled things. Which was fun, but often felt like I could get away with not trying super hard.",
    "I don't think that this class had any weaknesses really. Professor Donaghue is a wonderful professor, and this lab is very engaging and interesting.",
    "It was to abstract at times",
    "I loved this course, would not change a thing.",
    "I liked how closely linked this lab was with the lecture, Plant Diversity and Evolution. Prof. Donoghue taught the lecture as well as the lab and was present for every session. We would talk about a group of plant families in lecture and that same week we would be looking at them in lab. The generous quantity and variety of plant based snacks served graciously at every lab was also fantastic. The environment was relaxed and friendly. Some criticism: I wish we could have focused on fewer plant families and spent more time on them. We were only vaguely encouraged to draw several examples from each plant family, but I think being required to draw at least two would have helped greatly, as species from each family can differ greatly. More pointers as to what specific traits or groups of traits we ought to be looking for in each family to identify them would have been helpful as well. Lastly, I think a couple quizzes structured similarly to the final practice exam would have been very help for our preparation. The practical exam was very difficult even when I studied a great deal. Neutral: no lab reports made the workload extremely low but I think hurt us because we did have any structured out of class practice to prepare us for the practical exam.",
    "strengths: teaching - Prof Donoghue makes everything interesting and effectively ties together all the different parts. He's also just an amazing person. weaknesses: sometimes we didn't know what was expected of us. I have no idea why i got the grade I got on my lab notebook, for example.",
    "Strengths - it's a lot of fun, you learn a lot, low workload outside of lab Weaknesses - the final doesn't especially reflect all the work you may put into the class",
    "The only thing that could be improved would be the final exam. Very very challenging and not really any good way to practice that beforehand.",
    "The lab is rather free form. I found the brief lectures at the start very helpful, especially the part where Dr. Donoghue delineated the specific structures we needed to look at during each lab session. The free form allows students to get as much out of the lab as they would like and I think most would agree to maintain that free form. The types of plants available are seasonally dependent, but that can't be helped.",
    "No improvements, it's great"

    "I would absolutely recommend this course! The lab was so much fun; it was the best lab I have taken at Yale by far! It is really relaxing and you learn a lot.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class! I learned so much, had a great time, and was excited to go to the greenhouse every week.",
    "Yes! Super hands on, good change of pace, learn a lot, improve your drawing.",
    "The lab is so dope, plus you have to take it anyways. Would absolutely recommend this to another student.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was a lot of fun, and I learned so many things about plants.",
    "WARNING be very careful taking this class for your premed lab. It was much much harder than I expected. The previous evaluations painted this as and easy class but it was far from it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.",
    "It's a really social environment and donoghue does a fantastic job of getting to know everyone and spending one on one time to explain various plants.",
    "Yes, DEFINITELY take this class. Even if you haven't learned about plants or taken any bio since high school. I had no college level bio nor AP level and I was able to grasp everything. Prof. Donoghue is always willing to talk and help you, but you need to reach out and ask. Specific to this lab: they basically feed you every week during your session. Dave, a worker at the greenhouse, goes out and finds exotic and tasty treats made from the plants we are studying that week. It's incredible and made me look forward to lab every week.",
    "YES as long as you like eating food and learning about the entire history of plants (lots of memorization, but lots of FUN!!)",
    "I would recommend this course to any student (from any major). This was one of the most enjoyable courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, it's a great class!",
    "YES take it. One of my favorite classes at Yale (and definitively my favorite lab). You spend as much time as you want\/need (about 2-3 hours) in the greenhouse drawing and labeling plants. LITERALLY, YOU GET TO HANG OUT IN A GREENHOUSE AND DRAW PLANTS. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. This is about as far from gen chem lab you could possibly get (which is a damn good thing). They also provide food-- eating plants\/plant products that are in the families that you're studying. WE HAD GUAC ONE DAY, CHERRY PIE THE NEXT. Your quality of life as a science major will BE SO HIGH. And all of this doesn't even start on how awesome Donoghue is. He is the literal bomb. Do whatever you need to do, but take this class.",
    "Yes, you learn about something that you probably barely thought of before. And plants are really fascinating.",
    "Take it! Don't expect an easy time, but as a non-major I took it Cr\/D and am so happy I took it. Learned lots of interesting stuff and was never stressed out about it."
