    "I gained skills in critically reading academic journal articles and engaging with complex, scholarly arguments. I learned a lot more about various aspects of cognitive science, thanks to the broad approach of the seminar.",

   "comments": [
    "good info but could use more up to date articles on some topics",
    "Maybe syllabus voting should occur earlier? Idk, it doesn't have to; the course was great.",
    "The readings for this course were generally interesting. The two-hour discussion format felt stale by the end, especially because our conversations were not always the most stimulating. Overall the class exposed me to some new areas of cogsci, and was a good way to get a depth credit.",
    "This is a strong course, with well-selected readings and excellent reading response assignments each week to maximize engagement. I would have liked more structure and guidance about writing the final paper, and maybe even some time at the beginning of the semester devoted to teaching reading\/analysis skills for cogsci articles, since a lot of the reading was dense and used complex statistical methods, etc.",
    "Strengths: Interesting topics, Professor Sheskin was very approachable and did a good job leading discussion, very reasonable reading load, fair due date policy Weakness: The topics for some classes were very boring, and some were very interesting, so my engagement varied week by week"

    "This is actually a fantastic class! The 925 was rough on a few weeks, but Mark is an incredible seminar leader and really engaged everyone throughout the course. I would approach this seminar with the willingness to engage and learn, and you'll have an incredible time.",
    "If you have room as a CogSci junior, take it. It gives you a good level of familiarity with the field across its many branches, and is pretty fun.",
    "If you'd like to survey Cognitive Science material and meet other Cognitive Science majors, take this course.",
    "I would recommend this course as a good way to do some interesting readings and get a depth credit for the major",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to CogSci majors. I thought that it was a great way to learn about the most mportant and exciting concepts in CogSci.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone in the cogsci program, or even anyone with a passing interest in cogsci, given how broad the material is.",
    "Absolutely take this seminar if you are a cog sci major.",
    "It's a easy, interesting class. The topic varies week by week so some classes are more interesting than others. The reading load is doable and there is just a weekly reading response and a term paper to worry about."
