   "comments": [
    "Enviro Engineering is a good class if someone isn't sure about what specific kind of engineering they want to go into, as its a really broad course, and someone who is really interested in Engineering. I personally would recommend the class; the workload isn't bad, the grading is really nice, and the lectures get boring but are usually skippable.",
    "This class provided a general overview of what Environmental Engineering really is and what people study. I would definitely recommend this class to all who is interested. You don't even have to be majoring in environmental engineering because you can still learn about air quality, water contaminants, and much more.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in science, chemistry, biology, environmental issues, etc. I found every lecture interesting and looked forward to going to class every day. Definitely take it. It's not too much work, and Professor Peccia is awesome.",
    "Yes, not a class where you learn an extreme amount, but low workload, so good learning to work ratio.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in a theoretical and practical introduction to Environmental Engineering. The course has its fair share of calculations, math, and quantitative aspects, but if you don't miss a class you will be on top of what you need to know.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT",
    "I would say that it's a good class, with some dry points, but it can be pretty rewarding if you put the time in. It's definitely got some work in it, but it's never overwhelming and Prof. Peccia is a fair teacher and grader.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend this course if your at all interested in learning about pollution, waste, and how we study it and deal with it. It's relaxed, low work\/difficulty, and got me very excited to study environmental engineering further. Even if you know you're not going to major in it, it's a wonderful overview of the subject and makes you appreciate all that our public utilities actually do for us.",
    "I would definitely take this course. It is not that difficult yet you learn a lot about the environment.",
    "This class is good if you are considering environmental engineering. It gives a good overview of what the major entails, and there aren't very many problem sets throughout the semester. But they do take a bit of time to complete when they are assigned. Peccia usually gave about a week and a half to 2 weeks notice before a problem set was due, though, so as long as you stay on top of it the class isn't too bad work-wise.",
    "Forget about taking any other science and take this! There's only about 5-6 problem sets, a midterm, and a final. There are also 2-3 one question quizzes. Seriously, take this class, you'll be glad you did.",
    "I would highly reccomend this class to anyone interested in the Engineering department. The class is heavily weighted on problem sets, so the exams arent so crucial. Even if you arent interested in Engineering it was an interesting QR for people out there looking for those.",
    "YEs, I think it is a fairly interesting class and does not require a high level of scientific background.",
    "You have to be interested in the material - if you are, it's a good class. Not too difficult in terms of grading; problem sets can be hard but they're always graded leniently. If you have no interest in environmental engineering (and don't confuse ENVE with environmental studies...) you won't enjoy this course at all though.",
    "Weirdly, I really loved this class. I did the problem sets as a way to procrastinate on the rest of my work, and it felt really great to realize that I still basically remember high school chemistry and calculus. The excessive enthusiasm was probably a symptom of Humanities Major Right Answer Deprivation Syndrome (HMRADS), but the course itself was well-organized and well-taught. In addition to the people who are taking it for legitimate career-related reasons, I would also recommend it to Sc-hunters who feel kind of disgusted by the gut course thing. It is, to be honest, pretty easy as for-majors courses go, but it was hard enough to be fun instead of soul-killing. Take it if you liked AP Chem back in the day.",
    "Not an exciting course, but cursorily interesting. Lots of chemistry (don't take it unless you have a good HS or intro college chemistry background). Not easy, but doable for a very non-math\/science person.",
    "Yes.",
    "If you're a non-science major: this might be a great way to fulfill the QR requirement especially if you have the required chemistry backgroundFor science majors: unless you're an ENVE major, you're going to be really really bored.If you think you want to major in ENVE, well then you have to take this course so...",
    "Interesting class, I took it as a non-major and didnt need for distributional requirements and enjoyed it. If you are solid with high school chem\/math it is very doable.",
    "It's a really easy fifth class or QR\/SC credit. If you're interested in the major, you have to take it to meet requirements, but it's not a rigorous engineering class.",
    "I enjoyed taking this course very much. Its strengths were that it gave an excellent and relatively easy-to-understand overview of environmental engineering. Thus, it was a good survey course for those considering the major and also gave students who were simply interested in the subject a good knowledge of important calculations and concepts in environmental engineering. I liked that Professor Peccia mixed both PowerPoint presentations containing general information with actual notes on the board - this was a good mix in terms of presenting new material.Professor Peccia was a hilarious teacher - I enjoyed coming to his classes. He is exuberant and enthusiastic and I loved his little side jokes! I also appreciated his efforts to make the topics we covered accessible to students without any experience in the subject. He made sure the material didn't go over your head. However, his notes can be a bit confusing - make sure to go to office hours to learn how to actually solve the problem sets. Also, there aren't many quizzes - try not to slip up on them since everything (problem sets, quizzes, midtem final exam) are worth approximately the same.",
    "Easy course with emphasis on the math side of engineering rather than the qualitative side. I wish there was more up to date information on environmental engineering today.",
    "take it.",
    "The material is pretty manageable if you've taken genchem.",
    "I would recommend it if you have little or no chemistry background and are interested in environmental engineering.",
    "Environmental Engineering explores wastewater\/drinking water treatment, air pollution, chemical dispersion, and things of this sort. CLARIFICATION: It does not really have anything to do with sustainable design or environmental architecture. I recommend this class to students who have a strong chemistry background. I would not recommend it to those just trying to fulfill a distributional requirement. Prof. Peccia gives only whole letter grades (i.e. A, B, C) which can be good or bad. Grading of problem sets (~7 total) is liberal and it's not hard to get a 9\/10. That said, be prepared to work a decent amount on sometimes confusingly written problems. It's helpful to work with classmates, but make absolute sure you know how to do the problems. Just about everything on the quizzes (~3) and the midterm and final exams are very like problem set problems. Overall an interesting class, and Prof. Peccia brings in 3 guest lecturers knowledgeable in Environmental Engineering. Don't expect anyone to hold your hand (It's college, after all). A few Pset problems require excel. If you take it, you should make this class a priority and spread out the work.",
    "I wouldn't take this class if you are simply interested in the environment; only if you want this to be your major. I heard the rest of the classes in environmental engineering are more interesting. It isn't very hard, but it isn't particularly interesting either and sometimes it can be forgotten in the typical pile of classes. Even as an environmental studies major I would skip over this one.",
    "No I would not recommend this course unless you are looking for a relatively easy class. The problem sets ended up being quite tricky and time consuming. I come away from the class having a difficult time figuring out what I actually learned--very little that's clear. As an intro class both the math and the concepts are very simple. Exams covered a few concepts from gen. chem. and a few problems that were nearly identical to problem set or problems we had done in class. Rarely felt that I actually understood the ins and outs of a topic.Shop the class to see if the structure of the course works or interests you. This class was definitely not my favorite but a few of my friends were much happier with it."
