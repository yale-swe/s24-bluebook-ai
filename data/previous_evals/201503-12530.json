    "SPAN 350 is a fine course if you're trying to knock out your language requirement with an L5, but it's nothing to get too excited about. I went into the class thinking it would be seminar-style and allow for some discussion, but in reality the prof is talking for 95% of class (which may be preferable for some people with different learning styles, but which I found exhausting). The readings are definitely the best part of the course--Borges is a delight, and the syllabus is pretty well put-together. I'm sure literature and\/or Spanish majors probably got more out of this course than I did. Ultimately, if you're just looking for an L5 after placing out of the first two semesters with AP credit, this will be your best option only if you're super into Spanish lit--just know that you will be surrounded by a bunch of native speakers. On the plus side, though it's definitely not as gutty as Medical or Legal Spanish, the workload is very manageable up until the final 12-15 page paper, which is a monster if you're a proficient, non-native speaker like me.",
    "I liked this class a lot! It's a cool overview of the stories of Borges's--you start with his earliest collections, read his most famous ones, and end the semester with his later writings (including a little of his essays and poetry). Borges is very concise and plot-driven in his writing, which makes for fun reading, and there are never more than 3-4 stories assigned for each class. Professor Gonzalez-Perez is also super nice and really wants to see his students succeed. The class is run mostly like a lecture, though.",
    "A great intro to Borges' thought and work. Definitely recommended; topics are very interesting and Anbal is always available to discuss the readings both in and out of class. He is a supportive professor who cares about his students, and obviously loves the material that we discuss in this class. His enthusiasm for Borges is infectious!",
    "A very enjoyable class, with a totally reasonable workload. 2 short stories a week, plus a few little quizzes, a very straightforward midterm, and a final paper on a story not covered in class. Prof. Gonzalez is super friendly and is good at explaining the stories and giving them context. My Spanish comprehension definitely improved, though not my speaking so much, since class mostly consisted of the professor talking, and not a whole lot of discussion. I highly recommend this class for anyone who wants to keep up their Spanish and be introduced to a fantastically interesting author.",
    "Fascinating course but too bad there was absolutely no discussion. I wish I had had the chance to share my thoughts too and discuss them with the professor and other students. Uncertainty about my grade also made me very uneasy throughout the semester. I have no clue of what grade Im going to get.",
    "This class is great. Be prepared to read a lot and the final essay takes a lot, but this is a course you will enjoy.",
    "Not too much reading but the stories and poems are hard to understand until the awesome discussion in class.",
    "No, I would not take this class. The class should be advertised as a lecture because it is not a seminar. The quizzes and exams belong in a middle school classroom because they ask you to recall secondary characters' names, items' names, and cite random quotes. This forces you to read the stories with the quizzes in mind and sacrifice content reading and pondering for attempting to anticipate which random book or character will appear on a quiz. The best part about this course was writing the final essay which took place between Borges and I, no where near the classroom for this course. I loved reading the stories and I love Borges even more but taking this class was largely a waste of a Yale credit."
