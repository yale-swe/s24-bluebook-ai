    "So much!! Zeta function, gamma function, conformal maps, history of maths etc",
    "This is the first course where I learned what a large part of mathematics is really all about. Why do people care about divisors of an algebraic variety? What's with all this elliptic curve stuff? And just what the heck does hyperbolic geometry have to do with anything? It was super cool, and along the way we studied a lot of standard complex analysis that every math major should see - Riemann mapping theorem, fractional linear transformations, Schwarz reflection, zeta function, etc. and so forth."

    "This was a small class, so everyone in class was paying 100% attention. (If you don't, you'll be lost). Goncharov did a great job connecting ideas that he talks about in class, and tries to answer any questions you have. Very very good class. Goncharov might appear intimidating, but he is a great lecturer. This is one of the best math classes I've taken at Yale. Grades are a little bit sketchy. I have no idea what grade I might get in this class, but the experience so far has been awesome!",
    "Sometimes things were hard to follow because they weren't explained in language most of the students were used to. For example, I am not very familiar with distributions, so a proof using the language of distribution is less clear then a proof just using some calculation, even though the proof using distributions is the morally correct proof.",
    "Definitely the greatest strength of this course was Professor Goncharov. He knows exactly how to explain ideas, how to think about certain topics, the historical context of it all, and what's the best material to cover. My biggest complaint is that there isn't a textbook, but there's no textbook that follows the material he chooses to cover in the order he covers it, and explains everything as he does."

   "comments": [
    "YES! Take it with Goncharov. Take any classes with Goncharov. He's difficult, but he is so much more engaging than many lecturers.",
    "My understanding of complex analysis and mathematics in general was advanced tremendously by this class. Every class, my understanding of some topic that I thought I understood was completely revolutionized. For example, I used to think of Cauchy's theorem as some result from hard analysis using keyhole contours. Now I see that it is just Stoke's theorem, and that the Cauchy-Riemann equations guarantee that every holomorphic differential form is closed. This is the most enlightening class I have taken at Yale.",
    "No math major should graduate without taking this class, and if you get the chance to take it with Goncharov DROP EVERYTHING ELSE TO TAKE THIS CLASS. This was the best math class I have ever taken, and I have not heard the same from other students who took it with other professors. Not only do you learn a lot of crucial complex analysis, but you touch upon a lot of really important subjects in other areas of math, like topology, number theory, algebraic geometry, and so on. The exams were not easy, but the homework was very reasonable and Goncharov is a fair grader. Seriously, I cannot recommend this class enough."
