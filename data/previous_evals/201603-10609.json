    "Elementary korean skills.",
    "After taking this course, I am able to speak conversationally in Korean and have a strong background in the Korean language.",
    "A great introduction to the Korean Language!",
    "I learned how to communicate in both speaking and writing in Korean. I learned basic grammar patterns and many different verb conjugations. Like any language",
    "My family speaks Korean at home, so coming in my listening comprehension was already very decent. However, I never really spoke Korean in my household, so my speaking ability was very weak and my writing and reading ability was nonexistant. When I was considering Korean 110, I was worried that the students would all be brand new to the language, and I wouldn't be challenged throughout the semester. However, as I found out many of the students were just like me, and had some knowledge of Korean in the past, but no formal education in it. Angela Lee-Smith seems to understand this type of student extremely well, and caters to our specific difficulties extremely well, as well as being a phenomenal teacher to complete newcomers. My grammatical knowledge of the Korean language has increased so much just by taking this introductory course, and I enjoyed this class so much that I'm now considering studying it abroad."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Lee-Smith spoke in mostly Korean to train our ears to pick up the words, but she always translated if we have not encountered the vocabulary before. She was very energetic which made me eager to learn the language.",
    "While this course requires a high level of involvement and is time consuming, both inside and outside of class, I don't think that it is so hard\/ complicated that it would strain a person to do. You get to constantly practice your speaking and writing skills and you also have a T.A who can help you with any problems you may have.",
    "The oral listening book (Open Your Ears Wide) was much easier than the Student Workbook, so I wish the two texts were more similar to each other\/",
    "The professor was incredible. Meeting everyday made the course incredibly effective as the concepts were fresh in my mind each day. The professor also provided opportunities to connect with her on a social level which made the class a very close and friendly experience.",
    "One of the core strengths of this class is definitely Angela Lee-Smith. She has a comprehensive knowledge of the Korean and English language, and immediately has an answer to any grammatical questions that arise in class. She's very good at abstracting many of the more complex grammatical patterns into high-level language, so we never feel overwhelmed by the grammatical complexities of the language. Through our speaking presentations that we give in class, I feel like she's given us an opportunity to gain an authentic sense of where we stand with the language - which has been invaluable to me. I really appreciate how she focuses on everyday conversational language. Though we frequently learn colloquialisms, we she always reminds us to retain the foundations of proper grammar first."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the Korean language is so beautifully structured and Professor Lee-Smith is so passionate about teaching. Learning with her has been a great experience and it makes me want to continue to L4 and possibly beyond just to have Professor Lee-Smith again.",
    "I would completely recommend this course to another student. If the student is interested in Korean Culture, I would advice that they take this course. The teacher is super kind and loving and of makes the class feel like a home itself, which facilitates the learning process. Right now, I am moving to L2 and I am planing on continuing with Korean until I can have this teacher again. for more advanced level. She is really good at what she does.",
    "Of course. Any student looking for a new language either for themselves or for the distributional requirement should look into this class and teacher!",
    "Absolutely. Professor Lee-Smith is such a wonderful professor and person, and she definitely made my Korean L1 experience worthwhile. I'd love to take another class with her!",
    "This course was a wonderful introduction to the Korean language. Professor Lee does a stellar job of teaching basic grammar concepts and helping students apply it to writing and speaking skills. This course was also incredibly fun. We experienced everything from kpop to Korean food.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Korea is blowing up in pop culture nowadays, and that makes the cultural presentations that much more satisfying to do. Lee Angela-Smith is an excellent educator - she's exceedingly kind and accommodating, but don't be fooled, she'll push you to do your personal best in the class."
