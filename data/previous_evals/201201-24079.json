    "Take it if you are prepared to do more work than you think and if you're ok with a seminar that's more like a lecture.",
    "This is a great course, and I ended up watching (and analyzing) so many hilarious movies, tv shows, and stand up performances that I never would have sat down to watch on my own. Professor Friedfeld forces you to analyze why things are funny. Just because the class is about comedy, don't be fooled -- it is a lot of work.",
    "You'll watch fun clips and movies but be warned that it's way more work than you'd expect.",
    "Fun class! Learn about comedy. Professor Friedfeld is really knowledgeable and a great, great guy. You will have fun, especially once the class shifts towards more modern comedy.",
    "Pretty much the only way to go if you're at all interested in this stuff. Professor Friedfeld is a gem and if you put the work in the essays will teach you a lot. Class discussion could be better.",
    "The class can be a fair amount of work for a college seminar on comedy, but I still totally recommend it. Where else can you do an analysis of the cultural and comedic significance of the \"Schweddy Balls\" sketch from SNL? Great course, apply for it! Seniors may have an easier time getting in than anyone else, but if you are an underclassman really dying to get in, send in a piece of your own writing that is FUNNY on top of your standard writing samples. He'll love it.",
    "Comedy through the ages, from Chaplin to the Wedding Crashers-- if you like to laugh, take this course.",
    "Great class--you learn a ton about the history of comedy, and you spend lots of time analyzing comedians' techniques and the evolution of comedy throughout history. The papers were incredibly fun to write, which something I can't really say about any other class I've taken here (I wrote mine on Anchorman, James Bond and Austin Powers). And Eddy is jaw-droppingly knowledgeable about all things comedy and is happy to help you out with any questions or move deadlines to accommodate your schedule (helpful since almost everyone in the class was writing a thesis that semester).Only caveat--it's a LOT of work. It's all fun work, since you're watching movies and clips and reading books about comedy, but it comes up to around 7 or 8 hours of work a week (usually something like 2 movies, 20ish clips and some articles and book chapters and then a 15 questions reading response). It's actually not THAT much for a once a week seminar, but just try to space it out and don't cram it in in the day and a half before the reading response was due, like I did."
