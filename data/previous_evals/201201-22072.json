   "comments": [
    "NO! Don't take it if you don't want to spend 20 hours in lab. The randomly assigned groups for the project get pretty messy. You go through tons of material and reading; but don't see so much the practical side of it as you'd expect!",
    "It's a ton of work towards the end, and the bottom line is that you're making a tissue on your own with basically no assistance from the teachers.Although I did learn a lot and I hope my grade is good, I wouldn't quite recommend it, because it's too much stress\/work.",
    "Interesting overview of tissue engineering basics, lots of cell biology\/anatomy covered. The papers are typically very recent and relevant to the field. The lab portion is an excellent way to get some hands-on experience with designing and testing your own tissues. The lectures are not worthwhile if Liqiong Gui is still giving them.",
    "BENG 464 is both a difficult and rewarding course. It is a large time commitment, but the end result of a semester long laboratory project is extremely satisfying. Lectures were often very dense, as were the lecture based exams, but the laboratory work made the course worthwhile. Be prepared to spend upwards of 5-10 hrs a week in the laboratory, where often reading and class preparation can be completed while tests, assays, and procedures are being run. I would immediately recommend this course to anyone with previous lab experience, interest in the field of tissue engineering, and a team oriented mentality. This was the most rewarding science class I have ever taken."
