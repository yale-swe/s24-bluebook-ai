   "comments": [
    "Take it! This was the first time the class was offered and I certainly hope they continue it. Suzanne is really helpful and the class syllabus is flexible. I had no programming experience and did not find this to be a hindrance. I'm now a big fan of R and try to convince all of my friends to use it. This is definitely the way of the future for biological research.",
    "This is class is what the title states, an introduction to programming in the language of R. You will learn the basics from how to install it, how to set up your directory and perform some basic graphing and statistical analysis. You will also learn other tricks and manipulation in R.I would recommend this class because you will not always have access to other statistical packages and it is easier to collaborate with individuals elsewhere to share code. The learning curve in R is steep and that is why this class is essential-it will give you the basics in understanding how R works and what you need to put into the program to get results.",
    "Good introductory class, especially if you plan on taking a more difficult class in the future.",
    "This course eased the student into learning R. I would recommend this course to students who have not taken other computer programming classes in the past, but think it may go too slowly for students that have taken other classes, regardless of whether the course was on a computer language other than R.",
    "it is very basic.",
    "I would recommend it because R programming and programming in general is a great skill to learn"

   "comments": [
    "Very very helpful for my research. I'm glad I took the course as an undergrad because I used R to make all the graphs for my senior thesis. I foresee using it in grad school as well.",
    "This class is pass\/fail, so doing the homework and practicing is key. That being said, there is a bit more of a learning curve if you are using other statistical packages-and your brain can become confused. It also helps you learn and understand other statistical programs that use coding and what the program is trying to do.The course taught me how to search for answers and approach a problem in the \"language\" that it was created in. I am sure this has been taught in other classes, but Suzanne made it more transparent what methods need to be done to solve a problem. I know that I will take those skills about problem solving in programming in R beyond the realm of statistics and research.",
    "This course helped understand much scientific research, especially modeling, which I had not understood previously. I will most likely use R in future research, although as an FES MEM student, I am not currently working on a dissertation.",
    "kindof.",
    "I learned a lot about R and how to learn more after the class is over"
