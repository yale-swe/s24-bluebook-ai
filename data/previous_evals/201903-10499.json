   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "First and Second Laws, phase-equilibrium, chemical equilibrium.",
    "I learned about internal energy and enthalpy balances for closed and open systems for steam, ideal gases and real substances. I also learned about how entropy arises from analyzing efficiency of engines and how its increase (and Gibbs free energy's decrease) drives processes. I learned about the behavior of substances in solution, including chemical potential, fugacity and activity coefficients. Finally, I learned about reaction equilibria and how they're linked to enthalpy and free energy changes of reaction.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of chemical engineering in this course. From mass and energy balances chemical reaction equilibria, and phase changes, this class taught all the basics for chemical engineering.",
    "Solving thermodynamics problems (balance, equilibrium, vapor-liquid, mixture, engine, etc)",
    "You will learn the basics of chemical engineering thermodynamics, so steam tables, residual and excess properties, vapor-liquid equilibrium, and of course chemical potential's role in everything.",
    "I somewhat developed the ability to approach chemical engineering problems in an organized manner, allowing me to get a stronger grasp of the material.",
    "Learned how to ask the right questions, read problems correctly, and appreciate the wonders of thermodynamics (and chemical engineering in general). Prof. Vanderlick is an excellent seller of these things.",
    "I developed my thermodynamics skills in this course, as well as learning the non-ideal properties and effects that these non-ideal properties have on Gibbs free energy, entropy, enthalpy, and internal energy. I also learned how mixing changes these properties.",
    "This course was great for developing problem solving skills and developing basic thermodynamic knowledge.",
    "Thermodynamics as applied to chemical engineering problems. First law, second law, open and closed systems, deviations from ideality, vapor-liquid equilibrium, binary systems, chemical reaction equilibrium.",
    "This was the first, real Chemical Engineering class for many of the students in the major: it was our first real exposure to Chemical Engineering problems, and thus the class taught us how to approach and solve such problems. Although there was quite a bit of overlap with PChem I in terms of thermodynamics concepts, the types of problems we were solving were very different, and definitely more on the engineering side. Here are the main topics I will remember from the course: mass and energy balance (open and closed systems), equations of state (mostly virial), how to use the steam tables, thermodynamic processes for perfect gases (adiabatic, isothermal, reversible, etc.), residual properties for real gases, fugacity for real gases, chemical potential, properties of mixing, and chemical reactions & equilibrium.",
    "I now have a great foundation in understanding all the major topics in thermodynamics. We covered a lot of material and I am glad that we were challenged to learn so much. The way Prof. Vanderlick taught the class, this was also a comprehensive engineering problem-solving class that we had been missing until now.",
    "This was one of the most interesting courses ive taken at Yale, and while it was the hardest course ive taken at Yale, I learned so much about the principles of thermodynamics and how to solve real world process problems.",
    "All of the fundamentals and indepth concepts of thermodynamics from first law, internal energy, heat, work, entropy, enthalpy to fugacities and chemical potentials."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is a requirement for the Chemical Engineering major, but so is Physical Chemistry. Although I thought the course was very interesting and it was good to learn thermodynamics under an engineering perspective, I do think it was very repetitive after having taken CHEM 332. I think the course needs to be adapted so it covers different topics or provides a more distinct approach to thermodynamics than chemistry.",
    "Strengths: God, I love Kyle Vanderlick. She's one of the best professors I've ever had: funny, supportive, reasonable expectations. I loved having breaks during class, and her stories are incredible. Thermo is also a really weird subject that she made more intuitive, and I appreciate that. Weaknesses: The Yale curriculum (and prereqs for this class) doesn't really prepare you for the type of reasoning\/problem solving this class needs. So, it's pretty tough.",
    "The strengths of this course were mostly with the structure and how Professor Vanderlick taught the course. Since it is a chemical engineering class, the class size was quite small and its pace reflected where the students were at with the material. The book was not always the best resource to learn, but Professor Vanderlick did an amazing job teaching the topics.",
    "The course is small enough to be very engaging. Prof. Vanderlick is the reason the class is enjoyable. The philosophy of the course is effective and presented well. The weekly quizzes motivated students to figure out how to do the homework problems. Exams were hard, but students were helped and encouraged to do better with a \"mulligan\" exam. Students are occasionally called on to answer questions in class, but the professor is careful to keep students from panicking. Short 2-3 minute breaks during class were perhaps useful to keep students engaged during lecture, but most of the time I just wanted to keep learning. Great class, it made me want to be a chemical engineer. The \"problem books\" done near the end of the course were not particularly helpful because students don't know which problems will best prepare them.",
    "It was one of the best taught courses I've taken at Yale. Clear lectures, very open office hours, very helpful, caring professor who wanted students to learn, and quality support.",
    "The class size is small, so individual attention is highly available. Students are encouraged to participate in class which helps understanding of material. Not many example problems are done in class. Lots of derivations are taught, some of which could be exchanged by doing example problems during lecture.",
    "Strengths: pretty comprehensive, the professor gives plenty of opportunities to learn, tight-knit environment where ChemEs can feel comfortable Weaknesses: sometimes it seemed like too much was expected of us; pset problems were often too difficult to do on our own or required iterations",
    "I love how Professor Vanderlick pushed me to continue practicing the material, and I like how the weekly quizzes helped me reinforce the homework information. I think it would be a good idea to have two midterms instead of one, that way I get more practice in.",
    "Material was very interesting and problem sets challenging. Overall I would have liked some more structure.",
    "Strengths: very well taught, the material was chosen carefully so that we only covered things that felt important (we did not dive too deep into some detailed, theoretical aspects of thermodynamics), classes are interactive and the learning is done in class (as opposed to at home with your textbook), weekly quizzes incentivize students to always stay on top of the material Weaknesses: a bit overwhelming in the beginning, because the problems in the homework were hard and conceptual, and we had never really seen anything like it before (we had no idea how to start them)",
    "I enjoyed the focus on applicable engineering problems and I think it will prepare me well for practical problems in an internship. The \"subjective\" grading scale will be a strength for some and a weakness for others. I thought it was a refreshing change from the strictly numerical and statistical grading curves in other courses and it gave me a clear target to aim for.",
    "Honestly not much weakness. This class was so engaging and interesting, Prof Vanderlick always brought so much energy and enthusiasm, and was always there to help if you had any questions.",
    "Strengths: interesting content, a good amount taught over the course of a semester, very natural flow to it all Weaknesses: I wish there were examples which allowed me to grasp the concepts better. To fully understand them in a physical context."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in thermodynamics and engineering. However, if you have a choice, I do not think it is worth it to take it after CHEM 332, since they cover most of the same concepts, but with a different perspective.",
    "Maybe. It's really focused on applications of thermo to engineering, so it's hard to see why someone would take it if they weren't interested in pursuing it as a career. Vanderlick is a gem, though, and the material does give you a good framework for thinking about how physical and chemical processes happen and why.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in thermodynamics. It really gives you a great perspective on how and why these chemistry topics are applicable to common problems in engineering and the business world.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend taking this course for all students in STEM. It gives actual applications to the theoretical concepts learned in other thermodynamics courses.",
    "Definitely. Professor Vanderlick will do everything in her power to ensure you succeed, you just have to put in your part.",
    "Yes please take this class. You are probably pretty decided in ChemE by this point but if you aren't then this is the class that should do it for you!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. While it was challenging for me, I definitely learned how to problem solve better and the practical aspects of thermodynamics. I always thought thermodynamics seemed abstract before this course, but now I understand its implications in the real world.",
    "Yes it's really fun with Vanderlick! You'll feel ready to tackle all sorts of engineering problems.",
    "I would probably only recommend it to chemical engineering majors: you need a strong foundation in chemistry topics as well as a certain familiarity with engineering problems in general in order to make it through this class. It was probably the most challenging class I took at Yale, so keep that in mind!",
    "If you are a mechE or envE and interested in the true foundations of thermodynamics from a more chemical point of view, then I would recommend you at least shop this course with a few of your friends, especially if Kyle is teaching again.",
    "Absolutely, while it is very hard so many resources are provided that help you succeed.",
    "Yes! It is very engaging, rewarding to learn it all, and worth it. It will be difficult but if Kyle Vanderlick is teaching it, it is a must take."
