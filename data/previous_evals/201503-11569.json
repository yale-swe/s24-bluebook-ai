   "comments": [
    "I only have piece of advice for students considering this course: be aware of the time commitment. If you're an accomplished artist, expect to spend upwards of 6 hours doing homework PER WEEK for this course. If you're a true novice (like I was), you may very well find yourself spending 10+ hours on each assignment. While this time commitment is VERY substantial, the rewards are equally substantial. I walked into the class unable to draw a stick figure, and I left as a fairly proficient artist.",
    "I think this is an important class in that it forces you to have creativity and originality, two really critical and applicable skills that a lot of students seem to lack. I improved so much throughout the semester, starting with no ability and ending with 5 or 6 drawings that I am so so so proud of. Drawing became a refreshing and enjoyable part of my week, such a nice break from problem sets and exams. I think my ability to see and think visually improved drastically which is really exciting.",
    "I would tell a fellow student that Art 114 is a big commitment because of the time I had to invest into it, but it was also very rewarding. While I would definitely recommend it to another student, I would want to emphasize making sure that they achieve a balance in their classes with less time intensive classes.",
    "1-2 drawings per week, so about 6 hours of homework on average, but you can definitely spend more time if you want and get a lot more out of the course. i mostly enjoyed it for the opportunity to spend time drawing and practice more. some of the assignments are really fun though -- i easily spent over 20 hours on the collage assignment.",
    "Great class. It can be a lot of work at times, but I feel like my ability to draw and think visually improved a ton. Critiques (normally every Monday) were helpful in learning how to talk about other people's work as well as to get feedback on your own, though they could sometimes be a bit slow. If you can, take it with Anahita!",
    "A lot of work, but rewarding! Saw myself and so many of my classmates improve immensely over the course of the semester."
