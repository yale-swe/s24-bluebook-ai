    "yes, because Crabtree is so great. just google his citation index and you will understand.",
    "Very disorganized course. The material jumps all over the pace. Crabtree is very nice, but a bit eccentric. The midterms and exams seem to test minute details from the slides. There is no textbook so you have to rely on the slides.",
    "You have to take it for the chem major, but it's not bad at all! You get to drop one of the three exams (including the final), which is a great bonus. The material is a lot of review and not too difficult to get through, and while some of the exam questions can be a bit... obscure... chances are that if you don't remember who came up with the word \"isotope\" no one else in the class does either. Lectures go by very quickly and the teaching was quite entertaining. Let yourself enjoy it and you will!",
    "I took this class for fun and decided that although I did like about half of the course, the other half made it not worth it. In hindsight, I would not take this class again... but if you're a Chem major, this is not a class to be afraid of! It does have interesting sections and the tests aren't too hard.",
    "Take the class! It will be a joy to go to class and you will not tire of it. I guarantee it.",
    "Take CHEM 252 if you want a chemistry class that also has a lot of green chemistry\/energy, history, and poetry. Crabtree is extremely nice and incredibly smart, and his lectures are more or less interesting. The only thing is, make sure you are ready to memorize not only mechanisms but also historical timelines and facts about global warming.",
    "CHEM 252 was a decent, but somewhat disorganized class. I thought the material was interesting, and the workload was manageable, but professor Crabtree's lecture style can be a bit confusing. Not a bad class if you have to take it, but I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't need it.",
    "A good introductory course to inorganic chemistry, but it doesn't go very in depth.",
    "I would say that you probably won't take this class unless it's required for your major, but it's nothing to be afraid of.",
    "Yes, but only if you are taking it for your major. It is difficult otherwise and not particularly well taught.",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend this course, particularly to a student with an interest in and desire to learn about the fundamentals of inorganic chemistry. I was really looking forward to the chance to take a chemistry class focusing on coordination chemistry, organometallic chemistry, and metal catalysis, and I found the class to be very comprehensive and felt it offered everything I had hoped such an introductory course on the subject would and more. In addition to the standard inorganic chemistry topics, Professor Crabtree spent some time with us on green chemistry, climate change, and alternative energy, which I found interesting and felt was a nice addition. With regard to the workload, problem sets are not very time consuming (so in order to get the most out of the class and the material, you should plan to spend additional time outside of the problem sets reviewing the lecture material on your own time), and exams are reasonable (you\u2019ll probably get a sense of the kinds of questions on exams based on the kinds of questions asked on the problem sets; this year, the two midterms were in April, and our grade was computed after dropping either one of the midterms or the final exam). Professor Crabtree taught the class this year, and needless to say, the opportunity to be in class with a chemist of his stature is really quite an honor. As a teacher, he really made the class a very enjoyable experience. He is extremely kind and approachable, and exceedingly patient with questions, both during and outside of class. He also has a very pleasant personality and a great sense of humor. In addition to his presentation of the course material, I also really appreciated the general advice, insights, and anecdotes he often provided about science and about science as a career. Professor Hazari has also taught the course in the past, and he is an excellent instructor as well. He substitute taught quite a few of our lectures, and I found him to be very clear and knowledgeable and also very pleasant, approachable, and humorous too. So if you think you might be interested in learning more about inorganic chemistry, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I thought it was an okay course. You'll want to really do well on the first two midterms so you don't have to take the final, as it's a lot harder and covers a lot more. I found it easy to slack off because both of the midterms are in April, which I wouldn't recommend. Professor Crabtree and Louise were good. The class is interesting because there's some historical facts thrown in throughout the lecture. My largest complaint is that the lectures are a bit disorganized and that you will have no idea what ends up on the test. All of Nilay's guest lectures were fun too. Oh, I'd recommend picking up Crabtree's OM book for the coordination chemistry, OM and catalysis units. If you're taking it, you probably have to for your major. And given that it's a Chemistry class, you could do a lot worse.",
    "Inorganic chem is a lot better than orgo and gen chem, so you'll probably like it more. Very interesting stuff, and covers a lot of interesting material."
