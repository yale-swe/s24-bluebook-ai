   "comments": [
    "Yes. If you're looking to cover highly salient\/contemporary topics--which classes often fail to do--G&G 746 will do this.",
    "Yes! This was the pilot year for G&G 746 and I was incredibly surprised to find that it was quite successful. Class discussions were engaging and the speakers we had in person and over skype were also very interesting. Readings were a bit overwhelming sometimes (most of them were massive reports that were just impossible get through completely), but it was easy to get the gist of them through discussion. Class introductions by students let us all get involved and the final presentations were great because they let us see the other student's interests and work. Overall, it was pretty great.",
    "This course gives a much more international perspective than most other energy-focused classes. If that appeals to you, then you should take it.",
    "Seminar on climate and energy topics. Most relevant for students who are part of the Energy Studies program, but interesting for anyone who wants to learn more about these areas. You get to meet famous individuals in the energy, environmental, and green finance sectors and hear them speak about their work. Definitely a good class with lots of potential.",
    "It would be fantastic class for students who have a broad interest in energy and climate issues and already taken some fundamental energy courses.",
    "I would recommend it to another student. I provide a good overview of relevant topics in climate and energy",
    "Guest lecture course on energy around the world.",
    "Professor Oristaglio and Krosinsky were really good at bringing an excellent set of speakers, covering a vide array of topics. This class really gave me an excellent introduction to the different energy sources, and current obstacles to achieving large-scale production of each renewable source. I feel like I can now engage in intelligent conversations about energy topics, which is what I was hoping to get out of the class.",
    "Good course if you're interested in a broad overview of energy, climate and finance issues. Not too much work. Take it!",
    "I would say that it was a class with a general overview of energy topics and it would be useful to take it if you want to learn more about current energy and climate topics but if you already have a strong background in energy you could take a look at the topics and see if you would like to prepare a presentation to learn more about a new topic because that was useful."

   "comments": [
    "Somewhat N\/A, but yes--it deepened my knowledge.",
    "I gained a better understanding of energy issues from an international perspective",
    "This course helped me discover the broad context of energy and climate issues. It also gave me an opportunity to delve into a specific topic that I'm very interested in at the end of semester.",
    "It helped me learn a variety of topics in my discipline, and got the exposure to topics I was not very familiar with",
    "Provided me a great overview\/intro to energy and climate change issues. It addressed a lot of material and had a very broad scope. Some aspects were more relevant to me than others.",
    "It gave me an overview of current projects and topics that I didn't know about."
