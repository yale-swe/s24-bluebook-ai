    "It's very very hard to know where to begin. I expected to be terrified of this class all semester (and for much of the semester I was)! To this day, I could not explain to you how it runs or in what manner it gets information across, but I have somehow arrived at the end of the semester in shock at the amount of information it got across and with the pretty strong conviction that this maybe the deepest I have ever gone into anything. There's a ton of work and unlike other classes, it doesn't crescendo. It starts the beginning of the year incredibly heavy. You have a paradigm quiz every week and a composition exercise due every week, as well as some readings which you go over in class. A lot of the class--at least in my experience--involves teaching yourself material, and there's a pretty steep learning curve; depending on how good your Greek is, the first few weeks can really feel impossible, and the way class runs (not really directly germane to all the work you're doing on your own) pretty perplexing. But once you get the hang of it, it becomes such an amazing kind of work (and so different from the work demanded by any other class I have taken at Yale). And once you get what's going on, class itself is really really fun and really rich. In an odd way, I even think there's something good about the work pattern--it forces you to focus in such an intense way. The work for this class incorporates itself really unusually intensely and meaningfully into your life. At least my experience was that there is something about utter focus on the language and the language only that deepens your engagement with Greek in totally unexpected ways. It makes it feel possible to get so much more out of all the other more usual kinds of engagement. You have to be willing to embrace it (and it really is a lot of work and pretty unforgiving--it doesn't come in quick bursts like the work for most humanities' classes; it's basically constant). But if you are, it yields amazing returns. I am going to miss this class and the intensity of relationship to the language that it gave me tremendously.",
    "I'm not actually sure anyone's going to see this, since there were only three undergrads in the class? But if there are any undergrads reading this--take it. Don't listen to the scare stories. Take it. It'll be so hard, and you'll never have any idea what your grade is, you'll alternate between hating yourself and hating the class, but you'll learn SO much and you'll have a lot of fun. I'm genuinely sad that I won't ever go to this class again. Victor Bers is hilarious, the graduate students are kind and funny, and you get to read Greek, write Greek, and talk about Greek beyond your heart's content. Read Dover more than two days before the final, take notes on everything, cling to your Smyth. You'll come out of it knowing Greek better than you ever thought you could (and knowing how much more there is to know). It's more than worth it."
