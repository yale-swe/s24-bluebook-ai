    "Interesting class. Ultimately, I'm glad I took it, because I learned several computational methods and how to use Python. This makes it one of the more applicable classes to the real world. The classes themselves were often disorganized, so we definitely could of learned more had this not been the case. There were 7 psets up until spring break, 5 of which were fairly easy (took 2-4 hours each) and the last 2 of which were extremely hard (took 15 hours each). Just a final project after spring break, so work slows down a ton. The other weird thing about this class is that nothing was ever graded, so its very unclear how you are doing in the class.",
    "Good survey of optimization methods. Problem sets have non-linear difficulty progression",
    "I would recommend this course for those who have some previous programming experience and are interested in computational research in economics. While the course was advertised as \"no programming experience required,\" I think that those who came in with little or no programming background struggled greatly with the problem sets and may not have gotten much out of the course. As this is the first time the course has been taught, the material and lectures could have been more organized.",
    "I think this class will have improved a lot by next year. It's great if you want to learn how to apply programming to econ, especially if you haven't done programming before. There's a lot of self-teaching required, however.",
    "I would recommend Econ 417 if you are interesting in both programming and economcs.",
    "This is an eyeopening course for those who think economics needs more of a rigorous analytical backbone and who perhaps want to try out programming something more useful than a game of tic tac toe. I must, however, give a warning: this class was the most challenging class I have taken at Yale - and I don't say that lightly as an engineering major. If you have not programmed before and if you have not taken higher level mathematics courses (beyond basic linear algebra), this class is a tough stretch as you will be exposed to graduate-level material and a sort of niche where no one except those who are in the know will be able to help - and they are far and few between, especially without a TA! It's all on you - and for me, that meant on average 20 hours a week."
