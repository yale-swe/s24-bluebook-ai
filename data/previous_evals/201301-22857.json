    "What this class becomes really depends on who's in the class with you. Try to get a sense of whether you like the class environment before you decide on this class. Also, if you're on the waiting list, don't despair! I got in from really, really behind on the waiting list and had a blast. And if you do get in...it's absolutely worth it. Emily is the best. It's such a pity that she won't be here at Yale next year, because I would've said, \"TAKE ANY CLASS YOU CAN WITH HER, SHE IS BRILLIANT.\"",
    "No. Useless.",
    "Strengths: Emily Barton is an energetic, knowledgeable, kind professor who gives very thoughtful, detailed feedback on work: I'm really glad to have studied with her. Weaknesses: much of workshop is very dependent on the work of other students in the class, so if you don't connect with the writing styles of your classmates, the workshop can become a little frustrating at times. That being said, it's also good to be exposed to styles other than your own. Take the class if you want to make time in your schedule to get some writing done: you finish with three stories, which is great.",
    "Emily is fantastic. She gives specific and helpful advice and feedback on not only your story, but also shows you what you can learn and apply to your own work from your classmates' work. She obviously cares and is committed to helping you improve your writing and pushes you to really work hard and think about what you're doing, but not in a discouraging, negative way. You come out with three stories you really want to work on and keep revising.",
    "A wonderful class with a wonderful professor. I would absolutely take this class if you have the chance.",
    "I really enjoyed The Writing of Fiction, mostly for the space it provided to read and produce new work. The workshop environment undoubtedly relies upon the individuals in the course, but Emily actively encourages a generative dynamic. I always looked forward to class. Students write three stories over the course of the semester and revise two. I'd never been in a class with a workshop schedule before, but found it helpful in the process of writing to know when a piece was going to be read by fellow classmates. I would absolutely recommend this course, but only if you're willing to devote time to your writing.",
    "Emily Barton truly cares about her students. She caters to everyone's individual style while holding everyone to the same standard. A truly caring professor!",
    "Yes, take writing seminars if you want to write! You will learn a lot!",
    "This is a standard fiction workshop; you write three stories and revise two of them. The other students' work varied in quality and in how much it interested me, but it was really enjoyable to see what kind of work other people are doing and I found that I really improved as a writer.",
    "Take it!",
    "Take it! OK, so it hinges a lot on the professor and apparently Professor Barton won't be here next year (alas, because she was awesome), but this class in general is a very solid idea: a dozen people, a couple stories apiece, and then you just... talk about them. Experience\/skill varied pretty widely, but that was often more helpful than not, because it's valuable to be able to coherently critique stuff that isn't working, and because it's great to see work by people who are better at X part of writing than you are."
