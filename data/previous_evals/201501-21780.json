    "DRST 002 is a wonderful introduction to the study of Literature, via a survey of the history of Western literature in the modern era. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "A very rough guide to Western literature from Petrarch on. We discussed in depth some of the greatest and most important works ever written, although of course we're only scratching the surface of what's been done; the staggering inadequacy of our syllabus to define \"the Western canon\" becomes ever clearer to me the closer we are to the present day, since more is known to me, and less is lost in time. I would recommend this course to anyone not immediately turned off by the word \"Western,\" and who is willing and able to keep up (or pretend to keep up) with a somewhat ridiculous amount of reading. It's totally worth it.",
    "Yes, I think it is a great survey.",
    "If you want to understand some of the greatest minds in Western thought, take DS. Doesn't matter what major you're planning on--it's an essential foray into the humanities and will change you as a thinker, a writer, and a person."
