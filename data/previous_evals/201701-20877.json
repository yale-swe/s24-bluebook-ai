   "comments": [
    "I guess I learned about beam bending, materials properties, gears and motors and manufacturing techniques. That being said you don't really learn enough to do well on the midterms cuz the teaching is shoddy. You do get great practice at some actual engineering design challenges including the redesign and trial and error processes.",
    "General understanding of engineering.",
    "This class is a pretty broad overview of some aspects of mechanical engineering, different ways to go about making things and the reasons for making them that way. I thought the lab in general was pretty helpful to work on the things we talked about in class, but nothing really went into depth. That's not a complaint, just a general comment",
    "I learned basic design principles and skills which I can further apply to later studies.",
    "I learned about different topics in mechanical engineering, as well as design and manufacturing skills.",
    "This course helped teach some of the formal methods for evaluating mechanical systems and design. It was also a good overview of current manufacturing processes, and a decent introduction to drafting and modeling.",
    "This class provided a survey on a broad array of topics related to mechanical engineering, dabbling on the three main areas. We started off with CAD and engineering drawings, learning about dimensioning, picking the views, and generating (slightly more) professional drawings. The CAD part is mostly self-taught with the tutorials from SolidWorks, added with a little TA assistance during the first lab. So unless you know SolidWorks quite well before you come in, this would be a lot of struggle. The second area was engineering mechanics. For someone who has taken MENG 185 this section is a no brainer. No complicated maths involved, but got some key concepts out of the way that could make 185 easier. The final section discusses gears and motors (in preparation for mechatronics I guess) as well as manufacturing processes. I feel this section is the most helpful in terms of the amount of learning that happened, but it also feels like the professor is just going through a lot of google-able facts. The labs could be a lot of work due to the vague definition and criteria, but you really solidifies your skills in teamwork and CAD making.",
    "This course allowed me to understand how the process of design is carried out with respect to engineering. It taught me how certain manufacturing processes are carried out, how gear trains and motors are selected for, and a multitude of other skills that are relevant to designing for mechanical engineers.",
    "This class went over materials and forces (stress, deformation, torque, moments) theoretically, so we had to know how to do the calculations and know the formulae for tests. Lectures also covered manufacturing processes, basic design techniques, and how simple parts are described (like screws, tap holes, gears, etc). Lectures were not interesting and felt too long, but I think that if they were longer the material could have been taught more clearly. The midterms were taken during the lecture time (50min time period, which wasn't enough). The material is a little frustrating and isn't taught very clearly. The psets were a little frustrating to complete because office hours were scheduled only once a week a couple hours after the pset was assigned, too soon to be convenient for help on the pset. There is a lab associated with this course, 3 hours a week, taught by the TA, and focused on applying what you learn in lecture to actual projects. You work on a project with a partner, by yourself, and with a team, all assigned. Really teaches you to work in a group. The lab is really fun despite its inconvenient timing. The class overall is a considerable amount of work but doable if you are responsible with the assignments."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Dollar is a terrible professor in terms of teaching, but good TAs and otherwise good course. Pretty heavy workload. Three hour lab once a week they don't tell you about up front and you don't get credit for. Best part of the course though.",
    "The course labs are very hands on but the lectures are just slide shows that don't help much.",
    "Strengths: the things we did were sufficiently interesting to keep me engaged. Since we never got into a whole lot of depth with anything, nothing ever got really tedious. I thought the tests were pretty fair, and the homework assignments were useful and didn't feel like busy work. Also, Mike was an awesome TA, super helpful, and Professor Dollar was always fun to be around. Weaknesses: we spent a frustrating amount of time trying to get things to work that just wouldn't work, like pinions and gears that didn't mesh, or puzzle pieces with thicknesses that were 30% thinner than they were supposed to be. I'm sure to some extent this can't be helped, but it's still upsetting to not get a finished product at the end of everything not because of anything you did but because you had faulty numbers or equipment or whatever.",
    "The course was very disorganized and without proper structure. There needs to be a serious restructuring of this class in the coming year.",
    "I think the biggest strength of the course was that we got a good overview of different topics in mechanical engineering. I also really enjoyed the lab portion of the class because we got to build and design stuff using the knowledge we learned from class. In terms of weaknesses, I feel like sometimes the lectures did not go into enough depth about the topics or explain the concepts thoroughly enough at the level we were supposed to know them. I also think some portions of the final project could have been better organized; specifically, I wish we had time to actually test our designs before the competition and had the opportunity to improve them if needed.",
    "This course could have been truly excellent if it was better organized. All the topics taught were engaging and seemed relevant, but the three branched nature of the class; lecture, problem sets\/exams, and labs, which were run almost completely separate of each other, led to frequent confusion and inconsistent information. The psets were not always graded in accordance with what Professor Dollar taught in class, but rather what Ahsan himself thought. Lab was definitely the most exciting part of the class, and seemed vaguely connected to the lectures, but for the most part was unrelated. If the various parts of the class were more closely related, it would have been a much better course.",
    "I think this class should be restricted to freshmen. The first half of the course is on the material from MENG 280, so the sophomores who have taken that already have an advantage over the freshmen. The different components of the class also seem disjointed: the lectures were not similar to the pests or exams, the labs were not related to any of the above.",
    "Strengths of this class include the amount of introductory topic it covers, which makes you feel more like a mechanical engineer than ever. It also prompts you to think in terms of manufacturing and seriously about the different aspects of design. The weaknesses of this class lay in the lack of clarification on certain topics. It is understood that mechanical design is a field that is very product specific and tied to the corporate world, with many standards and best practices used by major suppliers\/ producers. But the practicalities should not gloss over the clarification of different possible variables, units and definitions (esp. in the gears and motors section). The lab assignments are also confusing to say the least, with the first lab assignment having the wrong answer keys. Finally, the labs are very vaguely written , giving both the students and the TA a lot of trouble to figure the rules out.",
    "This course teaches very practical material, but it would have been beneficial to have spent more time in the machine shop where we could have practiced our technical skills.",
    "Weaknesses: Lecture. Just felt unnecessary, can't really explain what I learned because I'm not sure I learned much. Midterms were both time crunches, and we definitely did not have enough practice problems to prepare us. Strengths: Lab. Overall a very chill fun time to collaborate with other students and make cool stuff. Competitions made it a little more fun, and it was cool to see what other people came up with for the projects.",
    "I think this course does a good job in covering a wide variety of topics relevant to mechanical engineering, and for a freshman entering the major is certainly one that would allow them to understand what the major is about. As a sophomore in the class, some of the material was certainly review from MENG 280, but nonetheless had enough variation to be different. There were certain parts of the class that could have been supported by the textbook (i.e. trading breadth throughout the course for greater depth in certain topics), so that might be something to consider when looking at the curriculum. In addition, the testing period was certainly short, since the class does rely heavily on calculations which are hard to do in the 50-minute time frame.",
    "The strengths of this course was the lab aspect and the TA, Mike, who was really helpful in helping us apply what we knew to real life. Despite this, the projects were sometimes unclear and therefore frustrating. The lectures were not taught well in my opinion, and sometimes the manner in which we were taught was frustrating. I don't think it was conducive to me retaining a lot of the information I got from the lectures, and I think a lot of what we learned could have been intuitive, but wasn't taught that way. It could be improved by using a new method of teaching and maybe different psets."

   "comments": [
    "Yeaaaah, I guess. It was fun if annoying. I'd say try to do ENAS 118 instead if you can, unless you know MechE is the only type of engineering you're interested in.",
    "The final project was a lot of work, the lectures were relatively useful, but somehow the course felt poorly organized.",
    "Yes, the material is. It hard to learn just a little complex in practice.",
    "I would recommend this class, but definitely take it as early as possible, since it covers a lot of topics that appear in other classes and will help prepare you for those classes (I'm looking at you, MENG280) There's some really annoying things, like having to get trained for the machine shop only to never be allowed in the machine shop alone. Overall, though, definitely a good chance to dip your toe in the engineering waters",
    "Don't take this course unless you have to.",
    "I think overall, I would recommend this class for someone who is potentially interested in mechanical engineering and wants to learn more about the field.",
    "Pretty good intro to mechanical engineering, lectures were not super helpful but the lab tasks offered opportunity for learning and practical design. The exams were unreasonably difficult given what was taught in class, but in general what was taught seemed relevant to real engineering and was interesting.",
    "This class takes up a lot of time, which they will warn you about from the start. The lecture portion of the class is pretty boring and frustrating. The labs are a pretty chill and enjoyable experience though. The final project can be insanely frustrating, but its rewarding to see the final product work. You get experience in the project process and all the frustration that comes along with that. That being said, I think there are other classes (namely ENAS 118) that give you that same experience without the bad parts of this class.",
    "A lot of the stuff covered in this class can be learned easily online or from other, more advanced courses. Except for the lab parts, which basically gave you a more structured walk-through of a design process that you would probably not realize just by participating in engineering extracurriculars. This class is a lot of work, as other students probably know, with mandatory weekly lab session running three hours nonstop. Professor Dollars is not the best lecturer out there. But he made the class fun to take (esp. lab assignments) for those who worked hard nonetheless. Just be prepared for a lot of confusion and (not detrimental) disappointment along the way. It counts as an elective.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Although I felt that parts of the curriculum could have been improved, overall this course was a positive experience.",
    "The class got better towards the end because of the electric car (which is VERY rewarding and feels great to have accomplished). If you're considering MechE and have little experience with it, I'd say give it a try, but don't base the entire department\/major off of lecture, because Dollar was just not a great professor. Yale can do better.",
    "Great course to familiarize yourself with process of engineering design, CAD modeling, and actual physical assembly of a designed product- course really facilitates hands-on learning and problem-solving",
    "I would recommend this course to a Mechanical Engineering student who is interested in design, but one who comes in with the understanding that this course will require a lot of work. If you need a freshman\/sophomore class to take and you have a light schedule for the semester, then this class is definitely one to at least shop.",
    "I think this class was not executed as well as it could have been, didn't really teach us about design, and a lot of the learning was self-guided. If you're thinking about this course, chances are you have to take it. If you are merely just interested in it, I wouldn't say it's a great course, but I don't think there are any alternative courses that would teach you a similar thing."
