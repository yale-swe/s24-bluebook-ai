    "I enjoyed getting hands-on experience on a project. I felt that the focus was sometimes not on impact as much as it was administrative procedure.",
    "This class was a wonderful practical course in public health research methods, and it combined two of my interests, human health and climate change, seamlessly. Professor Dubrow was an excellent instructor who made class time as helpful and efficient as possible. A semester is a short period of time, but Prof. Dubrow helped us meet our goals. Sometimes work was unevenly distributed between weeks and between team members, but this taught me a lot about how to share the load in a team. Our preceptors were sometimes difficult to communicate with, which may be an area that could be addressed earlier on in the future.",
    "The course could be improved through better coordination between the preceptors and the instructor.",
    "I am very happy Dr. Dubrow is offering this practicum, as it is such an important topic! It is all group work so group dynamics are important. You are also working closely with a preceptor for the whole course.",
    "It was a great experience to work with local health departments and do a project that is clearly meaningful and has a tangible impact. I would definitely do it again if asked. However some suggestions: - cannot be believe I am saying this but more assignments or \"drafts\" are probably helpful for next year. It was hard to stay on track of the project in the second half of the semester. It's definitely annoying to micromanage groups, but this would have been enormously useful - final report due before the final presentation, like Debbie's class - I did not know the names of everyone in our class at the end (from different groups).",
    "Strengths- Professor Dubrow is incredibly responsive and suppportive and willing to go the distance for his students. Weaknesses- course could probably be improved through incremental changes to increase teammate accountability (i.e. Weekly progress reports, chance to grade other team members on their contributions).",
    "It was a fun course especially with my group. I liked everything about the course except for a few things. I would have liked it if the meeting time for class was earlier or shorter more frequently and I think it would improve if teams were able to collaborate more together.",
    "Learned a lot about working with stakeholders, academic writing, and climate change. Clearer expectations and more structure at the beginning of the course would be helpful. It would be good if the projects could be front-loaded a bit more so that there was less of a crunch at the end."

    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was very helpful throughout the project and offered to step in when needed with the other leaders of the course. He was always available to answer questions.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Professor Dubrow was always willing to put in extra time to help us at every stage of our project, and I'm so impressed by his passion and dedication to teaching. He was very honest and realistic about what steps we had to take to finish our project. I also really appreciated his detailed feedback on our midterm progress report. He is such a thoughtful, detail-oriented professor and anyone would be lucky to have him!",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is one of the most caring professors at YSPH. He has high expectations for students and really wants them to do well and he cares about the topic a great deal. You can learn a ton from him!",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Really really helpful and encouraging. Sometimes his comments were a bit harsh but he ultimately means well and wants us to succeed. Really great guy and proud to be in his inaugural climate practicum class.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0He's won professor of the year multiple times for a reason!",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Rob is great! He was super helpful and offered a copious amounts of feedback.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Not always the clearest with initial expectations, but gave detailed and helpful feedback. Thoughtful and considerate answers to questions. Can tell he is really invested and wants to make a difference."

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this course will get better in coming years as it continues. I would encourage students to take it, but would give them the opportunity to really understand what each project entails, what the goals are, and what the process will be before committing. I would hold a hackathon-style event in the fall to generate project ideas that students can naturally come together on.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student if one of the project ideas really appeals to you! If you're not invested in your project, you may find the independent work involved daunting. But if you really care about making a novel end product and learning a lot along the way, definitely take this class.",
    "This course is still in its beginning stages - it seems like it has the potential to be a really cool and fulfilling project experience, but taking the class (at least as an undergrad) was often kind of a scary experience because I thought the expectations were really unclear. Its a ton of work\/time outside of class, and the whole thing is a group project format, where everyone in the same group is given the same grades (so that in itself is obviously terrifying). But so many people working together also necessitated really being on your game constantly, rather than the less frequent deadlines of a normal class. Lots of times, I also felt like the preceptors who were assigned to advise our projects had visions that differed with the instructors, so it was really hard to please everybody. Things got very difficult to coordinate and at times it just felt like a huge headache. But its great in the sense that instead of just memorizing information, youre actually working on a project that could make an impact! I just might recommend doing it cr\/d\/fail or something if youre an undergraduate for lower stress.",
    "Practicum courses are totally different than other courses at YSPH, as you are working with one team on a project for the whole class, so make sure you are interested in the project you are working on. This course is a great opportunity to feel like you are actually making an impact.",
    "I loved that our practicum projects were all related to climate change and public health! It really kind of helped establish the idea that there ARE things that we can do as students and as a community. It offered a chance to work with real health entities and have stakeholders in the project. Really interesting projects too. I would definitely recommend it but it is WORK, especially toward the end. Do not procrastinate. Again, do nooooot procrastinate.",
    "Excellent for a self-starter who's interested in a practical approach to combatting downstream climate change issues.",
    "Yes!",
    "A practical, semester-long group project connecting public health and climate change. Would recommend if you care about making a difference regarding climate change and enjoy group projects."
