    "I continued my intense study of the Chinese language and developed even better general study habits. This is the most rewarding thing I've ever done in academia, pretty much.",
    "I learned fundamental vocabulary and grammar essential to level II Chinese.",
    "I strengthened my knowledge of the Chinese language and spent a lot of time learning how to better memorize Chinese presentations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths are: great textbook, good daily presentations, daily practice, daily writing practice in the homework. Weaknesses: overload of work, often rapid pace of the course, new vocabulary not focusing on common words but rather on specific words that might not be used in every day conversation.",
    "All of the teachers are amazing and really care about your learning. Having different kinds of accents every week familiarizes me with different ways of speaking, and I feel like all of them know a lot about me and care about my life. They make it fun to study the language, and they make you feel really accomplished when you've done well.",
    "The course helps students improve their Chinese speaking tremendously. While the amount of work can be daunting at times, it forces students to constantly better their pronunciation, writing, and reading. This class does not have any weaknesses.",
    "It's a lot of work, which can sometimes be a distraction from studying content as a result of having to complete mandatory assignments. Strengths include the amount of professors that teach the class- which improve one's ability to understand accents and teaching styles",
    "This course is very intense. It is an interesting course, but it is incredibly time-consuming. I really enjoy the language, so it is not a problem for me to spend the necessary time doing the outside coursework, but it is quite challenging. The format of this course does a good job of making sure every student is engaged and learning."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only if they're willing to put in a lot of hard work and have a lot of time.",
    "Chinese will be the most rewarding thing you ever study at Yale. When I hear sentences in English, I run them through my head to see how well I can translate them into Chinese, pretty much all the time now. I feel like I'm using a whole new area of my brain. Take Chinese.",
    "Yes, take this course if you want to learn Chinese.",
    "Yes! If you want to learn Chinese and are willing to work for it- do it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This is a great course to take, and I believe it is the strongest language course at Yale."
