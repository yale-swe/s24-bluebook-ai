   "comments": [
    "This is pretty much a standard language course. We did nightly readings of up to a couple pages, which were coupled with vocab lists. We also did grammar review almost every day. My German has certainly improved, so I would recommend this to anyone interested in doing that.",
    "This is a good intermediate-level class that covers some grammatical concepts while addressing various aspects of contemporary Germany. I would recommend this course.",
    "The class is focused on reading articles on a variety of topics - politics, environmental issues, German culture etc. Relatively light workload, and very fair grading",
    "This course was just the right level for me coming out of 4 years of high school German. Coming in, I thought that I knew all that i needed to know about German and this class solidified my confidence with the language. The material was interesting and the instructor was very helpful. My German definitely improved over the course of this class.",
    "I mean, you probably already know if you want\/need to take this class. And it works. Professor Gehlker is great!"
