   "comments": [
    "If you're at all interested in playing chamber music, by all means, audition for the class. It is a reasonable time commitment - the \"class\" only meets once every two weeks for studio class - and it is a great opportunity to play exceptionally beautiful music.",
    "I definitely would recommend music 221. It is a fantastic experience. I love the experience of playing chamber music with extremely talented students and instructors",
    "Best class ever!!!",
    "MUSI 221 is a half-credit course dedicated to the performance of chamber music. You either audition as a group or you audition alone and get placed in a group. It's quite a bit of time commitment -- I actually think it could be a full-credit course, given how much rehearsal, coaching, independent practicing, class time, and concert time it requires. But in the end I didn't mind putting in tons of time into the half-credit -- chamber music is so fun in and of itself. I would definitely recommend if you want an outlet for chamber music!",
    "Worth doing, for wind players, but those reading this over the summer should lobby for Wendy Sharp to hire a wind player as one of the coaches next year, if it's not too late to do so.",
    "Music 221 is a great opportunity to play chamber music with other high-level undergraduate musicians. Some groups are much better than others. It's also a great way to learn a full chamber work in a semester, structured so that you have one weekly coaching and one (more or less..) weekly rehearsals.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a musician who is not already in a chamber music group, or to one who is in a group and wants free coaching from excellent School of Music faculty\/students. This course is pretty much up to you: almost all of the work is independent and can be scheduled at your convenience.",
    "See question 1.",
    "Definitely take Chamber Music! It is so much fun!",
    "The second semester of chamber music is a continuation of the first half, and the amazing thing is that it manages to become even more rewarding the second time around. You get even more attuned to your group and mature a lot. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student who wants to actively participate in his or her musical growth.",
    "good class if you've played chamber music before and want to continue",
    "All in all, a great course. It doesn't take too much work, is just a bit hectic near the beginning and the end, and really helps you become a better musician. I would recommend this course to any musician who is looking for a half credit, or is deciding whether or not to take another half credit. It does not constitute the work of a half credit, and it will greatly help your musicianship.",
    "The best way to play chamber music at Yale College (and receive credit for it, too)",
    "I highly recommend this class. The rep is great and the coaches are wonderful to work with. The time commitment is not enormous (studio class meets every other week). If you take this class, though, be sure to have the performance day completely available, as they count toward the final, and Wendy is very strict about attending both. Make sure you get a good group, or form an ensemble with people you want to work with and play at similar level. It makes all the difference.",
    "This is a great opportunity to play chamber music and get coached. It can take up a fair amount of time -- 4-5 hours a week for my group this past semester -- if you let it. It's good as a break from real studying and you get to play great music, so I'd recommend auditioning for it.",
    "If you have any interest in\/love for chamber music making then you simply have to take this class. It was the highlight of my freshmen year - getting to play music with a group of individuals who are so passionate, so talented, so fun, so musical, and so dedicated to creating the best final product we possibly can has just been an invaluable experience. I learned so much through coachings and through playing in studio classes. I learned so much simply by rehearsing with my group twice a week. I grew as a player, I grew as a person - guys it's incredible and you need to take this class."
