    "It is a little disorganized, but it is overall not only a learning environment, but also an enjoyable experience. I learn much better in this style of teaching through talking. Rather than have specific guidelines, you are prompted to speak and learn as you go along, which I feel is the best way to truly begin to understand a language.",
    "Bu is the absolute best. She is always positive and cares more for her students than any other professor I've had at Yale.",
    "I like this course however it could be organized better",
    "So fun!!!",
    "Strengths: immersion in Indonesian culture in food music dance and other Weaknesses: given very short notice for tests. Extremely long vocab lists of words very briefly mentioned during lecture given to us about 2 days before the test. Study guides and test expectations given with no alert and very late. Unorganized"
