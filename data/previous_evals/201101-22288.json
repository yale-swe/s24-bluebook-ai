    "Very interesting if you are remotely interested in aviation, but it is not very easy.",
    "469 is a class worth taking. Most people are scared away because it seems like it will be really hard, and it is at times. But the professor really helps you understand the material. By the end, you have a really good grasp of Aero.",
    "If you're looking for an elective and are interested in the field, this is an interesting course. Make sure to go to class every day, as you can't always follow the lectures from the book. Involves a fair bit of complex (in the i sense) math, but nothing horrible.",
    "You learn the fundamentals of aerodynamics, which will involve 2D and 3D airfoils, conformal mapping, and learning a few theorems. It will be a nice review of fluid mechanics with additional discussion on compressible flows and boundary layers. You will apply concepts by doing several problem sets, which involve design elements. The professor is extremely nice and understanding and will always be happy to discuss any questions. Make sure you follow the lectures and be prepared because otherwise you will be lost."
