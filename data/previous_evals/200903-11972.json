    "It varies from year to year based on the people taking it -- it was overall a really rewarding experience. Don't take it if you want to improve your oral proficiency, though; it's much more listening and reading comprehension than production.",
    "This was a great Russian lit class, especially for someone who hasn't taken a literature class taught in Russian yet. The reading material was relatively brief and varied (to say nothing of how interesting it was), which helped keep the class fresh. While I would advise non-native speakers to be aware of the fact that there are usually some native speakers in the class as well, it certainly does not make the class less fun for a less advanced speaker. In fact, Constantine is very good at making sure everyone in the class is in the loop, and the test, while challenging, are generously graded. I would recommend this class to anyone taking Russian who is looking to go beyond simple conversation.",
    "It's a great way to continue and step up the use of the Russian language. The training wheels come off for a bit - it's really up to you to learn the vocab and make your way through some difficult literature and historical\/cultural texts. One of those \"you get what you put in\" courses, but that said it is one that is not hard to fake, so you should be prepared for a very rewarding but somewhat more difficult than you might have participated experience.",
    "If you are interested in Russian literature and at the same time want to keep up your spoken and written Russian, this is a great class. I would definitely recommend it."
