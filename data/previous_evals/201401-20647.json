   "comments": [
    "Yes, good class. Not too much work.",
    "Don't take this seminar - the readings are amazing but you can do them on your own.",
    "Take it if you're interested in this kind of thing. Don't do the reading. Study up on your company for the weeks you have to respond in the forums and you'll be fine.",
    "I would take PLSC 466 if you're really interested in business ethics, but it is not a class to take if you're only interested in EITHER business or ethics. The class is very specific and covers a wide range of issues related to business ethics, but is definitely narrowly focused.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student. Whether you're interested in law, business ethics, corporate social responsibility, this is a great class to dig deeper into these issues. I learned a lot from researching my company and also the comments of other students in class. The speaker series was also a great way of being exposed to real life examples and meeting individuals who have done incredible work.",
    "SRA is really awesome - she's funny and the class has a lot of interesting reading. Make sure to take note who you're taking class with though - some people were literally never paying attention and that doesn't really make for a great seminar environment, but if you care about the class you can definitely get stuff out of it. The workload also isn't very high - reading is super doable and you can still understand most of class even if you haven't done the reading 100%. It's just biweekly responses and a final paper.",
    "I recommend it. Its a lot of readings but they're usually interesting, plus Susan got some pretty cool people to join discussions, who you get to go to dinner with at least once.",
    "She is a wonderfully considerate professor. I personally have had trouble speaking in class but she really engages the class, and the weekly paper responses are very conducive the the discussion.",
    "This course is quite a multi-dimensional look at the world of business ethics, and it draws on perspectives from a variety of different fields - business, law, foreign relations, economics and political science. There's three things about the course that stand out for me : a)Its inter-disciplinary nature : this is not just a combination of the fields I mentioned above, it is also a combination of both abstract, theoretical analysis, and more nuanced firm\/industry specific focus that makes its great. Plus, Prof. Rose-Ackerman is always willing to insert herself into any discussion and offer her opinion, which is great - and she pushes back against opinions that she believes need more substance\/warranting. b) The plethora of class guests - you get to meet some of the coolest people involved in the field. If you're someone who is interested in law in general, the guests Prof. Rose-Ackerman brings in are incredible people : Sarah Knuckey, Michael Posner, Luis Moreno Ocampo and Cheryl Eckard - and they give you a great inside persepective of the legal and political systems within which corporate accountability needs to be maintained. c) You get to know a firm (and its Corporate Responsibility) initiative very well - everyone picks a firm and follows it for the semester, which gives you a good perspective on how your firm builds CSR and generates corporate responsibility. In all of this Prof. Rose-Ackerman, is incredibly nice, and is always willing to help you with concepts you find challenging along the way. The freedom to write your final paper on whatever you want is also quite great ! I ended up doing mine on something slightly law-heavy, but I don't think there's any kind of expectation at all really !"
