    "Great class if you are coming from a mathematical background (i.e. Intermediate macro and above), and are interested in what equality means today. We read the works of Rawls, Nozick and Sen and developed simple models to clarify what these thinkers were saying. This was a really unique combination of math and political philosophy that was especially fascinating to me. There are a total of 4 psets, which are similar to that of Econ 121, and 3 five-page papers, the topic of which you are free to choose.",
    "The good: Professor Roemer is downright brilliant and has a lot of fascinating things to say about a well curated reading list. Workload is manageable throughout the term. He also treated us to a wonderful dinner in his home. The bad: The course structure leaves a lot to be desired. It mostly consists of the professor lecturing from his notes with little to no input from students. The grading is also harsh and unforgiving, so be warned.",
    "This course is a good introduction to egalitarianism. Other than Nozick, you will not read any non-egalitarian work, but you will see different egalitarian theories contrasted with one another. This is one of the only courses where you will mix economics and philosophy, and the course work reflects that (mixture of problem sets and papers.) The course is a lot of work, but you will learn a lot. That said, to call it a \"seminar\" is a little misleading. There is no class discussion and Professor Roemer just reads off his lectures notes during class. He distributes these notes, which is pretty helpful.",
    "The course begins by studying about various theories of egalitarianism. In the latter part it shows very well reasoned (mathematically and from principled standpoints) arguments about distribution on capital, i.e. socialism. I would recommend it to another another student",
    "Shop your classes based on the professor. Professor Roemer is amazing. Take this class.",
    "Excellent class, just know that the bulk of seminar is spent on (excellent and very clear) lecture notes. One of the few truly interdisciplinary classes at Yale, and definitely the only real EP&E class. Roemer is a wonderful person and is a giant in the field. Don't take it if you have little interest in distributive justice though--you need to be interested to enjoy the class.",
    "Equality is a truly interdisciplinary course that explores the feasibility and desirability of different conceptions of egalitarian justice. The class asks not only what is the purpose of equality, but also what do neoclassical models have to say about differently structured and their feasibility? You get to read a lot of great political philosophers, and also Thomas Piketty's Capital. Uses economics in an manner not done in most other Yale courses.",
    "Equality was essentially a 20 person lecture where Professor Roemer discussed philosophical and economic approaches to understanding economic equality. In the first part of the course, we read works in political philosophy evaluating the merits of an egalitarian society (Rawls and his critics). In the second part, we talked about what sorts of things it would make sense to equality in an egalitarian society (money, well-being, opportunities, etc.). In the third part, we talked about socialism and its critics and looked at data from Piketty's book. This class's syllabus was really amazing. The readings, though sometimes dense (~150 pages\/week), were definitely really interesting. The political philosophy stuff (Rawls, Nozick, Cohen), was sometimes had to get through, but Piketty's book was a nice empirical, easy-to-read contrast to the earlier stuff. The class itself was more...meh. It's a \"seminar\" but there's very little discussion - basically Professor Roemer has pre-written lectures that he projects on the screen and he basically reads it to you for ~110 minutes and leaves a little room for questions. Hopefully he will try to introduce more discussion into the class, because the actual subject matter is great! You'll have three papers and four problem sets. The papers basically involve you critically evaluating the readings in each part of the class. The problem sets are probably most like intermediate micro psets - you should definitely look at them a week in advance and go to office hours because they can be really hit or miss if you don't get help and can take a while without any direction. Overall, this class could be worth your time if you skim through the syllabus and are interested in it!"
