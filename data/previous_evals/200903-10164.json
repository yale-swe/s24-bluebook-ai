   "comments": [
    "This course allows students to select a research topic in any area of twentieth century American history. The emphasis is on developing a strong research process and on producing an excellent article-length paper. The professor allows a great deal of latitude in topic selection. She is extremely knowledgeable and helpful to students across a number of subdisciplines. This course would be useful to almost any student in American history, American studies, andother related disciplines.",
    "I think that this is a great research seminar, and I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student. Anyone who wants to learn how to do primary archival historical research with the leadership, support, and encouragement of an expert should take this class.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to do a piece of historicalwriting. The course looks at doing history from the inside out. You learn how to think like a historian, how to conceptualize a topic, break it down into little bits, and imagine and describe its wider significance, so the topic can find a place in the historical literature."

    "I feel like I learned how to do research this semester. The process that Prof. Gilmore outlined for us will be extremely useful to me in my future research projects.Also, the project I worked on might become part of my dissertation--at any rate, it informed my dissertation in allowing me to explore a segment of my topic of interest.",
    "I have learned so much in this class about research and writing. I know that this learning will inform my future projects - both in terms of content and methodology.",
    "The course started my dissertation process and gave me a road map for the next few years. I was able to begin to develop the topic and, just as important, gain an overall view of what books\/articles I will need to read and what topics I will need to research."
