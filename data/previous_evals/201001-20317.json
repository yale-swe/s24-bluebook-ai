   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend it, for reasons articulated in Question 1.",
    "This class is a great way to learn about a lot of books and a great preparation for orals. I would recommend it if there were fewer people in the class next time.",
    "Essential.",
    "History 735 is a readings course designed to familiarize students with major topics in 20th century US history, focusing especially on political and social developments. The course begins in the late nineteenth century and continues through the rise of the New Right. The course prepares students to teach teach topics in the twentieth century and to read for their oral exams. Students are required to teach one class during the semester, which requires them to develop detailed historiographical knowledge of that week's topic. Students develop deeper knowledge of one of four subfields--race, gender, economy, or culture--through additional readings. Evaluation of students' work is based in part on class participation, comparative review essays, and a final orals field.I would strongly recommend this course to another student for several reasons. First, it is a challenging course. The amount of work involved forces you read efficiently, find central arguments quickly, and make effective and relevant comparisons between arguments. Second, it is a course that allows you (asks you to) work with and learn from your fellow students to a degree that is incredibly helpful and perhaps not asavailable in other courses. Third, it really does give you both a solid grounding in 20th century history and the resources to explore any topic within that terrain more deeply. Fourth (but not least) the instructor invests a large amount of time and energy into preparing the course, which helps make it a success.",
    "A fast paced and intensive engagement with the historiography of social and political movements in the long twentieth century. An extremely rewarding course that will not only introduce one to the major issues and questions in twentieth century U.S. history, but functions as a primer for: (1) understanding how historiographical conversations are framed, shaped, and constructed over time, and (2) understanding how to build an undergraduate survey course and\/or oral examination reading list. Without a doubt the best graduate course I have taken at Yale.",
    "I highly recommend students take this course, particularly to gain confidence in 20th c US history. This course helps prepare students to take an orals exam in the field and introduces a wide variety of must-read books.",
    "This class is a very challenging, but rewarding, introduction to the 20th century US. I recommend it for all Americanist historians studying the 20th century.",
    "A crash course in all things 20th Century US Social and Political History; very wide range of reading in many different themes. Great introduction to the historiography and specific works. Oustanding prep for teaching a course on US 20th century history or preparing for orals list. I would highly highly recommend this course to fellow students.",
    "This course is a MUST for those who are doing twentieth-century American history. For those working on other periods or places, the course would probably be more than is needed.",
    "This class is a surprisingly comprehensive overview of major works on 20th century American history, given that it's crammed into one semester. Gilmore is an incredible professor who's brilliant but still very invested in her students. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. I think I've learned more in this one semester than I have in any other during my academic career.",
    "This is an amazing overview of 20th century history. Highly recommended-- you'll learn a tremendous amount and be challenged and it will be overwhelmingly worthwhile.",
    "I would recommend it with reservations, mostly because of the large class size.",
    "- excellent preparation for an orals field in 20th century US history- requires substantial (but appropriate) time and effort",
    "It's a must if you do 20th century history.",
    "This is a course to take if you want an understanding of 20th century US history or if you are preparing for your exams.",
    "It's an intense introduction to 20th century history that provides an excellent training for oral exams. It provides a broad historiographical knowledge of the trends and arguments. Students build skills in summarization and analysis by writing book reviews, and practice on the spot thinking through an activity called one minute rounds. Take the class: there's no final paper, and you leave with an oral's list."

   "comments": [
    "This helped me prepare for orals exams and for teaching more than any other class I have taken here at Yale. What a refreshing change! If I could take another 20th-century US course with this professor, I would.",
    "It introduced me to many of the major issues in twentieth century history and several of the historiographic concerns within these topics. More broadly it gave me the tools of analysis--elaborating a scholarly language or mindset, I guess--to apply to any future book I read. It helped me think deeply about the questions to ask about a book's argument and where it fits into the existing literature, etc.",
    "I entered this course with very little background in modern America and left feeling as though I could confidently design and present a 20th Century U.S. undergraduate survey course. I am also leaving this class with a firm understanding of what a historiographical conversation is. I feel confident that I could arrange an oral examination list in virtually any field based on my participation in History 735.",
    "Yes, this course helped me get a better understanding of the state of the field of 20th c US history. This also helped prepare me for my future orals examination.",
    "Yes, this course very much deepened my knowledge. I learned a great deal, all of which will prepare me for my qualifying exams and further research.",
    "this class was critical to furthering my research interests and professional goals; at least two or more times a question emerged from one of the readings or class discussions that guided a paper or further research in other classes. The broad variety of readings and themes was crucial to the development of an outstanding baseline of knowledge for me.",
    "Everything about this course was directly relevant to my research. I will probably use almost all of the books I read this semester on an orals list. I have a much deeper understanding of twentieth-century American historiography after taking this course.",
    "This course provided an excellent overview of 20th century history and at the same time allowed me to focus more deeply on a sub-field and a time period thatI had a particular interest in. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "- extremely useful grounding in 20th century US history (much more so than, say, Hx 700)- provided a rigorous back drop for my research- great way to meet fellow students!",
    "It helped me figure out how to group themes and weave them together over long stretches of time. It awakened me to recurring themes in American history that will help me to form a broad overview. Showed me how to build a syllabus. I feel confident that the oral exams will go better having been through this process.",
    "Prepared me for one of my qualifying exam fields.",
    "think i already answered this one."
