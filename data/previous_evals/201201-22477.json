   "comments": [
    "Strengths include literary historical perspective (we start with the Romantics), sensitivity to the value of pure literary appreciation (we actually LIKE the poems while we're at it), and BROWNING OH BROWNING.LB: Caring. Personal anecdotes with unbelievable relevance. Lovely and polite and respectful. Opinionated and virtuous. Sense of humor. One of the very best.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The material covered is beautiful and very interesting and Leslie Brisman is extremely dedicated and brilliant.",
    "Absolutely take it. If you can get through the Elizabeth Barret Browning poems, you've made it through the worst. The Robert Browning discussions are marvelous.",
    "In order to like this class, you need to like two things: Victorian Poetry and Professor Brisman's teaching style. Providing you like both of these things, this will be one of the most rewarding English seminar experiences you can have at Yale. His choice of poems and the way he juxtaposes them is rarely less than illuminating. He is an extremely quirky but lovable seminar leader, who always asks difficult but thought- and discussion-provoking questions. Beware, though, that he is a difficult paper grader, both in terms of harshness and in terms of the cryptic comments he gives.",
    "This is a course about Tennyson and Browning, with a few poems by their contemporaries also on the syllabus. I absolutely recommend you take it. I feel like every time I walked out of the class, I saw poetry or the world or something in a new way. Victorian poetry is very hard--dramatic irony all over the place--but it often deals with themes that are important to me personally and I think to many other college students as well: politics and poetry, science and faith, sexuality, and so on. Also, be warned that although Prof. Brisman didn't ask us to read very much or to write very much, he expected us to read very carefully and write very well.",
    "Absolutely. I would recommend any class taught by Professor Brisman. Whether you're interested in Victorian poetry or not, his passion is contagious and you don't just learn about poetry in his classes.. You learn about life!",
    "Take this class! Prof. Brisman may be frightening, but he is a good man, strict but kind, enlightening and rigorous in his examination of literature. I suppose if Victorian Poetry isn't your cup of tea, this class might not be either. But Brisman teaches his students how to read these often overlooked authors in a way perhaps more thorough and thoughtful than many other professors teach. If you want to improve yourself was a critic of literature, take this class-- but be aware he is a hard grader, and also that he does not give grades on papers-- one's grade must be requested once during the semester via email."
