    "ENG 114 is great. It teachers you how to write in a structured fashion that you are free to manipulate and make your own. This was my first writing class I took at Yale and I was very intimidated going in, but coming out it was one of my favorites. I would for sure recommend it to another student.",
    "Yes, the course requires time and effort, but the writing improvement you make during the course is well worth the work.",
    "I recommend english 114 to students who genuinely feel that their writing needs help. The professors are there to critique and evaluate work that is meant to be critiqued and evaluated.",
    "A large amount of work for a few papers. She was helpful and a good teacher but the workload was just huge.",
    "A lot of work, but it pays off",
    "This class will definitely improve your writing. A lot of work, but ultimately worth the time you put in because you see results. I would recommend to sophomores as well - I was not out of place in the class at all, even with more writing experience, and especially if you have Professor Klemann, the personal attention you get will always be tailored to your skill level.",
    "It is a lot of work but it helps improve your writing tremendously. The readings are very interesting. I would recommend it.",
    "I think ENGL 114 is a helpful class to take if one feels unsure about college (or after-college) academic writing. As someone who was fairly confident about essay writing from high school classes, I found that this course still provided me quite a bit of improvement in writing. I especially recommend a class taught by Professor Heather Klemann.",
    "Fantastic seminar class! There's a lot of work but none of it is really that hard unless you're a slow writer - you'll probably get quite a bit better at writing and the groupwork in this class is fun without being stressful due to relying on others. Super fun!"
