    "In Econ 474 I expanded my knowledge of Japan's economic development and thought critically about how other nations around the world can learn from the experiences and mistakes made by Japan's policymakers when the \"miracle economy\" ended in the 1990s. Throughout this course I refined my understanding and knowledge of general macroeconomics, as well as learned more about \"cutting-edge\"-type economics, such as macro-prudential policy.",
    "Roach calls it \"forensic macroeconomics\" --- learning how to identify key shifts in the economic condition of Japan and whether they're present in other economies",
    "Knowledge of the Japanese economic malaise, the factors that contributed to it, and policy prescriptions for addressing it. Most importantly, taking those facts and using them to develop a forensic macro framework by which you can diagnose the problems of another economy.",
    "This is an amazing class with a world-class Professor, where you will learn everything you have ever wanted to know about bubbles and the lessons of Japan. This is a stimulating course with active discussion.",
    "I learned a tremendous deal about the history and economy of Japan and gained strong research skills.",
    "I gained a stronger understanding important macroeconomic topics.",
    "How to wreck a country for 30 years",
    "I learned a LOT in this class, both about the economics of Japan in general and about the techniques of forensic macro. Probably one of the econ classes I've learned the most in, and with one of the best professors in the department.",
    "I developed a strong knowledge of Japanese economic history in the 20th century and its various applications to modern macro policy debates. This course also gave me a great cursory knowledge of various macro policy problems.",
    "Forensic Macro, a better understanding of Asian economics, much more insight into financial markets and crises."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The greatest strength of this class is definitely Professor Roach. He is a titan in the field of US-Japan relations on economic issues, and his experience working in East Asia as an economist clearly shows through in his course. The best part of class was hearing his thoughts on these matters, and being able to critically engage with the ideas and opinions he brought to the table. I thought that the biggest weakness of the course were the readings, which I found to be tedious and onerous as times. To be clear--I enjoyed them very much, but they did not seem particularly directly relevant to our weekly discussions, which tended to revolve around Professor Roach's slides or the student presentation for that week. I wish that either the reading had been less voluminous, or that it was more directly germane to our class discussions.",
    "The content of the course is interesting but I found the seminar discussion somewhat inaccessible. I don't think this is Roach's fault and it's probably even a \"pro\" for the course but students often bring in a rich background of personal knowledge. Pro is that conversation gets to be wide ranging but the con is that conversation veers away from the readings and can be hard to enter if you don't have the same background.",
    "Reasonable assessments and well-paced. Student presentations ran the risk of being repetitive with the professor's lecture at times.",
    "There are no weaknesses to this class, only strengths. It is a very engaging class and was possibly my favorite class at Yale.",
    "The course was excellent overall!",
    "It's an incredible course. You learn so much and every week is an interesting new topic.",
    "Roach is a genius.",
    "The course is incredibly well organized and features lively discussion in nearly every class. Professor Roach does an incredible job encouraging everyone to share their ideas in an intelligent and discourse invoking way. In terms of weaknesses, there don't seem to be many to me.",
    "Perhaps slightly less reading that's done by everyone, rather than a huge bunch that everybody skims."

   "comments": [
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this course not only to economics majors, but to anyone who is interested in Japan. Professor Roach is an absolute legend in his field, and it is a true privilege to be able to critically engage with him on these issues on a weekly basis. At the end of the course, you will be shocked by how much there is to know about Japan's economy, as well as how directly relevant it is to the present period of policymaking in the US.",
    "Yes! There's a decent amount of work but the content of the class is interesting. Roach gives students a lot of flexibility in coming up with provocative questions if you enjoy that. Warning, it can be slow\/feel repetitive in the second half. Also, the course tends to attract students with a rich background of personal knowledge. Conversation veers away from the readings and can be hard to enter if you don't have the same background. This might be a really good thing if you're looking for expansive conversation on the financial system, US, Europe etc. But if you aren't necessarily as familiar with macroeconomic debates in these topics you might have a hard time entering the conversation.",
    "Yes -- take this class. A fantastic econ senior seminar with a professor who really shines in a small class, on an interesting topic.",
    "Yes, I would 100% recommend this to another student. You have to take this before you graduate! Professor Roach is an excellent Professor and one that you should get to know before graduating. The courseload isnt the easiest, but every reading is stimulating and engaging. The grading in the course is fair; he grades you very fairly.",
    "Yes absolutely. The discussions were very engaging and the seminars were set up very thoughtfully.",
    "Good course thats clearly very well organized, make sure you are more or less well versed in macroeconomic terminology, though.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! If you're interested in macroeconomics, you're crazy to not take this course. You learn an incredible amount and Roach perfectly fosters debate between students.",
    "Absolutely",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class!! Professor Roach is refreshingly involved in his students' learning, unlike most econ seminars I've taken--he provides very comprehensive feedback and is willing and able to meet with everyone about assignments. You learn a ton that is relevant to economics as a whole and Prof. Roach picks a really excellent, thoughtful bunch of students to be in the class. I learned an incredible amount just from discussions. This class helps teach its students to be critical about economic concepts.",
    "If you're interested in macro policy, East Asia, or just want to get a broad understanding of how forensic macro is applied to various economies, this is a great course to take. Professor Roach is probably one of the most well-spoken and nuanced professors I have had the privilege of working with.",
    "Yes! But, in order to get the most out of class, it definitely helps to have prior knowledge of or interest in Japan specifically",
    "Yes, absolutely. It's a great course to take if you want to dive much deeper into macroeconomics and familiarize yourself with reading and analyzing tons of economic research."
