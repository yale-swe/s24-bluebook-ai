    "If you want to learn spanish, or if you don't remember much from high school and want to get back on it, take 120.",
    "Spanish 120 is simply the follow up of Spanish 110. Take this class if you have taken 110 and want credit for it.",
    "Its a introduction to the more complex grammatical forms of Spanish and an introduction to Hispanic culture around the world. I would recommend continuing Spanish because the department is excellent at what it does.",
    "This semester's SPAN120 with Prof. Wan Tang has been an AMAZING experience, but I would recommend this course with reservation, for the sole reason that the instructor and format of this course change from semester to semester. I feel that the wonderfulness of this course is largely dependent on the professor, given how much interaction there exists between the instructor and the students. Unfortunately, Prof. Tang is not going to be teaching this course again -- so I suggest that you shop a few sections of SPAN120 before settling down on one.",
    "It teaches a lot, but prepared to do a lot of work and be committed to learning it."
