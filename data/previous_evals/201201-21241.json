    "Unless you're super into philosophical argument at great depth and detail, don't take this class. You need some background in ancient philosophy too.",
    "yes, just to be with verity (consider her name).",
    "Not unless the subject matter is important to you",
    "Interesting and not well-known Platonic dialogue. One of the best instructors to have in ancient philosophy, hands down. About 60-70% of the secondary literature is interesting\/engaging. Verity Harte is skilled in every way.",
    "If you already like studying Plato, you'll enjoy this unique opportunity to discuss a single dialogue in-depth. Having taken several other classes with a Plato-heavy reading list, I can say that this is a different experience. However, the Philebus is not the most exciting Platonic dialogue. It is less clear and doesn't have the same stylistic flair as the other dialogues (though it is part of Professor Harte's project to prove that it really is as good as any other dialogue, it's hard to argue with the fact that its literary devices and humor don't strike a reader with the same strength as other ones). Be aware that you won't feel like you learned that much about philosophy per se from this class--it's definitely something to take to apply philosophical knowledge, not to take early in your philosophical career. I don't recommend it to freshmen or sophomores, who would get more out of a broader class."
