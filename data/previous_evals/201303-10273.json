    "I never believed it when people said that this was the easiest credit in Yale College. I mean, the Math Department giving an easy credit? Well, now that I'm done with the course, I definitely agree. You are assigned a single presentation during the semester that takes a few hours max to prepare, and for the rest of the year you can sleep in class. Nonetheless, should you wish to pay attention, you can learn a lot about a specific math field and integrate the knowledge you've gained from the core classes.",
    "Wonderful course. This year we covered on the topic of divergent series. It starts out with simple algebra (not abstract algebra, algebra) and some elementary real analysis concepts and calculus. Then you throw in some complex analysis, real analysis, abstract algebra (group\/right theories), ODEs, fourier series concepts, etc. If you have not taken any of these courses, no need to worry as Professor Kapranov explains basics of each necessary for the lectures\/seminars. It was an amazing course tied everything I learned in math courses at Yale.Also, it is very stress-free, as all the work was to give one presentation (3min-20min, depending on which one you get) in addition to attending seminars and taking notes. No pset, no final, no midterm.I learned so much from this course, and the subject matter is intriguing. By all means, take it with Professor Kapranov.",
    "Yes, if you're considering this course, you probably need it, but definitely take it with professor Kapranov.",
    "Amazing class with Kapranov! I really enjoyed how this class bridges a lot of topics covered in earlier courses. It was beautiful!",
    "If you take this class with Professor Kapranov, then this class is amazing. If you are going to take it with him, then you cannot find a better class. It is extremely interesting and a great culmination to many years of mathematical studies.",
    "Not very difficult and you touch on topics that you probably wouldn't see in more conventional courses.",
    "Not a ton of work but a nice way to cap off the math major. Definitely recommend if Kapranov is teaching it!",
    "A very easy, pretty interesting course. No psets or exams, but you'll learn things if you go to Kapranov's lecture. A lot of material from many different courses is used in the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math480 with Professor Kapranov. The workload is light and the material covered is interesting. I would recommend that Math350, Math310 and Math301 be taken concurrently or previously before this class, or later lectures will be difficult to understand. Otherwise, Professor Kapranov covers interesting and beautiful topics that bring together concepts from complex analysis, abstract algebra etc.",
    "No tests, assignments, or work outside of the class.Just attend class twice a week, and give a 15 minute presentation on a math topic (try to schedule yours early in the semester, so that you can blow off for the rest of it). You just sit back and get to hear about some really interesting math topics from a very intelligent man. It will be your favorite class of the semester.",
    "Far and away the easiest part of the major. Kapranov is hilarious in lecture and extremely helpful as you prepare your presentation to the rest of the class. Not much work at all and the topic our year was pretty interesting too.",
    "Would 100% recommend to anyone even slightly considering the class. Most clear math class I've taken at Yale. Workload is easily manageable, and the professor assigns everyone in the class a lesson to teach. I was uncertain about taking the class because math can be confusing, but the professor was helpful enough in all situations.",
    "Excellent course, take this with Kapranov"
