   "comments": [
    "One major strength of the course was the regular provision of office hours to go over problem sets.",
    "Strengths: Tolgas teaching style , meeting three times a week, general structure of course A weakness that could be improved is that the two days for office hours are right before the psets are due so they serve the purpose of going over the pset. It would be benificial to add a third day for office hours on Friday or Monday to work through\/get help with more general questions\/concepts.",
    "I did not know anything coming into the class which was a weakness. A strength was that I was very interested in the course.",
    "Very interesting.",
    "The course was taught very well by Professor Tolga. He was a good teacher, and at the same time funny. The improvement I would have is the PSETS. I feel like PSETS should correlate more with what we were learning.",
    "This course would be improved by doing more examples in class.",
    "Tolga is great but be prepared to work on this a lot on your own time, teaching yourself the material covered in class. The teaching assistants were very good and very helpful, and Tolga makes himself very accessible.",
    "No weaknesses. Tolga has been doing this for a long time.",
    "The strengths are that it fulfills its course description. The weaknesses are that, although it was a seminar, it often felt like a lecture meaning big and a bit impersonal.",
    "It was always really educational and super interesting when professor Tolga used real-life examples to transform the material into a more exciting one."

    "This was absolutely the best class of my first semester at Yale. Tolga is the best. He's absolutely hilarious, and somehow his jokes are always applicable to the material. I was engaged throughout every lecture. He truly wants everyone to do well.",
    "Tolga was very straightforward about his requirements and expectations for the students taking the course.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in economics.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who has little knowledge in calculus and economics.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you are either good or interested in Economics. For me, I never took an Economics class, so I did not do as well as other students that already had experience.",
    "Only if you need microeconomics for your major.",
    "Yes! Prior to taking this course, I have not taken calculus and the approach professor Tolga selected was very manageable."
