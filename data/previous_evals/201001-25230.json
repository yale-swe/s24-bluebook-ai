    "Not hard, you learn a lot. Well worth any time you put in it anyway.",
    "The class is very good. Midterm and final, he gives you a sheet with all possible questions in advance - makes studying less stressful. If you are very attentive in class, its actually really interesting, but lack of powerpoints makes those of us who have shorter attention spans confused.",
    "The course gave a wonderful introduction to Judaism. I enjoyed learning some of the Jewish perspectives on the Hebrew Bible and the rabbinic teachings. The format was nice, and the lectures were interesting. The professor was great. His lecturing style is almost like conversation which makes the class interesting and enjoyable. He's a very nice guy - very down-to-earth - and was a breath of fresh air among professors for me. I definitely recommend his class!",
    "This is a course about how Judaism dealt with crisis in the ancient world, and how Rabbinic Judaism emerged from that. It presents it both through academic texts and through primary sources, and as a result is a perfect mix of interesting things.",
    "It's a good introduction to this time period, and creates a solid foundation for further study.",
    "Take it."
