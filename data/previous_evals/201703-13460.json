   "comments": [
    "This course was larger than the instructors expected, but the format was not adapted to suit this larger size. Many of the lectures would have been more understandable if they had provided an introduction to the topic instead of making it an open-ended discussion about topics we did not understand yet. There was a broad range of topics covered but I would have preferred more of a systematic introduction to the field.",
    "Poorly organized course made up of a number of RECYCLED guest lectures. Instructors were tough to contact and provide nuanced advice\/ answers over email. The instructors are so laid back\/ uninvolved that my 6 friends and I found ourselves challenging each other to remember the professors' names.",
    "Good overview of issues in occupational and environmental health. I liked having multiple guest lectures.",
    "I LOVE THIS CLASS!!!!!",
    "Too many students, poorly organized topics without a clear central theme (we got very deep into individual areas but didn't spend very much time looking at the big picture questions).",
    "Very good course, covers a wide range of topics.",
    "Interesting course in an area that was very new to me. Some of the lectures had a lot of overlap. Professors frequently complained about the high amount of students in the class",
    "Just good the way it is",
    "It's a great course! I really benefited from numerous experts on different topics that invited to lecture. My only reservation, however, is the large class size. The class was too large to foster any meaningful one-on-one interactions with the experts that were brought on board. It will be an excellent course if the class is reduced to 30!",
    "this is a great introductory course to occupational health that goes over a number of topics within the field that gives you a great exposure to the profession.",
    "This course has a lot of potential to be a really engaging overview of some great, important topics in public health, but it was poorly organized. It ended up being larger than anticipated but that does not change the fact that it was not organized to encourage or really enable student learning or engagement. Attempts to break up lectures with group discussions did not do much because the groups were so large and the questions vague it was often not an effective way to discuss the material in any depth.",
    "I enjoyed this course. This is a topic I know very little about, but I learned a lot. I liked most of the speakers, and the take-home format of the exams. I really liked group work and that the overall workload was manageable. My one suggestion: I wish we would have recorded attendance somehow, to encourage people to come to class (maybe QR code?). It was annoying when people wouldn't show up... it happens in every class where they don't take attendance.",
    "A great intro course. That said, coming from the Wall Street, I've come to the conclusion that public health people need to learn to present their materials better. The toxicology professor's slide work was the best, but otherwise, this is a serious issue that public health experts can't effectively disseminate the information or educate others. Everyone in the field should take some basic presentation course. Slides are not your summary notes. They are visual effects to make your points. Don't use small fonts. Don't show many pieces of information at the same time. Show one line at a time. Public health can be more effective!",
    "Environmental science is a required course - this is a good intro for none EHS concentrations.",
    "It is a good, lightweight course. The best part is the lecturers are with good experience in their own fields and the classroom is very interactive in nature.",
    "The course really needs to be smaller because many of the topics deserved better conversation than the large class size permitted.",
    "excellent, learned a lot!",
    "Excellent course material. Learned a lot and gave me a great overview of occupational environmental health. The guest lecturers were fantastic. Only weaknesses was the class starting on time and the coordination with a larger class size. While an auditorium may have been the best fit for the size of the class, it didn't allow for great group interaction. Despite the negative comments about the overall class size from the instructors, I thought that a bigger group didn't take away from the dynamic and ability to work together in group exercises, merely the room itself was the main hindrance.",
    "Strength: we get concepts reinforced from a variety of health professionals, take home exams Weaknesses: Repetitive, not always engaging",
    "I understand that the instructors could not run the course in the way they usually do due to the size of our class. I wish the class could have been more interactive - it seemed at times that almost none of the students read for class and it was difficult to have a discussion based upon the readings. Perhaps there could be a way to engage more students.",
    "The course is great to let you learn many aspects of this area, it will be better to add some factory tour or some practical experience like that.",
    "Very interesting material, and the workload was not overwhelming.",
    "Strengths: The teachers were knowledgeable and brought different perspectives to the subject by engaging different subject matter experts to deliver certain lectures. Weakness: The class size could be smaller for a more one-on-one attention.",
    "Enjoyed the speakers but could be more interactive, lacked discussion and was solely lecture based",
    "More organization in the syllabus to make all the guest speakers tie together neatly.",
    "Many lectures are very interesting.",
    "The size of the classroom is too large.",
    "The various lectures provide a comprehensive understanding regarding hazards in the workplace.",
    "The strengths are the low workload and the willingness of the instructors to help students and encourage learning a variety of topics in the field",
    "Don't have guest speakers every week.",
    "Very informative course.",
    "It seems like because of the overwhelming class size this year, the instructor was not ready for the class. The speakers of the class were great, you can tell that they are passionate on what they are doing\/they have done. It's great to hear stories from different occupations related to health. It's a regret that we could not make the tour to work sites. I wish next year, they can be more prepared and make a way to continue the visits.",
    "it is good for an overall understanding of environmental health",
    "This course is great.",
    "Strengths - This course was structured well with interesting guest speakers, and the instructors were very considerate of our outside schedules in planning for the take home exams. Weaknesses - I think more people enrolled in this course than anticipated, which resulted in us not getting the full experience of the course. Usually they take students on a site visit, which did not happen this semester due to the larger class size. We were also in Harkness Auditorium, which was much too large of a space for what was supposed to be more of a seminar\/discussion based class.",
    "This is a fantastic well taught course with supportive instructors. It is very interactive which leads you to learning far more than you realise. In addition, class debates and discussions are encouraged, providing an engaging learning experience."

   "comments": [
    "The exams are easy but don't expect to get any feedback from the profs\/ TA.",
    "Interesting course with minimal workload. Definitely recommend taking it.",
    "YES TAKE TAKE TAKE ! you learn so much and this is what I expected in graduate school",
    "It was useful in that it was a requirement for the Global Health track for the MPH program but I struggle to find anything tangible that I will use from this course going forward. For someone who had an interest in occupational medicine it would have been an excellent intro course but as a requirement it did not seem to align well with broader Global Health questions. As an example, we spent considerable time talking about the challenges of implementing good research and policy as it relates to occupational health in the United States where there are generally strong and functional institutions but we didn't talk about how to incentivize policy makers or business leaders in developing nations to invest in workplace safety.",
    "Would recommend.",
    "Excellent course. People with real life experience",
    "It's a great introduction to Occupational and Environmental Medicine with lots of great insights and case studies. I will highly recommend this course to another student if the class size is reduced to 30 or less.",
    "A reasonable intro course of occupational and environmental medicine.",
    "It is a requirement to take at least one EHS class. This one is a good and easy introductory course to EHS. You get out of it as much as you put in. Wide variety of topics.",
    "A good course for a not so loaded introduction to the two aspects of public health it covers. The class size was an issue this year but I hope the next class gets to experience the visit that we could not plan.",
    "Easy, good overview of primarily occupational health related topics.",
    "great class--learned a lot! would recommend!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for another student if they are looking for a general overview of environmental health for the US and how occupational health is integrated into overall public health. Great guest lecturers and course material make this course worthwhile for any MPH student.",
    "I would not recommend it to another student because I felt like after the first couple of weeks things started to be really repetitive.",
    "It was a good overview of environmental and occupational medicine. There are so many different topics within this topic so it really was purely an overview\/ survey course - if interested in a particular topic, you would need to take another course. Overall, I learned a lot because I participated and read for the class, but it seemed difficult to get the entire class to participate\/read at times.",
    "This course can help you learn some basic knowledge in occupational and environmental medicine, including some harmful factors and some preventative measures.",
    "Great course to take during an overwhelming semester. You will learn a lot while not having an excessive amount of work.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course as it more than just OSHA. It provides a more holistic perspective to environment health aspects that I was unaware of before starting the course",
    "I would recommend it as a base course for occupational medicine, gave a broad look into all aspects of it",
    "Highly recommended! I think it's very useful to understand the occupational diseases and related hazard.",
    "I think this course is a must for graduate students without basic knowledge of environmental health or epidemiology. However, it is not recommended if you have learnt environmental epidemiology or other relative courses before, because its contents are generally included.",
    "Each class presents different content, which is good for students with diverse interests, but this also presents a challenge because the class does not follow a consistent narrative.",
    "Great for someone interested in Occ Med.",
    "Yes, whoever takes the class can learn a lot from different occupations, and the speakers vivid, real life stories.",
    "it includes basic aspects of occupation safety.",
    "This course provides really useful information, and I can learn a lot from this course. I will recommend it to others.",
    "This course covers very interesting information, and coming from a background where I have worked for a few years, it was very beneficial to learn more about occupational health through a public health perspective. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "If you're looking for a class to fill a requirement, this will work. If you're looking to be engaged and learn something from your courses, I wouldn't recommend this one.",
