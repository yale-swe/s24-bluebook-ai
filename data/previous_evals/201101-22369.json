    "While this course is probably not a cool as it sounds, it is still pretty cool. The course starts with a basic review of electronic sensors and how the are put together in mechatronic systems. The latter half of the course focuses on control theory, implemented in lab using a microcontroller and a DC motor. In lab, you'll do a little bit of simple circuit design, a bit a data processing, and a lot of programming the controller. If your in MechE, I would definitely recommend this course. If you are not in MechE but still have a passing interest in sensors and mechatroics, this class might not be exactly what you want, but it is definitely still worth taking.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get hands on experience",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. Professor Morrell and the TA, Hari, are both very kind. The class starts with sensors then moves into DC motors. Then you learn to program micro-controllers in C and then apply those programming skills to the control of DC motors, controlling their speed and position in particular using a variety of feedback control mechanisms. The course has a reasonable workload and deadlines are flexible which is really generous on the part of Morrell and Hari and reduces life stress enourmously, especially in the middle of the semester when you will be pressed by a bunch of other stuff.",
    "Absolutely. If you have any interest in C++ programming, microcontrollers, or just electronics in general, this is an awesome course!",
    "This class will require you to implement things you have learned in a variety of different mechanical engineering classes, included ENAS 130, MENG 280, MENG 361, and ENAS 194. The labs can be interesting, but make sure you know what the grader is looking for.",
    "This is a pretty sweet class. Some labs take a ton of time but they are compensated a few easier ones. The material is all very cool stuff with a lot of applications.",
    "I would definitely recommend ME 390 to another student if they enjoy both mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. It is an interesting intersection of the two. You spend most of the class understanding how you control a motor and writing a program to help you control its movements. Be warned that the lectures can be a little dry, and that the programming can be more than a little tedious. However, Morrell always has very interesting tidbits, and the end result in lab is often very satisfying.",
    "An excellent and fun lab, but occasionally depressing for the amount of time devoted to fixing microprocessor programing syntax."
