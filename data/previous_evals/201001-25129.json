   "comments": [
    "Bad course. Steer clear of it if you can.",
    "Yes. This is one of the better Econ classes I've taken.",
    "It's an interesting class if you're an econ major and have some interest in the public sector. Otherwise the class may seem boring and the math needed in the problem sets is not taught in class, so taking intermediate micro is necessary.",
    "There aren't many classes in Econ that I would say are a must take. This is no exception.",
    "The course material is very interesting, but Ebonya's really a bad professor. She takes all her notes from the pre-packaged textbook slides - just read the book and don't go to class and you'll still be fine.",
    "I would recommend it because it's a manageable workload, and the material is stuff that everyone should at least have a concept of to be a more informed voter.",
    "She says at the beginning of the year that lecture is optional. She is not kidding. Lecture doesn't help at all with most of the problem sets and the slides\/textbook are enough to get by on the tests. Section is your best friend when it comes to the homework. I regretted taking it because it didn't go that deep in any issue.",
    "Great course, strong recommendation.",
    "definitely!! now i know why micro is useful.. i love the structure of the class, only 6 problem sets - theyre a little bit long but you can go to section and the tas\/other class members will really help you out.. the professor isnt very nice, but her lectures are really easy to follow through, and if you miss one you can always look at the book\/slides and youll be fine!",
    "Solid course. Lectures aren't the greatest, but the textbook and course structure\/material are really good. Basically a well-organized course on the economics of public policy and public finance stuff. Not really too hard or too much work. Definitely would recommend.",
    "Good course. This is the kind of course your parents would want you to take in college. You get a better understanding of the economic underpinnings of government decision-making.",
    "Public Econ is weird because its a cross listed ECON and PLSC class. I got the impression it was too mathematically challenging for poli sci majors, but not economically rigorous enough for econ majors like myself. That said, the material is interesting (cool stuff like carbon cap and trade programs) and very well-taught. Take it if you're an econ major looking for a gut econ class (yeah, you didn't even know those existing right?). You only have to suffer through 5 or 6 straightforward problem sets, and write exams that have only one real math question on them (the rest will be written answers) Poli sci majors, I would steer clear unless you are very economically inclined.",
    "no. you won't learn anything interesting. take it though if you want a high grade. however, make sure you don't take the makeup!",
    "If you're looking for a Poly Sci class, look elsewhere. This is more of an econ class.",
    "This class was painfully awful. The problem sets were long and tedious and the exams were very INCONSISTENT both in terms of difficulty and GRADING. Ebonya was a terrible lecturer. Everyday was the same and she simply read off the slides in class. Based on her answers to students questions, I question how well she knows the material, at least from an economics perspective. She also had an aggressive attitude that could be somewhat distracting. Several people I talked to said they didn't care for her as a professor.",
    "Economics 275 is a good intro to public economics, where you learn a framework to analyze government decisions (i.e. along equity and efficiency lines). However, the course feels like an intro econ course and it is not math heavy, but rather is very qualitative. Frankly, there are much better uses of your time and you should only take this course if you want a fairly straightforward course with a good grade.",
    "Not a very exciting class. You learn a lot about public policy, but I felt like most of the stuff could have been read online or in the textbook, and the class didn't do much to enliven the material. Only 6 problem sets (only 5 are counted) but they are long and difficult.",
    "I liked it. I learned a lot about public economy, and it's an interesting topic.",
    "I would recommend it if you really are interested in how the government is involved in the economy or are an econ major. Other than that I would not recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course to econ students if they are interested in the economic side of public policies such as ones relevant to health care, taxes, welfare, or if they are looking for an easy econ course to boost their average and add to their major requirements.",
    "Yes, more if you are an econ major than poli sci",
    "It was interesting, but way too general. I don't feel as if I really learned how to analyze policies using economics. I feel as if I learned a lot about the different laws and systems in place in the US, but all of these are so subject to change that I don't think this material will be useful 5 years down the line. I enjoyed the problem sets because the math was slightly challenging and fun but they took hours and hours! Overall, a fair to subpar econ class.",
    "do not take this class. find another econ class.",
    "This material is REALLY cool. This is really really relevant material. You learn about how and why the government intervenes in the economy, looking at things like Social Security, Medicare, taxation, etc. As an economist, this is putting the stuff you know into practice. However, the lectures are awful. The textbook is wonderful and explains everything really clearly. The professor then goes and literally cuts and pastes out of the textbook into her slides. She's essentially a glorified TA. I would advise you to take this class and just read the textbook--no need to go to class because it doesn't add anything. You'll be glad you know the material.",
    "YES. The class closely mirrors the textbook, but class isn't so bad to go through. The sections explain the math for the problem sets, but if you can't\/don't want to go to them the TFs post their lecture notes online, which is really helpful. Tests are fairly easy if you study.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn how economic principles apply to the real world"
