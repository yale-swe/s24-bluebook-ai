   "comments": [
    "Alexandrov is a champion. Nabokov is a champion. You write two stress-free papers and read a ton of excellent books. You basically take an extended, mind-bending peek under the hood of the car that is Nabokov's unique, literature-creating mind. I took this class because I loved Alexandrov's Tolstoy lecture; I'm a non-humanities major with no background in lit theory.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.It is reading heavy but the works read quickly and has a very reasonable amount of writing (2 papers - a 7 page paper and a 10 page paper).However, it is worth noting that the thesis presented at the beginning of the semester will be the thesis presented throughout so if it does not appeal to you immediately this is probably not the course for you.It also attracts a diverse group of students - a good mix of English majors and Russian studies majors.",
    "Alexandrov is a brilliant professor. Nabokov is an incredible writer. This is not the best course to experience either. My advice -- take Alexandrov's Tolstoy lecture in the spring, and read a lot of Nabokov on your own. And maybe \"The Art of Literature and Common Sense.\" It's an essay we read in the beginning of class that essentially summarizes every single thing said in seminar for the rest of the semester.",
    "If you've always wanted to read Nabokov's most well-known works and maybe a couple others, I would recommend this class, but with a warning. You will certainly get your fill of Nabokov and professor Alexandrov is an amazing scholar who will add a huge amount of depth to your understanding, but by the end of the term you may never want to look at another book by Nabokov or hear the term \"cosmic synchronization\" ever again.",
    "This was a very interesting class. If you have never read Nabokov before, you will end the semester having been exposed to all his major novels. Reading Nabokov is, of course, incredible. The actual discussions during seminar could try my patience... the continual analysis of metaphysics and structure left me wanting to know something more about the more human element of Nabokov at times. I realize too that this is a class about metaphysics but I thought we could have spent some more time on Nabokov's style, which is why most readers are drawn to him. This is not an English class... the essays demand a kind of literary analysis that can be dry and impersonal. If that doesn't appeal to you, think twice about taking this class.",
    "Great class. Nabokov is brilliant, and his works are taught by a brilliant professor."
