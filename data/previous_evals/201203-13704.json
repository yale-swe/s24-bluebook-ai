My only critique is that occasionally organization around field trips was confusing; however, they provided an amazing learning experience, and I hope they are replicated in future years \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I only wish there were more of them! It would also be very cool to go out and do 'volunteer' eradication work of some form for a day and gain a personal insight into the on-the-ground challenges of IAS management.",

    "It is a discussion driven course, which was great, and everyone came to class prepared every week, making it extremely interesting.",
    "Dynamic discussion and a great class atmosphere. You both did a wonderful job of keeping the conversation going and pushing us to think a little deeper. The guest speakers were also a strong component of this course -- talking to people about their research is always so different from simply reading a paper. The small class size and the wide scope of subject matter covered complemented each other well, in terms of moving quickly while effectively touching upon different topics.",
    "Readings from primary literature were comprehensive and I felt that I understood the scholarly history of the topicEnjoyed the in-class discussions and presentations from fellow students",

   "comments": [
    "Expectations were not always clear for the various assignments, especially given that the timeline kept on shifting; similarly, we often didn't know what was going to happen on a field trip until we were out there and doing whatever it was that needed doing. Also, it occasionally got very competitive to get speaking time if you're not so good at jumping between comments; maintaining awareness of the different people in the class could help enable everyone to contribute to discussion.",
    "This is pretty minor, but I found it frustrating that the field trips were scheduled so late in the semester. It also (I don't believe) wasn't made clear that field trips would be on Fridays when we signed up for the course. It can be really difficult for students to attend things on Fridays: since there are no classes on Fridays, all of our professors schedule field trips, exams, extra activities, etc. on Fridays, and then all of a sudden we have all these conflicts on Fridays!In the case of this class, I felt that the field trips were interesting, but I thought they should be \"recommended,\" not mandatory. While I'm glad I went, I don't feel that they were essential for my learning in the course--and it might be better for everyone's schedule if making 1 or 2 of 3 required, instead of all of them!"
