    "This is a great option if you know that you can work well independently. Of course your thesis advisor can help suggest research sources or paths, but you are on your own. If you're someone who has a very heavy course load or trouble sticking to deadlines, you should consider writing your thesis in a seminar. But if you set deadlines with your thesis advisor and hold yourself to them, this can be a great way to get a full credit for the thesis alone.",
    "Make sure to stay in touch with your advisor and set deadlines when you first meet. That helps keep you on track with finishing your thesis.",
    "I took the One-Term Senior Essay course because I was not admitted into the Year-Long colloquium (ostensibly because of space limitations and a competitive applicant pool). Because you do not have the benefit of a regular class meeting or formalized group of peers (for reviewing, workshopping, etc), there is a more significant burden on you to research and write independently, while individually getting support from faculty and peers, if needed. For me, this course was not optimal, but I chose it because I had few other choices. I had the advantage of already having completed the field research for part of my senior essay during the summer prior to senior year; this made it so I had somewhat less work to do at the start of the semester, during the brainstorming and research phase. If you want to get more consistent support in a classroom setting -- rather than only occasional meetings with one faculty advisor, and some ad hoc meeting with other faculty contacts -- than you might want to try your best to get into the colloquium."
