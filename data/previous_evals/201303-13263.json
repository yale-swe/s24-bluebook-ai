    "Social Cognition is a history of thinking about psychology, Dr. Bargh covers everything from the Thinking is for Doing paper, through priming, and into the Fiske warmth\/competence scale. The incredibly wide range of subjects covered are always nicely tied together during the in-class discussions, and even though the reading list seems extensive, they are all pivotal papers worth reading. I would highly recommend this course to incoming students.",
    "Highly recommend. A good survey course of social cognition.",
    "take it if you're interested in social psychology, very detailed, lots of readings!",
    "I would recommend this class if you have some background in cognitive. I struggled a bit because I was not familiar with the jargon of cognitive psychology.Summary: A general overview of current research topics in social cognition",
    "I would recommend it - it's a good overview of the social cognition literature.",
    "Plenty of reading, but you will learn a lot. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Social Cognition is a seminar class. There are a lot of readings, followed by class discussions; however, those readings are many times very interesting for anyone who is interested in the field of social cognition. If you like topics such as automaticity, social judgment, and the self, then you should probably take the course; otherwise, you may not get much from it.",
    "I'd tell anyone that this course is a wonderful introduction to social cognition and provides access to a rich source of reading material and new ideas."

   "comments": [
    "This course allowed me to see a broad range of topics I would not otherwise have covered in my psychology career. Since psychology is such a large field with a wide variety of topics and with so many people producing so much work, this class was a great way to review the best of the last 30 years in social psychology in the course of a semester, a task that would otherwise have been impossible for someone in my position to accomplish. Though this course did not directly contribute to my personal research, it did help inspire a few different research possibilities for later in my time here.",
    "Spawned several study ideas. I feel much more knowledgeable about topics such as priming, impression formation, embodiment, and metacognition. A great class.",
    "I learned the background behind all of the theories I work with.",
    "The social cognition literature is closely related to my field. Many of the underlying mechanisms are relevant to the work we explore, even if the dependent variables are different. Additionally, many of the goal priming techniques are used in research relevant to my discipline and it's important to understand their basis.",
    "I am interested in topics within social cognition, so this course helped me a great deal. I will likely end up citing articles read during this course, so I found it very useful.",
    "I was exposed to canonical research papers and names of researchers that will influence my research over the next four years."
