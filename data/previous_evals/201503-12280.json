    "YES",
    "A fascinating art history class. Take it if you really want to learn!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If they have any interest in art at the start of the 20th century, Zeidler gives a wonderful overview of American\/European art at this time.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course, especially if you have a background in art history. The lectures are super interesting and this is a great course to learn about a specific time in art history in depth. But with that said, you don't necessarily need to have taken the intro sequence here at Yale or need extensive background. This class is meant for juniors and seniors, but I still did really well in it as a freshman. I only took AP Art History in high school, and that was enough to get me through talking and writing about art. You only have one final paper and some readings so coursework is pretty light.",
    "Yes! Take the class. Zeidler is a great lecturer and you get a great overview of modern art. I can genuinely say that I learned methods to approach and interpret art from now on, which is a life-long skill and cultural asset. I also developed an appreciation for Impressionism and abstract art, which I never thought would happen. Assignments are not hardmidterm, final, and paper. Eminently doable.",
    "Take this class. The lectures are wonderful and better when you're taking notes on paper. The paper and exams do require a very thoughtful and careful approach that does take some time to get used to and get better at.",
    "Definitely take this class- both the material and the professor are amazing",
    "This is a survey course of Modern art starting mid 19th century and ending roughly mid 20th century. It is extremely interesting and actually makes modern art make sense! I was very skeptical of modern art at first, but this course easily clarified its meaning. Also the professor and TAs are amazing. Any person can take this class since it is so explanatory and well taught. I absolutely recommend it.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS! Especially if you know nothing about art history you will find it to life changing.",
    "I loved this course. I can't recommend it more. It's the first art history class I've ever taken, and I loved it. It's a great introduction to the discipline, you learn SO much, and it's all so interesting. I loved going to lecture even though I was taking it Credit\/D. It's a great C\/D\/F class because lecture is great but if you dont do the reading you can still do well.",
    "Absolutely take this course. Professor Zeidler is amazing. Every lecture is fascinating, and you will leave each class wanting to talk about what you just learned. The readings are interesting, though not especially necessary (your TA will tell you which ones you need to do), and the paper and tests are all very reasonable. If you are at all interested in Art History, don't hesitate to take this course. Don't be put off if you're a freshman or if you've never taken an Art History class before - I found it to be very accessible to freshmen and non-majors. If you decide to shop it, try and sit near the front - Professor Zeidler is enthusiastic but somewhat quiet and doesn't really use a microphone.",
    "A great work-based oveview of early twentieth century art. This class might be better termed \"Technology and the rise of modern art\" or something of that sort, since that was essentially what the time period and subject matter encompassed. It was work-based and not movement-based, meaning we talked about specific artists and their paintings rather than about movements as a whole. (This is a general comment, generally but not absolutely true.) However it was also very very Western, and European at that; of course Modernism really took off in Europe, but it would be fascinating to study the art of more non-Europeans, like the Technical Syndicate in the Americas and maybe the art of people of color whether American or not. What I mean to say is that Zeidler puts little effort in making us learn about the non-white non-male history of painting minus an article in the first week and an article in the last-- but nothing during lecture, which is a shame, and hopefully might be altered in the future.",
    "A great survey of Western art from Impressionism to Abstract Expressionism. Professor Zeidler is eloquent and insightful. He goes into great depth about a few paintings per lecture and gradually draws out their meaning, supplementing this with a bit of historical context. His lectures had the advantage of depth over breadth, so I consider this course more appropriate for upperclassmen or underclassmen with some pre-existing knowledge of art history. Perfect elective and\/or 5th credit. Make sure to go to the gallery!! - so much amazing modern art is on display there.",
    "Not quite a comprehensive survey of the first half of 20th century European art, but certainly taught me about periods I wasn't very familiar with. Interesting choices for artists, many not the blockbuster names we all know already. LOTS about Picasso.",
    "It is a brilliant introduction to French modern art. It is a must!! If you have time to take it, you should!",
    "100% take this course",
    "Absolutely take this class, Professor Zeidler is amazing. I took the intro-art history class before this which I felt helped a lot, because I knew how to talk about art in this context which made me more comfortable. So if you're looking for another art history class to take after that then this is perfect.",
    "I would summarize this class as a highly-enjoyable and fascinating one. I would highly recommend this class to a friend, whether or not he or she is an art history major or interested in art history.",
    "A really great introductory Art History course for someone who doesn't really care about the pre-19th century stuff.",
    "Yes! I think an art history course as in-depth as this one enables a deeper understanding and appreciation of art of all periods.",
    "This was a great class about one of the most interesting periods in art history. If you want to take one art history course before you graduate, this should be the one. Professor Zeidler is funny and incredibly engaging. I feel like I learned a ton that I can apply to other fields of study. Highly recommend.",
    "Know that your grade in the class mostly depends on how your TF feels about you. They do all of the grading. Other than that, it's pretty easy.",
    "Take it just to listen to Prof. Zeidler's lectures. I wish students engaged with some of the material (like Dada, Surrealism) with a bit more seriousness, because too much of my section time would often be spent on people going on and on about how Duchamp's readymades made no sense and Futurism was a hoax, which was annoying to listen to.",
    "I highly recommend this class, no matter what major you're considering. It's a great way to learn about art history and does not require prior knowledge about the subject. The lectures and readings are enjoyable and you learn a lot about the artworks and how they relate to the time period.",
    "Definitely take this. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale, and I am not an art history major. Professor Zeidler is incredible.",
    "Great class! The lectures were fun and interesting.",
    "HSAR 323 gave a great overview of early 20th century, European art. The lectures are fascinating and easily accessible to almost any student (I'm a STEM major and hadn't taken an art history course since 10th grade of high school). Professor Zeidler is a great lecturer. The workload is also very reasonable. There are weekly readings, two exams and an essay. For anybody interested in European art, I would highly recommend this class!",
    "This was one of the best classes I've ever taken. Professor Zeidler is an incredible lecturer, and the material is fascinating. He really means what he says on the syllabus--it's history through the lens of art. I learned so much about the early 20th century through this class, in addition to so much about changes in the ways art is made and consumed, and how art can become a medium for theories about life and politics. If you have the chance to take this class, don't hesitate! It's phenomenal.",
    "This is a fantastic course. I had never taken any art history beforehand, and Professor Zeidler completely changed the way I think about art. He's a great lecturer, and the course is really well thought-out. Definitely recommend.",
    "Take this class!!",
    "A great lecture with a relatively light workload.",
    "Dope course, take it. The selection of artists\/artworks is great, Zeidler is one of the better lecturers that I've had at Yale, and the course reader (though I loathe Tyco) is also one of the better ones I've had at Yale. The workload is super manageable and you get to spend a semester looking at beautiful\/strange\/confusing\/beautiful art, which is ++, yes?",
    "Incredible course. Professor Zeidler is one of the best lecturers at Yale. Even if you have little interest in the subject, I'd recommend the course; if you do, it's a must-take.",
    "Take this class!",
    "Early Twentieth-Century Art is a survey course that covers major artists\/movements from the end of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century. I would recommend this lecture to students of art history, as well as those who are interested in gaining some knowledge in the field. No prior knowledge is required.",
    "Yes yes yes. Take this class. It is mind blowing. Even if you are not an art history major. Professor Zeidler is an amazing lecturer. You will finally understand modern art and its place in art history.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. As a senior who has never taken an art history course, I think this is the perfect one to take to get a lot out of a class without needing to put too much work in.",
    "This is a great course if you're interested in learning about and *how* to appreciate early modern art. Professor Zeidler is a fabulous lecturer, striking a balance between delving deeply into a key canon of artists and artworks, while still achieving a sense of breadth in his survey of \"early 20th century art.\" I genuinely looked forward to his insightful, witty lectures each week. His take on Picasso was particularly fascinating. Do note that this course requires quite a bit of work for the exams, as do most HSAR courses, but I found that a higher caliber of essays were expected of you on the midterm and final for this course as opposed to the other two HSAR courses I've taken. That said, it was worth it. Now I feel like I can go to a modern art museum and appreciate the art.",
    "Recommend completely!!",
    "I decided to shop HSAR 323 at the last minute and it was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I recommend it to everyone."
