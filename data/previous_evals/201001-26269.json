   "comments": [
    "This was a great intro to qualitative methods",
    "This was a great course! My only recommendation would be to increase the time we spent on practical applications -- like working on a coding structure together in class.",
    "This was an excellent course and should be offered regularly. Students need to be equipped with the skills necessary to perform qualitative research. Unfortunately there are not a lot of opportunities to learn about qualitative research. This course definitely helps to fill that void and should be offered regularly.The syllabus changed throughout the course, and it was sometimes difficult to sort through which one was the most up to date.",
    "A fabulous, must-take course. Provides the skills, understanding, and confidence need to conduct qualitative research.",
    "This was a great course. There was mention about adding a lab and I think that would be a strong addition to the class, certainly more work but it would be helpful. My only hesitation is that this is material that a lot of people should be exposed to and I worry that adding a lab might deter people. There should be more qualitative methods courses at EPH since this was a lot to cover in one semester.",
    "Overall, this class was very good. The topics covered were very interesting and provided me with a basic understanding on how to conduct qualitative research. Two suggestions for the class would be to spread out the due dates of assignments. I felt that April was a very heavy month for submitting assignments and was a bit overwhelming with having to write a paper or present a project each week. Also, our group projects was a nice way to understand qualitative research, but unnecessary. I think we would benefit more from having our assignment 2 as a group project. This assignment was very informative, but in a real setting, we would not be reading or coding transcripts on our own but rather with a team. It would have been nice to \"mock\" qualitative data coding and writing up a manuscript with 2 or 3 people.",
    "The course was wonderful and provided a much needed qualitative lens on data collection and analysis. In particular strengths of the class were it's structure, format (lecture and discussion) and opportunity for application of methods learned. The only thing that could be improved is the organization and structure of certain assignments - namely, the transcript analysis might be more effective\/real-world like if down in teams. Conversely the article critique may just need to be an individual activity. Distribution of major assignments could have been skewed less toward the end of the semester. Other than these logistics, amazing class!",
    "Strengths: It is SO important to have a qualitative research methods course. Many epidemiologic internships and jobs will require interviewing and focus group leading, and it is so helpful to have this experience.Weaknesses: I would have liked to have had the option to focus either on focus groups or in depth interviews, and then rigorously plan and complete the process for one or the other. I still think a brief overview of both would be great, but I think this would have been a good activity.",
    "GREAT COURSE!!! I am so glad I had the chance to take this course. I learned so much about qualitative methods and feel this course should be a requirement for students.",
    "Could be more useful if it was a little more detailed and more hands on. More practice sessions. The idea of an added lab component came up in class and I think that would be helpful.",
    "The course covered a wide range of topics that provided a nice overview of the many aspects of qualitative research. The instruction was excellent - the professor was extremely knowledgeable and provided helpful examples from her own research. I personally could have benefited from practicing more of the methods we learned (how does one actually run a focus group, etc.)",
    "Great! An important subject that should be offered in any MPH program.",
    "More teaching on how to analyze and less on what qualitative research is."

    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0Dr. Curry was an excellent instructor. She provided a nice mix of personal experience with qualitative research and background on reserach methods. I also really appreciated the guest speakers we had and hearing about their qualitative research experiences in a variety of different settings including international research.",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0An excellent and thoughtful instructor. She presented some of the best lectures I have attended at Yale. She helped us understand the qualitative approach and carefully set up the course to build our design and analytical skills.She was very responsive to requests and was a passionate advocate for us to pursue our qualitative research. I'm very lucky to have been a student in her course.",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0Leslie was very accessible, she presented the material clearly and articulately. I believe that her background in health systems research is a strength to the class since this draws on a field of qualitative research that may not be as familiar to many students. She was able to bring in examples from her own work to illustrate a WIDE ranges of qualitative applications.",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0Dr. Curry is a great professor. She is very smart and has much to contribute. This class was very helpful in developing my qualitative skills.",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0Leslie is a wonderful teacher, approachable mentor and knowledgeable researcher. Her understanding of and interest in qualitative and mixed methods is contagious! She does an excellent job in translating methodology into experience and bringing speakers to the classroom to share their work and challenges faced while doing this type of research.",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0Lesley is a great instructor- incredibly receptive to student feedback and comments and very flexible in terms of curriculum changes to best fit the needs of the class. Also she is just incredibly pleasant and it was a great experience being in class.",

   "comments": [
    "Great beginning for anyone interested in learning about qualitative methods",
    "Great course if you want to learn qualitative methods. Even if you don't anticipate doing qualitative research in the future, you should take it so you can be an informed reader of qualitative results.",
    "Excellent course. I would take is again and strongly recommend it to anyone with an interest in qualitative methods.",
    "Should be a requirement for all public health students in their first year. A fabulous course that builds important qualitative research skills.",
    "This is a great course and I would strongly recommend it to everyone in the EPH program. Qualitative and mixed methods reflect the methods used for a lot of real world program evaluation, and are gaining in utilization across the field.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. YSPH heavily focuses on quantitative research so it was nice to delve into qualitative research to understand the other side of how to perform studies.",
    "Qualitative and mixed methods is a great course that I think all public health students should be required to take a at some point in their career - it gives you a sense of the depth of research methods as well as shows you ways in which to get at elements of analysis that are not possible from a purely quantitative perspective. This is a useful class for skill development and practice. The assignments are relevant and incredibly insightful...the professor is wonderful as well.",
    "If you are planning on conducting interviews or leading focus groups I highly recommend this course.",
    "Overall great course! Everyone should take this course.",
    "I would recommend it as an intro to qualitative and mixed methods; I think there really should be more qualitative and mixed methods classes offered at YSPH. This was a good overview.",
    "The course provided a great introduction to qualitative methods - Ithink it would be great to have an advanced version as well!"
