    "This course was absolutely phenomenal from start to finish. It's the best. You can't finish your Yale career until you have taken this class.",
    "Definitely take this course!",
    "I definitely recommend MCDB 345, it's a really fun lab environment and you will learn so much.",
    "Same as 344, except you also have to do a 15 minute seminar presentation - it sounds intimidating but was not bad at all. You just have to present on a scientific journal article, but the instructions are very clear and it's very doable.If you get in, TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! The most fulfilling (you actually learn relevant things and get so much useful hands-on experience), painless lab! There are no lab reports - instead, you spend a lot of time in lab (twice a week, usually get out around 6), which I would much rather have since your time is being more usefully spent. You also learn how to read and discuss scientific journals and data, which is an invaluable skill. I had no lab\/research experience, and was terrified of even touching a pipet at the beginning. I gained so much confidence and experience by the end of it! No matter what level you're at, you will take away so much from this class. Also, Professor Wolenski is the absolute best!!! He cares so much about his students, and is so entertaining and engaging. One of the best professors and classes. But apply early - it usually takes 1-2 years to get off the waitlist.",
    "Best lab at Yale. Take it if you can get in.",
    "A solid continuation of 344 that really allows you to further develop your skills as a researcher. There are somewhat harder assignments in the second half, most notably a seminar presentation, but Professor Wolenski prepares you well and it's a rewarding experience. The workload is still very manageable as well.",
    "Yes, definitely take this course! Wolenski is fantastic.",
    "This is the best lab - no, the best science class period - you will take at Yale. It's small and intimate and you get to know Professor Wolenski and your classmates very well. Be ready to learn a lot and put in effort during lab, and you will be more than happy with the sense of fulfillment you'll have at the end. If you get in, it would be a silly decision not to take this class. No lab reports, 2 days a week of lab (about 4.5 hours each day), one 5-min presentation, 1 15-min presentation, and a couple chances to present your gels and data to the class.",
    "Highly recommended! Second half consists of more full fledged presentations in addition to the anthrax module we did this year. Great class.",
    "MCDB 344\/345 is hands down the best course and best lab I have taken at Yale. This course teaches you a lot of useful methods like transfection, cell culture, experimental design, and various assays, but more importantly, it teaches you skills you would not gain in other labs but nonetheless are extremely useful for a career in medicine or science in the real world. I myself improved a lot in presentation, confidence in front of my peers, and thinking deeply and creatively about science, not just the steps or protocols. Professor Wolenski is consistently rated as one of the best professors at Yale, as is this class. Hands down, take it. You also get to go on a fun cruise to the Thimble islands, or even better a barbecue with the class at his house! Tractor rides are included, and great food. Oh and food is a common theme throughout the course... You'll never leave one of the engaging seminars he packs into the course without cookies or coffee! The class is long, but rewarding. Must take. Did I say that already? Yes, take it. TAKE IT NOW\/"
