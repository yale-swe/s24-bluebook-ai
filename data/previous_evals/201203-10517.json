   "comments": [
    "Introduction of various organic reactions and how they can be applied to total and asymmetric synthesis.Yes, definitely for synthetic organic students.",
    "I would recommend this course to another organic student. It greatly improved my skills in applying synthesis in a more difficult setting.",
    "This class is extremely difficult and for me it was pretty demoralizing to take because I felt like an idiot 90% of the time. I would recommend it to another student who is looking to learn how to synthesize molecules, but the level of detail makes me feel that it is not an absolute must for anyone but a natural products chemist.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student, for it was perhaps my favorite course that I took this semester. It wasalso the most challenging and time demanding course in which I was enrolled, and as such I would not recommend it to students with a high course load, as it may become overwhelming at times. Overall though I would recommend this course to anyone planning to use organic synthesis in their research, for in my experience the structure and connectivity in which the course was presented is unparalleled in other courses that I have taken.",
    "Lot's of interesting total synthesis.",
    "CH 528 is a strategy course that would be most beneficial for students interested in organic synthesis (natural products or otherwise)."

   "comments": [
    "It gave me a good review of reactions I've covered previously and a good introduction to new reactions, and how they can be applied to total and asymmetric synthesis.I'll be carrying out synthetic organic research so I'll probably get to carry out some of the reactions covered in the module, and perhaps do retrosynthesis and total synthesis as well.",
    "Again -- essential for a natural products chemist. For others it is a very useful class as well.",
    "The paradigms of modern organic synthesis presented in this course were extremely useful in expanding and deepening my chemical knowledge. Not only did this course help me to draw connections between previously learned material, but it also allowed me to learn a vast amount of new material that I feel will be highly applicable to my future research endeavors.",
    "Got lots of practice for retro synthesis.",
    "I can see some of retrosynthetic strategies I've learned comingin handy in the future"
