   "comments": [
    "Emily was a great discussion leader, and created a very comprehensive syllabus for us to work from. As an early PhD student putting together migration-related research, I found this course extremely helpful in situating my work within a broader context. In future years if there are more PhD students who take the course, it would be great to incorporate time to workshop students' research projects\/proposals and spend more time discussing methods in particular. But given the makeup of students in our class, the format we had worked well.",
    "I think the regional presentations can be better structured, for instance, to anchor them with the topic to be discussed in the class. Moreover, since it is graduate course, I think in-depth discussions about the research design could be also helpful. But this course was already well designed and structured!",
    "A strength of this course was that it provided a gamut of readings (books, articles, literature reviews) from economic, political, and sociological perspectives. A weakness of this course was that it didnt seem to tie the topics we covered together as we went. It felt like each week was a different segment."

   "comments": [
    "This is a great survey course in migration research, which covers political science, economic, sociological, and historic texts. It is a well-run and focused class. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Definitely. The lecturer is very experienced in a variety of disciplines, and can organise them well with regard to a substantive focus. Students who are interested in migration and its implication for public policies can learn much in this course. The weekly short reading responses also facilitates the in-depth discussion in the seminar.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It will broaden your understanding of immigration and will help you formulate a more bipartisan perspective on how immigration policy formulation requires an intense understanding of sovereignty, boundary control, and cultural identity.",
    "Absolutely - professor was incredibly knowledgeable and the subject matter was exceptional in both breadth and depth."
