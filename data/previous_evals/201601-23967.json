    "The workload was very reasonable, and Prof. Aslanidis does a good job giving a broad overview of ER\/RR movements. I think the class size was a bit too big for the presentationswith two presentations in each class it was almost half of the time, and hurt the depth of some of the units. Hopefully it's a bit smaller next time.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It was an empirical and theoretical look at the rise of radical right wing parties in the past several decades, predominantly in Europe. The reading is pretty light and interesting, mostly academic papers, and Professor Aslanidis adds a lot of information in class. The papers aren't super long and were interesting to write.",
    "It is a class about various radical and far right movements around the world that seeks to explain a clearer definition and isolate and identify causes of these movements.",
    "Worth taking if you like political science.",
    "Excellent class with small workload and very interesting readings"
