    "If you're interested in learning the techniques of mapping with an old hand, this is the course for you. Professor Tomlin is one of the most respected people in the field and cares about the development of his students. Because the latter half of the course is structured around progress on a final project, make sure you have a stimulating project in mind that you will keep up with. Do be mindful that this is a course occupied with the hard skills of analytical mapping and data visualization tools (class time is not devoted to philosophical interests in mapping).",
    "This was a great course! I learned about about a very useful tool, and I'm happy I took it. Professor Tomlin is a very, very helpful instructor. He explained the concepts very clearly, his handouts were very useful, and he is the single most responsive to emails of all the professors I've ever had. The one catch to this class is that your ENTIRE grade is based on your final project, and it is REALLY easy to get behind in this class because of that. You really need to be good about keeping yourself on track and not getting behind to do well in this class.",
    "A solid, if not terribly interesting, introduction to the fundamentals of GIS. The entire class is geared toward you completing a final project on a topic of your choosing, so there is a lot of independence. That being said, I think it's a mistake that this class is run as a lecture--one can only stand so many weeks of watching the professor use his computer on the projector screen at 9am. Take it, but only if you really are into GIS. Otherwise it will feel like a waste of time.",
    "This is a course about learning ArcGIS. Take it if you want to learn how to use the industry standard mapping tool. If you are just a person interested in maps, or who thinks he needs to make a map but doesn't really want to learn a complicated and buggy software, I'd recommend against taking the course. That being said, if you are interested in city planning, forestry, or any other field where maps are key, you will be impressed with the tools you learn and their applicability.Be sure to pick a project where the data is available, and where you think you know the right 'answer.' It will save you time and frustration. The Thursday lectures can be a little dry, too.",
    "If you think you'll need G.I.S. for career\/internships, then it would probably be a good move to take this course!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS if you are at all interested in making maps, or if they could enhance your research in history, anthropology, any other social science, environmental science, or poli sci.",
    "EVST 290 is essentially a time and space to learn a complex software program that you might not have the time or expertise to learn otherwise. I was disappointed that it wasn't particularly intellectual, and wish it had had more of a focus on quantitative data processing or statistics. It's an easy-going class though, with no work due until the end, although you should keep up with the work if you'd like to actually learn the software. Professor Tomlin is very helpful and knowledgeable and kind. It's a great class to take if you have a specific idea of a dataset that you'd like to represent cartographically.",
    "I highly recommend this course to especially EVST students. Currently filling out job applications, and many of them (in the environmental field) ask if you have prior experience working with ArcGIS. This is a skill that I want to carefully hone over the years.",
    "I would recommend this course, although I wish it had covered more material. For a graduate student, it moved too slowly. I really like that it combined vector and raster into once semester."
