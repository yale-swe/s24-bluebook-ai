   "comments": [
    "Might be intimidating for a non-science major--lots of technical facts. The final paper or exam option was nice, though, and gave students a chance to explore topics of interest more in depth.",
    "yes",
    "If you know the type of professor that Bill is, then you don't need this eval to tell you what to expect. If you don't know what type of professor he is, ask around. I'll sum it up for you this way, though: you'll only get something out of this class if you put time into it (no shit, right?). Besides that, though, Bill is cool, chill, and pretty damn awesome all wrapped up into one bit. Great Hu credit for premeds with relevant material.",
    "This course isn't hard at all. It's an easy Humanities credit if you're looking for one.",
    "This is an extremely easy class and not a big work load at all. I would recommend this if you're looking for a 5th class or to fulfill HSHM requirements.",
    "A comprehneisve review of the history of molecules and the infrastructure surrounding it.",
    "This is an interesting class if you are interested in the subject. There is not much work at all. You can keep up with the readings if you want to dominate in section, but there are only two short assignments during the semester and a larger research paper\/exam for the final. Good way to take a humanities course if you aren't interested in humanities.",
    "This is a DREADFUL (but pretty easy) class. The lectures are awful, but on the bright side, you don't actually have to go to any of them because none of the assignments (article review, book review, and final research paper) are related to them, unless you write the final exam instead of the paper. The paper is 15 pages (ish), but it's totally worth it if you don't want to go to class.",
    "Yes, this class is a relatively relaxed history course and is quite interesting. Not very sciency but it would be a good idea to have taken some chem\/bio beforehand.",
    "It's a good fifth class, but if you can take something more interesting, go for that. Unless you're as HSHM major, then this could be right up your alley.",
    "yes.",
    "Meh. Take it if you want.",
    "No",
    "Definitely take this course. It is a great course on the history of molecular biology--its birth, development, and present day status. The workload is not much at all during the semester, just a 1-page newspaper summary and a 5-page book review, but towards finals' week it can get pretty crazy (a final exam OR 15-page final paper). In terms of the content of the course, it can get pretty technical at times (and may feel like an intro bio course) but as long as you keep in mind that it's a history course after all, you don't have to stress out about the nitty gritty details.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class unless you are very interested in molecular biology and its history. On one hand, though, there is very little work in this class: one 2 page newspaper analysis, one 5 page book review and a final exam or research paper. For the final, the choice is to either take an exam consisting of 5-7 essay prompts or write a 15 research paper (only after getting your topic approved). I highly recommend writing the paper, and getting your topic approved as early as possible. Also, Professor Summers leads his own discussion sections, and often dominates the conversation by challenging everyone else with hypotheticals that occasionally verge on silly sci-fi-esque situations. You also probably do not need to purchase the Lily Kay book (which was $80) from which we had maybe 3 assigned readings.",
    "An interesting course - a combination of history and biology, so having a science background is helpful. It's unfortunate most of the class stopped coming to lecture toward the end of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this class because there are not many requirements and it is interesting. It is not a gut class because of the final paper assignment, but definitely not stressful.",
    "It's a pretty interesting survey of the history of molecular biology. Sections were led by the professor himself, which was a nice change, but in my section, not that many people participated, which was frustrating. I didn't do that many of the readings, and still got a lot out of the course. It was a pretty easy course with some interesting assignments, but the lectures themselves were pretty boring actually.",
    "Would recommend to all science majors. It is a really nice break to science classes and you learn a ton of interesting information regarding all the things you already know but never thought about how they were created.",
    "Not too much work, a nice overview of science and the discovery of DNA in a larger societal context, Summers is an easy grader.",
    "If you need a humanities credit, this is definitely a great class. It is a very low work load and fairly easy. Lecture can get boring, but ultimately, if you are interested in the material, there are great opportunities for articles to read, discussions, etc. Humanities gut for sure. If you have a heavy schedule and need a 5th (or want a 6th), this is it. Take it if you are interested in the subject: knowledge for the sake of knowledge, just enjoy the class.",
    "Take it if you are interested in the subject. Presents facts from different perspectives and gives you a different way too understand everything that has happened.",
    "If you like science, and are interested to know how each important discovery of the 20th century comes into existence and the social implication of those discoveries, I recommend this class.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend HSHM 242.",
    "take it.",
    "This course had an interesting premise but the emphasis of the course was a bit biased. Unfortunately, the ethics portion of the course was not much of a balanced discussion but rather all about Professor Summers' thoughts. However, the covered topics were quite interesting.",
    "The course is fine for non science majors, but I would not recommend it for anyone who understands even a bit of biophysics. Professor Summers is nice, but he sets a clear agenda and isn't as balanced as I would have liked on certain subjects.",
    "I would recommend HSHM 242 for any student interested in the history of science in America. Summers is an incredibly nice person and, while not the best lecturer I've seen at Yale, is truly dedicated to the students in the class - he leads all discussion sections himself. This class had the option of taking a final or writing a final paper, and I felt that choosing the paper option helped me learn more than I would have if I had merely sat for the test.",
    "Unless you are very interested in the subject material, don't take the class. It was very disorganized and Professor Summers was pretty boring. He knows a lot about the subject, but unless you go out of your way to talk to him about it at section, you won't get much out of his class. The workload is low, but Summers is also a pretty tough grader.",
    "The workload is a lot less than most classes. There's a one page newspaper analysis, 5 page book review, and optional final OR 15 page research paper. The class was interesting, but I feel like I have no idea how I did grade-wise. Great 5th class though.",
    "I thought the course would be better than it was. It is neat in concept, but the lectures are rather dull and hard to get a cohesive picture of the entire course. Professor Summers means well but he is a little dull at times.",
    "If you are not a science or history of medicine major you may not like this class. If you are you still might find it boring. It takes a certain kind of person to be moved and engaged by this subject matter, and some degree of biological knowledge is helpful for the full experience. However, this class for me was fascinating and key to a full understanding of the historical roots of certain attitudes regarding biological issues. The work load is very light and you are not formally held accountable for readings except through discussion in section, which the professor taught. The grading system does leave something to be desired - we had only 1 short article evaluation which was out of 10 and a book review out of 30, so it was easy to lose valuable points fairly arbitrarily. The final was the best part of the graded events, consisting of broad themed short essays. I would recommend someone to shop the class at the very least and get a feel for it. If it is for you, you will really enjoy it."
