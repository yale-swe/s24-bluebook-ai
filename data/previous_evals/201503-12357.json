   "comments": [
    "If you didn't take calc before it will be very tough!",
    "This section was great with Danny. Take it if you can get him.",
    "MATH 112 is an in-depth Calculus of a single variable course with a medium workload. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a beginning Calculus course.",
    "I think Math 112 is an essential class for any STEM or non STEM student here -- definitely recommend it.",
    "The quality of this course is highly dependent on the quality of the graduate instructor. May have to self-study a bit.",
    "I would recommend the course, it's a straightforward math class that can be used to get rid of a QR credit. It's not a gut, but it's doable if you put in the work and show up every day. Danny was a great professor, he made class fun even though the class was long.",
    "I would recommend. A lot of work and takes a lot of time but you are able to learn alot",
    "I would recommend this class to someone; however, only if they are a decent test taker. One thing I felt was that the tests were often harder than the homework\/class work so you really need a strong grasp on the material.",
    "To my fellow students, if you don't need to take Math 112 for your major, I really don't see a reason to take it. It was a great class and I really enjoyed it, but there isn't must good you can get from taking a college calculus class for no reason. Freshmen especially. I took this to satisfy my QR, but there are definitely better options out there.",
    "Math 112 is an excellent course to take if you either are not familiar with calculus or had a rocky learning experience previously. Even if you took BC Calc in high school, this may be the class for you if you did not feel comfortable with the material. The instructors are great and they make sure nothing goes over your head in class.",
    "It's an introductory class to calculus and I would recommend it to anyone looking to gain a better understanding of mathematics. The class was good overall",
    "It is a general math class. If you have taking Calculus AB AP, it will be an easy course for you.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes for the fall 2015 semester and I would recommend others to take it if they like to learn math."
