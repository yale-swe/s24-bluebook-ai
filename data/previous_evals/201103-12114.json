    "I would recommend recognition to a philosophy major who is willing to take a risk and really invest time in readings and ideas that are much more difficult than the average philosophy class. The class was well worth my time and the extra time that I put into it beyond a normal philosophy seminar.",
    "Decent class, with some very interesting readings. Class discussion was lackluster at times, would have benefitted from more structure and guidance from the professors. class discussion was not very energetic. Also, be prepared to receive less guidance than you are used to for response papers and essays. A lot of the students in the class are grad students, so the professors treat the class like a graduate-level course and do not give that much structure to the undergrads.",
    "The readings were excellent \u0097 a very compelling syllabus. Unfortunately class discussion itself was often less compelling; we frequently got sidetracked on overly extensive discussion of preliminary questions and would sometimes not be able to devote adequate time to the main questions of the texts. The seminar was overly large, and the high number of students made discussion more difficult and less rewarding. I enjoyed the course a lot, and it did improve, but I enjoyed it much more for the readings than for the seminar itself.I'd recommend taking this class if you're interested in the subject matter. It's a great opportunity to work with a couple really excellent professors on really interesting issues.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. Darwall and Smith were a good team, and the material itself was fascinating. It was a great mix of analytic and continental, political and ontological, and there was a lot of continuity among the readings. Occasionally, we wouldn't get to delve in as deeply as I would have liked, but that's a perennial complaint, especially when you're reading two or three authors per class.I wish we could have spent a little more time examining objections to the whole second-personal project, rather than simply different takes within it. It was also a little bit strange that half the class was a build-up to Darwall's book, which we only read for one seminar. Maybe we could have read it at the beginning, to frame the discussion? But that would have been strange too...This was my first class with Prof. Smith, and I was very impressed. He prepares well for each seminar, writing up detailed outlines of his remarks, and his thought is original and sharp. Occasionally, the dynamic between him and Prof. Darwall got a bit distracting, as they would argue about finer points of interpretation, but generally the two-professor dialectic was positive. Darwall super solid as always. This is his main deal, and he did well with it. Not mind-blowing, but careful and considered.",
    "Where else can you read Fichte and Hegel at Yale??",
    "I would recommend it provided the student: does all the readings, goes to office hours, and asks questions. It is an interesting course but WHAT the course is on, remained somewhat of a mystery throughout.",
    "I would recommend to other students who have a good background in ethical and political philosophy. Coming in a bit green, this was a tough course. The material was presented lucidly and carefully, and I really appreciated the exchange between Profs. Darwall and Smith.",
    "This is a very difficult course with very tough reading material. Take it only if you really have to"
