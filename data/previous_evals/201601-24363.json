    "AMST 340 is a look into the history of women in comedy, the struggles they have faced, and how they have succeeded in bringing feminism and progressive material into comedy. I would definitely recommend the class, especially if you are already interested in feminism and\/or comedy! It was super interesting and pretty chill--a hard balance to find!",
    "Women and Comedy is an incredible seminar that you must try to take!",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. The class had a bunch of comedy people in it, but really everyone can\/needs to\/must get something from this class. The reading is amazing. The presentations are amazing. Jalylah is amazing. Were all funny people in the class, but this comedy discussion is serious stuff, and everyone needs to friggin learn about it. Like I would take this course again, just because the material is so important and so rich. I am awake!",
    "An awesome class! TAKE THIS! I am a straight white dude and I took this class and so should you! It is an american studies class, you get to talk about the nature of comedy and feminism and sexism and all sorts of interesting things. Everything felt relevant. Just take the course already.",
    "This class is great: feminist, intersectional and funny. Prof Burrell has organized it very well. The readings were super interesting. It was a great way to look at humor. Definitely recommend!",
    "This was an awesome class. The material was interesting, the professor was great, and the class discussions were always engaging and fun. The work was 100% manageable and often fun to do. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Take this course to learn about comedians you've never heard of (past and present) and to hear some really interesting thoughts people have about comedy. You'll be pushed to think about comedy seriously. It's not a particularly difficult or time-intensive course, and it's very enjoyable. Professor Burrell is very accommodating and excited to talk with her students, and the readings are very diverse and interesting.",
    "A must take class! Very interesting material but not an overwhelming amount of work. Get to write 2 really cool papers and the presentations teach about different Sykes of comedy.",
    "A thrilling exploration of issues of race, gender, and sexuality in the american comedic tradition. Highly recommended.",
    "Interesting, engaging class with awesome subject matter. Take if you are interested in comedy, or gender in entertainment. The quality of the students really affects class discussion, so if your class is smart (mine was) it'll be awesome.",
    "Best class I think I'll take at yale"
