    "Fun course! I learned a lot, and great professors. You'll like it, if you can get in that is.",
    "readings every week, few responses. Spend a lot of time wading through the theory and trying to get at the practical ramifications. Very important for everyone who's interested in sustainability and environmental practice and faith.",
    "Maybe - it was an interesting idea, but frustrating in how it was carried out.",
    "Take it if you can. Tucker and Grim simply phenomenal people to be around, and the material is pretty cool too. You will receive a spiritual education.",
    "You read a lot of articles, some of which are awesome, some of which are boring. The first third of each class is a lecture from Grim and Tucker although other things are sometimes thrown into the mix (show-and-tell of their art or books, Buddhist meditation,etc.) then there is a discussion which is started by whichever student was assigned to do the reading summary for the week. There are two take home exams which are just essays.I'm not sure if I'd recommend this class. It depends on what you're looking for. It's not very difficult and can take up none of your time or a lot of your time depending on how seriously you want to take it. If after shopping it it really interests you, go for it.",
    "Great course! Obviously a really interesting subject, though sometime too advanced to fully comprehend. The discussions sometimes got too far off subject for me to follow how it related back to the original discussion, though it was a perfect atmosphere for a seminar (everyone talked, engaged, built, expanded, ect). The professors were great at extending the conversation and redirecting it when necessary.",
    "Definitely worth taking if you want to better understand a social force that could have major impact on our planet's future. This course offers a way of thinking about ecology that may never have struck me, but I now realize is absolutely essential. Really enjoyed this course...",
    "If you call yourself an atheist, ask yourself one quick question: why do you define your beliefs by one thing that you do not believe in instead of something (or possibly many things) that do believe in? For example, can you at least say that you believe the entire world ends when you die and it's all been in your mind or do you feel that it continues somehow? If you answer \"I don't know\" then you're correct but you're still not telling me what you believe in. I can't say whether this course will help others define what they believe in as well as it did for me but I'm pretty sure that it has something helpful to offer everyone."
