   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it! One warning: it is a lot of work. As someone who was qualified to take the class but is far from fluent in Chinese, I often find myself struggling to keep up with other students who speak Chinese at home. Although getting through it was tough (not so much difficult, but just a lot of work!), you WILL learn a lot from this course.",
    "Great introductory Chinese course. Assumes proficiency in Mandarin speech and listening, though; the course is conducted almost entirely in Chinese.Instructors expect a lot, but they're definitely fair about it. Very meticulously and logically structured, which is helpful for the student.All things considered, a good course.",
    "This is a great course for students who already know how to understand spoken chinese and can speak a little chinese themselves. As Professor Liang (\"liang lao shi\") puts it, this course fills in the holes of our (cheddar cheese) chinese education. I strongly recommend it to any other student - it's a decent amount of work but it never feels stressful.",
    "This depends on how much you want to learn Chinese. It is definitely not an easy language.",
    "Yes- only if you have a background in speaking Chinese. Liang lao shi speaks in almost 100% Chinese starting from day 1. I enjoyed the class and went from knowing almost no characters to over 360 characters.",
    "I would definitely recommend CHNS 112. Liang Laoshi is quite good, and your Chinese will improve dramatically IF you invest the time (usually 1 hr+ a day).",
    "Yes, very good beginner class for native speakers who don't have much background in speaking, writing or reading. But, daily study is required.",
    "Fast course, daily homework but not too much.If you are already relatively fluent in speaking and listening chinese, I would definitely recommend 112.",
    "it's a good class if you don't know any vocab, i.e. you've forgotten everything you've learned in sunday school. lol.",
    "Great, but tough class. Although the workload can be heavy (1-2 hours), as long as you keep you, you will do fine in the class. Liang laoshi is great!",
    "Chinese 112 is a rewarding class that is filled with a lot of work. Every day there are daily quizzes and homework. Homework ranges from simple character worksheets to memorizing long passages for tutorials. Therefore, if your courseload is relatively easy, then this class would be great for someone who is a native speaker and wants more familiarity with the Chinese language.",
    "Yes, I would definitelyrecommend this class to another student because it was exactly what I was looking for as a heritage speaker. The pace of this class and the work was exactly what I was looking for and I am very happy about how much I have improved my Chinese after one semester.",
    "The class is a boatload of work. If you're going to take this class, you must make sure that you will have the time to devote to it. If not, your grades will definitely suffer. For example, the class has daily quizzes that are cumulative and there are also a lot of homework every night. It would also help a ton if you went to weekend chinese school."
