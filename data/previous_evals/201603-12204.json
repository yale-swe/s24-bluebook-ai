   "comments": [
    "I gained an excellent overview of practices and discourses of sexuality throughout American history. I also learned important insights into the workings of academia (e.g. practicing evaluating articles, introducing a set of articles, working with primary sources).",
    "I think my biggest takeaways came from the \"parlor games.\" I had never considered professional skills like evaluating articles through an editorial lens or putting work together for a panel before. I also enjoyed that many of those activities required smaller group work, which was a welcome change from the usual full-class discussion format. They were also fantastic examples of pedagogical strategies that I will definitely integrate into my own teaching in the future.",
    "The course readings and discussions were very helpful for providing a grounding in the history of sexuality, as was to be expected from the course. A benefit of the course that I did not expect, though, was the exposure to a range of excellent pedagogical tools. The way the seminar discussions were framed and the class activities with the readings allowed for an in-depth exploration of the material, as well as giving me ideas for use in my future teaching.",
    "How to evaluate history. Understanding the history of sexuality.",
    "Greater knowledge of both the history of sexuality and the development of the discipline of the history of sexuality."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The interdisciplinary nature of the class was a definite strength, as different students were able to bring more perspectives to the table. The topics covered by the syllabus combined breadth and depth in an excellent way. Class time was used well without fail, and very often creatively. I would have appreciated more feedback on assignments, in order to have a more defined sense of my progress over the course of the semester.",
    "Strengths: the many interesting approaches to putting the readings together, helpful feedback on assignments, and student involvement in modifying the syllabus throughout the semester. Weaknesses: I sometimes felt like we were trying to cover too much material at once, due to the number of articles each week. While I appreciated the exposure to a wide variety of scholars and ideas, I often came away without quite as much of a grasp on topics than I would have liked because we were unable to spend the time on each piece to get enough depth.",
    "Again, one of the greatest strengths of the course, beyond the professor's expertise, was her framing of the material. There were no significant weaknesses, but a possible suggestion would be to make the individual responses to the reading viewable by the whole class, to prompt class discussions.",
    "This was the most engaging course I've taken in graduate school.",
    "Strengths: good topics, good discussions. Weaknesses: wished for a little bit more integration of international histories of sexuality; as it is, course is American or Transatlantic history of sexuality.",
    "The course was very strong; the class as a whole also discussed any adjustments to the reading list at the close of the final seminar."

    "Yes, I would - depending on what the student is looking to get out of the class. The course was different than expected, but still very good!",
    "Yes, but only if they had a background in gender and\/or sexuality.",
    "Yes, especially if they plan to teach upper-level\/graduate courses in the future.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Absolutely! Great set of readings, interesting topic, excellent guidance from the professor.",
    "Yes, absolutely, particularly (of course) those interested in the subject."
