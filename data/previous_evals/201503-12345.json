    "I recommend this course to anyone.",
    "Recommended to anyone interested in learning about the most fundamental (i.e., the most crucial) questions relating to interpretation of any kind. GMAN 456, or a course very very like it, should be required for any student of literature or other art forms at Yale. Carol Jacobs has an extraordinary mind and is a fantastically able seminar leader. You will learn so much. Note, though, that you should NOT take this course if your ONLY goal is learn about the four individual writers themselves (Freud, Barthes, de Man, Benjamin) read in the course. Prof. Jacobs discusses their concerns, obviously, but her emphasis throughout the course is to engage with each of these thinkers as an interpreter first (and only then as a psychoanalyst, a semiotician, a scholar of Romanticism, a Frankfurt school memberand so on). But that only makes the course all the more relevant to a broad spread of students."
