   "comments": [
    "Alexandrov is one of the best lecturers I have encountered at Yale; insightful, engaging, funny-- a true expert in his field. You can't go wrong with a great lecture and amazing literature. Be forewarned, the reading is dense. It is Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. But it is also wonderful, and I am so glad I took it.",
    "Meh? It's a lot of reading that you could just do after you graduate, when you actually have time for it.",
    "This class surveys four of the great novels of Russian (and world) literature: War & Peace, Anna Karenina, Crime & Punishment, and The Brothers Karamazov. Prof Alexandrov is one of the world's foremost scholars of Russian literature (check out his press blurb for the Pevear\/Volokhonsky translation of W&P) and listening to him lecture about these novels has been one of the most gripping classroom experiences I've had at Yale. His depth of knowledge and intimate familiarity with the texts is palpable, and his wry humor even spices up the lectures once in a while. Obviously, there's an enormous amount of reading involved, about 300 pages each week, but that's the nature of the course. There are midterm and final papers (both 7-8 pages, on any topic relating to the novels) and a final exam (20 IDs from all the novels), but the course has no fat--effectively the entire workload of the class is reading the novels, and if you do all the reading the papers and exam are pretty trivial.",
    "If you can take this class. Its amazing. Just be prepared for a lot of reading.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. This class covers novels that you should read, and it really teaches you how to read them. The work was very manageable (two papers and a final exam comprising solely passage identifications), and the lectures became one of the highlights of my week. Definitely keep up with the reading, because it is easy to fall behind. If you stay on top of the work, this will be an incredibly rewarding experience. A great way to round out your semester.",
    "Amazing class - if you're at all interested in Russian literature, you should take this class.",
    "Great class for these novels. Ambitious but worth it. Work is manageable which allows you to concentrate on reading the texts: 7-8 pg midterm paper, 7-8 final paper, final exam consisting of 20 IDs. Alexandrov is also an incredible lecturer. With all this said, I do not recommend taking literature courses by lecture. I much preferred seminar format or DS-style format. Nevertheless, Alexandrov is an unique lecturer, who has written books about these texts.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student! If you have any interest in any of these novels, you have to take it! The reading assignments are manageable and so is the workload and the lectures make it so worth it.",
    "Definitely my favorite course so far at Yale. The reading list is incredible!! It is an amazing opportunity to be able to read 4 of the greatest Russian novels in one semester. It comes down to about 300 pages a week of reading, but it gets lighter as the semester goes on (I found War and Peace to be the densest of the works). Two papers and a final exam. It's a mistake to pass up this class- Professor Alexandrov is amazing!! YES to this course!",
    "The texts are enough reason to recommend the course. The professor expresses his ideas clearly, and they make sense and are often interesting. Section gives at least a little time to talk about the novels.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to people with at least two out of the three following characteristics: wondering whether to study literature, able to keep up with huge amounts of reading, and also interested in Russian novels, especially by Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. For me, the class took a bit away from the magic of the novels (I read Anna Karenina and the Brothers Karamazov before taking the class), but it also expanded my ability to critically think about literature immensely--perhaps at the expense of my grade. I know I won't be pursuing literature as a study, but I would totally take this class, and probably Credit\/D.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this - the novels are some of the greatest in literature, and Alexandrov is a wonderful lecturer.",
    "Take before you leave Yale, books will make you view the world differently!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with a passionate interest in literature. I wish I had taken the course when I had a slightly lighter course load, as the texts invite deep analysis and require leisure to digest.",
    "You read four of the world's best books in one semester. Take it if you're interested in the books because the reading is not easy to keep up with and you will have to do a lot of learning. These books, though, will change your life!",
    "An AMAZING course that more Yale students need to take.",
    "I would have loved this class, except for the crazy fast pace. Alexandrov's lectures are fascinating, and so are the books. But it feels like we only touched the surface of each book, and it was extremely difficult to keep up with the reading. I had only read one of the books before, and the part of the course that covered that book was the most fulfilling for me because I could focus on the themes rather than rushing through the reading and just focusing on the plot.The exam was fine if you read the books and\/or paid attention in lecture.",
    "You read a lot - but the works are great. Lots of questions get brought up, and they will stick with you. Worth it!",
    "Recommending HUMS 176 to another student is highly dependent on that student's interest in reading the four novels the course covers; if there is interest, then HUMS 176 is a must-take course. Its depth allows for some very close reading, and Professor Alexandrov's lectures are not to be missed. However, should one not have interest in reading these four novels to begin with, I'm not sure if a student would particularly benefit from taking this course.",
    "Absolutely take it. Readings take a lot of time but they're worth it. I feel like I've come out of this course as a much better and faster reader, and also I think a more sensitive and better person. Everyone should read these 4 masterworks of these two geniuses, and I do not exaggerate when I say that to do it under the guidance of Alexandrov is a unique, once in a lifetime opportunity. I sincerely think that this class has the power to change your life for the better.",
    "If you want to read these books, take this class. If you don't want to read these books and you want to pretend you did, take this class. If you want a semester full of epiphanies, take this class. If you don't have one, pretty much all the characters you read will at one point or another."
