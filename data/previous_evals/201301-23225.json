    "So dull. Barely a seminar. There were hot guys in the class though, so that was a plus.",
    "If you can get into this course, you should definitely take it. European Politics provides a great complement to the European Union course Professor Cameron offers during the fall semester. It is also a great course to take on its own if you would like to explore the European states in a comparative context. There is a lot of reading, but the majority of it is pretty interesting.",
    "A great systematic overview of the content. Cameron is funny and incredibly knowledgable, though you can skim\/read reviews of the readings (he's an assign a whole book kind of guy) and you'll probably do as well as the people that read every page.",
    "This was a decent course on European Politics that was bogged down by sometimes very boring material and a seminar style that was more of a lecture and that was sometimes extremely dry. I would take it only if you expect to love the subject matter.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Many of the readings are boring and repetitive, and the first half of the course is essentially the same reading 5 or 6 times. The weekly reading comments are never fun to write, and I rarely get helpful feedback on them, so I'm not really sure why they're there.Professor Cameron is very nice and, I'm sure, a good mentor. But for students looking to take a class without having to spend a ton of time in office hours and to still learn something, European Politics is not the class to do it in.",
    "You'll learn a good deal about European politics in the context of several different countries and the EU. I would recommend it both for Professor Cameron and for the great group of students you'll learn with.",
    "This is a great poli. sci. seminar, but you should probably take a lower level course related to European politics if you want to have constructive comments to make in class."
