   "comments": [
    "This course, actually, is difficult for me without medical background.",
    "I loved the content of the course, but the way it was taught could be improved.",
    "this course was great and the professor illustrated the complicated theory in very simple way. It did take students some time to understand this difficult courses.",
    "good.",
    "Argh, this class. I really wanted to like this class. I also really didn't. It particularly stands in contrast to Melinda Pettigrew's Principles of Infectious Diseases 1, which occupies a similar in the EMD curriculum, covering the basics and then diving deeper into a range of specific examples. Much of my feedback is going to be based around why PID1 worked for me and tox didn't, because that lets me get at some specific problems and offer specific solutions. Throughout the class, content that was presented range widely from pivotal (modes of absorption of mercury) to irrelevant (PAH nomenclature). It was very difficult to tell which was which, especially while the content was being presented. There were a few exceptions, where key concepts were presented on intro\/summary slides, or when a \"but you don't expect you to memorize all that\" was explicitly state. There are multiple additional ways to mitigate this. First, I suggest introducing some variability in your presentation style; Jon in particular has a uniform style that makes everything sound equally important. Second, consider more \"learning objectives\" slides. Third, I suggest having an exam review handout. Melinda had a one-page handout for each each which consisted of essay questions; if you could take that handout and answer all the questions on it well, you could count on doing well on the exam. I'd be happy to show you what that looked like. Second, I'd love to see you engage the students more often in a brief \"why do you think this is important \/ what do you think this is about\" kind of conversation. But see per-instructor feedback for additional thoughts on challenges I foresee in that regard. I think you ran into some problems setting clear expectations about exams (especially the first exam). I think much of this is due to the difficulty differentiating minutia from important material. This was mildly stressful for me, and I am pretty sure it was more than mildly stressful for others. A few of the transitions from one lecturer to the other were not handled well, I think mainly because your schedule of those transitions was too inflexible, and so any timing problems (like the time when Cheryl thought she had two hours rather than 1.5) resulted in frustration for everyone. Mainly, if one of you is running long, I suggest you handle it by either passing the buck to the other and having them finish your lecture in the following class, or by showing up to finish your own lecture in the following class. That puts the burden of sorting this out on you, rather than on the students. (Which is what happened when Cheryl's 2-hour lecture was delivered extra fast and we were offered the option to stay extra long to finish it up.) One more thing. Student presentations are, I think, an excellent idea, but were rather poorly executed by many students. This was a problem when I needed to remember their content for the exam (though I do understand incentivizing attendance, and agree with that goal). I think YSPH needs to do a better job of teaching people how to present. I am pretty sure this is not a problem you can solve in tox, and I do intend to bring it up with not sure who yet, but definitely someone. But I think that if you want to rely on student presentations as a major part of the class, it might be a good idea to instigate some way for people to learn how to present well. I know I could use it, too.",
    "I would recommend not having all of the assignments bunched together. I would have preferred to space them out more, and have a more clear understanding of what the essays are asking for prior to writing them.",
    "wonderful challenging course.",
    "I was really excited to learn about toxicology, but found the course layout very difficult to follow. I don't feel like the end learning goal was established and topics were not laid out in a clear manner. Often, class would end up in tangential stories that were difficult to tie back to the subject matter. I wish we had been given case studies (especially pharmacological studies) and then examined the inner workings of toxicological principles and how those play out in the world of patient health and pharmacy.",
    "A common theme for this class is \"It was hard, but I ended up learning a lot.\" I would expand upon this a bit. Yes, I do feel like I learned a lot, but I also think I could have learned more and it did not need to be as hard as it was. The structure of the class was my main issue. All graded assignments were bunched towards the end, so you had no idea how you were doing until the midterm. I would have been nice to get some feedback more frequently. Also, because the professor likes to go on tangents, it's hard to tell what are useful (as in what are examples of class topics that you should know) and what is not useful. Despite this course not being a biochemistry course, there is quite a bit of biochem you end up needing to know (or at the very least, it will make recognizing and memorizing compounds and chemistry concepts easier). I do think that if the lectures were better organized, it'd be easier to learn the material and keep track of what is an example of what, and why that matters.",
    "Strengths: Professors are great. Weakness: May require a little biochemical background.",
    "There is really no reason to torment students with two months of definitions. Jump right in to some toxicology and case studies. I still believe toxicology is an interesting subject, despite this class. Students will pick up on the the toxicology concepts while they learn about interesting toxicological issues and they might just walk away knowing more significant toxicological issues than just mercury, PAH, and TCE. Don't underestimate students, they can learn definitions simultaneously with known toxins and toxicants.",
    "Pretty disappointed. The strengths of this course are that the material is very important, very interesting, and the professor is very knowledgeable. Its weakness is that that the lectures are not engaging. It is very unfortunate that we spent half of the semester going over very basic principles just to get everybody up to speed. Also, the way the papers were graded did not make much sense nor did it seem fair and balanced. This course is very important and I think significant changes in its structure are important in the future. One recommendation would be to make the class much more interactive using a flipped classroom model.",
    "The course does provide you with a working knowledge of the principles of toxicology, however, the methodology is a bit flawed and confusing. Actual methods of evaluation don't occur until very late within the semester, and it is difficult to decide how detailed\/general you need to be with each portion of the course material. Across the board, test questions were often misinterpreted by many members of the class. (Such as requesting students to describe concepts in \"layman's terms\" yet also desiring specific use of course vocabulary in grading...which are 100% contradictory directions and expectations). Grading turnaround for assessments are also take extremely long, forcing students to adjust study\/preparation habits within the final month of the course to finish the final paper\/presentation\/exam at the end of the course. Oftentimes having a more robust knowledge of biochemistry can harm classroom performance when answers such as Cl+ being considered an electrophile are accepted as correct responses within class. While answers such as this are theoretically correct, they don't occur in nature let alone within the body. Then on the flipside, failing to be specific enough about a particular form of Cytochrome P450 can result in being docked points. Answer keys and practice exams\/problems are not available for a student to track progress or self-assess from the sparse homework assignments and exams. All in all, the course is extremely difficult, but it's not necessarily because the content is difficult. When students have such a hard time determining how they are supposed to be assessed and what they are being asked to do, it is almost a meta-course in guessing what the instructors want you to say. This is attempted to be addressed by requesting students to set up individual meetings for clarification on the assignments, but as the class size grows this is an unsustainable and, quite frankly, irresponsible method. It makes sense to utilize office hours to obtain assistance on conceptual problems with the course, but if an assignment can't be accurately conveyed to a classroom during classtime, that is a flaw in planning, not student comprehension. It should not be on the onus of the student to try and correct this issue. Earlier and consistent feedback on course material is a MUST for this course.",
    "One weakness was there was too much information given in the course, so we were confused as to what were the most important facts that we needed to know.",
    "I have no chemistry background, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this course. Both instructors do a lot to make the material accessible to everyone, and are very available for outside help."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Professor Fields is really a great instructor. She has enthusiasm to help us solve any problems in the class, and I like her teaching style.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Great instructor - time management was consistently a problem for the lectures she taught.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0the lady was so good, Just speak too fast and it's hard to follow up her.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0lack of stress in the lecture.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0See notes above about handling presentations that run long. I think the way that played out (that is, you tried to fit two hours of content into 90 minutes of class) is related to the interpersonal dynamic that I see between you and Jon, namely, that he's the boss, and not a boss that is particularly good at listening. That trait of his leads to a lot of secondary effects on how this class feels (students feeling intimidated, not getting their questions answered but having a hard time with saying so, etc). I think that your role (as I see it) both in relation to him and specifically in this class amplifies this. It was established relatively early on in the class that he's your boss and that he doesn't really listen to you. I might be particularly observant about this, but I think that by the time that we reached the 2-hour lecture it was clear to everyone. The problem with everyone in the class seeing this is that it amplifies the extent to which they are intimidated by him. (I wrote extensively about this in my feedback to him.) If he doesn't listen to you (his peertheoretically), then why would he listen to any of us? My guess here is that this dynamic between the two of you reaches far beyond the confines of that one classroom, so I don't really have any good proposal for what (if anything) to do about it just the impression that it's hurting the ability of both of you to do your work well.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Ms. Fields is the perfect balance to Dr. Borak. She is significantly more approachable and less intimidating. I always felt comfortable going to her office hours and I am really thankful for that. She's wonderful and knowledgable and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0approachable and knowledgeable. Great addition to Jonathan Borak",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Cheryl was engaging, but added a lot of superfluous details to some of the lessons that got me lost in the weeds instead of understanding the overall goal of the class.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Professor Fields' lectures are definitely much more straightforward, if also a bit winding. Otherwise, a fine lecturer who knows her material.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Very knowledgable and engaging.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Also great.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Kind and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Good instructor.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Professor Fields is a solid lecturer and sensitive to student concerns. She has a firm understanding of her required lectures and students would probably benefit greatly from having her take a greater share of the lectures throughout the course.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0She was very approachable and clear in what she expected of us in the course.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Very sweet, friendly and accessible instructor who was always happy to help outside of class. Her slides were always extremely well done, but at some points her lecture style felt a bit overwhelming. (A little too fast with a lot of information coming at you.)",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is really an excellent professor and he is very patient to answer out questions and help us to understand the materials.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0The content for this course was excellent, but the way it was taught could be improved - I often found it difficult to determine what to take notes on, as the spoken lecture would often times not correspond or stray far from content on the slides.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Professor was so great that the course itself is very interesting. Just very hard to start because the complicated chemical names which international students had to check the dictionary to understand the content.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0good.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0See notes above about uniform presentation style. Two other things. First, I think there were a number of times when someone asked you a question and you answered what you thought the question was, and they didn't get much out of your answer. I know you usually ask \"did that answer your question\" at the end, but I also recommend more saying \"let me make sure I understand the question at the beginning\", for reasons that will became clear in the next paragraph. While I can get on board with your style of humor when it's directed at me, I think that it has a high chance of misfiring with many other people. It's a style of humor that I think works well between people who have a mutually established respect, but can be very off-putting\/intimidating between people of whom one has inherent position of respect (you) and the other treats them as a superior (most people in YSPH classes, especially 1st-years). Which isn't to say that I want you to completely turn off your humor, but I would advise more awareness about who the humor is directed at. Humor directed at you generally helps diminish your position of superiority, and will make other things you say or do appear less intimidating; humor directed at others (especially the person asking a question, which happened a few times quite subtly and I don't have enough space here to list specifics) amplifies the inherent imbalance. This exacerbates the \"did I answer your question\" problem, because if you do things that amplify the extent to which people find you intimidating, then that makes it harder for them to say \"actually, no, you didn't answer my question at all\" and more likely to say \"yeah\" even when that's not actually true. Yes, I know they would be benefit from being better at handling these situations without getting intimidated, and if that's a challenge you want to help them with, I think there are more effective ways to accomplish that. Finally, one more thing that created an impression of you as intimidating. It was clear from the way that you and Cheryl interact that you are the boss and she does what you ask. And not because of anything that she said it was clear in the way that she reacted to various things, like realizing that she was going to run long on a lecture. I suspect this is a dynamic that plays out between the two of you outside of the class, and is just a subtle undertone to your interaction in the class. But, given that dynamic, the takeaway for the students is \"Jon doesn't listen to Cheryl, who is his peer, so he's not going to listen to us either\".",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is wonderful and knows so much. He can be a little bit intimidating, but the really cares about students and their success.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Jonathan and Cheryl were great and are clearly enthusiastic about what they teach.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0It is clear that Dr. Borak is very knowledgeable and passionate about his subject. He did like to talk in tangents about examples that I felt were sometimes a little bit too advanced for the people who were just being introduced to toxicology for the first time, though.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is useful in explaining things you might not understand after class and he is indeed willing and capable of that. However, his lecturing style in class is a bit disjointed and it's hard to keep track of where things fit into one another.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Very knowledgeable and engaging.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Everything is great, except the ppt, may be the name of the chemicals mentioned in the class could be add to the ppt.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0It is the structure of the course and not the instructor that I really had an issue with. I will add that the grading seemed silly. Are \"gotcha moments\" the way we need our essays graded?",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is extremely knowledgeable and brings his very broad expertise to the classroom. However, the class could be made much more interactive with a different model and improved slides.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is very knowledgable about his studies, and he is able to provide examples for scientific concepts very quickly. However, he relies far too heavily on verbal instructions for assignments and feedback. Similarly, while knowledgable, he can be quite blunt when speaking with students one on one. While this was not a problem personally, it would be understandable that students with less thick skin could be upset or offended by him. While I think Dr. Borak's heart is in the right place, he needs to reassess his goals for this course in terms of being specific vs being general about the material. Furthermore, he would benefit from developing written versions of his instructions that clearly convey his expectations, if for no one else the international students that do not speak English as a native language.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0He was very knowledgable and clear. He would sometimes supply us with too many details.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Great lecturer, friendly guy, and very available to outside help. I know he puts a lot of efforts into the slides, but at some points I would have appreciated a clearer organizational structure to them!"

It's challenging, but we're paying too much money in tuition to take a class \"just cause it's required.\" Yes. It's hard. and Yes, you will put in a lot of time, but it's rewarding and worth it and you'll sound smart when you say you're taking \"tox.\"",
    "Challenging course. Worth all the extra effort it requires.",
    "It's a brief introduction to some mechanisms of toxicity and studies on a few understood toxic substances. Unless you have to take the course or you have a micro-bio background, I would not recommend.",
    "Unless you have to take the class as a requirement, I think it'd be best to avoid it until some issues with the course structure are addressed. Having everything in a 400-slide powerpoint is not helpful in keeping track of the material, and not following or updating the syllabus means you can't really plan for anything happening when you think it will. You will learn a lot (though probably not as much as you could \/ would actually want to); I learned the most through the two paper assignments where it was essentially self-learning by reading scientific papers and wikipedia-ing everything I didn't understand about chemistry. Additionally, having a strong chemistry background will help understand some of the concepts that he tries to dumb down for a general audience (but not really succeeding in).",
    "The course is rigorous and challenging if you do not have a background in organic chemistry, however, the instructors give you every opportunity to ask for help and clarification. This course helps you understand how different exposures can produce different disease outcomes, and helps provide a scientific basis for understanding many of the studies that are assigned in other classes. I would definitely recommend this course since it adds additional dimension to epidemiology and other fields that fall under the public health umbrella.",
    "Are you an MD? Do you have a PHD in molecular biology? Are you good at mind-reading? If the answer to all of those questions is no, you should NOT take this class. I cannot even begin to describe how awful it was: the material is boring and hard. The essay assignments are extremely unclear -- and you will be graded on your ability to answer questions that are really NOT evident from the prompt. Doing well on the tests requires rote memorization of 500+ slides. And then here's the kicker: you're graded on a curve, BUT a third of your class already has an MD or PHD and thus is already familiar with much of the material. So you will inevitably be on the bottom of the curve, no matter how much you study.",
    "A very good course, hard but interesting.",
    "I would recommend taking another course if this class is not restructured. It doesn't teach you much science and it doesn't teach you about very many toxicants.",
    "This course is a very good way to get a solid foundation in toxicology for people without a firm biological sciences background. However, you may not find it challenging if you have already taken general chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry.",
    "Honestly, I would steer away from this course unless you HAVE to take it. Students with a firm background in chemistry\/biochemistry beware, you may have to re-learn previous concepts you took for granted. If you do decide to take this class, you need to set up meetings with Dr. Borak for clarification on any major assignment or exam. Directions are almost never clear from the get go, and if you think you understand what is expected of you, you probably misinterpreted at least one aspect of the assignment. It's better to be safe than sorry.",
    "Very interesting course material, but a lot of information",
    "A great course which provides you with some basic toxicological tools."
