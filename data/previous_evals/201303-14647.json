    "Strongly recommend, it is full of knowledge and fun.",
    "This course is designed for students whocan communicate fluently in English to help them improve the skills in communication. Since most students are graduates or visiting researchers, the course is focused on the academic communications skills, such as writing theses or reviews, introducing oneself in a academic way, etc. There are also some topics for daily communications, e.g., writing emails and debating.I would recommend students whose TOEFL are higher than 26 to attend this course, since it helps one to increase the knowledge in English as well as other cultures.",
    "worth taking because you'll make many friends from different culture and even though only 4h\/week this course may be the only chance to really practice conversation in English.",
    "Yes. I would like to describe it as a nice place to practice a good communication in English where the professor can successfully engage all students into the classroom discussion and talking about the unique culture of American and other students' culture and what make them they are."
