   "comments": [
    "Great overview of how the texts and authors on the syllabus related to one another and the broader study of Ethics, Politics and Economics.",
    "A really good understanding of tough philosophical texts, and how they apply to issues in the world.",
    "This course honestly changed my philosophical outlook on life. I learned to consider various definitions of life and politics and how to apply them both historically and in modernity. In many discussions now, I find myself thinking about how I interact with myself and other humans using the philosophy I learned in Classics of EP&E.",
    "This class made me consider big and profound ideas of human nature in a way I had not done before, even after doing DS and taking other philosophy\/EP&E classes. It gave me a grasp on the central contributions of a wide range of Western thinkers, but really not as in-depth or precisely as DS did, since we were covering one text in a single seminar rather than in several meetings.",
    "I went into this course having only an on-the-surface knowledge of philosophy and came out with not only a deeper sense of knowing the philosophers but a willingness to learn more about them later on. I now know about each thinker's life, their major contributions, and how they relate to real life thinking and current affairs."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A lot of the readings were very obscure, but we spent little time working through the material. The class lecture was very hard to follow at times. I had to dedicate a lot of time outside of class to really begin to comprehend the material.",
    "I would have liked to have more discussion in seminar. I find that having to talk in class allows me to formulate a better understanding of what I am reading. The testing methods were really good. I enjoyed having an oral final instead of a written exam.",
    "Professor Leslie is really committed to teaching the class and knows the material well. I was also really happy at the variety of philosophical texts that we covered, including writers such as Frederick Douglass and Simone de Beauvoir. I think the classes could have been organized better since we were a little behind schedule at all times.",
    "Strengths: You learn a ton from many different philosophers and Professor Leslie is warm and incredibly brilliant. Weaknesses: I honestly think this course could do better as a small lecture course rather than a seminar -- Professor Leslie had to do a lot of lecturing and if you were not someone good at interjecting, it was difficult to participate. Also cutting down the reading list a bit wouldn't hurt -- the post midnight class was pretty hard also.",
    "David lectured a lot, which is great because he knows so much, but made it more difficult to stay engaged and thinking critically; you could sort of zone out if you weren't careful. We could have been more attentive to the actual texts, since we barely read any specific passages and relied more on thematic discussions. This meant that there was room for what we were interested in, but the class definitely tended to get off topic and into very meta- level, vague thinking and questioning.",
    "There is a lot of reading, but it is worth it. I feel that although this is a seminar course the professor has to talk during most of the session. I was fine with it, but some students might want to discuss more during the seminars."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. David Leslie is a lovely man",
    "I really enjoyed taking this class and feel like I learnt a lot during the semester.",
    "If you're an epe major you have to take this. Professor Leslie is new but very good and I enjoyed my semester in his class.",
    "I took Classics of EP&E because it was required for my major -- Professor Leslie is lovely and incredibly smart, but I'm not certain I would recommend taking this course if it wasn't required for your major. I think there exist other philosophy\/political philosophy courses that might serve as a better primer before or instead of taking this one.",
    "Definitely take this course with Prof. Leslie, he's fantastic! This course was key in helping me develop a philosophy for life.",
    "If you are passionate about philosophy or Western civilization and history, you will enjoy this class. It gives you as much as you put into it. I did not do a lot of the reading, since I've read a lot of the authors in past classes, but this meant that seminar was much less rewarding. If you are interested in big questions - what does death mean for humans, how do we connect with one another, what does the state mean, how does human history progress, what is justice, etc. - then definitely take this class. I cannot emphasize how wonderful David is (though extremely verbose and occasionally disorganized) and how way-too excited he always was about whatever we were reading. He also includes texts on the syllabus that other teachers may not, so take advantage of this opportunity to read essential thinkers like Fanon, Douglass, and Beauvoir that other teachers neglect!",
    "I feel this is a great introduction course to the philosophy of the greatest thinkers of our era and has a wide range\/types of thinkers. If anyone is interested in philosophy, they should take the course."
