   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course for a fairly easy humanities \/ writing credit. If you are interested in psychology this course is especially interesting as several broad psych topics are discussed.",
    "Great, interesting class, but not that easy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The papers are short, but the lectures are cool and the guest lecturers are seriously interesting.",
    "i recommend this class",
    "I would recommend this course because it is interesting and a good WR",
    "I think this class has a lot of really great opportunities with amazing guest lecturers from all different fields. However there is a lot of tedious work and I don't think normal lectures were enjoyable.",
    "Interesting class although there is no real answer to what genius actually is (although the professor notes this at the start of the semester). It's a great exploration and gets you thinking.",
    "THIS CLASS IS A WASTE OF TIME. DO NOT TAKE IT UNLESS IT'S CREDIT\/D AND YOU DON'T PLAN ON SHOWING UP EVER. Some of the lectures are entertaining. SOME. But they treat you like high schoolers!",
    "Lectures are zero help. daily quizzes to make you go. 4 short papers (500, 500, 600, 700 words) and a final paper that is 2000. Grading is not hard, but not a breeze.",
    "This course consists of a lot of quizzes and papers, as well as guest speakers, but overall the class is really interesting and I would recommend it as in interesting extra course on a unique topic.",
    "Pretty chill for a writing credit, but a decent workload nevertheless. Readings were generally interesting and guest lectures were awesome. In-class reading quizzes were annoying. Class was mostly just an excuse for Craig Wright to muse about random topics - not the most interesting.",
    "A fine class if you need a writing credit, but I wouldn't take it for fun.",
    "I enjoyed the interdisciplinary nature of the course. However, the class at times felt haphazard, and I was frustrated by the amount of speculation and circulatory arguments about what genius \"is\". If you're a science major, you'll probably get frustrated with the many fluffy arguments. Your grade will depend a lot on the TA you get.",
    "I would probably not take this course given what I know about it now. Shop it to see if you are intrigued!",
    "An interesting course that gives some good insight into history's most famous geniuses (Leonardo, Mozart, Picasso, etc...). If you can handle the lack of organization, this class will be very easy for you. The writing portion was clear and concise, and makes for a great writing credit. Definitely recommend.",
    "This class is a very interesting course, with not too much stress. Essays are relatively short and manageable. Professor is also very nice. Overall, interesting course that makes you think about what makes genius, and a low key humanities\/writing credit.",
    "Manageable Wr\/Hu credit with interesting readings and guest lecturers. Would recommend.",
    "gut writing class that's also fairly interesting",
    "Great writing credit with minimum workload. It's not dramatically enlightening, but it's definitely entertaining...always a relaxing lecture addressing some cool people\/topics. You can make of it whatever you want--Prof. Wright is really excited to develop topics further based on student feedback and encourages people to explore more deeply the specific things they are interested in. He also finds all sorts of cool people who are experts in some realm to come talk to the class--writers, actors, neurologists, etc. He tries to make it a seminar-style conversation among the students, but with 50+ people in the room it can be tough sometimes.",
    "This class was a waste of time. Lecture was generally very repetitive and discussion was at a pretty low level. The work was essentially all busy work, and while it is supposed to be a writing course, class itself is not at all focused on teaching writing skills. Maybe once a moth a TA would talk for 10 minutes in class about writing, but the actual professor never discussed it. There is a fair amount of work, none of which is hard, but most of which is a real pain. I would recommend this class only if you need a writing credit. If you really dislike writing and aren't interesting in developing your skills, this is a relatively non-rigorous way to get the credit.",
    "If a science\/math student, it might be more beneficial to take another class to fulfill the Humanities requirements. This class can be writing intensive if not an experienced college writer and involved abstract concepts. The questions about genius that come up in the class never truly get answered. Only would recommend this class to those who are really interested in genius or a student who is a strong writer.",
    "Good class. You won't \"learn\" a lot, but you'll think about lots of different things.",
    "Yes. So. Easy.",
    "No. Just No.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it. The class was a bit pointless and was basically a semester-long ramble. The TAs graded the papers more harshly than you would expect and there is tons of random busy work. The class was not interesting enough to counteract the messiness.",
    "Genius. So much to say about this class and Craig Wright. Don't take this class unless you need a WR and don't know what else to take. I hear this class started as a Freshman Seminar and that premise is actually good but it has morphed into something completely unmanageable. This term it was around 100 people and somehow CW still expected us to participate. This is made even more difficult by the fact that CW dominates the \"discussion\", providing input after anybody says anything. It is basically a lecture. Most professors teach so they can pass on what they know to students. Although CW has a fair amount of knowledge and opinions, he doesn't do this. Instead, he rather selfishly treats this class as his personal exploration of genius, and sometimes acts like students are secondary parts of the class. He is also extremely disorganized and unprofessional. Also, grading is completely dependant on your TA. If you don't care about any of the above, it is a fairly easy (as long as your TA is reasonable) WR with very little work.",
    "This class is interesting at times but also some lectures are very slow.",
    "Overall enjoyable class. Not very work intensive (although readings for quizzes during the first month can take some time) and some cool ideas are explored with interesting lectures and guest speakers. Would recommend, especially for someone looking for a writing credit that doesnt require a ton of actual writing",
    "A very interesting course and a great WR credit for those who do not feel like great writers. The course would work much better as a seminar, but due to large demand Professor Wright made it a lecture without freshmen. Still he managed to learn pretty much everyone's name which was very much appreciated. The material was great- it strayed from the syllabus and probably half of the weeks we spent studying a specific genius and the other half of the weeks were on what constitutes genius. We frequently had guest lecturers. Workload was just a few short papers, reading quizzes, participation, and a slightly longer final paper. Paper grades really depend on the TA you are assigned to, but I did not find that to be an issue at all. Work is front heavy in that almost all quizzes and papers were prior to spring break.",
    "Although the homework load is light, the writing was evaluated severely which made the actual grading difficult.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student because it is an interesting, engaging, highly varying way to get your writing credit out of the way and to learn about different important historical figures.",
    "HUMS 217 01 is a course about the nature of genius. It is a class that is not too difficult and has the potential to be enjoyed if you do the readings. I would recommend the class to any Yale student.",
    "Interesting course which sometimes lacked focus slightly, but a very interesting \"broad\" rather than \"deep\" course.",
    "I recommend it. Its an interesting class with not too much work and you get a writing credit.",
    "Definitely take this class. It is wonderful and you learn a lot of really interesting things about so many different areas, from art to science to music. Class is never boring and the speakers who come in are some very interesting people. I definitely enjoyed every class and learned so much. Also, it is not much work and writing the papers is often very enjoyable. The readings are often short and very interesting, so the daily quizzes are not difficult at all.",
    "You'll get much more out of any other writing credit - so unless you really want to waste one on something mindless, take something else.",
    "Hmm, on the fence about this honestly. Not too much work for a writing credit. But can be frustrating.",
    "MUSI107 is a course designed to improve writing through the examination of genius throughout the ages. I would recommend it for someone who is comfortable with exploring the big questions like \"what is genius\" without coming away with concrete answers.",
    "A true gut that you should take if you need the writing credit or are really interested in the subject. It's actually a good class, and you feel like you're actually learning stuff as long as you put the slightest bit of effort into it.",
    "I would very highly recommend this course. The topic was fascinating, I learned a lot about how to write---but even more, I felt this course encouraged me to reflect on how I learn and how I use what I learn. I think this course can help you reflect more broadly on your university experience, think about what your strengths are and what future paths you might want to consider.",
    "The writing assignments are graded pretty stringently, but as long as you put in a bit of effort and work with your TA, they are reasonable and even interesting. The class itself can be a lot of fun.",
    "I think this course really opened my mind to different people and thoughts. The course covers a range of topics, which I have found useful in my day to day activities. It's like a philosophy, history and psychology class. A good mix to learn interesting information you may not indulge in on your own. Prof. Wright is one of the best professor's i've had here. He learns everyone's names and is really caring.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course. It sounds a lot better than it is.",
    "Interesting class, not too challenging.",
    "Yes definitely recommend this class to everyone, not just those looking for a WR",
    "Absolutely would NOT recommend.",
    "This is a pretty interesting class, although it gets a bit repetitive toward the second half of the semester. The writing assignments are short enough and most of them are straightforward but they make you think a bit.",
    "All in all, it's a gut. I didn't realize this upon enrolling and became ever more disappointed in the course as the discussions went from engaging, to average, all the way to pseudo-intellectual, baseless banter that never reached any meaningful conclusions. The professor knows a great deal about music but spends much of the course attempting to discuss material he knows too little about to teach (neuroscience, psychology, the scientific process, etc). At first I was excited; by the end I was shaking my head wishing I had taken ENGL120 or something. The writing assignments will not make you a better writer, and I don't think the course should be considered a WR."
