   "comments": [
    "The course is pretty straightforward. This is exactly what you expect. Rather fun because it uses your classical mechanics intuition but teaches you new ways to apply them. Tests are predictable so you should do well, if you do the homeworks properly.Useful because subject matter will be on qualification exams.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless he or she was required to take it, for all the reasons cited above.",
    "This course is a good extension to one's classical mechanics knowledge assuming one has taken an advanced classical mechanics as an undergraduate. I would recommend the course.",
    "My fellow student has to take it because Physics 500 is a core course.",
    "Solid course on classical mechanics. Introduces techniques from classical physics widely applicable to other subfields of physics. Would recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anybody who has not had a theoretical mechanics course, but student should beware the algebra-heavy and time-consuming homework.",
    "This course is very well structured and organized, though the use of textbooks is somewhat tricky and may be unpredictable. I would recommend this course to a student who is able to keep good notes and is willing to ask questions about a confusing concept.",
    "Mechanics was more or less a more difficult version of my undergraduate mechanics class, with a few additional topics like Hamiltonians. I think it will be useful, but maybe not more useful than whatever other course I would have taken instead. I did feel that the work was rewarding and enlightening, so the class was certainly not a waste of time.",
    "Yes I recommend the class. I think it's necessary for all physics graduates to get a grasp of advanced classical mechanics as, for once, it provides seller insight into modern physics theories.",
    "It's a good foundational course but not necessarily relevant to future research."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Certainly deepened my knowledge of classical mechanics. Does not, unfortunately, contribute to my research.",
    "I intend to be an experimentalist, and thus the course had pretty much no relevance to any work I will do during the rest of my time here. As I have already passed the classical mechanics portion of the qual, it did not affect my preparedness for any departmental requirements. Certain parts of the course deepened my understanding of the connections between quantum and classical physics, others did not.",
    "This course is largely irrelevant to my research, but parts of it were interesting and useful for understanding the history of physics and the development of quantum mechanics.",
    "I don't know that this course contributed to my dissertation\/research. However, one thing it definitely did do was help me to understand some things that were grazed over in quantum and math methods. For example, when we talked about change of basis in math methods, the professor gave the example of kinetic and potential energies. He mentioned that the KE mass tensor could be diagonalized to 1 by an orthog change of basis. Had no idea why this was true until Yoram went through the derivation. This has happened various other times too. This course was most useful for its unifying properties, not the actual material.",
    "I haven't seen the direct effect of this course yet, but I am sure it would serve me well in the years to come.",
    "This being the first graduate mechanics course for me. Though I am on an experimental physics track, pretty much everything I learned helped me build a better understanding of foundations of theoretical physics, as well the connection to quantum mechanics.",
    "I appreciated seeing some of the generalizations of Newton's laws like the Hamiltonian formulation. I can't anticipate whether it will be directly useful to me, but I'm glad I know it."
