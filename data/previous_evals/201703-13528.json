    "I gained a wide variety of new perspectives on topics related to sedentary societies, both contemporary and historical issues.",
    "A history -- both broad and specific -- of the development of agrarian societies, and the development of an intellectual focus around agrarian societies.",
    "Skills: none. Knowledge: lots.",
    "I learned a lot about agrarian societies, that's for sure. Tons of discussion, too!",
    "I learnt a lot about history and contemporary politics around agriculture and how it is tied with different modes of governance, capital, market and ideas of development. The course offered a lot of insights to pursue further research in the fields of agrarian studies, development studies, environmental anthropology and political economy. The close reading of the assignments by the instructors and the long discussion sessions in the class were of immense help.",
    "I got to know more about agrarian societies and anthropological and historical approaches to it. Now I am familiar with some important works in this field.",
    "Among others, the most important ones are the ecological approach to and environmental prospectives in historical studies.",
    "Insights on humans management of nature and indigenous population over a very long historical span"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It was great to have multiple perspectives from lectures and discussions via the three professors. However, some bridges between material would have been useful both in better understanding the course material as a whole and in helping students develop strong paper topics by midterm and thereafter. One weakness was that I did not receive any feedback on reading\/discussion response papers during the course of the semester; even a little feedback would have been helpful to gauge whether or not I was actually grasping the material and interacting with it in a meaningful way.",
    "More opportunity for writing feedback from both professors and fellow students.",
    "Strengths: strong syllabus, interesting readings, having three different professors and guest speakers. Diversity of the class was also good, having so many people across different disciplines and in different departments\/schools added a lot to discussion. Weaknesses: The main one is that this class absolutely should not be four hours long. The content is so interesting and important, and hammering it for four hours actually does it a disservice because people's brains are fried. It would be better to break the course up into smaller chunks, even two hours twice a week. I also wish discussions were a bit more driven, or had stronger leading questions to jumpstart discourse. I like the idea of a students leading discussions, but many times students would just read a long dense speech they had prepared on the readings, not leaving the group with any problems or questions to debate. It often felt like people were just talking to fill airtime.",
    "This course is excellent in providing an introduction to agrarian issues from an interdisciplinary perspective.",
    "sometimes old guys like to ramble and bramble",
    "strengths: well-prepared and clearly presented lectures, lively discussions, and interdiscplinary approaches weakness: I feel a little bit lost by the sheer diversity of the topics in agrarian societies. Perhaps better to present main threads of debate in this field at the beginning of this course so that the readings in the following classes are better organized together",
    "Strong teaching crew and good reading list. I would be better if we can meet twice a week instead of once per week."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It's a rare opportunity to have three excellent professors in the room together once a week and be able to share ideas with them, rather than being simply lectured at. They were all willing to accommodate student perspectives in the classroom and happy to help us work through our paper topics.",
    "Absolutely. It's intense but totally worth it.",
    "Mixed feelings on this class...but it's what you make of it. Readings are really fascinating. Discussion often fell flat or went nowhere, which was disappointing, but my biggest takeaway from the course was probably ideas from info in the readings. Also be warned that a four-hour seminar is...long. Like, really long.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially anyone interested in learning more about agrarian issues.",
    "oh it's such a blast!",
    "Most definitely. The fact that it's being taught by three top experts in the field of agrarian studies, environmental history and political anthropology adds immense value to the course.",
    "indispensable to those who hope to study agrarian societies",
    "Only if the person has strong interest in anthropology or sociology."
