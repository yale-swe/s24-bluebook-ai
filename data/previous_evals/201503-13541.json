    "I think the course load was a little too heavy for this class. In grad school, one expects to be able to let some classes \"sit on the back burner\" a bit one week to focus on others, and vice versa. However, almost every week I had to focus on this class in some respect from October onward. Readings weren't spaced out well (sometimes readings were really heavy for a class, other times very sparse). I don't think that there should be as many midterms, or if there are still midterms in the future, I would make the final noncumulative. A cumulative final AND a 15 page paper is a lot for one class, in addition to heavy readings and two midterms.",
