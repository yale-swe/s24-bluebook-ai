   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course - the syllabus is amazing and the workload is very manageable.",
    "This class covered a great variety of texts from Plato's Republic to contemporary science fiction, and Professor Rogers' ability to draw a continuous thread throughout the many works was impressive and made the class incredibly interesting. Take it if it is offered again!",
    "Take this class, wonderful english seminar requirement. Two papers and guest speakers, wonderful engagement with critical texts.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! If you have the opportunity, take it, take it, take it!!!! Make the time to do the reading carefully; you will get so much more out of the class. The best thing about ENGL 414 is getting to see the arc of \"utopia\" over the course of the semester, so keeping up with the texts is a must. Enjoy the papers, and be sure to take some risks!",
    "You read the literary canon of utopia. Starting with Plato's Republic and More's Utopia all the way to Zamyatin's We (i.e. the book that Orwell and Huxley \"borrowed\" their material from) and Chang-Rae Lee's On Such a Full Sea (a contemporary novel, which was also a great read). There's an approximately 7 page midterm paper and a 20 page final paper. For the most part, you read a book a week, but most of the books are quick reads. If you can get in, you absolutely have to take this class. Every week, I looked forward to seminar and the readings!",
    "This was a great course! Each week we read a different Utopian text, beginning with The Republic and advancing chronologically. Professor Rogers sometimes assigned secondary sources, which were not terribly long and were very good (or at least illuminating). Professor Rogers was an excellent seminar leader. He began each class with a brief, lecture-style introduction to that week's text. Discussion topics were mostly student-chosen, but he directed class conversation to certain topics every week to ensure we covered the important aspects of each text. He often prompted individuals to expand their thoughts and gave constructive intellectual feedback during and outside of class. The course included three guest lecturers, each of which sat in on class, gave a lecture, and attended a reception and a dinner at the Whitney Humanities Center. Students were required to attend all of these events, which were very interesting but extremely time consuming.",
    "Absolutely take this class; I can't say enough positive things. The seminar format is perfect for this kind of subject matter and Professor Rogers is one of the best instructors I've had. The two-hour class time is enough to really delve into the weekly material, which is often upwards of a novel a week (but totally worth the investment). For a first-time class this floored me; it was really fluid and dynamic and Rogers is a seasoned pro at fielding a discussion. The two hours always sailed by, and you'll wind up reading some \/incredible\/ stuff. The two papers are manageable, with the midterm one being a blessedly short 5-7 page length. Be warned, though: the final paper is 18-20 pages, and Rogers asks that all students meet that requirement, even if you're not a senior English major (I wasn't). But again, I can't stress enough how great Utopia is. Plus, the fact that this was a sponsored Franke seminar meant that we got to meet some really amazing guests, including novelist Chang Rae Lee, whose novel On Such A Full Sea was on our syllabus! A great experience, and unquestionably one of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "A fantastic investigation of an intriguing field of literature. The readings never fail to fascinate because it seems every famous utopia is riddled with political, economic, sexual, cultural, and spiritual madness. Untangling the influences and intentions of the genre makes for a lively discussion, and Professor Rogers is one of the best seminar leaders I have worked with at Yale. If it is offered as a Franke lecture again, then definitely take it: the guests brought in for the lecture and dinner series were wonderful."
