    "The resources for this class were pretty good, but I think there was an issue with not being able to access the source material for our paper online. With the library's policies on borrowing books and the hours - especially given our studio schedules - I think a part of that assignment was harder than it had to be, taking time away from actually completing the assignment. I ended up buying the books to complete that assignment, and I did appreciate having more material than just the assigned reading, but I don't think that I derived any special benefit from having the book paperback compared to if I had a scanned copy online.",
    "Resources were great.",
    "yes",
    "Most resources were available, except that the policy of one book for one day at the arts library makes any research difficult.",
    "The resources were adequate.",
