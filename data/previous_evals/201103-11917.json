   "comments": [
    "Take it. You will learn so much,!",
    "Fantastic senior econ seminar. Take it if you are at all interested in health or development issues. Will change the way you think about the world.",
    "I don't think I would recommend this class unless some revisions to it were made by Professor Nattrass. I think there could have been less reading and, more importantly, fewer readings that were 200 pages of fluffy recommendations that didn't end up really saying anything by different commissions. I came out of this class feeling as though I had read some things that were completely obvious, and, in all honesty, I don't feel like I learned that much. The big paper for this class involved using a very complicated AIDS spending model online. Nobody really knew how to use it and everyone just ended up making a lot of assumptions (although we did all get to research an African country and its health\/AIDS policies, which was interesting). I also think that the seminar should be capped (so if there are 25 other people taking this class as happened with me, I wouldn't take it). However, it has a lot of potential and is definitely an interesting subject.",
    "This course did not meet my expectations as to developing a better understanding of health inequality in the developing world and how policy change has been approached in the past 50 years. I would suggest looking at other courses offered by the Jackson Institute that have a more focused perspective.",
    "This class goes through the complex relationship between health and economic development, attempting to tease out the causal effects in both directions. It looks at questions such as how does the AIDS epidemic affect sub saharan African economic growth, the effectiveness of foreign assistance, the role of economic growth in basic public health improvements, and how to measure and evaluate development interventions.",
    "This is a pretty interesting course that effectively ties together Health, Inequality, and Development literature. I learned a lot. There is a ton of reading. I didn't always finish, but it was one of the classes where I wish I had.",
    "I enjoyed this class a lot. The readings are interesting, though one downside is that there is not a clear direction to the course, and you just learn a lot about various aspects of the topic each week. That said, I learned a lot. Professor Nattrass is engaging and passionate.",
    "This is a class that requires attention to the reading and strong analytical skills for the responses. I would definitely suggest you take it as your required senior seminar. I loved it. Possibly the most enjoyable and stress free econ class I have taken at Yale."
