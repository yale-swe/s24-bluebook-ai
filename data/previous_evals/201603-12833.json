    "Strengths: Welcoming seminar atmosphere Discussion style",
    "I thought the biggest strength of this class were the transcription projects, which gave us a very hands-on experience at understanding how and why certain ethnomusicological decisions were made. The course was structured as a historical survey of the emergence and coalescence (roughly speaking) of the discipline. While this was interested and illuminating, I think I would have preferred more of a focus on the current landscape of ethnomusicology rather than the disciplinary history. The in-class discussions certainly engaged me on the intellectual and academic issues of each period and how they shape the current field, but as a non-ethnomusicologist, I would have liked to come away with more familiarity with the current trends, issues, and problematics of the field. The decision to have each reading presented by a student was, overall, a positive one, I think. I think more easily facilitated conversation that engaged with the underlying issues, but the quality of conversation varied greatly depending on the quality of the student presentation. This also resulted in us frequently having more readings to discussed than time permitted. While this is not the worst thing, the snowballing of delayed discussions led to us losing several weeks of class, which led to the dropping of more recent scholarship that I wanted more of.",
    "Strengths: the syllabus contained many important texts for students to understand the development of ethnomusicology as a field. The assignments also helped us hone in on the major 'trends' pre-WW II and post-WWII. I also appreciated the transcription assignments because they got me to really grapple with the challenges of representing 'non-Western' musics. Weaknesses: I wish we would have gotten to the postcolonial readings a week earlier so that we could start thinking about our final papers earlier. I also wish that there had been more time and maybe one additional reading about feminist and gender studies in ethnomusicology. That being said, I really appreciated the inclusion of readings by Spivak, Said and Fanon to show how larger political and academic shifts influenced ethnomusicology.",
    "If the readings were arranged in chronological order, it would help to situate them in the broader context. But I understand that it was important to organize them by topics. I wish feedback was given in a more timely manner.",
    "The course was well thought out and organized. The two trends essays are strange for graduate students in that they demonstrate learning rather than offer research opportunities, but they're effective in forcing us to solidify our synthesis of the information. The readings are good. Perhaps less time could have been spent on early trends. I liked the discussant system. The workload of the course is somewhat heavy, and in this particular term the extremely compressed time frame of the final essay presented an obstacle to solid research. In the syllabus, the workload is spread out quite well, but in practice our delays in class meant that a lot of work was pushed to the end of term. This could be fixed by simply sticking to the schedule."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if that student is interested in the history of ethnomusicology.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it goes through the formation of the field of ethnomusicology and in so doing has students confront the colonial legacy in comparative musicology and anthropology. Although this is not always easy, it is important for music scholars to understand the problematics of engaging across cultures, especially in light of unequal power dynamics."
