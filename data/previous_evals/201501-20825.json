   "comments": [
    "This course gives very good overview of topics in the major of computational biology and bioinformatics",
    "The course gives a broad overview of the tools and uses of bioinformatics. I would recommend it to a student without programming experience who wanted a general introduction to the field.",
    "I would summarize MCDB 752 as a computational biology course where your grade won't depend on having to learn programming. It is cool that this course brings together students with really diverse backgrounds, but if you're someone with little knowledge of bioinformatics coming in, be prepared to push your comfort zone and to get out of it as much as you can. Even if you triple your time investment, you're not going to understand 50% of it. But that's OK, because gaining exposure to this stuff is important for modern biological research.",
    "A decent general introduction to Bioinformatics \/ Computational Biology methods and mostly the concepts and not the technical details. So you won't learn how to use any of these methods but will learn some of the underlying principles. Low workload. A few quizzes and homework assignments. Have to read a few easy papers a week. Final project is longer but can be done over two days.",
    "Best way to learn the variety of different topics in computational biology",
    "Yes, I would. It is helpful if you are interested in bioinformatics, especially data mining and simulation part.",
    "Would recommend it, although do not feel confident that I can use techniques independently with real data"

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, Helped me improve my coding skill in perl\/python.",
    "I may use some of the genomics or immune simulation material from the course during my thesis research. The course also gave me a better sense of the ways bioinformatics can be used in research.",
    "Several individual components of the syllabus\/assignments are going to be really helpful going forward. For the final project, for instance, we used Galaxy which is an online tool for do-it-yourself analysis of high-throughput sequencing data (no programming required). So that was really cool to explore. In general, I gained a much more detailed understanding of next-gen sequencing. The lectures on genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics were really helpful. As for the computational modeling section, I feel like now I know what math skills I need to refresh if I did want to learn how to incorporate modeling into my research. I found the information on machine learning to be very helpful - I am actually considering building an automated image classification tool to help me analyze data from a specific type of staining experiment carried out frequently in my lab.",
    "Added some missing general knowledge to my understanding of Bioinformatics. Did not add much in terms of technical skills. Not particularly useful to my research.",
    "Having hands-on experience on data mining and simulation, especially Dr. Kleinstein's lectures, help me a lot.",
    "I hope to be able to use some of these techniques in my reasearch"
