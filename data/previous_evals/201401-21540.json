    "The work wasn't too bad. If you do you're readings and speak in class you'll be fine.",
    "Solid seminar that covers topics about the Court and provides exposure to quantitative methods. A contrast to ConLaw.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the subject matter and\/or the politics of legal decision-making. Not a course in Con Law but having taken Con Law is useful because many of the same Political Science issues that came up in Con Law are relevant here as well. If you're someone who's a devoted SCOTUSblog follower, this is the course for you.",
    "I'm glad I took it, but I would make sure you know what your goal is before you take it. I wanted to learn more about applying quantitative methods to real political work and to get a better understanding about the way the Court operates. If you can get on board with that, it's a lot of fun. You have to do the reading every week, but other than that it's not a lot of work. Prof Rader is super nice. Downside is you might spend a lot of classes questioning why the material is important and if it even reveals anything, but it's a well structured class that helps you think through issues."
