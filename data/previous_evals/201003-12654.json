   "comments": [
    "Amazing! Take this class if you have a chance. You'll work hard, but you'll be proud of how you grow as a thinker and writer.",
    "This is the best course I have taken at Yale. I looked forward to class and screenings, the reading was phenomenal, and I loved my final project. Discussions were outrageously lively most of the time. The weekly papers could get a little annoying, but were always an interesting experience. Nemerov demands something very unique from his students.",
    "This course was absolutely fantastic. If you are at all interested in art, film, culture, or American history, it's a must-take. Nemerov is amazing - sensitive, brilliant, and (incredibly) passionate about the material. Prepare to take a personal and emotional interest in the subject matter -- Nemerov expects you to. Work: 2h seminar a week, ~2h film screening per week, 2-3 page response due each week, and a final paper 10-15 pages.",
    "Yes, please take it.A really amazing seminar.I can't really put into words how much I learned.It sounds really corny, but I really learned how to see and understand history in a whole new way. What really made the class was definitely the professor and the equally awesome students in the class.",
    "Do it to it?",
    "TAKE this class! It is the best class that I have taken at Yale. The people in my class were absolutely wonderful, and the opportunity to have weekly discussions with them, and Professor Nemerov was fantastic. The class is quite a bit of work but it is manageable and you will WANT to do it!",
    "Possibly the best course I've taken at Yale. A cross-medium study of early 1940's America, during and immediately following WWII. Looked at largely through the lens of film, but incorporating paintings and extensive readings as well. The goal is not so much historical or art historical as it is about coming into touch with the emotion ethos of the time and understanding, or trying to understand, what life was really like on a personal level. An absolutely spectacular class. Nemerov is a phenomenal seminar leader - if you've had him in other classes, you know his poetic style of speaking and teaching, and learning from him in a small group setting is in no way disappointing. You will come out of this class with an entirely different perspective of what scholarship can and should be.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course to someone else, if they were interested in movies and in learning about the realities of World War II America through them. Also, if they were game to explore a lot of personal reactions to these movies as a gateway to the realities of the past. It's a class that involves watching movies and doing a lot of reading from the home front during World War II, and then coming up with various insights and reactions during long discussion. I really loved it. Taking a seminar with Professor Nemerov is something everyone should do, if they can.",
    "This course is an analysis of how WWII seeps into American film during the period of '41-'45, and how we can both be impacted by these films as well as inform the received history by studying them. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Definitely take it if you can get it in. It was the best course I have ever taken.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student that is appreciative of art history. It is a great course for those who really enjoy drawing meaning from a work that many would find far-fetched. If you are not in to this kind of thing, you will probably be frustrated by the class. This course is very poetic and sentimental (but not romantic--it doesn't attempt to gloss over history) and for those who like writing and discussing things in that way this is an excellent course for you.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. If you like films, studying war, or American culture you HAVE to take it. The weekly film responses aren't tedious like most reading responses are in other seminars. You won't regret taking this course.",
    "This is class is about learning to peer into the darker depths of time period and a culture's soul through the movies of that generation. It will change the way you examine art for the better and more critical, while still respecting your emotional reaction to it."
