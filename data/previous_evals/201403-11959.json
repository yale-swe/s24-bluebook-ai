   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as an interesting Spanish class that's worth taking because although it may sound unappealing to someone who's not thinking of going down a path to a legal career, it shows how the legal system works without completely overwhelming you. It's a great introduction class and worth the time. I would definitely recommend it because you can apply the knowledge you gain to news happening around the world and the way the professor teaches it makes it much more interesting than it sounds it would be.",
    "SPAN 222 is an all-encompassing legal class, with introductions into many legal topics, taught in Spanish. This class has a perfect balance between teaching, discussion and extra materials and resources like videos.",
    "Great Spanish class, and on the easier side of the grading scale. Two one-page papers every single week, no exams, and a final 10-page paper. The class is labeled as L5, but there are clearly many many students who are not up to that level. So if you don't understand the professor, you're not in the minority. Every class you go over a different legal topic, and it can get a little bit dry. Overall, not too difficult class. Take it if you need the A or the Spanish credit. Before you try getting in - it's a seminar, but she accepts 20-25 students. Enrollment, as she will mention on the first day of shopping period, is limited to juniors, seniors, and her former students. Anyone else is not allowed, UNLESS you email her a few weeks before stating you really want to take the class and cannot because you're a freshman or sophomore. If you do this and she gives you permission, you're much more likely to get in than just showing up first day, where you're sure to be rejected if you don't fit into any of the aforementioned three categories of students she admits.",
    "take it! learn lots!",
    "The class is a great way to learn about law, and increase your spanish vocabulary. The writing assignments can take some time, but they really help to enforce the information that you learn in class.",
    "I would definitely recommend.",
    "I would say it is a great class to keep your spanish skills up if you're interested in learning more about international law and haven't yet taken a class with Mercedes. Totally recommend it.",
    "If you can get in, and want a chill Spanish class that will help you learn about international law, this is the class for you. Mercedes is so, so cool, and I actually enjoyed getting up early to go to her class. If you're interested in law at all, you'll find the concepts interesting, and the daily assignments are short but effective in improving your spanish writing, especially if you're a bit rusty (like I was). Overall, absolutely recommend.",
    "Take this course if you can get in",
    "I wouldnt recommend this class to anyone who is seriously attempting to improve their spanish",
    "Would recommend for lower-level L5 student. Writing assignment for each class. Final essay about a topic you choose. Class discussion and debate. Many videos and tv shows that were not very instructive. But the course book was very instructive.",
    "A nice walk through of different types of laws, legal systems, and their applications.",
    "It's a good class. Take it!",
    "Learn how to talk about legal issues in Spanish. It's not super practical for talking with people day-to-day.",
    "Great course! You will learn a lot about the legal system of Spanish speaking countries and even of the United States itself. The professor is funny and loves her job."
