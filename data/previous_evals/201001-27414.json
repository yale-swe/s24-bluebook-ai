   "comments": [
    "Gives you a good knowledge of latin american literature, generally.It's not too difficult, but that of course depends on your facility with the language.",
    "I didn't enjoy the class as much as I thought I would. I expected to critically analyze major works of Latin American Lit and I don't feel like I got much of a chance to do that. I would have liked to be able to come out of the course being able to discuss important authors and their famous works.",
    "If you want a class that teaches you a lot about literature, this is the one. If you want to practice your Spanish, this is not the one. It's mainly a lecture, so you rarely get to speak Spanish. However, the readings (most of them anyway) were really interesting, and the tests were manageable if you learned paid attention in class.",
    "A great survey course in Latin American literature. Professor Adorno is really engaging and enables you to see the texts in ways you wouldn't have initially. Workload is moderate reading for each class, a long with 3 partial exams and a final written paper.",
    "Pretty nice course. Gives a nice sampling of genre and authors in Latin American literature. I especially liked it as an intro to poetry. It is interesting but sometimes the themes seemed a little simplistic, but thatmight more have been the nature of an introductory course. One downside- you almost never actually speak Spanish (since it is a lecture). If you want to get better at speaking, take Grammar which meets three times a week and makes you drill and practice in class all the time.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It covers a lot of the great Spanish authors and gets to the core of their writing. Grading is very fair and everyone I knew did well in the class. Three exams and 1 final comparative paper that's 8-10 pages.",
    "This is a great course if you are looking for a survey of Latin American Literature. You will experience 4 genres: the essay, the poem, the short story, and the novel. The reading assignments are very fair in length. You will really enjoy this class, especially if you can get Professor Adorno. She is an excellent professor.",
    "I would recommend it. It requires enough reading but not too much, an hour or so before each class so that the student does not get too burned out. Professor Adorno does a great job picking the gems of Latin American lit for study.",
    "A fine overview.",
    "No, not unless you need it for the major.",
    "I don't think this class really works as a lecture. It was fairly boring all the time.",
    "I'd reccomend it; it's so beautiful! I did a lot of work for it because I love the subject matter, but I imagine it's as intensive as you make it to be.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone interested primarily in literature, not in actually speaking Spanish. Your Spanish writing and analysis will improve, but you will actually speak very little Spanish in class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course (especially if taught by Professor Adorno) to any student wanting to deepen their understanding of not just Latin American lit, but literature in general. Between the different writing styles, you learn a lot about finding the deeper meaning in writing.",
    "If you're looking for a course for which you don't have to read a lot, take grammar or conversational Spanish. Still, the readings for this class are absolutely manageable.I would recommend it for sure.",
    "This is a great class if you're looking for an introduction to Latin American literature. It's a survey class and as such, almost always moves too quickly for your comfort. But Adorno is so knowledgeable and understanding, and you'll leave the course feeling as though you learned something important (maybe even if you didn't).",
    "Do not take this class thinking that it is a discussion class in which you will practice your spanish. Instead, it is a lecture on Spanish literature (which you do need your Spanish to read). While the choice of texts is excellent, make sure you know what you are getting into in terms of learning some literature processes, but not much Spanish.",
    "A sweeping survey of latin american literature.",
    "An interesting survey of a cross-section of Latin American literature. Take it.",
    "It's a pretty solid survey course on Latin American literature, and if you want to brush up on your Spanish and take a literature-focused course, this is a pretty good option."
