    "This is an excellent course for anyone who loves books. You will learn to use the printing presses in Yale.",
    "I can honestly say that this was the best course I took at Yale this semester. Professor Rose is a wonderful teacher whose love of books is infectious and the group of students who self-selected to be part of the class were all so talented and interesting. The projects were always a large time commitment, but one that I was more than happy to make given how enjoyable and rewarding the work was. I would recommend this course to anyone would would enjoy going on a field trip to a bookstore, spending their thanksgiving break shopping for paper and carving linoleum blocks, jamming out to holiday music in the press room at midnight, holding books from the 1400s, becoming tight with a group of 10 artistic and brilliant classmates, and learning a lot about printing and typography.",
    "Lots of work, but of a different nature than the papers or psets you would otherwise be writing; it's nice to have to take time to do something with your hands. Expect to put a lot of time into this class, but an incredible class: when else are you going to learn how to operate a printing press (and handle medieval manuscripts, and use centuries-old lead type, and...)? This class really made me appreciate the amount of work, both physical and intellectual, that goes into handprinting. Tclass requires a very significant investment of time (for a conservative estimate, most people spent 10-15 hours in the press outside of class for the broadside and upwards of 20 on the book project). But it was worth it.",
    "I would recommend this class if you truly enjoy printmaking, design, and typography. The workload is definitely manageable, and truly you can choose how complicated or how simple your work is. Of course, the class expects excellence, but not perfection. The resources and material I learned in this class is unparalleled. Also, our class got very close since we worked together for hours, so the social aspect was great too. Professor Rose is great, and he will help you in whatever way you need. That being said, if you are not dedicated to this topic or hands-on activity, this course might not benefit you like another one could. I highly encourage everyone to shop the class - truly an inimitable Yale experience.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, though I would advise that any student knows going in that this course may take more time than you think. Also, it is important to realize that this course is very creatively based and if you don't like to get your hands dirty, this is perhaps not the right course for you.",
    "Amazing course for anyone interested in books, design, or the history of hand printing. Would recommend for any freshman to try out. After taking the course, it has an added benefit of qualifying one to use the printing presses at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student! It's honestly a really random subject and operating a printing press is not necessarily a 'useful' skill, but it was such a fun and interesting course. I feel like I learned a lot more than just how to use the press, but gained a lot of composition and design skills as well. Professor Rose is also the greatest, he is immensely knowledgeable and so helpful and caring."
