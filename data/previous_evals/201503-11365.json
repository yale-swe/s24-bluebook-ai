    "I'd recommend. Aristotle sucks, but the rest is fun.",
    "The majority of the fall syllabus is consumed with Plato and Aristotle. After that, you explore the major Christian philosophers, as well as some Arabic ones. Take it if you like the reading and don't want to be significantly involved with extracurriculars. Or, take it if you like the reading and want to be involved in extracurriculars at the cost of never being fully satisfied with the amount of sleep you get. Personally, I would still take the course, but it's a really personal decision.",
    "DS Philosophy will cover material you most likely have not been exposed to before; for most students I believe it is an acquired taste, especially regarding how much philosphy papers differ from other subjects within DS. For both of these reasons, I would recommend DS Phil, although it will be the hardest to connect to modernity, at least right away.",
    "No, probably not. This class is the reason I am wavering on my commitment to DS. It was too unwelcoming, quick and difficult. I put in a lot of work and got nothing out.",
    "DS Philosophy is a great way to learn about ancient philosophers and get a decent grasp on Plato and Aristotle. Lectures will be hit or miss, and discussion will occasionally be a drag, but overall, it is a worthwhile experience.",
    "Good intro to philosophy",
    "A survey of the great ancient philosophical texts, with emphasis on Aristotle and Plato. Great course, absolutely take it. If you like philosophy it will make you love it, if you don't like philosophy it will teach you to like it."
