    "This class will not teach you how to write a play. However, you will have written a play by the end of the semester. From the 3 creative writing classes I've taken, I've learned that creative writing is something one must do on one's own. These classes just serve as a workshop for you to come and share your work with other writers and to also hear there's. So, if you find it impossible to self motivate yourself to write anything longer than a boring 10 page research paper and need to have a classroom structure to get shit done, then take this class.",
    "It's a wonderful course for someone who actually wants to write a play. There isn't really a way to cut corners. You will by the end of the course write a play. With the support of classmates and especially the indescribable Deb, it is a therapeutic adventure in playwriting.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Deb is amazing. She creates a class environment that is the perfect combination of supportive and challenging. I always looked forward to going to class. You have to write a whole play, so it's definitely a lot of work. But it's so worth it. One of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would highly, highly recommend this class. It will help you so much as a writer, even if you've never written a play before. It is revelatory; it will teach you the things that you've always wanted to say but never articulated before. It opens you up to all the creative inspiration in the world around us all the time. And you really should write every single day. Deb will tell you this over and over again, but it's so true.You will write a working draft of a complete play in one semester. Deb will give open-ended creative assignments, and as a class you will collectively construct a syllabus of important plays to read each week. Towards the end of the semester, you will spend most of class reading each others' scenes aloud. Take it! It will be amazing!",
    "Take this course with Margoin if you have any interest in writing a play. She takes you through the process with love and compassion, inspiring you to execute your best expression of the human condition through theater.",
    "A collaborative group of writers who push you along with positive reinforcement as opposed to pointless criticism. I would recommend the class because it can be meaningful therapy even for students not focused on creative writing.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in exploring the world of playwriting. Everyone is a playwright, and even if you're hesitant about the notion of writing an entire play, this is definitely the place to try it. Whether you have experience or none whatsoever, you will learn an enormous amount in this class and will grow as a theatre-maker, playwright and person. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys being introspective and exploring characters.",
    "The one assignment in this class is to write a play. Don't be fooled; that is no easy task. There aren't collected, weekly assignments, so the only person you're accountable to is yourself."
