    "This course should be required for every Divinity school student because it gives the requisite background for understanding what is going on in contemporary theology.",
    "I have and will continue to recommend this course to other students. I also recommend that other students take the course with Prof. Craigo-Snell. She's part of the reason why I recommend taking the course. She makes an already interesting area even more appealing because of her effective teaching style.If a student wants to learn how Christian thought has progressed over the years, this is definitely the course to take.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Very fun, a manageable amount of reading, and covers material that is value for anyone living in the modern western world."
