   "comments": [
    "Professor Smith was great at leading discussion and highlighting a variety of important MH topics. Despite our large class (biggest weakness) we had opportunities to do small group discussions and do individual presentations. To improve the course I would do the presentations at the beginning of class so that there is always time for the panel discussion (several times the discussion portion was pushed to the following week). If enrollment is so high again the class should be split or the 'class participation' expectation must be adjusted because it was difficult to try to contribute with 30 other students in the class. Slides should be posted ahead of time so that we can print them since we can't use laptops in class. The way the room is shaped the bottom 1\/3 of the screen is not visible. Some of the readings were interesting but some weeks the amount of reading was just waaay too much and too technical.",
    "One of my favorite classes so far! I learned so much and I never wanted class to be over. The 2 ours flew by even though it was in the 1-3pm time slot which usually means Im not even really conscious for class. Amazing information, well put together, and meaningful assignments that were not too long.",
    "Goooooooooooooooooooooood! Just too many reading summaries to do and consumes a lot of time, hope could cancel this.",
    "Amazing course; I was engaged during every class, and I always looked forward to the class every day. Honestly, it was one of the highlights of my semester and one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "weakness - i realized i dont like survey courses strength - great professor",
    "Fantastic - by far the best course I've taken so far. The only qualm I had was that it was too big for a good discussion.",
    "This was actually one of my favorite courses this semester! I learned a lot of different topics regarding mental health and was able to really grasp the complexity and issues of mental health for vulnerable populations. The workload is moderate; there are about 4-6 readings per week and you write a response paper about interesting points you found in those readings. There are a few other assignments, presentation, and final paper but the workload is totally doable and enjoyable.",
    "I enjoyed the class, but I wish we had more of a chance to discuss within class.",
    "Strengths: lots of topics are covered; focus on developing a holistic understanding of mental health and its relationship with public health as opposed to memorizing trivial details and then being tested on them Weaknesses: I think that the structure of the actual lectures can be improved. Typically, we would have 45 minutes to 1 hour of lecture by Prof. Smith, followed by panel presentations. Some lectures also involved group assignments. I think there was too much going on in the lectures and that if the course was spread across 2.5-3 hours, that it would work out better. Simply put, there's too much going on for such limited time.",
    "I thought this was a good introduction to the field of mental health. Each week we focused on a different illness or area of mental health and had panel-style student presentations. I wasn't a huge fan of how much time was spent on the panel and I thought they weren't that instructive. I did think the papers that we did for the class were very useful and applicable.",
    "The class was great, but it was too large. 30% of our grade was based on participation, yet with over 30 students in the class, it was difficult to get even 1 chance to speak each class. I think the discussion style is great and well suited for this course, but it needs to be capped at 20-25 people.",
    "covers very relevant topics; thorough but not intimidating;made difficult material very approachable and personal",
    "The instructor attempted to cover too much material and I never understood the point of the weekly reading assignments. The instructor should have given us reading material on the vocabulary she spends about 20 to 30 minutes covering in class and then spend more time talking about the case studies. It's also overwhelming to receive that much information for over two hours. It might be better to meet twice a week. I liked the student presentations. It was a challenge to reduce my presentation to 5 minutes but it forced me to truly understand the material and to weed out the noise. This skill has also served me for other classes and job interviews. I also think we should have been evaluated on the vocabulary and central concepts through an in-class test. In the last class there was a slide with the central concepts and key vocabulary terms... this was a perfect template for a test.",
    "I loved that the classroom time was split between lectures, student and outside presentations,, and small group discussions. I would suggest a better format for the weekly reading summaries or slightly fewer readings\/week.",
    "This class is excellent. Everyone should be required to take this class. It brings together principles of epidemiology and social factors impacting health. I loved the class and am sad that I'm not able to take this class a second time.",
    "The course was great!",
    "There is few emphasis on how culture might influence the expression of mental illnesses. However, Professor Smith did great job explaining concepts.",
    "The class is great. You learn a lot about the topic and the professor is really knowledgable and delivers material well. The class discussions are always good. However we had to do class presentations which were informative but often it as unable to finish the agenda for the class.",
    "I learned so much from the class. I love the subject matter, the assignments and the dynamic that Prof. Smith creates in class. I think Professor Smith is an excellent professor and able to draw connections between what we are studying and larger themes in public health. However, I felt like there were several issues with the way it was structured. The class was at its best when Prof Smith was lecturing and facilitating conversation. If often felt like Professor Smith was rushing through the material she prepared for class in order to get to the student presentations. I learned a lot from creating my presentation but I really didn't get as much out of my classmates', even though most were excellent. Not enough direct connections were made between the readings\/lectures and the presentations. Perhaps the the class was too big. I would suggest scheduling a couple symposiums outside where students present their presentations. This way everyone could have the experience of presenting but it wouldn't cut into the limited time we have to learn from Professor Smith. One other thing: It would have been helpful if Professor Smith had scheduled office hours rather than \"by appointment.\" She was responsive to emails but I didn't end up setting up a time to meet with her about assignments because I felt like I would be bothering her. My lack of communication is not her fault, but if it is feasible, I think students would feel more comfortable reaching out if she had scheduled office hours. The TAs were helpful, but there were times when I specifically wanted to discuss issues with Prof. Smith.",
    "It's a really good class that covers so many different aspects of mental health, a truly important but underlooked aspect of health.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I learned a lot about how disparities in mental health arise and the theory behind disparities in general. I think the assigned readings provided a good foundation and background for the discussions we had in class, and the papers we had to write allowed us to integrate and expand on concepts we learned in class. I also thought the topics were interesting, although I would have preferred to spend more time discussing issues in adolescent mental health. I believe we used that class to talk more about addiction and suicide, which are also important, so maybe we could have used the migrant populations class to expand on adolescents. I also realize that the presentations take up a large amount of time and we didn't have a lot of extra time for discussion. So that as many people who want to can take the class, maybe people could be put into groups of two for the presentation who have similar topic interests, to cut down on time.",
    "AMAAAZING course, one of the best courses, a lot of learning, a lot of reading, a lot of assignments but a lot of fun. Mental health is close to my heart, and I learnt a lot that is applicable in daily life, in my profession, to my family. Great class. Amazing instructor",
    "The course was very well designed and very insightful for understanding mental health from a public health standpoint. One suggestion would be adding a discussion class separate from lecture. There wasn't enough time and opportunities to participate in discussions, which was a major component understanding of concepts and our grades.",
    "This was an excellent class. The class size was just small enough to create a comfortable environment that encouraged participation and the instructor was great."

    "Take this class if you are at all interested in mental health!! It gives an amazing perspective on mental illness in general and on a lot of specific ways that mental illness can play out.",
    "Take it. The only course that was consistently intellectually engaging.",
    "Must-take for those who have not been exposed to mental health issues before! It's a reasonable amount of work (tons of readings but they're all enjoyable); Megan and your classmates really make it a good learning experience.",
    "If you are at all interested in the intersection of mental health and public health, this course is for you!",
    "Best course I have taken thus far at YSPH",
    "I would recommend it but I would warn them of the course structure and information overload.",
    "You get a lot of this course, especially if you put a lot in. Incorporates so many dimensions including public health interventions for mental health, clinical considerations including barriers to mental health care, larger policy issues, and reflection in one's own experiences in the context of course readings. Highly recommend for all!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IT IS SOOOOO GOOD.",
    "very good!",
    "Take it if you're interested in the topic! It's worth it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student - I think the subjects covered are essential.",
    "I would recommend the class. It's important to be aware of how fortunate you are and how the unique statuses of other people make it difficult for them to have proper mental health statuses.",
    "This class covers the etiology and epidemiology of a multitude of mental disorders and difficulties, from depression to addiction to schizophrenia. The class focuses on the cultural and social factors that influence and modify these disorders, and provides a great knowledge base for the different ways in which health disparities arise. Dr. Smith is a very accessible professor and has organized the course very well. There are reading responses each week which are graded on completion, two short papers, a presentation and a final 8-page paper. The prompts for the papers were all very clear and the TAs and Dr. Smith were almost always available to meet if you had questions. The readings didn't take too much time (but don't start them an hour before the response is due) and were usually pretty interesting. The class is more on the lecture than discussion side, but Dr. Smith welcomed comments and questions throughout the class. I would definitely recommend this course, particularly for first year SBS students, as it will provide a great foundation for other classes.",
    "See answer 6",
    "I believe everyone should be required to take this course. It is critical to understand the mental health plays a roll in all areas of major public health issues.",
    "This course should be a requirement for all YSPH students because one cannot fully understand public health without a knowledge of mental wellbeing.",
    "Fantastic course that gives you a solid foundation on the factors that influence mental health - Professor Smith delves into specific and relevant subpopulations and mental illnesses in a really interesting way."
