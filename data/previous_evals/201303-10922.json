   "comments": [
    "I definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in literature (even if you have had little exposure to Japanese literature\/language). The readings, which include both prose and poetry, are enjoyable. The fact that the course makes frequent use of the resources at YUAG and Beinecke makes the material all the more interesting. Kamens will read rough drafts of your papers and meet with you to discuss them which is very helpful.",
    "Yes 100% if you have any interest in either literature or Japanese history\/culture . Incredible experience!",
    "Great introduction to Japanese literature, art and theater. The works covered in this class are connected to each other in many ways, and so by the end of the class I felt like I had a good understanding of how literary\/artistic tradition developed over many centuries . Not knowing Japanese was not a disadvantage for me in this class. Professor Kamens (and TA Riley Soles) gave me detailed feedback on my writing that inspired me to really care about the class; I started it credit\/d but changed because I ended up putting so much work into the papers. Overall, the class is not much work, and the reading load is quite light. Trips to the art gallery and the Beinecke are cool. not many universities have the resources to teach a class like this, it is an opportunity worth taking advantage of.",
    "This class does not have many assignments, but they are difficult and may be hard for freshman to complete. A very high level of writing is expected and the assignments are graded accordingly. I would recommend this only to upperclassmen, who have done some poetic analysis.",
    "It is a general overview of classical Japanese literature, of which Professor Kamens is probably one of the major scholars in America. I believe the course can be enjoyed both by those who have no or little exposure to Japanese culture and those who have taken some years of Japanese language. The workload is not too heavy, but the written assignments can be quite challenging, even if they are not particularly long - it is a writing course after all. I enjoyed being able to write papers on different topics, but it could be a little frustrating polishing our papers repeatedly until they fit the type of writing expected for the class. Kamens' approach is quite interesting, as he focuses on the intersections between visual materials and the texts we read, and the visits to the YUAG and Beinecke are very illuminating."
