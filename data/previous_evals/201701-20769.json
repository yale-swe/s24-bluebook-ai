    "I have better understanding of the italian language.",
    "This course was definitely more relaxed and useful than than the first term. It helped you hone the grammar and skills you acquired in the first half and spruce it up with some more tenses. Definitely invested more of my time this semester which helped a lot with keeping up with the heavy courseload.",
    "I learned how to speak and how to understand Italian much better than I could previously.",

   "comments": [
    "It was very repetitive and the class engagement consisted of all the fluent kids who should not have been in Italian 2, answering all the conversational questions because the rest of the students that were as comfortable with the language were too intimidated to speak.",
    "MY professor was too stubborn and concerned with what he thought of him personally to try to improve his teaching for the benefit of the class.",
    "The course has an interactive and cultural nature which I really like, however the overload on some very niche grammar and vocabulary is overwhelming and frisrating sometimes. Also not having a class test to drop put a lot more pressure on students. One thing that was so much better was the speaking\/oral requirement, the conversation with Luca was so much fun and it was also very unique to talk about an Italian painting in the Yale Art Gallary!",
    "I think that a strength of this course is that there is a lot of material within it and exposure to Italian culture, however, sometimes I felt that the pace of the class was so fast that I would be able to learn but not be able to retain all of the information that I was learning.",
    "The strength of this course was that it challenged me to go out of my comfort zone and speak Italian more. One weakness was that it was fast paced and the intensity level was a big jump for L1 to L2."

    "I would hands down recommend this course and the Italian language; however i would not by any means recommend this professor if you are taking Italian 2. If you are going into Italian 3,4, or 5, then this professor would be fine. This course was much harder and went way too fast for over half the class, i did not learn as much as i would've liked because of the fact i knew around 10% of what was going on in every class because i couldn't understand him talking.",
    "I would recommend the Italian program, yes. I would not reccomend my specific professor simply because his grading was too strict.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to any student interested in the Italian language and culture. It's so fast paced but you end up feeling much more competent and confident than last semester!",
    "I would recommend this course if you would like to be able to improve your Italian speaking, writing, and comprehension abilities.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course because of the valuable skills that come with learning a new language."
