    "If you are interested in getting a deeper feel of Japan, especially its culture, contemporary literature, society and history, here is a course for you. Not for those specifically interested in aspects such as politics or economy.",
    "Sign up for this class if you are at a very advanced level and want to push yourself to expand, at a large time cost. If you merely want to maintain your Japanese level, though, find some other means to do so.",
    "Similar to other upper level Japanese courses if you've taken those. Seto-sensei is probably more funny than the other teachers though. Workload is usually fine except for a few times when you have to read a selection and write a longer composition. Readings are usually enjoyable, and you read some pretty important Japanese authors (Murakami, Mishima). Overall, maybe not the most exciting course out there, but I consistently enjoyed coming to class so I would recommend.",
    "If you a moderately advanced student who wishes to learn more Japanese."
