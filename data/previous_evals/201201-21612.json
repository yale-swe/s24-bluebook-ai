    "Excellent gut course with very little work.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it was such a good overview of a few branches of physics. It was great to get in-depth in quantum mechanics and general relativity, neither of which I had seriously studied before. Professor Baltay does a great job of explaining tricky concepts and applications in ways that will stick in your memory.",
    "Take it if the stuff makes you love it. It will get tougher than 260 and be prepared to work very hard to get things clear. Also, the class will require you to study alone and do the work all by yourself which can get frustrating at times. And grading is very unpredictable. Don't take it if you're unsure of physics\/ intensive math.",
    "I would recommend this course as the second part of the intro physics sequence, although there are flaws in the latter sections. For those seeking to understand all of the material, it will be necessary to consult outside sources with some regularity. Nevertheless, one does encounter refreshingly advanced topics for a freshman course.",
    "Challenging material, although a light workload.",
    "It's a class geared toward physics majors who have taken AP physics and multivariable calculus in high school. The general relativity unit at the end is the most appealing and while it is hard, you will not be able to find this experience in other intro courses. The material is mostly theoretical so be prepared to see a lot of equations and numbers.",
    "For quantum and GR, the lectures seemed to be geared for grad students, while the Psets sometimes seemed appropriate for high schoolers, which leaves the tests somewhere in between. On the whole, a very interesting class, but less applicable to engineering\/the real world than first semester. Baltay is still the man.",
    "Physics 261 is a great class. E&M and quantum mechanics were handled very well, although GR was not as good; Baltay sometimes seemed to get bogged down with details in GR which made it tougher to see the bigger picture. However, he gave everyone beautiful LaTEX-typed GR booklets that he himself wrote, so studying it became much easier, and one was able to emerge with a very solid foundation in GR. Overall a great class, albeit a lot of material to learn and study for the final.",
    "Great class. The material is more difficult than in 260, but Professor Baltay knows that, and the problem sets take it into account.",
    "The class is a bit more difficult than 260, but please don't drop! I really think this is the best intro physics class you can take in terms of understanding physics rather than just applying it to the usual word problems. It was kind of mind blowing to watch Professor Baltay's relativity lectures derive all these rules we had learned before using only a few inputs and some cool math.",
    "This course is significantly harder than Phys 260, as it continues halfway through EM with the magnetostatics portion. Overall, we covered a lot of material including some quantum and general relativity, but it was a lot of material to go through and to know for the final and the midterm. Definitely review the GR a lot on your own, its easy to get lost in the covariant notation.",
    "Well taught physics course that covers a lot of ground. If you're looking for a challenge as a physics major, this is a good place to start. Complete understanding of the material, especially general relativity at the end, is a high order, and luckily the midterm and final are relatively forgiving in that they don't focus on the most difficult concepts (although they are by no means easy).",
    "Physics 261 should only be taken by intense Physics students planning to major in physics. If someone knows that Physics is their passion, then they should definitely take PHSY261, as they will get a lot out of it. Otherwise, the class will be overwhelming.",
    "PHYS 261 is a continuation of PHYS 260, beginning with magnetism, then going through quantum mechanics and general relativity. A lot of the general relativity went completely over my head, but I realized by the end of the course that more of it had made sense than I thought.",
    "It's tough but rewarding if you're willing to put in the time. There's about 4x the amount of material covered in 260, and only about 1\/3 of that is review, so be prepared to work. Definitely take it if you're interested in physics, as youve already gone through 260 most likely.",
    "Physics 261 is a good introductory physics class for potential physics majors. It\u0092s a good deal tougher than 260, but not terribly much work. It covers introductory General Relativity in the last third of the semester, which is completely inappropriate since the tensor approach used is outdated, poorly-explained, a major conceptual hurdle for even the smartest students, and it\u0092s almost impossible to find help for it since the approach used by Professor Baltay doesn\u0092t appear in any textbooks. That said, 261 is a pretty fun course and hard, but not too hard if you\u0092re into physics.",
    "PHYS 261 is the extension of the first half of the year, but with a focus on Electromagnetism, Quantum Mechanics, and General Relativity. Doing AP Physics, you should be relatively familiar with E&M, but most have never seen QM and GR. So, this makes for an interesting class--a lot more learning goes on than in the first half of the year. But, I also think this is the cool part of physics, and Baltay's GR notes are great. If you love physics this class is fun, otherwise it might be awful...I wouldn't know haha",
    "Good class. Take it if you've already taken 260, why not just take 261 as well. The main difference is you go without a textbook after the midterm, and that becomes very annoying. You use Baltay's \"lecture notes\" which are great, but the also contain lots of superfluous--you really don't need to know, in fact it may in fact be harmful to try to read--sections that aren't covered in class. The final this semester was much harder than last semester, mostly because the material is all over the place (magnetism to GR). The midterm was actually relatively easy (just remember to multiply by two winkwinknudgenudge).",
    "If you are serious about physics this really is the class you need to take. It's very theoretical, so you have to be into that kind of thing. Baltay is a professor though, and if you're good at math and have the mind for physics then take this class. Also, don't be scared when he says that you need to have taken multivariable calc and E&M. I hadn't taken either and was able to figure it out, he basically goes over everything you need.",
    "If you enjoy physics, it is a really great and interesting class to take. The material is definitely more difficult this semester than it was in 260, but at the same time really interesting. Problem sets take a bit more time than last semester, but are manageable. The main thing is when you have a test, you have to put A LOT of effort into the class. It's not easy. But definitely worth it if you are up for the challenge.",
    "If you took Physics 260, you should take this course. It helps you understand some of the material from 260 better; besides, otherwise you only know half of introductory physics.",
    "This class covers A LOT of material in a pretty short amount of time. You start out finishing a pretty detailed look at E and M and then move into themotion of electromagnetic waves and quantum mechanics, and end with general relativity and relatavistic E and M. This stuff is challenging to say the least, and is certainly not for the faint of heart. However, if you are willing to struggle through it and work hard, you can come out of the class understanding alot of the things that make our universe work. Professor Baltay does a good job of keeping the big picture in view even as he furiously scribbles 4 tensor equations on the board. The course moves really fast, so one off day or one missed class and you can feel almost hopelessly behind, so try to get a good sleep before class every day. I wish there were a more organized section in the class other than the casual problem sessions we have. I feel like when I was confused, it was not about the problems but more generally about the concepts. Understanding the concepts would let me understand the problems.",
    "PHYS 261 is not as hard as the hype may suggest. If you are willing to push yourself slightly, and are looking to emphasise understanding over pedantic details, take this over PHYS 201. General Relativity is extremely challenging, but phenomenal! Baltay is great; he has a lot of belief in the ability in his students, and expects a lot from us. The exams are fair.",
    "Physics 261 is much more interesting than 260. The workload isn't too difficult, although the tests are definitely harder than last semester. General Relativity is kind of confusing, but Prof. Baltay gave us a copy of the lecture notes which made things clearer, although for most derivations I still just had to take his word for it.",
    "If you're considering taking this after PHYS 260, it's basically the same deal, just a bit math-ier (cause of GR), and with a strangely non-rigorous unit on QM.If you're considering taking this without PHYS 260, it's tough to recommend, since 260 doesn't end neatly before 261 starts. But I would recommend 260\/261 to those who are interested in physics and feel very comfortable in their physics ability (unlike myself).",
    "Instead of lectures that repeat the book in less detail this class should actually teach students problem sets skills. I skipped class because all the information I needed was in our textbooks. What's the point of repeating this material and writing it all down on the board?The problem sets were ridiculous. The first ones from the Griffiths book were extremely hard, yet only basic problems in E and M were done in class. All of the learning I did for E and M happened when I was trying to crank through these problem sets (without ANY help from the extremely basic summaries of the material in class). The second third from the Modern Physics were a complete waste of time. The hardest part of them were forcing myself to overcome boredom and plug in numbers into basic equations that I could have learned in middle school. The two on GR (general relativity) hardly improved my understanding of GR or tensors, they should have been much harder if were going to learn anything substantial from them.The tests were also ridiculous. We had a problem on solar sails on the four-question midterm that we hadn't even seen in class. It wasn't hard but lots of people tripped on it because it wasn't covered in class. If your course grade depends on 12 questions, shouldn't the questions be a little more relevant to what we learn in class? Also, I can't express my frustration on how stupid it is to provide NO EQUATIONS on either test. I lost a fair amount of credit because I couldn't remember relevant equations.Don't take this class unless you want to be bored by lectures, frustrated by problem sets, and generally upset about losing points on irrelevant problems, or for not being able to memorize equations. Baltay is not the teacher he is cracked up to be, he just regurgitates the textbook with less accuracy, detail, and depth. Take 200, you'll learn less physics but at least the material you learn in class will be relevant to the tests and the problem sets.",
    "This course was a difficult and thorough introduction to E&M and general relativity. Professor Baltay is really unbeatable, and if you have strong math and physics background this is the intro level course for you. Beware, because it is somewhat easy to let the material slip away from you as p-sets are relatively infrequent and you can just learn the material then immediately forget it (as I did.). This makes for a very rough finals week. Also, this course is composed mainly of eager freshman who study a lot.That being said, again I think this is DEFINITELY the right course if you want an introduction to the world of physics: a very cool world!!!!! The TA is also awesome (Kent Riley). You will bond greatly with your fellow 260ers, and probably will make a bunch of friends in the process. Plus, the material is really epic and you feel like you start to understand the reasons behind a lot of universal truths. You may even question your sanity as you learn general relativity.",
    "For a freshman physics course, you cover a ton of material--E&M, Quantum, and General Relativity. The concepts this semester were a lot harder than last semester in 260. The class isn't too much work (one p-set due every week, one midterm, one final) but the class moves very quickly and I never felt like I had a good grasp on what we were covering in class. If you have a decent background in math and you did well in PHYS 260, you should be fine, but know that PHYS 261 is significantly more difficult than PHYS 260.",
    "Same thing as 260, except the material is much harder and actually becomes painful at times. But it isn't that bad if you know exactly what to study and what to skip. For example, you totally don't need to understand everything in general relativity. The Griffiths textbook is great, but Krane was useless. It felt like a high school textbook. Warning: if you're looking for \"real\" physics, you'll be disappointed. This is just an intro class. At the beginning, I thought I was doing some really hard E&M, but at the end of the semester, I was wondering whether I was learning any rigorous science at all. Our treatment of quantum and GR was superficial at best. All I needed to do to pass quantum was memorize all the forms of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation and how to derive it for several potentials. We know less quantum than, say, students of pchem. But given that this is an intro level course, I shouldn't complain.",
    "Physics 261 is a different world from Physics 260. A lot of people say that Physics 260 is a repeat of some concepts of AP Physics C (I don't know, I did IB HL Physics and everything in Phys 260 was new), but Physics 261 is a whole different level to anything you have taken.The highlight of Phys 261 for me was the 4 Vector and Tensor treatment of General Relativity and E&M. You appreciate the concepts in Phys 260 in a different perspective when they are generalized using 4 vectors and tensors! Finally understanding (at least parts of) the Schrodinger Equations was also a high point!If physics is your thing, you have to take Phys 261!",
    "Difficult, interesting, impressive. If you did well in 260, it will be some of the most awesome stuff you've seen so far. If you just did okay, maybe rethink it.",
    "The continuation of Physics 260. Though harder than the first semester, this class covers more interesting and advanced material. Prof. Baltay is a good lecturer; the classes were usually more interesting than they were first semester.",
    "It's similar in difficulty to 260, although the topics might be things that haven't been covered before (e.g. electron shells, Schroedinger's equation, general relativity). Baltay doesn't give a textbook for general relativity, just his course notes, so be warned - the course notes are good, but in my opinion don't substitute for an actual textbook.",
    "If you're seriously interested in physics, this is the best way to begin. You will gain at least a basic understanding of nearly all of the main branches of physics.",
    "Tough but highly rewarding. I highly recommend it if you have a strong physics background and\/or plan to major in the field.",
    "Much harder than Physics 260. The homeworks are slightly tedious but not much worse than first semester's homework. The midterm and final are fairly confusing conceptually, so study well before-hand and review regularly.",
    "I'd recommend 261, but know that it probably won't be as hard as you think. Checking out a 400 level physics class might be a good idea if you want a really hard class.",
    "Good course, especially for Physics majors."
