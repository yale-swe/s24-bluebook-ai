   "comments": [
    "Unless you really like rocks, no. You will enjoy 2 out of all the seminars, ie the ones on atmosphere, glaciers, and renewable energies. The rest is all about rocks. If anyone talks to me about plagioclase, polymerization or ductile flow again, I will cut them.Beyond that, Prof. Park is is kind of pretentious, the final paper and presentations are annoying, and seminar is basically a rehash of the reading.Hint: you don't need to buy the book. This is why Google is the best.",
    "This class was great in my opinion, but I'm a G&G major so of course I loved it. You have to make sure you have no problem with the seminar style of teaching because there's no lecturing in the class. You spend all the time learning from presentations or discussions with other students and most of the real science you learn is from your own reading of the textbook. No one really reads the papers assigned unless you're presenting it, but the textbook is good and the small class size promotes some good discussion. The material covered is great and though Professor Park seems a bit strange at first, he's a good teacher and he really knows his stuff. The grad students in G&G are also for the most part great so it's hard to go wrong with the TA. Workload isn't bad at all and the two papers, if you choose something interesting, are actually kind of fun to write! If you're interested in the environment at all, even from a policy or social science angle, take this class.",
    "While this class covered a wide breadth of subjects and I feel like I did come out of it with a more general understanding of the earth science branch of geology, it lacked real depth in the topics. The class goes through a chapter each day and there is no real accountability for learning the material besides class discussions. While the workload was minimal, I was almost able to pick-and-choose the parts of the material I wanted to learn and graze over the rest (which could be positive or negative, depending on what a student wants to get out of the class).One really valuable portion of this course was the in-class presentations on scientific papers. These provide great practice for in-class public speaking as well as a better understanding of how to read more technical papers.",
    "Take it if you are an EVST major or a G&G Major. Also take it if you want to go into the mining\/energy\/commodities industries. Teaches you a thing or two about the difference between bauxite and kaolinite.",
    "This is an excellent introduction to geology and geophysics. This course is great if you are genuinely interested in geology. If you are not interested in the material, however,do not take the course.",
    "A rare breed - the science seminar. There were definitely some strengths to this model, especially the student paper presentations that gave us a lot of experience reading and summarizing dense scientific papers. Sometimes, however, the discussion got a little sidetracked or became a conversation between the professor and one or two students. Overall, however, I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in geology and prefers the seminar format to the lecture.",
    "take it if you are interested in geology. excellent survey course.",
    "Great class. Good intro geology course. Not too much work. The 15-20 final page research paper does take a lot of time though.",
    "A solid introductory geology course. Do the readings and put a lot of work into the papers, and it's a very helpful and rewarding class.",
    "It's very little work, and if you find geology interesting at all I'd say it's an awesome class. JPark is a little out of it sometimes, and quirky I guess. I liked the material a lot never having taken a real G&G class - class itself can get dreary b\/c it's about answering his questions and student presentations each class, but I enjoyed writing the papers, which were completely open-ended.",
    "this class is a intro geology class in seminar format. during class you go over questions from the textbook and then 4 people present on geology papers. there are no tests but 2 papers. i feel like i would have learned more in a lecture class.",
    "GG 200 is relatively straightforward, but is a fair amount of work if you really want to learn. Understanding the material takes more than just finding the answers to the assigned questions. The paper presentations (we did 5 each) took me about 5 hours to prepare each; the individual research papers required much more time- you will look at real scientific papers that require much attention. I would only take it if you are a geology major or studying a related field.",
    "Since the G&G200 is mostly reading and discussion based, you get out of the course what you put into it. Overall, I would recommend it to students interested in the natural sciences.",
    "I would say this is a good introduction to Geology, but I would probably recommend taking the lecture in the fall, rather than this seminar. It is weird to have an intro science class as a seminar because people do not know enough detail about anything to discuss the topics, so they end up just quoting the book with every question and it seems like a waste of time. I'd rather have an awesome lecture about the material from a professor who knows what he is talking about. That being said, if the fall class is not an option, this is a fairly decent replacement and you still learn some cool things about geology. As for the structure of the class, there was reading assigned for every class and questions you had to answer from the book material. The class time was then spent going through the questions (this is where people quoted the book and it was pretty stupid) and then there were two student presentations per class on outside research papers. This was a cool thing to learn how to do, it didn't take much time once you get the hang of it, and it is nice to be able understand some pretty complex material and learn about random geology that is being researched today.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. It was slightly less of a workload than other classes and it provided some relaxation compared to the rest of many science major's otherwise heavy workloads. This was formatted in a seminar format, which while interesting, was also greatly helpful as an introduction into geosciences."
