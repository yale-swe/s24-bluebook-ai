    "If you're going into the course expecting to walk away with a new profound understanding of yoga, I don't think you'll be satisfied. This course seemed really much more about art history than about yoga and I'm not sure I really got what I was hoping for out of it.",
    "I would recommend this course asan interesting, unique experience. It was very different from any other class I have encountered at Yale. I didn't love every theme covered over the weeks, but I generally found the course enjoyable and informative.",
    "I would summarize this class as a scattered look into various Indic religions, at various periods. I would not recommend this class to another student, unless the syllabus and structure of the course are substantially re-worked. I also thought that there was very little art history involved in the course, which was a disappointment to me as it was cross listed in the department.",
    "Take this class if you genuinely care about the religions of India. There are few classes at Yale that will give you a broad view of this region, and this is one such class. Do not take this class simply because you want a gut credit.For the record: I was the only student in this class that never practiced yoga prior to starting the class. And while we never got to practice together as a class, I can now say that I'm planning to take it up!!",
    "The title of this course is extremely misleading. Unless you want a somewhat disjointed exploration of various types of Buddhist prayer and art, don't take this class."
