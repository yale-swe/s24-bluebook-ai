    "I would definitely recommend it, though I don't know how it would be if it were offered again since Lynda wouldn't be teaching. It's an interesting body of work that you read though, so if it's taught well, you will learn a lot.",
    "This class was incredibly interesting. Although we spent a fair amount of time covering cultural theory, we also spent large amounts of the class talking about things like Disney, Cirque du Soleil, and tourism. I'd definitely recommend the class.",
    "Take this class. It's amazing and will change your way of thinking about performance and media in general.",
    "ABSOLUTELY would recommend this class if it's ever offered again. You actually want to do every reading, participate in class, and put a lot of effort into the papers - the course will inevitably expand your worldview. Where else can you discuss everything from David Bowie to Disney to Wagner and back?",
    "Look at the syllabus before you commit, but it was a great class.",
    "This class was great!"
