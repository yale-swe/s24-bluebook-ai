    "I suppose it helps to practice presenting information in your field, but we were allowed to present anything we wanted. Facilitators were unfamiliar with a lot of terms in our discipline, so the feedback about that was not super relevant to public health itself. I doubt this course will really help me with research or my thesis, as I feel I could get help with presentations from career services that is just as good.",
