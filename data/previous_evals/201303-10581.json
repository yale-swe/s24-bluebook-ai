   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in ancient Rome than yes, this would be up your ally. I took this class Credit\/D as my preindustrial credit for the history major. It didn't really hold my interest very well, but I like more contemporary history so I wouldn't be the best person to ask.",
    "This was an absolutely fantastic class. Professor Johnston is an extremely charismatic and enthusiastic professor and has an encyclopedic knowledge of Roman history. The lectures are very clear, and are accompanied by powerpoints that are great aids for learning the material. It was a real pleasure to take this class.",
    "A fantastic class! TAKE THIS CLASS! The material is so engaging, and Professor Johnston makes it all even more interesting. The amount of material covered, and the variety of material, makes for a diverse class that teaches you to look at history from many different view points. The reading is interesting, and the papers are open-ended, so you can really write about whatever part of Roman history\/culture is interesting to you. Each lecture was likewatching a movie, I was enthralled and excited to see how the story continued--Professor Johnston is a fantastic lecturer, as well as an engaged professor who really wants to get to know you and help you grow as a student.",
    "Yes, yes, yes. Take this class if you're thinking about taking it. Take it if you aren't thinking about taking it. Take it if you stumbled on this review page through the unlikely coincidence of typing a string of random characters into the url bar on your web browser. Take it whether or not you go to Yale or have ever been to New Haven.I would call this a spectacular and satisfying exploration of crucially relevant subject material at the hands of an expert professor. Everyone needs and deserves to know about the Roman Republic -- its lessons are still at the heart and soul of our own fragile republic. Do yourself a solid and take this class.",
    "I would recommend it to any student interested in history or looking to fulfill a humanities requirement. It is not overly difficult and very interesting",
    "An extremely interesting course with a good and enthusiastic prof and dedicated TAs",
    "This is one of those rare classes that will never leave you, as much for the rich and fascinating texture of Roman Republican history as for the humble virtuosity that Prof. Johnston teaches it with. You must take this class, you couldn't possibly regret it.",
    "2 papers, midterm, final, quizzes in section. Great course. Decent amount of work. Definitely take this course.",
    "Take this class! The Roman Republic in and of itself is pretty awesome to learn about and Professor Johnston's class is great!",
    "Simply an incredible class for anyone remotely interested in ancient history. Professor Johnston is a very engaging lecturer, the slides are fascinating, and it's one of the few courses so well organized where sections, lectures, readings and handouts have little overlap and all provide more and more insight into the course. My favorite course all semester!",
    "Wonderful class. Professor Johnston clearly put an enormous amount of thought and time into his lectures, and it really paid off. The workload (two 10 page papers, a midterm, and a final, as well as weekly discussion questions) was heavier than almost any other class I've taken, but it was well worth it. I'd recommend this class to anyone. Shop it and you won't be disappointed.",
    "Unless your semester is too packed with other priorities, take this class. It was my favorite class at Yale, and I'm a senior. Professor Johnston is wonderful -- he's dynamic, eloquent, and makes you fall in love with studying the Roman Republic. The class is a lot of work: 10 min quiz every week (section), tons of reading (including additional readings for section), two 10-page research papers, one midterm, and one really long final exam. HOWEVER, the quizzes were easy and made you keep up with the material, making it even more engaging, and made the exams less stressful. The section was actually fun. We had good discussion and it wasn't too stressful. The exams were just short essays, so not too difficult and sort of fun to do. Inevitably, I fell behind on a lot of the reading, and while I wish I kept up with it more, it did not hurt my grade. This class is good for people of all majors and years -- take it!",
    "Very excellent class. Material is engaging and is presented as such. Great professor. Easy to do well in if you come to lecture and are a good writer, although it has a heavy workload of two papers, a midterm, and a final.",
    "This is a really fabulous course, which examines the history of the Roman Republic. The lectures are amazing and Professor Johnston will change your life. Section includes weekly quizzes and additional readings. There are two papers that require significant research as well as a midterm exam and a final exam. I would highly recommend this course to someone who is willing to take on the workload. It is definitely worth it in the end.",
    "Professor Johnston is a wonderful teacher\u00e2\u0080\u0094his main quality is a sort of boundless excitement which is definitely contagious. He makes Roman History interesting and accessible and important. There are great stories, and he tells them well. He also engages with ongoing debates regarding historiography, and touches on modern ethnographical and critical methods, which is refreshing. If you think that Roman history is dry (as I did), shop the class. Then take it; it's wonderful.",
    "This class is good if you want a basic overview of Roman History. However be prepared for a lot of reading and a large amount of materials learn. There are quizzes each week in section, but these are only very small. Section leaders are really great and helpful for papers, and sections themselves are generally quite interesting. The lectures and power points don't vary much, so by the end of the semester they were becoming quite tedious. The professor is approachable for help with papers and enthusiastic in class, but he is quite a strict grader. The midterm and final are quite fair, the questions are very broad and there is always choice in which one to answer. I am pleased I took this class, but if won't be continuing with the Roman. Imperial class in the Spring, because I found the readings a bit excessive and the lecture too repetitive and similar.",
    "10 min quiz on the IDs each section, 2 papers and 2 tests. It's a bit much, but really fun, and doesn't seem to be graded too harshly. Awesome material, great class to take Cr\/D, although an A\/A- isn't too hard if you just go to class, and honestly, it's one of those classes you want to go to.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Johnston is engaging, and the grade is spread out evenly over different amounts of work (and, to be honest, not *all* of the reading is necessary to keep up in lecture and on exams, which is really nice!) Professor Johnston really wants you to succeed and makes every effort to help you do so!",
    "This is a fantastic course. There's really something in it for everybody. Professor Johnston is as good of a professor as it gets. It can be a lot of work sometimes, with2 papers and 2 exams, but if you put in the effort to write good papers it will totally be worth it. The course starts out slow, but the second half of it is absolutely gripping. Take it, you won't regret it!",
    "Yes, one of the best courses I've ever taken. Simply outstanding professor whose lectures will blow your geeky mind."
