    "I gained a comprehensive overview of some of the major poets that influenced the trajectory of English literature over the course of history. There was a variety of form touched upon: from sonnets, to standalone poems, to book-long poems, it was a dynamic mix and almost too heavy a load for such a short course.",
    "I gained so much taking this course! I learnt how to write critically under pressure, and how to structure my essays better.",
    "I read and developed a strong, solid understanding of the poems that have become foundational to the literary tradition in the English language.",
    "became a better writer, reader and thinker",
    "I learned to craft a better argument, to write better, and to be more confident in exploring my ideas about a text.",
    "This class was extremely beneficial to help me develop my writing skills and reading skills. I learned a great deal about close reading and poetry as a whole. The essays were challenging and rewarding and I learned new ways to evaluate poetry because of them.",
    "close reading, analytical essay writing"

   "comments": [
    "Grading is spread out over several assignments, participation and a final exam, so no one component holds too much weight to drastically alter your grade.",
    "No people of color or women in the core syllabus. Please change this.",
    "The main strength of this class was the phenomenal Catherine Nicholson! I also really enjoyed how the writers complemented each other.",
    "I loved this course. The poetry was amazing, and Professor Catherine Nicholson is brilliant. The seminar structure of the class is very conducive to deeply engaging discussions, and the essay prompts ask us to think critically and creatively about the work we're reading. My only suggestion would be (and I don't think this is Professor Nicholson's fault or anyone's fault at all) for the instructor to somehow encourage participation in the discussions toward the beginning of the semester. I had a really hard time coming up with things to say in the discussions, and some students didn't speak at all; that might be my own fault, of course, and I'm not exactly sure what the solution would be, but that was my only concern about this course. It was a fantastic class!",
    "it shouldn't be required but is nonetheless great",
    "A great introduction course to the English major. I wish that the course was more clear cut in terms of what it was exploring--I wasn't sure if the focus was on their poetry, or the major poets themselves.",
    "The discussions and professor were great. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "Weaknesses: it's status as a required course is problematic (let's decolonize the English major!) and also dilutes the class with students who aren't as interested in or engaged with the material-only taking the course because it's required. Strengths: close reading, engaging class discussions",
    "The class should not be required and should be modified to better fit the needs and curiousities of its students. The English department should consider the \"tracks\" system of the history department to better create classroom environments where all students feel comfortable and equally engaged. Though the women added to the syllabus were appreciated and the use of literary criticism to dicuss race was incredibly interesting, denoting only some days to women and minority writers and thinkers felt superficial and strange."

    "Would recommend the section taught by Catherine Nicholson - excellent & critical view of these 'canonical' authors",

    "Absolutely! It's a vital introduction to the English major at Yale, and entertaining and insightful in its own right.",
    "Absolutely! Not only are the texts we study in this course so important to the English literary tradition, but they're beautiful, powerful works on their own, and reading them is deeply pleasurable. This course also helps you develop the close reading and essay writing skills that are vital to anyone taking an English class. Plus, Professor Nicholson is a fantastic professor. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "yes if you are interested in these poets or you have to take it for the major",
    "Yes--it helps you develop essential skills that are applicable beyond the English major",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in English and poetry.",
    "If you're interested in the subject, sure.",
    "yes"
