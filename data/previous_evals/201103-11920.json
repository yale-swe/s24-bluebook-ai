    "Applied Physics is a class that is meant for students wanting a greater historical and scientific background in a few general subjects. If you want a broader background in some topics, take it. If you're looking for a more in depth explanation on the science side of it, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Physics 050 is a great class, especially for people who don't truly enjoy hard science. The class focuses more on the history of science rather than the hard factual science. It was enjoyable and the content was interesting. Dr. Prober is a trip and fun to learn from.",
    "A very interesting and fun seminar. I would recommend it to any freshmen and the professor was a great teacher and I actually looked forward to class each week.",
    "I would recommend it. It seems like a pretty unique class because a fair amount of it is taught by students through presentations, which can be a good or bad thing depending on what you like. Regardless, Professor Prober still oversees everything and will step in if a student is covering something in enough detail. Prober is a good teacher and the workload isn't very heavy at all: around 6 problemsets, 1 presentation, 1 mid-term, and a final essay.",
    "I would recommend it if you want a fun class.",
    "take it if you're actually interested in the material, otherwise its kinda of a waste of time. no one takes this class very seriously.",
    "Yes, the final paper really allows you to delve into a scientific topic you are passionate about, which is great for both science and English majors.",
    "Take it if you are interested in the material, or else the class will bore you. Still, a good course. Professor Prober is a very nice teacher who will give you lots of animal crackers and oreos :)",
    "A great course. It taught me a lot of really interesting and useful stuff. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, especially prospective innovators and engineers, as it taught us how inventions came to be and showed us some of the thinking behind the great technological advances of the 20th century.",
    "I would say it is how stuff works but more in depth. I would recommend it for a student who wants a very basic science understanding, but not for a student who knows some basic science."
