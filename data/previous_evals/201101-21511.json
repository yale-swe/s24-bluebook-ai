   "comments": [
    "Take it if you need it or if they get someone other than Schwarz to teach it...cool stuff, problem sets aren't overly difficult, midterm was OK, but class is really bad.",
    "This is one of the easiest mechanical engineering classes. Almost no quantitative reasoning is involved, only qualitative discussion of material properties, and no difficult concepts. Actually this might make for a good Sc credit for a non-mechanical engineer, especially someone in the sciences, because it is interesting, applicable and not boring. Ever wonder how they produce all different types of plastic products? Wonder how different characteristics of metal alloys are achieved? If this excites you, take the class. Sometimes it would be helpful though if Udo actually knew how to pronounce the things he was talking about.",
    "Definitely. It's a fascinating topic for anyone who wants to understand why metal bends while clay breaks, what plastic is really made of, and everything else about what makes up the world we live in. It doesn't require any background knowledge in the sciences, and is not particularly difficult. Everyone should take this class.",
    "you're probably taking this as a requirement for ME or as an elective for ChemE. not a bad choice, you learn a great deal as it is an intro class and there is some interesting material. the exams are mostly qualitative and the course itself is a good balance of rote memorization of facts\/trends like in intro chem and math to calculate useful relationships, etc. the psets aren't too bad, the prof isn't too bad as well. i took it with 286L (jan schroers) and it was a great combination, some material overlap and of course hands-on experience. take it!",
    "Yes - interesting material (and while required, good class)",
    "A lot more chemistry than I was anticipating; too much if you ask me. But I guess that's the nature of the subject. Let's you know what going on at the molecular level in all sorts of common materials but very interesting. Udo is really unthusiastic but gets off topic easily.",
    "This course provides you with a lot of essential information about materials if you are interested in being an engineer. It becomes especially interesting when you get to ceramics and polymers as you really start to understand the materials you might be using in lab or for design. This is not a math intensive class, however, there is significant memorization.",
    "A terrific broad based investigation of materials and their properties. Covers metals, ceramics, polymers, etc - how to make them, what they are, what they do and are good for, how to work with them. One of the few engineering courses I've took that I can honestly say is directly and constantly applicable to all the work I do. This class has truly enlightened my understanding of the world around me. Professor Schwartz is super engaging, and does a great job not only of keeping us interested, but also explaining the properties of all the materials from an atomic level all the way to the bulk properties. A wonderful class. Very little math - it's realy qualitative, and therefore super useful. I'm a BME major, and I think that this course should honestly be required for the BME major. I have so much knowledge me peers to not, and it's going to constantly affect my way of working in the future (for the better).",
    "Good coverage of the major classes of materials (metals, ceramics, polymers, composites). Exceptionally easy class with very straightforward and simple problem sets, but you'll certainly learn a thing or two. Professor Schwarz has very funny stories and makes extensive use of analogies to fondue or skiing to explain material properties.",
    "From a design standpoint, this class is very useful, as it explains many of the choices inherent to designing a product. However, it's very intuitive, with little math involved.",
    "I'm a ChemE major, and I took this class as an elective. It was a good elective, and I learned a lot. You didn't really need to attend lecture to do well in the class because most of the material came from the book.",
    "Take this course if you want to know how the very little influences the world around us."
