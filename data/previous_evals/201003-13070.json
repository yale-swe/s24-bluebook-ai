   "comments": [
    "Take it! So easy!",
    "Good class. If you're interested in government or in going into politics, definitely worth taking.",
    "boring material.",
    "No. This was my biggest mistake at Yale so far. Not a gut and not interesting. The workload is not worth the payoff",
    "I do not recommend this class. Lectures are extremely boring and do not add information to the readings. If you take the class, be sure to have section with someone who is a political science grad student rather than a law school student. The readings are all very subjective but presented as hard facts. If you know anything about current events, you will find half of lecture useless. Take a more specific seminar if you are interested in American government. But the workload is not too hardif you are looking for easy workload. Just study a lot for the exams by organizing all the readings. And the authors' names are EXTREMELY important, something that is not emphasized enough by the TA or professor.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're really into Congressional politics and have a pretty good grasp already. This is a class that focuses almost extensively on academic studies and articles of Congress, with lots of different theoretical constructs and empirical studies. There's a sizable amount of work and this is by no means a gut.",
    "I would summarize it as a heavily theory based look at the US Congress. There's a decent amount of reading, though nothing too crazy. I would recommend it if the theories about Congress and its members are interesting. If not, or if you don't have a basic knowledge of the system already, I wouldn't suggest it.",
    "No one needs to know this much about the US Congress, and the grading is not an evaluation of practical knowledge.",
    "Take the class for a great introduction to the US Congress. Not all of it is basic information; there is a significant amount of theory and ideas involved, especially regarding party politics and the relationship between Congress and the President. Midterm and final are all short answer\/essay style-questions. Lectures are mainly based on textbook readings. Readings are somewhat extensive, but most people won't read all the materials anyways; some of the readings are more interesting than others. The material is not too hard, but does require effort to get the high B or A grades. Overall very straightforward class and one way to get a Soc credit!",
    "pretty good course- it's basically what it sounds like: an introduction to the us congress. lectures got kind of dry, but you definitely should still go to them because most of the exam questions come from lecture. i liked the course because i was interested in learning about congress, but if you're not, then you'll be very bored.",
    "If you have only taken basic American government and find Congress interesting, than this is the class for you. If your major interest is American Government however, and you've spent any time looking at Congress, this class is going to feel like a slow, boring, review. That was the situation I was in, and virtually all I did in this class, aside from maybe learning one or two new ways of looking at Congress, was to associate different scholars names to things I already intuitively knew. All in all, it was a fairly frustrating exercise for someone really passionate about Congress.",
    "Good class. Wouldn't take it if you follow politics\/Congress at all though. Gets boring at times because its very introductory.",
    "If you have any interest in congress, definitely take it. You will learn everything you ever wanted to know and feel much more well-informed.",
    "This is a great foundations class if you don't know much about Congress (I didn't). You learn a lot about the rules of Congress and we read a good bit about incentives as well. Lectures are OK, and the readings are half are a third from a textbook and two thirds academic articles on Congress. The latter category is mostly very interesting, but expect to be reading dense studies. I would highly recommend this class: it makes you an educated observer of Congress, exposes you to a lot of material, and is not too hard to keep up with or do well in.",
    "This class doesn't just teach you about how congress works; a lot of it is about theories about the process. You're going to spend a lot of time studying individual political scientists and their opinions. This class involves almost zero creativity or independent thought, so be ready study like you did in high school for this one, as the final exam is actually pretty tough, despite what the number of backwards caps in the room might suggest.",
    "Strengths:-Good overview of the theories and structure of Congress-Learned about the major seminal works in the field as well-Today's political faces was a nice additionWeaknesses:-Major focus on memorization-Very little discussion of current events or actual policies"
