   "comments": [
    "No, the course is poorly taught and is simply not interesting. Newtonian mechanics the first half of the course is fine, but the remainder of the course is simply terrible.",
    "Yes I would. I learned more than I expected, and some of them are pretty pioneering physics nowadays!",
    "If you have any Physics background TAKE 180! If you don't, this class is manageable if you pay attention and keep up. It is hard to do really well since so many people take this class who should take 180 or higher, but the class is still a reasonable Physics class.",
    "Awful if you've never taken physics before...only take it if you need to.",
    "Exactly as you'd expect.",
    "The course is fairly easy, although the problem sets are not always straight forward. It is probably way easier than Physics 180 though and you will learn a lot from this course as well.",
    "This class was terrible. There is no curve. While the exams are fair, this does not make up for the fact that Prof. Zeller doesn't actually teach you anything in class...any learning you do is from the book. Don't take this class unless you absolutely have to.",
    "Physics 150 is very basic. Most of the class seems to have prior physics knowledge so the class is a good stepping stone to higher level courses.",
    "As an introductory course in physics, the class is fine and Professor Zeller is an engaging teacher and the tests and homework are fair. However, the main weakness in the class is the fact that 75% or more of the students belonged in Physics 180. I wouldn't be surprised if the vast majority of the students in the class had taken high school AP Physics or the equivalent. Thus, for those of us for whom Physics 150 is the first exposure to the field, we are competing against a class of students for whom this is a refresher course. THE PHYSICS DEPARTMENT SHOULD INSTITUTE A PLACEMENT TEST TO PUT STUDENTS AT THE LEVEL WHERE THEY BELONG. I don't really care if the class was mostly pre-meds and interested in just getting a good grade. The idea of an education is to challenge oneself not to rack up easy As because you have taken a similar course only a year or so ago. Physics 150 should be only for students that didn't take physics in high school--that is what it is geared towards in theory, but the students are gaming the system, because they know they can enroll in it even if they've had significant exposure to the field already. This is or should be an issue for the folks running the Physics Department.",
    "Do not take this class unless you have to - which is probably the only reason you would take this class anyway. It is very poorly taught although obviously the easiest option for physics here.",
    "Physics 150 is a good class for those who have to take a general physics class, but it is nothing special. It is probably good for those who did not take AP physics because 180 requires a lot more time and is more advanced.",
    "pre-med physics. Take it if you need it.",
    "take only if you have to",
    "If you have never taken physics before, and don't know a derivative from a ditch, then this class is for you. If you're being stressed by the bio sciences, then this class is for you. If you have any interest in actually learning physics, take 180.",
    "If you need to take this course, you probably will. If you are looking for intellectual stimulation and you are very interested in this subject, you will probably take one of the higher level Physics courses. Zeller is a cute professor and makes us laugh, but to be honest, his board work is not very organized or easy to follow. I ended up learning most of the subject by skimming the equations in the book.",
    "I would recommend it to a student needing to fulfill the pre-med requirements.",
    "Not too bad. As long as you work hard on the problem sets and do some practice problems, you should do fine on the tests.",
    "Super easy if you've had any physics in high school, because everything's taught right out of the textbook. Prof. Zeller's adorable and funny, and hegives the option of having a page of notes for all midterms and finals, which helps a LOT. As long as you keep up with the weekly problem sets and can remember and apply the concepts, you'll do absolutely fine on the tests.",
    "Only take this if you have to.The curve is not very nice in that about 20% of kids make perfect scores on every exam. So if you're not one of those 20%, be ready to work hard.",
    "This is an introductory physics course (semester 1-mechanics). It is not a calculus-based course. I would recommend taking this course if you have never taken physics before or if you took it very early in your high school career and don't remember much about it.",
    "Bad",
    "I would recommend this class if you are pre-med. It is very manageable and great if you have not had a lot of physics experience. It's realy straightforward, so problem sets though challenging are very doable. The professor tries to be pretty clear but take advantage of the study session times with the TAs as there is no normal section. If you are looking for a harder physics class that is more thinking outside the box, I would go for 180 or 200.",
    "A good, solid intro course. Pretty easy if you've taken Physics before. Pretty typical of an intro science course, but no mandatory section, which is nice.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Phys 150 01 is an introductory course to basic mechanics of physics without the use of calculus. If the student took physics in high school, this class will be fine because they already have a grasp on the core concepts.",
    "Not unless you absolutely have to.",
    "People who have already taken physics should not take this course. Many of these people in the class found the course a boring, pointless chore with few redeeming features. On the other hand, if you have not taken physics, you will learn interesting things that will surprise you. I enjoyed this course for that reason. The professor is an engaging lecturer.",
    "Physics 150 follows the textbook pretty well. I mean, our questions are straight from the textbook. I would recommend this class only if you're premed and are scared of 180, or if you're beginning the physics major.",
    "Necessary if you are premed. Be wary that there is a very high curve. For example, if in orgo or another class an 85-90 on a test would be really good and likely lead ot an A in the class, in this class you will really have to get the 95 on your tests to get the A. That being said, the tests and problem sets are not particularly difficult. BUT, don't slack off b\/c you think this is going tobe super easy. If you haven't really taken physics before, you will need to study.",
    "good",
    "If you have to take it you should. Shop 180 as well and see which one is better for you.",
    "Boring, but not too painful.",
    "Don\u0092t take it unless you have to. If you have a genuine interest in the subject, take 180If you have taken high school physics and just need to fulfill the requirement, take physics 150. If you have never taken physics, this class will probably be difficult and you will have to work hard to seek out help.",
    "Take it if you have to . I've heard the 180 professor is better, so if you have any physics background you should probably do that one.",
    "Take it. Do-able. Don't underestimate some of the tests though...like the final. Don't fall behind either.Work together on problem sets. Take advantage of study halls. Get a tutor.",
    "only take it for the pre-med requirement.",
    "Only take it if you need to fulfill a requirement.",
    "Took it for the pre-med requirement. Wish I didn't have to because I found it a total waste of time. Zeller probably isn't the best teacher to have if you're trying to learn this for the first time but since most of the material was stuff I had already seen before, he was really helpful when I had extra questions after class. He's a nice guy but tend to make mistakes while solving problems, making it difficult for people to follow his train of thought.",
    "If you have to take it take it. It's not good, but it won't kill you.",
    "Take if required",
    "Physics for pre meds. Don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "Register for a math course and take 180 or 200",
    "It's ok, I wouldn't take it as a fun QR, but if you need it as a requirement it's not too hard.",
    "Yes. It's a good way to get a science credit.",
    "Physics 150 is a basic overview of general physics without calculus. Take it if you need the physics for medical school, but not if you want to really go deep into physics beyond what you can learn in high school.",
    "It's truly awful. If you're a total beginner (as I was) with any sort of concept of Calculus then just do 180. Physics needs calculus to some extent, I believe, and everyone in this class has had physics in high school. This applies tenfold if Zeller is teaching it.",
    "If you are premed, then take it.",
    "One of the worst classes at Yale. It's full of premeds who should be taking a higher level class. If you're taking this though, you're probably premed (at the moment), anyway, you're screwed. It sucks, doesn't it?",
    "Yes. Professor Zeller is amusing and engaging. His lectures are good and definitely worth going to. The work is not that challenging but doing well in the course can be frustrating. Many people have had a lot of physics before taking this course and so themost common scores on the midterms were 100%.",
    "Do not take physics if you have never taken physics before",
    "If you have any physics background, I strongly suggest taking a higher physics course. I had never taken physics before (not even in high school), so I chose 150. If I didn't have to, I wouldn't have taken the course.",
    "I would recommend this class because it was very straightforward.",
    "This is an ok class; Professor Zeller in sometimes unclear and makes mistakes, but they are usually pointed out in class and fixed. He is a very nice, understanding person, however. Reading the book will clarify anything that is unclear from lecture. Study hall is extremely helpful if you are having trouble with some hw problems.",
    "Even though this is the lowest level physics, be prepared to work. You must do and understand the psets, and practice a LOT, to do well, because there are a lot of people in this class who should not be in it (who should be in a higher level). Go to the weekly tutoring sessions in Silliman, they help a lot!",
    "It was an OK course - if you don't know anything about physics, you could probably pick a worse class. I think this almost completely depends on the teacher, less on the course itself.",
    "wouldn't recommend it but you have to take it",
    "It helps a lot if you've already taken physics in high school. Zeller is awful. He sometimes gets confused when teaching and makes some mistakes. Some of the questions he writes on the test are unclear. I think the only reason I understood what was going on was the book and the fact that I had taken the class in high school. The class itself was fine but the professor was terrible.",
    "If i were you an zeller was teaching, I would take 180 unless you already know everyhing",
    "Physics 150 is exactly what you expect from a physics course. You go to lecture, you take notes, do problem sets, and take exams. I wouldn't take it unless you have to, since it's not really a fun course. If you take it with Professor Zeller, he is a good guy and his tests and problem sets are very fair.",
    "Take it only if you have to take it. Professor Zeller is great, but probably a bit bored by teaching this course. Try PHYS 180."
