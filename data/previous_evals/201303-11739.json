   "comments": [
    "Yes, it builds well off of intermediate micro and macro and financial theory.",
    "Take it if you want to work and not understand what is on the board but only what is on problem sets and tests.",
    "Do not take this class unless you are an economics and mathematics major. It is not that interesting and quite difficult. That being said if you do choose to take it, go to Professor Bewley's office hours as his lectures are useless. At office hours you might actually learn something.",
    "Im a normal economics major who took this class, and I found it to be an extension of intermediate micro. It's definitely tough, but nothing that's not doable. Make sure to put a lot of work in early learning shortcuts and foundations; I found myself falling behind quickly, but managed to catch up near the end of term.",
    "Take this course. To those of you who enjoy macroeconomics this course will provide you with a completely new perspective with which to view the macroeconomy. The material is very interesting and very useful both in general and if you are contemplating further studies in economics. Though the material is quite difficult, it can readily be mastered with hard work and persistence. Grading is also very fair so if you work hard, it is not too difficult to get a good grade. The professor is excellent. He selects topics that are relatively easy early on to help you build intuition. It is only after you have gained a very fundamental understanding of the material that he increases the difficulty of the course. Finally, the professor is genuinely one of the nicest and most intelligent people I have ever met. His office is open virtually anytime so if you have a question about something, it is easy to get an answer. He also explains things very clearly and is willing to repeat himself until you understand.",
    "The course material is fairly proof-based but the homework, as in many theory classes, is disconnected that could be frustrating. At its worst the class can be called boring, at its best it is a good introduction to general equilibrium theory.",
    "Very theoretical class, take if you are an Econ\/Math major and\/or seriously considering grad school in Econ. Prof. Bewley is actually the Director of Graduate Studies for Econ great person to talk to if you are considering grad or business school."
