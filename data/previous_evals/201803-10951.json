   "comments": [
    "I developed a wider appreciation for ancient literature and the skills to more quickly analyze and appreciate different works. The class is very fast paced--usually one play per class.",
    "I learned a lot about writing in an academic style that demonstrates passion and engagement with the text, but also a certain amount of restraint. Professor Robinson saw to it that I developed a more academic voice than I already possessed when coming into Yale. Furthermore, this course is excellent at providing an introduction to Western literature for one who decides not to take Directed Studies. While I ultimately regret dropping DS for a variety of personal reasons, this class brought me great enjoyment and a taste of what I would have experienced.",
    "I learned how to read and digest a large text very quickly."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the this class really are the plays themselves. They are all classics, in some sense or another. Professor Robinson was a bit odd, and tended to be a bit more focused on sexuality within the plays than the students were. Despite this, we had interesting and fruitful discussions in class.",
    "The sheer volume of reading is both beguiling and off-putting. It's the nature of this class, after all: a lot of reading in a short period of time. Make of it what you will.",
    "One major strength of the course is the reading material. I loved the works we read. However, the pacing of the course (a play per day) makes it hard if not impossible to cover the texts in a satisfactory way."

   "comments": [
    "This class is very topheavy when it comes to workload, and was a bit abrupt for first semester, but overall I enjoyed the materials and the class.",
    "I would, but not in lieu of Directed Studies, which is what I did. It's a very different course from DS, with a different intellectual environment. If you're looking for DS-lite, you won't really get that in this course. Take DS if you want DS."
