   "comments": [
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. This was a wonderful opportunity and one of my best experiences at Yale so far. It was inspiring and confirmed my career path. I cannot emphasize enough how great this class was!",
    "This is a wonderful and exciting introduction to art historical conservation. Theresa is a legend and runs an excellent, very hands-on seminar. I loved it and each class was new\/exciting\/different. Take this course.",
    "This is a great class to start learning about art conservation.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Important information for art history majors.",
    "If you're at all interested in the practical side of art or in working in the museum field take this course. Professor Fairbanks is so knowledgable and caring and you'll gain a fair amount of practical conservation knowledge. Also - the resources you'll have access to are incredible. Professor Fairbanks knows everything there is to know about works on paper and can magically move through the bureaucracy of Yale Art so you'll go to the BAC, YUAG, Sterling, and Beinecke. The amount of work is super light, you only need to do readings if you're interested in them, and every week of the class is basically a different hands-on art experience.",
    "This was a wonderful class that provides a unique, under-represented angle on art history. Professor Fairbanks-Harris is great and puts so much energy into the class. You get to see a lot of great things -paintings in the process of restoration, limited-access items at the Beinecke, sculpture demonstrations, and so on. The class was a breath of fresh air in a department that can border on stuffy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to every student at Yale. Even if you are not an art or art history major, you will enjoy an inside look into paper and painting conservation at the British Art Center. There are even mini art classes where we experimented with multiple media including clay, pastel and paper.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who majors in fine art or art history."
