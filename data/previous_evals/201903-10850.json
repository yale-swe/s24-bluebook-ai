   "comments": [
    "Population economics, Hotelling model, Neoclassical Growth Model applied to environmental economics, specific topics in climate change. We also covered optimization in excel and created a very basic integrated assessment model.",
    "An understanding of the most relevant and recent topics in Environmental Economics. Taking this with Professor Nordhaus offers a perspective at the forefront of the field, so you get to learn about some of the things which are only now being discovered, investigated, and developed.",
    "I learned so much about a diverse array of topics ranging from climate science to neoclassical economic growth theory to behavioral economics. Such a great mix of topics really gives a wide perspective on the overarching theme of climate change. There is also plenty of opportunity to into depth in the areas that interest you through readings or the final paper.",
    "I learned a lot about population, resource, and environmental economics, as well as policy.",
    "This course gave me a somewhat deeper understanding of various facets of the economics of climate change. Perhaps the deepest part of this course was the examination of integrated assessment models of climate change.",
    "Learned about environmental economics, expected effects of climate change and the research of Professor nordhaus",
    "A survey of important topics in modern-day Climate Change Economics from a Nobel-laureate in the field. Broadly, we learned how the impacts of climate change to the economy can be modeled to facilitate cost-benefit analyses and optimal policy implementation by setting an appropriate price for carbon that must be enforced internationally. Much additional work is being done on this process, however, and we learned about these issues such as the difficulty of modeling damages from climate change, the dispute between higher or lower discounting rates which influence how urgent mitigation measures should be, and the intricacies of the Earth system which introduce uncertainties such as hurricanes and tipping-points like large-size ice melts. Coming out of the course, I now see how bad it is to underprice carbon, as we do today, and how difficult the climate change problem is to solve, but I was also convinced that some very reasonable and moderate steps could greatly improve the situation.",
    "I think a good portion of this course is focused on what goes into an Integrated Assessment model, but we do go over the basics of environmental economics that you may have seen if you took Mendelssohn's class.",
    "This course covered an in-depth look at environmental economics and was a great introduction to a very large and relevant problem in today's economy.",
    "Excel solver, economic theories concerning natural resources, a critical view of methodologies.",
    "I developed an understanding of the potential impacts of climate change, as well as the optimal policy responses and adaptations that must be undertaken to avoid catastrophic economic damages.",
    "Nuts and bolts of econ of energy and climate change.",
    "Learned about Climate Change Econ (a broad topic -- from climate science, to behavioral econ, to uncertainty). Got to see how Nordhaus's integrated assessment model works (from Nordhaus himself), which is covered in pretty much every school's climate change econ class.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about the current state of environmental economics (damage modelling, discount rates, etc.) and what is holding back policies from being implemented. There's actually many other policies (world hunger, healthcare, overfishing, agriculture, etc.) that would be much more efficient to address than researching new technology, and they aren't being addressed because of the vested interests of previous generations. We know that climate change is happening, and that it is very bad. However, it has the potential to be much worse than anything we could possibly imagine. It's a pretty awful prisoner's dilemma atm. I also learned that modern society is probably going to go through some terrible years, based on my own geopolitical research (spurred by my interest in this class.) I also pondered the ethical value of discounting future generations' GDP.",
    "I learned something of how climate change damages are estimated and the importance of social discount rates, and I also learned a bit about how economists think and have thought about economies interactions with the environment."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Prof Nordhaus is a obviously a master of the field, but often the lectures were very slow and hard to follow. We shifted from a quantitative review of basic micro and macro economic principles in the beginning of the semester to a more qualitative analysis issues of climate and energy. This course could be improved with better organization and flow. The concepts felt very isolated to each lecture; I would have appreciated a more cumulative effort.",
    "There was a lack of structure to the class. Much of it felt slightly haphazard and unorganized. At the same time, it does a good job of teaching the relevant topics and showing how they are applied in the real world.",
    "Overall the course was excellent and one of the very best classes I have taken in my time at Yale. The professor and the TA are both excellent and really care about students' interest, understanding, and success. The range of topics covered is impressive. The exams are both very fair and test a deeper understanding of concepts. Lectures are very engaging and funny. Really can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "Fascinating material, but very unclear expectations. I think it just needs more structure as a course.",
    "This course covered many different topics in climate change economics. However, at times, each lecture felt a little superficial and haphazard. The course really felt like a superficial introductory level course on various facets of climate change economics. I feel that the course could be greatly improved by dedicating significantly less time to \"background knowledge\" topics that aren't directly related to the economics of climate change. For instance, a lot of time was spent covering standard macroeconomic models and population models, and a lot of time was spent covering the science of climate change. While all of these topics undoubtedly are related to the economics of climate change, they're not what the focus of the course should be. Students taking this course likely are already knowledgeable in these topics, and if they're not, they should have sufficient background knowledge to get themselves up to speed. This course would have been a lot more interesting and engaging if it spent less time on background topics and focused more in-depth on the crux of the course, integrated assessment models, and the difficulties surrounding damage projections, pros and cons of different climate policies, etc.",
    "The class covers a broad number of concepts and the problem sets developed interesting insights It could be more numerically challenging though in my opinion",
    "The course afforded great exposure to a leader in the field, which is one of its huge strengths. It was a \"leminar\"-style were Prof. Nordhaus would frequently engage the students in class discussion. Problem sets were very manageable, usually on Excel, and there were only six. One small weakness, however, was that I would have wanted to hear more about Prof. Nordhaus's contributions to the field, who was quite modest and covered a great deal of scientic and economic material. It would have been fascinating to hear first-hand about how prof's work influenced the field.",
    "The strengths are that Prof. Nordhaus knows this subject inside out but sometimes it can be hard to receive all of this knowledge because he quietly sometimes. A mic would definitely help.",
    "This course had a great discussion and was extremely interesting. However, there was a relatively small disconnect between the course and exam preparation, though with enough effort it came out to be an overall positive.",
    "Strength: large coverage, good problem sets that lead you through the major model Weakness: some contents are merely slightly touched upon\/ don't feel concrete",
    "I enjoyed this course overall, but I feel that too much time was spent in the beginning reviewing concepts from macroeconomics. Since macro was a prerequisite for this course, it seemed unnecessary to once again learn the material.",
    "Strengths: covered key concepts in detail Weaknesses: brushed over some topics in climate science without helping students develop deep understanding Weaknesses: too much coursework. If there is a term paper, there usually isn't a final exam but this has both, over and above multiple problem sets for which students were not adequately prepared",
    "The problem sets felt a bit scattered, and they were basically of the form that would (mostly) unable to be tested. I wish I could've talked to Nordhaus and Jonghyun about my research paper earlier, because it took a very long time for me to come up with ideas. (just based on the timing of what we learned.) I'm glad that Nordhaus gave us hints on what to expect for the final exam, because the midterm was mostly out of nowhere (basically just testing on stuff we learned in intermediate macro.)",
    "The greatest strength of this course is that it is, basically, a survey of the topics on which Professor Nordhaus has spent his working life. It doesnt cover anything in a tremendous amount of depth (I think we saw about one slide each for Monte Carlo simulation and Cap and Trade), but it does a great job of tying the various (and often disparate) topics relevant to natural resource and environmental economics into a relatively cohesive whole. There were quite a number of fairly tremendous (or at least tremendously interesting) lectures, like the lecture on carbon taxes, or the lecture on hurricane damages where Professor Nordhaus seemed to have discovered a possible paper topic on average hurricane damages increasing by a factor or NINE instead of a factor of three during his pre-class preparation. The problem sets, exams, and papers all seemed fair and were often actually quite interesting. I can see no major place where this course can improve."

   "comments": [
    "If you are extremely interested in the concepts covered, yes. Do not take this class if not.",
    "Yes, if you think you might be interested in Environmental Economics or if you want to learn about climate change from an economic perspective, as many of the major thought leaders of our time are doing.",
    "Yes!!! This was a really eye-opening course and definitely one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The topic is so interesting and important and the course is taught in an engaging way. Nordhaus clearly cares a lot about his teaching and his students, and is also just an incredible smart guy. The course is basically him explaining his groundbreaking results to undergraduates. There is also such a diverse array of topics covered in the course that you feel like you really gain a good, holistic view of the topic, and readings and the final paper give the opportunity to dig deeper into your particular interests. Could not recommend this course more highly. I am not an economics major, and although some areas definitely required a bit of review, the course was very manageable as there was a lot of support available.",
    "Only take it if you are interested in the environment. It's not enough to be just interested in economics. At times the lecture material was boring. This class was basically learning different ways to price carbon.",
    "Only if you are prepared to really care about it. Writing a 15 page term paper for an Econ class is really difficult, and Nordhaus seems to have high expectations. If you are interested in the material, and maybe want to study Economics in graduate school.",
    "I would recommend this course to somebody who is interested in the topic and does not have strong background knowledge of economics and climate science, as this course does a good job at building the important knowledge base from which one can build up their understanding of climate change economics. For somebody who is already super solid on the background knowledge, this may still be a worthwhile course to take; you can still learn something you didn't know before about climate change economics, and it is a good way to get into a mindset of thinking about an extremely important issue from a rational and economic mindset. However, be prepared for some boring lectures.",
    "Yes, I recommend the course, but be prepared do a heavy workload around finals due to a term paper due just before the final",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course, even to students with only novice experience in Economics. The models in Climate Change Economics are of course complex, but the course material is very accessible. Time is devoted to the discussion of important issues and points of contention in the field rather than on model details. There were few problem sets that were very manageable and the exams seemed fair too.",
    "If you're looking for an intermediate-advanced econ class this is a solid choice. It should really be a 400 class for all the work we did. It really helps if you are interested in the subject to begin with.",
    "This course was fantastic. It was a very comprehensive and interesting class and I would highly recommend.",
    "Neutral. Recommend to someone interested in the topic.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I learned a great deal about the complexity of climate change economics.",
    "If you have a strong interest in environmental and\/or climate change economics this course is a must. Professor Nordhaus is a giant in the field and provided an amazing survey of the current research and frontiers of climate change economics. However, the course matter can get somewhat dense, so having a strong interest in the subject matter is ideal.",
    "Not really -- Nordhaus has his name and reputation but not great delivery in the classroom. It is really difficult to comprehend what he says and he doesn't engage the class a lot",
    "Yes - awesome opportunity. Nordhaus has a top notch understanding of the whole field - he can answer all your questions. He's a good teacher too.",
    "Yes, if you are able to take it with Nordhaus. I heard that people who took intermediate macro with him thought that he wasn't a very good lecturer, but he was very much in his element in this class (since it's his life's work.) This was my first econ elective, but I thought the topics I learned were more useful than what I'd learned in both intermediate micro and macro.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has the necessary economic and mathematical background (and those requirements are not particularly high). Climate change affects almost every sector of life, but it often seems complicated enough that it or its effects can be difficult to quantify and project. This course helps students understand how to do that, and as such is exceedingly useful for those preparing to go into almost any line of work, as well as those who would simply like to be more-informed global citizens."
