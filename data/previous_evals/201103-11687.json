   "comments": [
    "This class is great; the professor is super awesome, the readings are interesting, and the topic is important. If you've never written a substantial paper, though, I would probably take a lower-level class first; the papers for this class are fairly long and very challenging. Still, though, I had fantastic discussions in this class, and I learned a LOT about race and class in Brazil. Overall, this course, I think, is exactly what it says it will be---only better.",
    "This course is exactly what you would expect from the title. It is highly specific, which might feel limiting at times, but if you want a comprehensive look into the culture of race (and to a lesser extent, class) in South Africa and Brazil, this is the ticket. It's not too much work, and the mid-term and final are both fair and not too painstakingly difficult. Ultimately, I would definitely recommend this course to Sociology or ER&M majors looking for something different. Also, Professor Seekings is awesome.",
    "In this class you read and talk a lot about the sociology of race and class in Brazil and in South Africa, where are super interesting societies for this type of comparison. Also an interesting framework from which to think about race in the US (or anywhere else). The readings are fascinating and class discussions are fun (especially since the class was so small).",
    "Absolutely."
