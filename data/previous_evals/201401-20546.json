    "Yes, doing your senior thesis as an independent study is the best option.",
    "An independent research and writing course for the senior essay.",
    "I recommend writing your senior essay in the standalone senior essay credit, not in a class. This way you have more time to devote to your topic instead of the work of the class. (A great move is to take someone's seminar and write a paper with them as an additional credit outside of the seminar.) My biggest advice is to start on this early, write about something you like, and keep handing in drafts to your advisor and the EP&E essay adviser--they'll be incredibly helpful and that way you'll have no surprises.",
    "It depends. With an independent essay you definitely have less work than when you write an essay in a seminar.",
    "The Senior Essay is a cool way to either take something you've been interested your whole time at Yale or something you just thought would be cool and research it in-depth over either a semester or year. There's a good support network in the major for writing the exam, which comes in handy as you start to write your essay and when you get close to deadlines. You have to do it to graduate, so it's not exactly an escapable thing, but it's something you'll be happy to have done once you complete it.",
    "If you want to graduate as an EP&E major, yeah, taking this class is kinda useful. Keep in touch with your adviser, it makes it a less stressful process.",
    "It is required and you will learn a lot!",
    "It's a senior essay. You have to do it.",
    "Yes! Absolutely, this is the way to go if you care about doing intensive work. Just make sure you pick an essay advisor that will push you to set and meet deadlines for yourself (ones that are earlier than the EP&E ones) and that will provide you lots of feedback. The difference between good and bad experiences seems to be based in the specific advisor you have."
