   "comments": [
    "I gained knowledge of how to properly prepare for, perform, and record data for lab experiments. I think that the skills I learned about how to calculate and consider uncertainties in calculated and measured values are extremely important. Also, the skills I learned for crunching numbers and displaying data in a useful fashion through python-powered Jupyter Notebooks are also very important. Aside from experiment procedures, I also gained a fair bit of physics knowledge that I had not yet learned about through lecture or other physics courses.",
    "Comfort being in the unknown, quick data crunching, experimental thinking",
    "I learned how to use Python in Jupyter Notebook to graph and plot data. Through the various lab experiments, I learned about various physics principles in an applicable way.",
    "We learned many of the techniques used in basic physics instrumentation (oscilloscopes, optical devices, etc.), practical error propagation methods, a fair bit of Python coding for graphing and curve-fitting, and a great deal about the mechanical implications of theories learned about in physics lecture. I found the visuals provided by handling a real gyroscope and induction coils particularly insightful as those were concepts that I had difficulty with when I first took Physics, but in lab the theories felt much more intuitive.",
    "I learned how to operate and interpret various pieces of essential physics lab equipment such as an oscilloscope, a torsional oscillator, and a breadboard. I gained a very intuitive understanding of physics concepts such as gyroscope through the hands-on approach. I learned how to use Python to do data analysis. I learned some basic statistical techniques such as least squares method curve fitting, Gaussian\/Poisson distributions, and propagation of uncertainties.",
    "This course definitely gave me a better understanding of how to work with physics in lab, including learning certain aspects of general physics and using various equipment such as oscilloscopes and optical breadboards. I also learned how prominent and central programming is in physics research, and improved my Python coding skills.",
    "Knowledge: Error propagation, lab notebook presentation, some physics laws. Skills: Basic skills to learn Matplot in Python, which is really my first introduction to programming of any kind. Also, how to use an oscilloscope, optic instruments, and other physics laboratory equipment.",
    "I gained experience using Python in a lab setting, writing summary reports, and using more advanced scientific equipment that I did not previously have access to.",
    "I learned how to use python for data analysis and how to make measurements with uncertainty values. I also gained skills on designing experiments for indirectly measuring a quantity or testing a physical principle.",
    "In this lab we learned how to use various lab equipment, how to document our observations, use python to visualize and analyze data, and analyze error.",
    "I learned to quickly adapt to concepts and experimental techniques I had no prior experience with, and now have a good foundational understanding of using certain apparatuses, designing experiments, and applying exact measurements of uncertainty.",
    "Learned how to use modern physics equipment to carry out intermediate-level experiments, and data analysis and graphing in Python.",
    "I learned how to write things in a lab notebook, type them in Google docs, and fit a curve to data in Python.",
    "Learned to use lab equipment and approach questions creatively using the given equipment, as well as how to keep a good lab notebook.",
    "Familiarity with some basic physical instruments. Perfunctory introductions into Python and error analysis. How to manage time efficiently in a lab setting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that the pre-labs in this course were a bit of a mixed bag. Many of the topics we focused on or explored through the labs were topics I had never seen before. I think that some of the pre-labs did a great job explaining the concepts enough that I could understand what was going on enough to perform a proper lab. However, many of the pre-labs left me nearly clueless as to what the content meant or how it worked. In these situations, the TF (Hannah) or Professor Irons usually were able to explain what I did not understand. Although I think that the workload for the first few weeks was excessive, I think it would be valuable to maybe create and include videos in the pre-lab further explaining what the pre-lab said. When the whole class felt that they needed more explanation of the pre-lab, they would explain the content in person, which helped us, but also delayed the start of class. I think including videos in the pre-lab would better prepare the students for the lab and would also save time within the lab. Also, I feel that maybe the experiments should be tweaked a tad, as my section usually didn't finish until at least 4:45 and several times we finished after 5 (when the class is supposed to run from 1:30-4:30). Or maybe the description of the class' duration should be extended to be 3.5 hours long.",
    "Please make the summaries more chill. Also you could have spread out the pset work. That was like by far the most work I had in any class while we had psets.",
    "I didn't know anything about coding before I took this course, and there wasn't much guidance when it came to using python. However, my TA was very helpful and provided office hours for those who had questions.",
    "We really enjoyed many of the experiments in lab, especially toward the end of the semester as we got to know each other and the instrumentation better. The first few labs were more difficult and less interesting because none of us had a very good grasp on Python and we felt that the psets\/prelabs did not provide much guidance on coding or on setting up some of the more confusing equipment. I also enjoyed the latter labs more for their diversity in subject matter -- where the first several labs focused on the same torsional oscillator, the later ones covered electromagnetism, optics, circuits, and radioactivity.",
    "The assortment of labs covers a wide range of physics topics. I generally felt like the order of the labs made sense and matched our development with lab techniques and our knowledge of the physics. For instance, the lab on damped-driven oscillators came after the lab on damped-oscillators. The labs were supposed to only take three hours, but they often ended up going over that limit for every single lab group. I would have appreciated it if the length of the labs actually corresponded to how long the labs took. One way to save time would be to let us take our lab books home so that we can write procedures in the lab books before each lab. After all, we upload the lab books online anyway.",
    "This course was good in that I believe it provided a solid introduction to lab physics with some concepts included from a variety of different physics fields. However, the work load was pretty significant, and would often require a number of hours every week. Additionally, lab almost always ran for half an hour or more past the allotted time.",
    "Strengths: I learned a lot of knowledge and skills from taking this course, and some experiments were very very interesting. Since sections are so small, the TAs and professors are always available for you to ask questions. Weaknesses: Sometimes the experimental guides were too long, so it was always a time crunch to complete everything on time. Furthermore, the quantity and lengths of assignments was very high for a course only worth .5 credits. I think this could be improved by shortening the length of Problem Sets.",
    "It was very helpful to learn to apply Python in a lab setting, but I wish we practiced it more to solidify how to use it. We were also exposed to a lot of different physics concepts and experiments that were a lot of fun, and that we wouldn't otherwise be able to investigate in a large lecture course. At times, the pre-labs and procedures were confusing and hard to follow, so it would be helpful if they were explained or clarified more in the beginning of each lab. However, it is difficult to allow more time for this while still accomplishing the goals of each lab and the course in general. This class was also a lot of work in general, but again, it would be difficult to cut down on the load while still accomplishing the goals of a lab course.",
    "The course is extremely fast paced and it would be nicer and probably more conducive to understanding the lab if the course was a bit slower. The lab was good at teaching python and making sure that we knew how to carry out labs efficiently and analyzing results (especially after the first few weeks).",
    "Weakness: - Takes a really long time. I really hope that the instructors reconsider some of the experiments because there were some in which even the best students in the class couldn't complete in time.",
    "The course was new and it was very clear. There wasnt alot of feedback on work we submitted making it hard to improve",
    "I think the strength of this course was the level of intellectual challenge and variety of experiments we experienced. While I was introduced to many concepts at a much higher level than my prior experience did not fully prepare me for, the support I received (especially from our teaching fellow) allowed me to rise to the challenge and learn at this higher levelfor example, prior to this course I had absolutely no coding experience, and now have some basic python knowledge. I think the weakness was the length and tediousness of some of the labssome were designed so that basic introductory experiments took a long time and made the process very stressful.",
    "Well, if you're a physics major you have to take it. I think the problem with Physics 205 has nothing really to do with the course itselfit's just the nature of the material. It's not really that interesting to push a cart up and down a ramp and write about it in five notebook pages and five google docs pages. And even though the professor and TA were super nice, when it's 10pm the night before and you have a ton of homework and you realize you have to spend 4 hours basically copying what you wrote in your lab notebook into your write up, you're not super fond of 205, no matter what it's like. The gyroscopes and torsional oscillators were cool, though! Adding Python was just a good idea, too. I guess what could improve this class is cutting out the boring labs and working with the gyroscopes more often. And also getting rid of the typed write-ups - just writing in our lab notebook essentially serves the same purpose!! Alternatively, being able to substitute research for credit for physics lab would be great I know people who did research in a physics lab before taking 205L and it worked out alright for them.",
    "The TFs were great and very helpful, always willing to help us along if we got stuck, and merciful if we missubmitted something on Canvas. A few minor points which could have been better: 1) it would be nice if we had a more thorough guide to lab summaries and notebooks, as well as Python commands, 2) the sheer multiplicity of different assignments was hard to keep track of, especially at the beginning, and 3) labs generally took significantly longer than the time of the class. It would be nice if either labs were shortened to fit within the timeframe or the classtime was extended, so we could budget our time accordingly.",
    "The strengths of this course lie in the breadth of fundamental review of physics concepts in tangible form. These experiments were generally well-designed and engaging. Additionally, the equipment we used was important to familiarize oneself with. The best part of the class academically was the introduction of Python and its integration into the curriculum. It is a great new skill that the class beautifully incorporates into the classic physics fundamental experiments. The main flaw of the class is in the timing. There was a systematic issue with the class running an hour late. One time I got out at 6PM out of a 130PM lab. This either needs to be rectified by making the labs shorter or advertising the class time as longer so people can plan ahead.",
    "205L is like a game in which the referee withholds all the rules yet still penalizes you for not knowing them. The stated intent of the class to provide an intro lab in which students are expected to think for themselves, without hand holding could have resulted in a challenging but engaging environment. Instead, it's just punitive. Rather than introduce difficult concepts or provoke genuine critical thinking, 205L makes elementary ideas and tasks needlessly complicated with confusing, inarticulate, and often straight-out bizarrely written prelabs and labs. Since expectations for your lab notebook and summary reports are never really laid out in detail (outside of a few brief, unhelpful documents on Canvas), you're totally in the dark about what you're supposed to put in your work until you're marked down for it. Many of the labs are too long, and most weeks the majority of my section would stay 30 minutes to an hour over. On the bright side, you get to see some cool stuff in the labs, and most of us (at least the people I talked with in my section) ended up with good enough average grades by the end of the semester. It's just miserable getting there. The course could be much improved with clearer materials and expectations, as well as more reasonably timed experiments."

   "comments": [
    "If another student wants to become a researcher I would definitely recommend this course. The skills and knowledge you learn for doing research or lab testing is extremely important for getting valid and useful results. If they did not want to be a researcher, I may recommend a lower level lab, as this lab was quite intensive for the first few weeks, and it requires a fair bit of work to be done.",
    "Yes. I have recommended this course to two other students. I gave them the caveat that its secretly way more than half a credits worth of work",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to really engage with the physics experiments you complete. It was a tough transition at first, but I'm grateful for the experience that I gained and the learning curve I was able to overcome.",
    "I would definitely recommend this lab to students interested in physics, even if it's not required for their major. Lab offers a very tangible and intuitive understanding of physics that is difficult to get from the classroom, and especially toward the end of the semester, the workload was comparatively minimal and really allowed us to focus on the experiments during the lab period rather than outside of class.",
    "I would recommend PHYS 205L over the other intro physics lab sequence to any student. PHYS 205L offers more independence and the experiments are more interesting. The lab course is also a great way to get a more intuitive handle on many of the concepts covered in intro physics, such as harmonic oscillators and gyroscopes. As a bonus, you get to develop your programming skills in python.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone if they're interested in lab physics, but not if they're not entirely willing to put in the necessary work.",
    "For any student going into chemistry or physics, this is a very good course in showing how the physics you learn are put into practice and it is very good if you want to learn how to use python to analyze data. If you aren't looking for any of those, then I probably wouldn't recommend this course.",
    "It's inevitable if you're a physics intensive major. If you're a typical Yale STEM high-achiever who likes taking the highest level course that you can take, then go for it. Otherwise I don't really see why you would take this instead of 165L.",
    "Yes! For the reasons I listed above, I feel this course helped me grow intellectually; it was the perfect mix of fast-paced challenge and a comfortable, supportive environment.",
    "Since this course is required for the physics major, you can't escape it if that's what your major is. While this course has received a lot of negative feedback in the past, they made changes that really make it different than what it used to be. The write-ups are done in class now, so there is significantly less out of class work. They also teach you to do a bit of data analysis using Python instead of Excel. While some of the labs aren't particularly interesting, this class is perfectly doable and not as bad as it used to be. That being said, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who didn't need it for their major, and I would recommend to most people to wait to take it until after their first-year fall semester, just so they have some college level intro physics under their belt to help better understand the labs.",
    "Yes\/Sorta. It's a necessary and (somewhat) satisfactory course for physical science majors, but if you're not in that crowd, it won't be an enjoyable experience.",
    "Only if you are forced to take it!",
    "I would recommendgreat people and relatively interesting experiments",
    "Take it only if you have to."
