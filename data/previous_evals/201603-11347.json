   "comments": [
    "I gained skills in sight singing, dictation, and figured bass realization. I think I found particular progress in my skills of rhythmic dictation, finding myself able to more complicated rhythms in a variety of styles much more clearly. I also felt that my skills with harmonic dictation were well-served with the class, feeling confident about hearing applied dominants, augmented sixths, and neapolitans, as well as diatonic chords.",
    "I feel as though my musicianship improved greatly.",
    "This course was amazing at improving my ear. I can now identify chords, hear intervals, and analyze rhythms like never before. Also I can read alternate clefs and am better, though not near good enough at all, at figured bass realization and score reduction. Andrew gave us the tools to expand our thinking and ability to listen to music. For example, Andrew often had us sight-sing parts of a bach chorale together in class. I often was not very good at these. By the end of the course I had identified which intervals chronically gave me trouble and I'd walk around for a few days hearing a car drive by at a certain pitch and think, \"Quick! What's a major third below?\" Andrew is an extremely responsive professor who goes out of his way to make sure his students fully understand the material. He is a gem in the music department.",
    "The curriculum this semester had more breadth but less depth than in previous installments of the course (according to what I have heard from previous students). We covered harmonic dictation up to and including secondary dominance, modulation, Neopolitans, and augmented sixths; melodic dictation (tonal according to the chords listed above as well as atonal); sight-singing (treble, bass, and C-oriented clefs, and again both tonal and atonal); and metric theory (rhythmic dictation, diatonic rhythms, etc.). In keyboard lab, we tacked on figured bass reading and score reading. All of these are hugely useful (and essential) practical skills for any music theorist or performer, so the content always felt relevant and engaging.",
    "I developed my ear training and sight-singing abilities to a greater degree. I found our examination of rhythms in pop music quite interesting. I also developed specific keyboard skills, such as figured bass reading and melody harmonization."

   "comments": [
    "I think the course really doesn't have enough class time to accomplish its goals, but spends the time it does have very well. In particular, we spent the most time on rhythm and harmony and I felt that I improved very much with these skills. However, we spent very little time on sight-singing, which I think limited the utility of the class in developing these skills (especially since basically the only times we sang alone were the exams!). In general, it seemed that dictation was emphasized a lot more heavily than sight singing. I felt that the time taken discussing pop music was well-spent since it gave a more diverse view of music than one usually gets. Similar forays into atonal music were interesting, but they felt less well-developed - we didn't really build up skills with such music in an organized way (especially singing, which happened a little bit some weeks, and not at all others).",
    "The course was strong in ear training, but perhaps weak in keyboard lab.",
    "It should definitely be made a full credit and have recorded sight-singing assignments and also have a much more serious keyboard lab. I wish I had the time to improve my ability to shrink down scores and more quickly understand chords, but the way the keyboard lab is set up, I was able to get significantly better but am no where near proficient. I only had to practice an hour a week before section, and that's what I did. In an ideal world I would have done more, but I can't devote so many hours to a half credit course. It's just not economical. If the course were a full credit, I would encourage the pace of keyboard lab to be much quicker and for there to be much more at-home work (in the form of recorded sight-singing or whatever else the teacher felt fit). Furthermore, Andrew spent a lot of time covering rhythms and it was really cool. Encourage teachers to explore their own interests for a class or two as he did. I learned a lot because he was able to share his way of thinking. Also the class takes up a large amount of time for a half-credit course. Half an hour keyboard section, an hour prep, two hours of course time, half hour transcription per week. That's 5 hours. That's half of a course on the heavier side workload wise. Push the work further and make it a credit. I feel like keyboard lab was full of skills real life musicians need and it's a shame I left better, but still quite bad at them.",
    "Andrew did a great job of including different types of activities this year that hadn't previously been included in the curriculum. In particular, he introduced a rhythm unit that I think we all enjoyed and benefited a lot from. If I were pressed to offer suggestions for improvement, I'd probably recommend two things. (1) More slow-paced and structured sight-singing instruction along with sight-singing homework to reinforce new concepts. That's the way sight-singing was done in 218, and frankly, it was more effective. For instance, I think introducing unfamiliar clefs and atonal sight-singing shouldn't have been done in massive bites with only the general directive to \"flip through Melodia and sing whatever you find\" to practice on one's own. Rather, those concepts should have been introduced in little nibbles--with short homework assignments specifically selected to help us get our feet wet in each new clef \/ interval pattern \/ etc. I realize that practicing sight-singing excerpts somewhat defeats the purpose of sight-singing, and perhaps that's why Andrew didn't give us sight-singing homework like previous instructors had. At the same time, taking the time to practice particular intervals, note recognition on unfamiliar staves, etc. is the only way to truly build fluency in sight-singing. (2) A better feedback loop. Though we always received scores on written quizzes promptly, we never got scores for sight-singing assessments or keyboard lab. It would have been useful to know how we were doing in the class as we were progressing through it and what areas for improvement the instructor had identified in each of us individually so that we could hone in on those skills outside of class.",
    "Strengths of the course include the low workload and flexible curriculum."

    "Yes ; it was very engaging and beneficial",
    "This course is flippin' fantastic. (Are you allowed to curse on these?) If you want to improve your ear, but can't find the time to do it, this course is literally giving you free ear training practice. In this course I learned how to read alternate clefs, and read difficult sight-singing passages. It helped me identify what intervals I was hesitant on and I practiced them at home and am now a new man. This course feels like no work, but ends up sucking more time out of your week than you realize. Keyboard section teaches you, but I wish that were it's own course on its own. Tacked on to this course, there's not much time to practice and really get into understanding piano realization like a real musician would have to.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course. Frankly, most people take this class just because they have to fill the prereqs for the music major or coreqs for lessons for credit (as was the case with me). To my pleasant surprise, this class turned out to be one of my favorites this semester and something I genuinely looked forward to. A lot of it has to do with the fact that Andrew is a really chill, intelligent, and super engaging instructor, so try to get him if you can. What you learn in the class is also incredibly practical for any performing musician or music theory student, and you'll be able to apply what you learn in this class to your other musical activities immediately. So in sum, it's a must, and I'd say that even if this class wasn't institutionally mandated to be a must.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who wishes to improve his or her sight-singing and ear training abilities."
