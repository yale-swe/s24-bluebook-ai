    "This is a fantastic class and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in math, formal languages, or anything of that nature. The problem sets are not difficult and are fairly regular. Also the final and midterm schedule is perfect for the class. Be mindful, though, of the grading, because the problem sets must be very specific in some of the proofs.",
    "This is a seriously terrific course. I had a lot of fun, learned lots of cool things, and wasn't ever overwhelmed by the workload. But make no mistake about it: Formal Foundations is primarily a math class, rather than a linguistics class. Happily, the math is always super interesting, and relatively straight-forward, as long as you attend lectures. There's a lot of fun drawing, especially near the end of the course, and the problem sets are actually really stimulating.But most of the work requires solid mathematical intuition. You don't need to be a savant, but it really helps to have some ability to see a pattern, or see how things connect. If you're good at Sudoku, you'll love this course. But if this doesn't sound like you, then Formal Foundations might not be your best option.A quick word on the classes themselves: Gaja is a great lecturer, and particularly good at interacting with you during the lecture. If you're confused, she'll respond in a way that helps you clear up your confusion for yourself, rather than just repeating the material. Very helpful."
