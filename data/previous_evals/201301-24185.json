    "While I wouldn't have taken this class if I didn't need a science credit, I thought it was a very enjoyable, doable, and legitimate way to fulfill the requirement. I would definitely recommend the class to anyone interested in nuclear-related topics or who wants to be able to talk knowledgeably about any nuclear events that come up in the news.",
    "not too much work and fascinating exploration of a radiation.",
    "Take it if you are interested in nuclear technology. You will learn a lot about how nuclear tech actually works, how to quantify the threat of a nuclear accident or weapon to make some sense of the numbers that the news throw around when reporting nuclear related issues. Interesting class.",
    "If you are interested in learning about nuclear science and its applications without getting too deeply into the math, this is a great class.",
    "It's nuclear technology.",
    "I would, especially if you need a Science credit and are interested in nuclear policy.",
    "Relaxed class about the uses of nuclear technology. Lots of fascinating information, not much in-depth, technical science.",
    "Good class, really interesting overview of nuclear technology and a lot of the vocabulary that goes along with that. Not too much work, given how much new stuff you learn."
