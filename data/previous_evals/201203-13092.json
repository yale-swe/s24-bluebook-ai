   "comments": [
    "It is a great class for learning and understanding what is going on in the environment. Very interesting",
    "Take it if you want to learn the nuts and bolts of climate change, or if you're interested in environmental science.",
    "i did not like this course. it is supposed to be for non science majors and even though i HAVE taken environmental classes before, it was one of my hardest classes at yale. just seemed very poorly taught... the professors were way too vague and colloquial in class, but expected us to know the actual scientific terms for tests and psets. and they frequently referred to the book as \"wrong\", even as we kept using it",
    "I would not recommend this class. You don't learn in a way that is helpful and the exams ask questions about specific topics we breezed over or that just aren't taught very well.",
    "To any Yale administrators reading this: THIS IS THE WORST CLASS AT YALE! PLEASE DISCONTINUE! HONESTLY!It was a poorly organized, poorly taught, all-around unpleasant experience. The syllabus was not clear, though the professors didn't really follow it. The TFs had no idea what was going on...one literally told me that he knew nothing about the subject matter, and to talk to another TF. It was quite difficult, though mostly because the grading was incredibly unfair and the tests asked questions about things WE HAD NEVER COVERED IN LECTURE. For Wettlaufer, we followed the readings at least, but with Pagani they weren't related at all. Also, the teaching was just awful, lectures were boring and confusing, and the sections didn't help at all!This was confusingly taught, poorly taught, and not really what it's billed as. It's not about modern climate change, but more about climate history of the last 55 million years. The lectures aren't interesting at all, and just show pictures of incredibly complex graphs the whole time. They tricked us by showing a movie the first day.I cannot convince you enough: This is an awful, miserable, ungodly bad class.",
    "yes! I liked it. Was not too much work. I liked it and learned a lot",
    "Take it only if you are geology major.",
    "Awful class. I wanted to learn about global warming but instead I just ended up having to memorize all these minute details about the chemistry of the ocean, etc. Wettlaufer was a fine teacher but Pagani was terrible--worst teacher I've ever had. He gave extremely vague, jumbled descriptions of really complicated concepts and when people asked him questions, he basically just repeated what he said the first time. I had to learn everything from the second half of the semester on my own.",
    "This is not a gut, and it is not an easy class if you are looking to pick up a science credit as a non-science major. I luckily was taking the class with a close friend that was an environmental studies major, and he helped me out with figuring out the problem sets and understanding the material for the midterms and finals. If you are a non-science major looking for a science credit, I would NOT recommend this class to you, because it is not as-advertised. If you are a science major, or are intent on learning more about the environment and climate change, then take it. Overall, It is advertised as an easy class, but you have bi-weekly problem sets, two midterms, and a final.",
    "This class is not what it seems. While some of the course material is very relevant and interesting, save yourself and just by the books, because honestly I think I learned more from them than from Wettlaufer and Pagani's jumbled lectures. The tests and problem sets (especially in Pagani's half) are tricky and often don't even reflect the concepts from lectures, and while the class is supposedly designed for non science majors, many of the concepts are very science oriented but hard to comprehend if you are not a science person. Not worth it, especially if you are looking for a distributional science credit!",
    "Don't take it... it's more stress than it's worth. The material is important to know, but you end up doing a lot on your own.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student interested in studying climate change and the processes that drive it, so long as the student in question has a relatively strong background in science. I would not, however, recommend it to a student that wants a class to fulfill the science distribution requirement, unless that student has a strong science background, especially in physics and chemistry.",
    "Take this class if you want to understand the basics of climate changes on Earth. This course does not only focus on our modern climate change, but on many changes in climate during the Earth's history. It is a class designed for non-science majors and does not have any requirements. EVST 125 will also probably be part of the curriculum for the Energy track that will open soon at Yale, so if you are interested in energy in general, and especially renewable energy, take this class. Professors Pagani and Wettlaufer are awesome!",
    "I would definitely not recommend this class to another student. It was vague and confusing so I felt like I wasn't learning a lot, and it was also difficult so I never felt like I was doing well.",
    "If it is taught by different professors yes, because this is an important and interesting issue but the way it was taught largely ruined the material. Take it if it isn't taught be wettlaufer or pagani",
    "I highly recommend not taking this class. Prof. Pagani has a weird sense of humor and his lectures are extremely disorganized. His method of teaching was underwhelming, the problem sets did not connect with the material he was teaching, and the grading regime was murky at best. We had to buy an text book that was not used once during the entire course. Lectures were broad in nature, while exams were extremely specific and detailed. Pagani asked us to interact with him, but when people asked questions, he belittled and condescended upon them. Class room atmosphere was uncomfortable, which is attested to by the precipitously dropping class attendance once he started teaching.",
    "Absolutely not. It is impossible to actually learn anything and it is not taught well.",
    "In the first semester you'll learn general information about how the climate works, and in the second you'll learn about climate history and whatever else Professor Pagani is studying at the time. Most of the time you won't have to work very hard, but there will be brief periods where you have a very heavy workload. I would recommend the course to anyone interested in the subject, but not for someone looking for a class to coast through. The professors don't expect you to know the topic inside and out, but you'll have to work to assimilate all of the concepts they expect you to understand. If climate science interests you, I'd definitely recommend the course!",
    "The worst academic experience I have ever had at Yale. The professors don't care about the class AT ALL. No one knows what's going on. And the TFs are clueless! They couldn't tell you anything about the course because they never came to lecture or spoke with the professors. One even told us that he was just there to get paid by grading our psets from the answer key (which one of the professors refused to post), and that he had no clue what was going on in the class. This class COULD have been interesting. But with how poorly taught and organized it was (the grading was terrible, too), it should never be offered again. This is not a gut, it's a disaster. Take a harder class that is better-taught over a supposedly \"easy\" class that is not managed well. The professors don't even hold office hours (and they are required to).",
    "No. Didn't learn much.",
    "Cool climate class, more sciency than you might be expecting."
