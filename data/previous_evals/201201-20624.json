    "Only if required.",
    "This class is 90% mathematics and 10% physics. it is an inefficient way of gaining physical intuition about electrodynamics. I would not recommend this class to anyone not required to teach it or take the qualifying exams.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It is a waste of time, the physics is uninspired and doesn't particularly help anyone learn the material. The homeworks are awful (pages and pages of math for no reason!). If possible, don't take this class!",
    "Good course to refresh knowledge about Maxwell equations and learn how to solve a boundary value problem.",
    "My advice to a fellow student would be to place out of it if at all possible. If they could not place out, I would strongly suggest that they put off taking it until Professor Read was not teaching it.",
    "Yes",
    "This is a class with extremely tough homework. Doing it takes a huge amount of time.",
    "I would not recommend the course.",
    "It is required and moreover it could be taught better."

    "I can honestly say this class had the lowest \"things learned to work required\" ratio of any class I've taken in my undergrad\/grad career but that seems to be by design.",
    "Very little. I feel that I am much better prepared to solve certain sets of mathematical problems, but I do not believe my insight into how electric and magnetic phenomenon occur has changed significantly.",
    "This course didn't deep my knowledge and it won't contribute to my research.",
