   "comments": [
    "Strong basis on epi methods and political issues with outbreak investigation. Loved the CDC trainings, etc but could ahve been better integrated. Best part was hearing outbreak stories.",
    "STRENGTHS - The professors have real experience with outbreaks and have interesting stories to tell, so you get a good understanding of the real procedures that are followed during an investigation - There is little outside work associated with this course - The subject matter is interesting - The integration of emerging outbreaks: Zika and the E.coli outbreaks, was well done WEAKNESSES - For a more \"applied\" course- we got to do very little in this course. Ideally, it would have been helpful to actually develop a line listing, a questionnaire, an epi curve, etc-instead of just reading about them. - The case studies from the CDC were nice, but we didn't need to separate them over 4 classes. We could have been made to do it as a homework and just discussed it in class afterwards. That would have been more helpful than the theoretical textbook questions. - Story time was much too long during class and it seemed as though the professors didn't know what they wanted to talk about that day---we rarely followed the syllabus towards the end. - The homeworks rarely related to what we were talking about in class. Perhaps the time would be better spent as 1 hr of lecture (covering topics from the readings), 1 hr of applied work--developing line lists, questionnaires,case studies, etc) - The final exam, again, is not applied and only tests us based on theoretical knowledge. Having a case study be the final exam would have been a better test of our knowledge--to see if we could apply what we learned - Providing rubrics for our final project would have been helpful--so we could see what we are being marked on. - We could have covered more outbreak topics instead of focusing on food borne and Legionella outbreaks for so long.",
    "more feedback on open ended quizzes would be nice. doing more cases studies and going through them more quickly in class. the instructors were all extremely qualified to teach this course and had really interesting personal stories to share about working in the health department or working as EIS officers. That was probably my favorite part of the class.",
    "I think this course really came up short the vast majority of students. The syllabus had been revamped from the previous offering so I went into it with an open mind and an optimistic attitude that it would be good but was really quite disappointed. First, the use of the textbook really did not add anything to the course. With the exception of a few chapters, most of the book felt like a review of epidemiology 1 and the homework questions were so blatantly obvious, most of the time reading the text was not actually necessary. The online training sessions we had to do were somewhat interesting but they were never incorporated into the class discussions or acknowledged at all so in the end it was just extra busy work. The CDC case studies were actually interesting, I think those were the main thing I enjoyed from the class but we spent WAY to long on each one. The case would be dragged out for 3 or 4 weeks when in reality, we could have just done it in one class. We could have accomplished so much more if we hadn't spent such a long time on each topic. Next, I think the stories and anecdotes from the professors were interesting but every single class felt like a story time. I appreciate the real life experience that the professors have had but I don't think it adds anything to hear 5 different stories about cases or outbreaks of legionnaires... 1 or 2 would suffice. Finally, I think having a final project presentation, final paper, and in class final exam is overkill and just felt unnecessary.",
    "All of the instructors have tons of experience in the field, which allowed for some great discussions about their previous work. Case studies were useful to a point, but it took much longer to get through the case studies than it should have. The final project was easy, but I'm not sure what I really got out of it. Making up an outbreak then having to \"answer\" questions about it during the presentation (which just turned into making up things on the spot) doesn't seem like the best way to use the things we learned throughout the semester. Also, the need for a final project, paper, and exam seems excessive especially given the fact that all three components seem more like time-fillers than ways to test our knowledge of the course materials.",
    "I think this class could have used greater rigor. Too much time was spent telling stories rather than challenging us to think about applied public health and how our training fits into daily work. It is very valuable for students to have a course working with public health practitioners. I think this can be enhanced. A lot of the basic epidemiology covered in this course was already covered in other required courses and this class can and should take the student experience, particularly towards application, further.",
    "I really liked this course. It had a low workload, and yet was fascinating and learned a lot about the practical aspects of epidemiology.",
    "Ahhhhh, this class. I really wanted to love this class. I didn't. I loved the final assignment. The kind of creative thinking required to make up a fictitious outbreak was exactly the kind of thing that I want to be doing with my brain, and presenting it and writing it up pushed my communication skills. The multiple choice homeworks were not very inspiring. The essay-type case-report-based homeworks were much much better. The final was similarly uninspiring, along the lines of \"this feels like a waste of my time\". So, I think it would be delightful if you could tap into the parts of the class that engaged my thinking and my enthusiasm and used them in the rest of the class. It would give everyone a genuinely rewarding reason to get up in the morning and show up to class. I don't feel like writing a ten-page paper into this course review, but I'd be happy to talk more about what I wish this class was, so feel free to reach out to me. Ben",
    "I had high expectations entering this class, but left very disappointed. Strengths: - Learned the ins-and-outs of working in a state health department Weaknesses: - Class time was consistently more like \"story time\". Truthfully, I am not sure what we actually were supposed to learn during class. - Overall, it was very, very disorganized. The instructors appeared not to communicate well amongst themselves. - The homework questions did not require thought and answers could be found verbatim from the textbook. - Going through case-studies was a good idea, but implemented very poorly. Working through a single case over the span of weeks fragmented and prolonged the process. - The final project, in which we \"create\" and present an outbreak, seemed a stretch. It may have been more worthwhile to have groups go through an actual outbreak.",
    "Good class overall. Informative in terms of understanding public health practice for outbreak investigation. The book was a good resource. Enjoyed the case-study based teaching approach. Thought the homework was manageable and generally useful. Creative assignments. Thoughtful professors. And the final exam wasn't bad at all. Appreciated it.",
    "I very much liked the course and thought it about it a great deal, hence this long course evaluation. I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Cartter's accounts of legionella, anthrax, Zika, E. coli., and other outbreaks which were of interest to the class. The Zika presentations were an interesting exercise although it got boring hearing the same presentation over and over again- we should have been split among Guillen Barre syndrome and microcephaly. I thought the guest lecturers from the state lab and the Sanitarian were good inclusions which highlighted the various public health team members. Similarly I thought the other state epidemiologists were assets to the class, although sometimes it led to organizational uncertainty about who was talking and who was leading what groups as they sort of looked at each other. This course really benefits from Dr. Cartter's leadership and when he wasn't able to be present because of other demands on his time, he was truly missed. I had mixed feelings about the textbook because on one hand it covered many important outbreak related topics, but on the other it was rather simple. We've all had Principles of Epidemiology and the book largely rehashes these topics and adds small insights here and there. I don't think this textbook is necessary and would have appreciated selected readings from actually published in the literature. The online quizzes were silly exercises with ridiculous distractor questions. Although I read the chapters, this wasn't necessary to answer the questions. The online training components were pretty good; I especially liked the Salmonella in the Caribbean one. I'm somewhat less keen on the in-class case studies we did. The legionella one was really good, but in general we went through them too slowly, spending much of the time reading aloud the case information and questions. No one likes to read these things out loud. We even said so midway through the semester and yet our feedback wasn't heeded. I enjoyed preparing and delivering our outbreak presentations. This was a rigorous exercise which served as a nice recap for the semester. We fielded some thoughtful questions from the instructors and I think this element is a very important element in our development. Critical discussions and feedback are highly valuable and we could have used more of it throughout the semester, as opposed to just at the very beginning with the Zika and outbreak presentations. The graded\/written feedback we received after the presentation was also a bit lacking. Lastly, and I know this is certainly in the other evals as well, the final exam wasn't necessary. It was designed to constitute a small part of our grade and as we all expected, was composed of the book questions we had already seen. Besides that, in a surreal moment we were all handed the exam answer key instead of the actual exam. So the final exam was poorly conceived and executed. Despite some these concerns, the course was probably my favorite of the semester as we were privy to some very important insights about applied epidemiology from practitioners and I'm glad I took it!",
    "This class was rather frustratingthe topics and teachers all have an incredible amount of potential, but the execution was a bit sloppy. I believe most of that was due to the fact that the class had been recently redesigned, so we had to work out quite a few kinks over the course of the semester. However, some of these kinks seemed like they could have been avoided. For example, we had a guest lecturer that had never given any sort of extended lecture before, which was fairly evident in her affect. Additionally, the answer key for the final exam was accidentally copied and distributed, rather than the actual final. Things like this were scattered through the class enough for it to be distracting and detracting, rather than an occasional laugh. Personally, the in-class CDC-directed case study discussions felt like they could have been more effective. Having us read the questions out loud to each other felt rather childish, and I feel like the entire exercise could've operated better as a homework assignment, rather than the fairly trivial textbook questions we had (which promoted looking for the answers, rather than actually reading, synthesizing, and producing an answer, which is what the few case-study homework assignments we had required). On the other hand, the in-class case studies that described actual outbreaks, both historical and ongoing, were great learning experiences. They demonstrated to us some of the actual on-the-ground work that needs to go on, as well as introducing the ethical framework in which many of these rapid decisions need to be made. Hearing about Zika, Legionnaires, and the goat E. coli outbreak were very interesting. The textbook was excellent, it provided us with a great guide to field epidemiology. I do wish the homework questions were a bit more thoughtfulthe provided ones, while easier for the professors to grade, ultimately resulted in word searches. The amount of videos that we watched during class was somewhat frustrating. I wouldve happily watched many of these on my own time, outside of class. Since in-class time is so limited to begin with, due to the nature of the CT DPH work schedule, I wouldve preferred to use every last minute of that time actually learning. Finally, I think the online certifications we needed to take were both interesting and useful, though they were also easy to speed through, since the post-test evaluations were incredibly easy.",
    "The strength of this course is that the professors work in disease outbreak and are able to provide us with a lot of information on what is currently going on as provide us with their own history of working in disease outbreaks. It was great to have that real world experience brought into the classroom. The weaknesses of the class is that because the professors work in the health department it seems that they did not have the time needed to build a course. A lot of our assignments seemed to be an afterthought when creating them. The lecturers were not organized in that when one of the other professors were asked to speak they always seemed surprised and were not prepared to lecture to us. When there were guest lecturers we were never prepared for their visits nor were we notified that they would be coming to class. The class assignments were remedial in that we spent a majority of our time reading the CDC case studies used for EIP training's, before answering the following questions. When we brought up our concerns about how we spend our time in during class the professors seemed to be listening but did not incorporate any of our ideas and removed the portions of the class that we wanted to focus on (i.e tangible skills such as creating line list). For our final project we had to design an outbreak and write an outbreak report but we had not covered any of these reports during the semester. It would have been very helpful if the professors had included some of the outbreak reports that they had worked on at the end of their lecture. During our final exam it was clear that the professors were not prepared because Draft was typed across every page of the exam and all of the answers were italicized. They then had two students correct and print off additional copies of the exams while the rest of the students waited in a class room for half an hour."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0ALL PROFESSORS WERE SO RECEPTIVE. Probably the most receptive professors at YSPH; literally took half a class period to get feedback to improve the course; all very responsive via email. Phenomenal, overall.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0Matt is very nice and seems very approachable. He is clearly very knowledgeable and has real-world experience in outbreaks. However, he and the rest of the professors could try to better integrate our mid-term feedback. None, if any, of our feedback\/concerns were addressed in the latter half of the course.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0It is clear that Professor Cartter, and the other professors, have had a great deal of experience in the areas they are teaching about and I appreciate their input to the class. That being said, I don't think this class needs 5 professors by any means. Further, Professor Cartter did not take feedback very well and I found this to be extremely frustrating. For example, the professors asked the class for mid-semester feedback about the course, which we were happy to provide. However afterward, the course went in almost the complete opposite direction from what the students had hoped for and I was very disappointed by this. We wanted to speed up the cases, do less small group discussions, and actually learn the things on the syllabus that we had skipped over (i.e. creating line listings, questionnaire development, etc.) Instead, all the things we had asked to do were instead taken off the syllabus, and we kept doing the same old thing. Professor Cartter seemed defensive when given the class feedback and it was frustrating because if there was really no room for change, then asking for feedback in the first place was pointless.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0Very kind and supportive of students.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0Wonderful when talking about his own personal experiences. Teaching epidemiology was slightly boring.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0Very knowledgeable about outbreak investigations and appreciated his ability to bring in personal work experience as he taught. Did not always circle back to summarize the information we were supposed to be learning outside of the course. So I think going forward, this would be a good approach. Generally approachable, quick responses to emails. Would take another course with him.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0Dr. Cartter's perspective made this course extremely interesting. His experience and ability to tell a compelling epidemiological story was the best part of the class. As such, we really missed him when he wasn't able to attend class, which although disappointing was nonetheless understandable given his responsibilities. Moreover, Dr. Cartter asks pointed questions which lead into some thoughtful discussions.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0Dr. Cartter brought an incredible wealth of experience to the classroom. I think some of the most valuable things I gathered from this class came from his own personal anecdotes about previous and current outbreak investigations. He frequently asked us for feedback throughout the semester to adapt and make the class work better, which I appreciated, and I believe was implemented well. Unfortunately, we did not get to see him too much through the semester. Whether work took him away or we had guest speakers, the time he actually spent teaching was fairly limited, which was a shame. I appreciated his engagement in the course, and it felt like he was trying to maintain a professional attitude despite the mishaps that seemed to reappear week after week.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0Matthew Cartter has a lot of experience which is nice to hear about. However, throughout the semester it seemed that he had other obligations and would not show up to our class and would not give us a warning nor a reason for this. By the end of the semester it felt discouraging to not have him in class without any reason for his absence. When he did show up to class, it did not seem as if he was prepared to lecture in that the class was very disorganized. He would also ask for some of the other professors to present but gave them very little to no warning that they would be teaching that day."

   "comments": [
    "A good look into outbreak investigation. Loved that used case studies and related to current outbreaks rather than only relying on historical examples. Might be improved by better management of in class time but, overall, utility of the course relies on interaction with the amazing professors with a lot of great EIS\/PH experience and outbreak response practice.",
    "I would recommend this course because outbreak is a huge part of epidemiology and deserves to be studied. However, the way the course is currently structured, I am not sure that the student will take much away. I was disappointed with how little we were actually able to do and apply what we know. Learning about the theory (such as odds ratio, p-values, etc) is mostly review to most of us, so it would have been better to actually do something with this knowledge.",
    "If you are interested in public health practice and are interested in working at the CDC\/health department\/doing outbreak investigations someday definitely take this class!",
    "I think the class has potential, and people would be interested to take something like this in the future. As the class stands now though, I would not recommend it to other students. Specifically, I would not recommend it to EMD students and particularly second year students. I think it could be a good sort of crash course to infectious diseases, surveillance, outbreak etc. for non-EMD students but I think most EMD people found it redundant.",
    "Good review of basic epidemiology but not a rigorous course. You are not going to develop a lot of new skills.",
    "People from the CT state department of health come to YSPH to relay experiences about their work. Also some covering of epidemiology and some practical experience. Would definitely take again.",
    "This class was a lot of fun in the last two weeks. I hope they can work on making the first 12 weeks comparably fun. Guardedly recommended for anyone interested in the topic.",
    "I would summarize this course as disorganized and severely lacking. I would not recommend this course to other students.",
    "Great course if interested in outbreak investigations. Would recommend.",
    "A must take it if you're interested in outbreaks or applied epidemiology! The course is true to its name and covers the investigative and reporting on disease outbreaks with a strong basis on real outbreaks in Connecticut and other states.",
    "This class was a good introduction to many different topics associated with disease outbreaks. I think with a bit of restructuring and smoothing over, this could be an incredibly effective course. Even if it isn't, the experience you get from actually talking to, interacting with, and learning from DPH employees is well worth it if you are planning to pursue a career in public service.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. Overall, the professors did not seem dedicated to the class nor did they have the time necessary to build the course. While they are all very nice and have a lot of experience in the field, they did not seem ready to teach the course. It might be better if there was a full time faculty member that administered the course and brought in the DPH employees as guest lecturers."
