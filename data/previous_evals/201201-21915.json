   "comments": [
    "Great way to get credit for research. That's all there is to it.",
    "Do it if you like research!! :) Find a lab you love.",
    "Fairly painless way to get credit for your research. Proposal is due early in the term though and written report at the end is a pain.",
    "Yes. Everyone should do some research.",
    "Take it",
    "Yes, it is a great experience for understanding how to build and manage your own project. I would recommend to do it for more than one term and continuously.",
    "Do this for an MBB credit: you get research experience (hopefully fun!) and get to apply your brain in a real-life (non-classroom) setting.",
    "I would recommend it. The class is what it is. Research for Credit.",
    "This is a good way to get course credit if you're going to be doing research anyway. There is not too much work apart from the actual research itself. Obviously, the nature of the course will vary with the lab that you are in, but I would not expect to be only putting in 10-12 hours a week of work in lab--probably more around 15 hours\/wk.",
    "Great for individual research. You will need to talk more with your PI and your lab mentor to flesh out a project. There isn't much guidance at all from Professor Garen.",
    "I highly recommend doing research in a lab outside of your area of expertise. I think I got a lot out of working in a BME lab as an MBB student. That said, to get anything done, you'll definitely be in the lab more like 15hrs per week. 10 would almost not be enough to get anything done.",
    "This course is an excellent way to get credit for doing research. If you are doing research anyways, I would highly recommend taking research for credit. All you have to do is a proposal, presentation, and final report, which are necessary for any research project anyways.",
    "Undergraduate research is tremendously worthwhile for science majors. Suddenly, your science lectures become urgently relevant. Performing research as an undergraduate is the best way to determine whether a career in scientific research is best for you and to prepare for a career in scientific research. Research for credit is a large time commitment and cannot be done all at once, so be prepared to make time for research, get a bike for quick transit to and from lab, and make the most of time in between classes. The teaching ability of postdocs in your lab will be a large determinant of how much you will learn during your experience. You can improve your grade in the course considerably by soliciting feedback from your mentor on drafts of your research proposal, talk, and report."
