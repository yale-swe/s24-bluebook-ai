    "I definitely learned a lot throughout the course of the semester, and I learned to put more thought into each decision I make. GD is so much more than moving things around to see what looks good. There is a meaning and a reason behind every choice in how something is typeset or aligned, and I truly have a greater understanding of how to convey different ideas with my work.",
    "A better grasp and understand of design, as well as a greater attention to detail",
    "For this course I learned many skills including critically looking at art, printing skills, and creativity thinking.",
    "In this course, I explored how to manipulate the shape, color, orientation, and placement of text and objects to evoke certain ideas or emotions.",
    "I learned how to be thoughtful and inventive when visualizing different ideas as well as better understanding how to arrange hierarchies of information.",
    "Basic graphic design composition, typography, etc.",
    "I gained a new understanding of graphic design, or, to be more specific, how to make abstract designs using analog tools like Xerox machines, scanners, etc., as well as an intro to Indesign and Photoshop (which I had no knowledge of before)."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely a lot of work, but nothing overwhelming. I don't really see a way to change anything.",
    "Lots of fundamentals, vocabulary, and contextualizing designers that help to establish a base from which to work. I wish less class time was spent on crits and powerpoints and we had more time in class to actually work and craft. More expenditures throughout the semester than covered in the materials fee, this should be made clear early on or a class budget should be accessible for low-income students.",
    "The assignments were extremely engaging and difficult that required a high level of attention and time. Our critiques were extremely helpful at improving our work and leaving from each other.",
    "I thought it was extraordinarily beneficial to do entirely analog work for the majority of the semester - having to cut out and manipulate objects by hand gave me much greater insight into how subtle changes can have an impact.",
    "The strengths of the course is that it is incredibly engaging as well as containing immersive projects. I loved the tone and the seriousness that crits took, although I did find some of them redundant.",
    "I liked all the analog assignments a lot. Perhaps more time could be spent on instruction as opposed to critiques in class."

    "Despite the amount of work, I LOVED this class. The skills you learn in this class are so integral to pretty much anything you may do in life, even if you are not studying art. You learn how to convey different ideas with typography, images, placement, etc. It pushes you to explore beyond the graphics you see in every day life, and it teaches you to put thought into every decision you make when designing something. Before taking this class, I though designs were something people did effortlessly; however, a lot of thought and effort goes into every choice, as slight differences can connote vastly different themes, ideas, or images. Julian is also a great teacher. He can criticize, but I think that helped me grow so much and pushed me to put more thought into each choice I made. I started it as CR\/D\/Fail, but he gives you a midterm grade, so you can gage where you are and decide what to do moving forward. I would highly recommend anyone take this class! It is a lot of work, but even as a 5th credit it was not bad. If you get in, definitely take it.",
    "Yes! My sense of design grew an amount that surprised me. Also, the final construction of the book was a feat that I could not have imagined even a couple months ago.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to people even if they aren't art majors. The skills we learned were very insightful and could be applied to many different aspects of art and disciplines.",
    "I LOVED this class and would highly recommend it to anyone who is remotely interested in design (even if not necessarily graphic design). It is extraordinarily helpful in teaching you how to analyze and interpret visual representations and every project was creatively and intellectually engaging. Plus, I enjoyed how we had multiple iterations of each project so that we could actually take advantage of the feedback we received in class to further push our ideas.",
    "Yes - graphic design is very important.",
    "Yes, if they're interested in graphic design it's a great place to start.",
    "Yes! I learned how to use my brain in a different way than even in the other art classes I've taken, maybe because \"design\" uses a higher level of abstraction than any other class I'd taken before. For this reason I'd recommend anyone take it."
