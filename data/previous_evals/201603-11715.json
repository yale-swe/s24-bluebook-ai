   "comments": [
    "My speaking skills improved a lot, and I was also able to polish a lot of the grammar concepts I learned in high school.",
    "Better understanding of Spanish grammar, better oral communication skills as well as writing skills.",
    "This course was really helpful for improving my grasp of Spanish grammar. Additionally, I felt that the class improved my speaking ability, something that I have not been able to improve studying Spanish in the past. The class participation combined with the oral presentations and the final oral exam facilitated frequent Spanish speaking.",
    "I learned many new vocabulary words in spanish and improved my oral speaking and writing due to the many in class assessments.",
    "My speaking ability improved the most from the course. I became much more fluid, and was able to speak quickly and still use complex grammatical structures. I did review some more advanced grammatical concepts, most of which I had been exposed to already in high school, but speaking was the main focus. The class is very discussion based, and though some of the discussions do involve culture, many other topics are discussed.",
    "How to speak and read elementary spanish",
    "By taking this course, I had improved my speaking and listening abilities. Coming into this course, I was fearful that I was placed too high -- only took three years of Spanish in high school -- but I was able to have the resources necessary to improve.",
    "My speaking ability in Spanish was greatly enhanced, and so were my vocabulary and grammar.",
    "I definitely became more fluent. I learned more nuances of the language.",
    "This course developed overall spanish skills: speaking, writing, reading, with emphasis on learning new vocabulary and improving grammar.",
    "This Spanish course improved my reading comprehension, fluidity\/confidence when speaking, and writing skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that the course assignments were all very similar to each other, and sometimes seemed redundant. A little more variety would have been nice.",
    "The class was somewhat repetitive and going to class every day might seem like a lot, however, the material was engaging and it's always fun to be speaking a new language. I feel like the class could be improved by changing the Supersite assignments and grading system for those. Professor Cividanes was the best instructor you could ever dream of though, she made the class so much better.",
    "Overall, the course is very well structured and catered to improving Spanish fluency. However, one weakness is in the daily homework. The online Supersite homework was often very time consuming and did not contribute much to the understanding and acquirement of the Spanish language.",
    "Personally I enjoyed the context of the course and learned a lot about hispanic culture that I did not know. The grammar aspect was all good because though students knew a lot of the grammar already it was good to brush up and improve on it.",
    "The course is taught in an enjoyable manner, with lots of discussions and activities in class. Thus, its main strength is facilitating Spanish discussion. The grammatical concepts are taught in class, but not in massive depth. You have to review some of the details before the exam, since the class is not focused on this. In some ways, the fact that the classes themselves revolve so much around texts and discussion, yet grammar is tested heavily, is its biggest weakness. It really is a great and fun class though.",
    "Course was very well taught. I would not recommend the online platform that was used for homework.",
    "Strengths -- forced me to speak everyday. Weaknesses -- Online Spanish HW (Enfoques) was not accurate.",
    "Strengths: Emphasis on useful speaking\/writing skills, the professor knew how to teach very well Weaknesses: Outside reading and the movie to be watched were a little boring, sometimes the supersite activities would go ahead of material covered in class",
    "I didn't learn much online homework for the course so i think that could be eliminated and more emphasis on teaching grammar lessons in class.",
    "The readings were very interesting and the reviews done the net class days were always helpful. Even if I didn't understand a reading that night, I fully understood it by the time we finished reviewing it. I also think that the class time was well divided between teaching and peer learning. My favorite lessons included the movie \"No\" and the art gallery assignment. In terms of improvement, the online homework often seemed more difficult than the practice problems done in class. Additionally, it seemed like the information given on what to study for the exams didn't always align with the exams themselves."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, Spanish was my favorite class, particularly because of my teacher.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class if you can take it with Professor Cividanes. The class meets everyday which can be a pain but honestly she made it so much better and fun. There's about 15 to 30 minutes of homework per day, but it's nothing too hard or overwhelming, in general the workload is extremely manageable and not too bad at all. All in all you'll get better at speaking and at writing in Spanish which is nice. And I can't stress it enough: take it with Professor Cividanes!! You will not regret it, she is the sweetest professor, always available to anyone, super flexible and understanding and she really does try to make the class fun for everyone, she's probably the best professor you can get for L4 Spanish!",
    "Yes, although the class meets everyday and there is a decent amount of work involved, it was a very rewarding experience. There was a noticeable improvement in my Spanish fluency, and this course has inspired me to potentially seek out study abroad programs.",
    "I would recommend this to another student who wants to improve their spanish and is willing to devote a good amount of time each week to it.",
    "This class was fun. The time spent in the classroom was always fun, Prof. Cividanes is extremely friendly and understanding. The workload is not brutal, but it is five days a week and the grading is harsh compared to high school language classes. That said, you will improve a lot (usually to the point of near fluency) and enjoy it. That's a rare combination to find in a class.",
    "Great for a pre req",
    "Yes, take this course to improve your Spanish skills.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was well taught and I definitely learned a lot.",
    "Yes, this class fits the L4 requirement and was enjoyable with a great teacher and fun class.",
    "Yes. If a students wants to improve their Spanish, I think that this class will definitely help them."
