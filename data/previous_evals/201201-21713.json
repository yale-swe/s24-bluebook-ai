   "comments": [
    "The class wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be.It covered much much more breadth than depth, so we really skimmed through composers. I would have much preferred if we focused on a few number of important composers from each time period. It didn't help that many of the details that were covered included going over specific dates and seemingly trivial things - like how many sonatas, concertos, ballets that a certain composer wrote. Instead of more biographical events or historical context that influenced the composer's works.I felt that there wasn't much of a focus and we jumped from one composer to the next without covering much, which was frustrating.What I hated about the class was that we never discussed the readings that the exams were entirely based off of. Then there was a portion of the exam where we were required to put pieces in order on a timeline - which I didn't understand the importance of.Things that I actually did like about the course - when we discussed articles we read. Such as why there haven't been great women composers. When we got to talk about topics like that, time actually didn't feel like an eternity.",
    "Great class. I would recommend the class if the student has any interest in learning about music. The course is interesting, and the assignments\/essays are quite painless and actually fun to write.",
    "wonderful course, learn a good deal, listen a lot",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. The workload is very manageable, and doing the homework is fun since it's mostly just listening to good music. The listening quizzes were not too challenging and you got to have your notes. Both the midterm and the final were open notes, and Dr. Green gave us the area of the questions beforehand.",
    "The course surveys trends and iconic composers in western music from the romantics to the present day. Grades were based largely on a midterm and final exam, and two papers, each with revisions. There were weekly-to-biweekly listening quizes. In all, it is a good course for the uninitiated to the history music, but it is helpful to know a bit about musical notation and some of the language of music (eg. staccato, legato, fortissimo, etc.). I recommend the course.",
    "A nice overview."
