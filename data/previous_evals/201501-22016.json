   "comments": [
    "This course was incredible. I really cannot express how much I loved the way Professor Kastan structured this course. I absolutely love these plays, which made just being able to closely focus on them so fun -- but even if you don't love these plays, take this course anyway, because you will fall in love with them!! I am so glad I was able to take this as one of my final Yale seminars; from our sessions in the Beinecke to just really fascinating class discussions, this has been one of the best courses I've taken in my time at Yale, and I would highly, highly recommend taking it.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!!",
    "For the most part, this class felt more like a tiny lecture than a seminar; Professor Kastan really likes to talk. But he's smart, and he says smart things, so it's not objectively a bad thing. But if you're looking for the sort of seminar that feels like a round-table discussion in which the teacher's is just one of many voices, this probably isn't going to be your favorite class.",
    "Take this course. Professors like David Kastan are the reason that students go to Yale. Not only is he one of the leaders of his field, but he truly believes that every student has something new to teach him. You will leave his class with a deeper understanding of Shakespeare and a greater confidence in your own textual analytic abilities.",
    "I solved the authorship quandary! Kastan wrote Shakespeare, or, if he didn't, he probably knows him pretty well because he knows the plays like the back of his hand and his interpretations are extraordinary and beautifully worded and explained. Also, he loves to listen to his students and respond to them and really invests himself in our analytical processes. He's also hilarious. Take any class with him that he's teaching ever.",
    "You read the four tragedies in a lot of detail. Take it if you like Shakespeare, and are relatively patient in section.",
    "I would definitely recommend ENGL 208 to another student. Needless to say, a background in Shakespeare (even beyond the four major tragedies and probably including the comedies\/romances) is probably a good idea (and lo and behold, it is a pre-req for the course). And of course, interest in Shakespeare is an even better idea (if you have done Hamlet a hundred times, a month of Hamlet may be frustrating but still, probably, useful). Professor Kastan is brilliant, other students will be brilliant. Take the course if you can!",
    "Absolutely take this course. The discussion is incredible, as are the trips to the beinecke. The papers end up taking more time than you expect, but they're rewarding assignments. The weekly reading is pretty light, which is also nice.",
    "Amazing class. Kastan is the best professor at Yale and the best in the world at what he does, and it's an incredible opportunity to be able to slowly read the four major tragedies with him each week. Couldn't recommend it more.",
    "Kastan is great. Teaches you a lot, incredibly dynamic.",
    "If you're interested in Shakespeare and you don't take this class you deserve to be dismembered.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to students interested in reading Shakespeare, even if they have already read the four tragedies. The workload is very reasonable (occasional forum posts, three essays), with the work mainly being in re-reading the plays carefully. Professor Kastan is a brilliant, funny, and kind instructor who leads without being overbearing and guides his students with questions they might not have thought of before. As an added plus, you get to see and touch the first Folio--how cool is that?",
    "You're probably drawn to this class because Kastan is teaching it, and he's a really great and intelligent guy, but not my type of section leader. He has really interesting thoughts but isn't so great at leading a class discussion. If you've taken histories and tragedies with him, you encounter more of his ideas here, which can be fun to delve deeper into but also a little repetitive."
