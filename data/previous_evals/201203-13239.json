    "A somewhat spontaneous class where you would read or write a poem for 5 minutes with a partner and then be expected to share your ideas. Because of this style, contributions were not expected to be genius, which made for a very relaxed and open atmosphere. If you are the type who likes small classes but does not like to raise your hand, this class is perfect for you. There is a lot of group work and informal sharing instead of pressure to ask and answer questions. The weekly readings of 20-30 poems can get frustrating because you could get by in class without doing them, and even when you do, they blur together anyway. Solve this problem by rereading the 2-3 poems that you like best, and try to answer the weekly question on your own. You write 3 papers, which was my favorite part of class, especially because the prof gives extensive, very helpful feedback on the drafts.",
    "FREN 092 is an early-morning freshman seminar on modern French poetry. It has three papers - two four page responses, and as a final paper, a ten-twelve page comparison of two poems - which are very manageable; their due dates are spaced out. The first two papers are submitted twice, with a week-long revision period. Professor Connolly is very accessible and eager to talk about essay-writing, how you're liking the works, and the class in general. His feedback, however, is on the general side; your papers will improve after revision, but your writing overall may not. Furthermore, it is the nature of the course that students will read hundreds of poems but discuss very few of them in-depth in class. If you are already passionate about poetry, you may want to just read the poems on your own.",
    "French 092 is an excellent class to take if you are interested in reading French poetry, learning to critically read poetry, or improving writing skills. The readings can get overwhelming at times, but they are on the whole very manageable. Professor Connolly is brilliant and very approachable (take advantage of office hours!) I would highly recommend taking this class if you are at all interested in the subject.",
    "Fren 092 is an excellent course, in which you read many poems, some of which are difficult to understand. Class discussions are rich and exciting, and writing assignments are enjoyable and allow one to choose poems that one likes best to write about.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're at all interested in French poetry of the 19th and 20th centuries--and do ensure that you're willing to put in the requisite time and effort to read the poems, if you would like to obtain the maximum benefit from this class. The way that Connolly integrates art, history, music and theater into the class is wonderful, if you're at all interested in knowing the contexts of poems that lie behind the texts themselves. You also get to read some essays by some of the luminaries of the last century (Walter Benjamin, Paul de Man, Barbara Johnson, Le Corbusier), which dramatically shifts the way you think about analyzing poetry (and poetry itself!) So, in short, DO THE READINGS.Connolly's also very open and helpful during office hours, although he definitely doesn't spoon-feed you information; instead, he forces you to think for yourself. In class, he usually lets students take the lead during discussions, which may be good for some students who feel like they've got a lot to express, but not so preferable for others who want to hear more about Connolly's own thoughts. This was the only 9am class this semester that I could be bothered enough to wake up and go for, which definitely says a lot about this class.",
    "French 092 01 was a joy. The course material is exceptional, the professor is engaging, and the class structure is based on the desired output of the student which was very refreshing and provided the dynamic which drove a number of fruitful class discussions. The term papers can be very interesting and equally challenging. I would recommend this course to a fellow student, especially one who enjoys any poetry, and thrives in a more loose, free-form educational environment. Also you dont have to know french but you get some language exposure to a number of romantic, occidental and ancient languages which is a bonus to those who enjoy languages.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in drama, English, or French but I can see someone solely interested in more quantitative areas suffering in this course.",
    "This class is great in terms of subject matter. If I was to have a 9 am class, it would be this one. The only exception to that is if there are people that you know you do not jive with in the class; since it is a seminar, your fellow classmates can really change how you feel about the class in positive and\/or negative ways.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a writing credit, but the amount of writing you do is pretty minimal-there are two three- to four-page papers and one final paper that is ten to twelve pages. The poems are also pretty interesting (albeit very, very French) and the professor is very calming and kind.",
    "Definitely take this class! It helps to speak French and have some previous knowledge of the poems, but professor Connolly is great at making the material interesting and accessible to everyone.",
    "This is a great course with a fantastic teacher. If you are interested in poetry at all or perhaps trying something new, I would highly recommend this course. Professor Connolly truly understands and is interested in the material. Inevitably his own interest, through his quirky stories, anecdotes, or comparisons, will take root in you too.",
    "If you're looking for an artistic course and a break from more serious, rigid coursework, this class is definitely for you. It's very refreshing, not strenuous at all. We just read and talked about interesting poems for the entire semester. You write two papers and a final--that's pretty much it. Moreover, if you put a lot into the course, you will get a lot out of it. The material can be very abstruse, in a wonderful way--because youre not expected to come up with one \"right\" response to it.",
    "This seminar is a great way to start studying literature at Yale - if you love poetry, this is the class for you. I came away from the class fairly well-versed in a variety of French poets, and I loved the opportunity to learn about artistic movements like modernism and surrealism. The prose readings can be dense at first, but ultimately they are worth it. Professor Connolly is an excellent professor - not only is he knowledgeable and engaging, but he is incredibly accessible and accommodating to students. He appears to have a working knowledge of every single language, as well (questions like \"Who knows the etymology of this word in Arabic?\" are not uncommon)."
