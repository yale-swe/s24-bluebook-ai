I received feedback from my peers and Professor Choi that helped me improve my work and understand how to make future work better. I was also pushed to write every single day which has proven to be a very useful practice.",
    "I sharpened my understanding of how to build and pace a plot, and how to make my writing clear and concise.",
    "I learned a lot about my own work, critiquing others' work, and the revision process.",
    "I got to read and workshop two to three stories a week. The class helped me to read short fiction for craft and to engage deeply with my own writing by reading others' works every week."

    "I really enjoyed the course as it was structured",
    "Susan Choi is literally so amazing. Anything she teaches and any workshops she leads cannot further be improved, because she's so good at this.",
    "This was my favorite course I have taken at Yale and I am a senior. It was both fun and very useful. All of the work we had to do was interesting and meaningful. My own writing improved a lot over the semester and I enjoyed reading my classmates' work. Professor Choi is a very kind and wonderful person and an excellent professor. She gave us copious feedback on each of our stories and was always excited to talk over pieces in office hours. I can't think of any changes that would improve this course.",
    "This is an excellent writing workshop--organized and productive. The daily notebooks keep people engaged with writing and Professor Choi maintains a high standard for comments and workshop.",
    "Susan is great, and I really appreciated that the course was entirely workshop, without any outside reading, since feedback is so valuable, and it's also very valuable to listen to other people being workshopped. I also really liked that we had to turn in a revision of one of our stories, since it was a great opportunity to rethink a piece based on the feedback we'd gotten in the course, and then get more feedback. I don't really see any weaknessesit's a great workshop course!",
    "I think the weekly workshop structure is great. I enjoyed the consistency and constant support from all my peers in the class."

    "Yes! An amazing course to improve your fiction writing",
    "I cannot recommend this course to other writers enough. Susan Choi is a blessing and we don't deserve her.",
    "Take this course! Professor Choi is a brilliant author and an amazing professor. She is extremely kind and understanding and very approachable. She gives a lot of useful feedback and I felt that my writing improved a lot over the semester. The course doesn't have any busy work. You have to keep a daily notebook, write and revise your own pieces, and give feedback on your classmates' work. All of these assignments are useful for improving your writing and the workload is very manageable. The classroom setting is also very positive. We all critique each others' work, but the workshop atmosphere was collaborative and helpful not competitive or mean.",
    "Yes. If you want to hone your fiction writing, do it. You will receive excellent feedback both from Professor Choi and from other students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for fiction writers! The feedback you will get is invaluable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. This is a great fiction class if you're looking to build your workshop experience and to have your stories read by an entire group of other students also honing their crafts.",
    "Great writing course for anyone interested in fiction. You'll produce two stories that you're proud of and will get great feedback from Professor Choi and your classmates. Also not too much work, so you can focus on your writing."
