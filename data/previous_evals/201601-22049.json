   "comments": [
    "An important class to understand Africa, colonialism, and the world. Not a gut per se, you need to go to class and take notes and do readings, but doesn't require extra attention. The material is so amazingly fascinating. Great for a 5th class.",
    "This is a good class on Africa's involvement in the Slave Trade. Professor Harms is well organized and the class is well structured. There is a paper, a midterm, a final and two quizzes (which are really easy). Not too much work and pretty interesting.",
    "Highly recommend this class for anyone interested in learning more about African history and the slave trade. This class definitely covers information that gets left out of or glossed over in history textbooks made in the U.S. It will really open your eyes to how advanced African societies were, and how interactions with Europeans affected people throughout the continent. The workload is VERY reasonable, with just 1 midterm, 1 final, 1 8-10 page paper, and 2 very simple \"map quizzes.\" The lectures are interesting too!",
    "This has been one of my favorite history lecture courses at Yale. The lectures and readings are both extremely interesting and provide a solid foundation of knowledge about west and west central Africa during the 15th to 19th centuries. While the course is huge in scope and considers the Atlantic slave trade from a global perspective, you spend more time focusing on the histories of specific states and individual narratives. The workload is average for a history lecture course (midterm, paper, final exam). I highly recommend this course!",
    "This class gives you the opportunity to learn about slavery from the perspective of the African continent and the history of the African continent prior to slavery, because there was history before slavery in Africa.",
    "Take it to understand Africa during slavery well",
    "I would recommend Africa in the Era of the Slave Trade as a credit for history majors who need a pre-industrial credit and a regional credit. For me, the good and bad thing about this class is that it doesn't really fit with any other work I've done in the history major, but it's a tremendously important topic to world history. And it is not difficult or too much work. If you just show up to lecture and take notes, you'll be fine, and the readings are interesting. So you get a lot out of it even if you don't put that much in.",
    "Great class if you put in the hours to make sure you grasp the content of the class.",
    "Take it.",
    "Take or audit the class! The material is not very hard but very interesting.",
    "Take this class. You will learn so much!",
    "Take the class because it's an opportunity to learn a history -- of expansive kingdoms, of brutal wars, of charismatic leaders, of things that seem totally crazy -- that you probably have never heard of because all of your other education has dismissed it. The grading was not hard at all and much of the reading was interesting (though some of it was pretty dry). You don't need to do most of it. A lot of assignments for a lecture - midterm, final, 2 map quizzes, one paper. Lecture could be dry. But it's pretty low key and you learn a lot."
