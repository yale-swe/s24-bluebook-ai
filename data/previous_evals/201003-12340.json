    "great class; music rocks. taught well. very interesting.",
    "I would recommend to anyone who has no musical inclination because you really learn a lot.",
    "I learned a ton from this course--helped me as a musician immensely. Also, very fun. Take it.",
    "This is a great class to take if you're at all interested in music theory. I sing in an a cappella group and played a instrument in middle school, but I couldn't even identify the notes on the staff. Now I can read notes in treble and bass clef and play them on the piano. You learn about major and minor scales, intervals, cadences, and many more things. There are some lengthy exercises in the workbook, but it will only help you to practice more. This was my favorite class of the semester and I would highly recommend it. Karen Jones in a great professor who is always willing to hold office hours and extra help if you need it.",
    "MUSI 110 was a good basic coverage of introductory music theory. We actually covered a nice amount of material. I would recommend this class only if you have an interest in pursuing music; otherwise it is kind of useless.",
    "This is a great class, especially if you like music.",
    "good course. HW every class though.",
    "Yes I would"
