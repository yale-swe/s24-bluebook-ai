    "I would but it is more of an introductory class with many who haven't done screenwriting before. Would mainly recommend to beginners.",
    "You'll learn some fundamentals of screenwriting though not exhaustively and write a solid number of pages with some workshopping.",
    "If you've got a story you want to write - or even if you haven't, but you'd just like to write for the screen - this is a fun and interesting way to get into it. You have to be prepared to put the time into getting a solid screenplay for the class to critique - what you get out is what you put in. Crowley is a good instructor.",
    "Good alternative to the film dept. screenwriting classes.",
    "This is a fairly easy screenwriting class that forces you to pretty much write a full-length screenplay in a few weeks. If you are looking for a class that forces you to do that, take this class! however, we didn't really receive grades for most of the semester, so if you are nervous about a class that could lower your gpa, I'm not sure I'd recommend this."
