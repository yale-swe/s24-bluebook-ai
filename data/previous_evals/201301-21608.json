   "comments": [
    "The material of the course was pretty interesting. That being said, I think a class like this demands a nuanced pedagogical approach in order to find the balance between a small philosophy\/linguistics seminar and a basic language course, and I don't think this semester was successful in that. As the weeks passed, I felt less and less inspired, and the final exam unfortunately felt like a particular waste of my time.Professor Lin clearly has a deep understanding of the material, but she was somewhat unsuccessful at sharing those insights with students. She seemed nervous speaking in front of us, and she went through material too slowly, so it was challenging to stay engaged during class. Her corrections were always very helpful and detailed. She is definitely only willing to accept the traditional interpretations of the texts, and while I believe this to be her prerogative, she often couldn't articulate exactly why a phrase or sentence ought to be interpreted in a certain way, and though I'm sure my frustration over this trend is rooted in my ignorance of the commentaries, it was terribly frustrating nonetheless. In the end, Professor Lin is a very intelligent and kind individual, and I'm sure that with practice the course can improve.",
    "Literary Chinese is very hard. Professor Lin is very kind and understanding. Don't stop after the 1st semester. You read a lot off the classics.",
    "This is a great course for anyone looking to continue to study Chinese philosophy and\/or literary Chinese grammar.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I really enjoyed the pacing, structure and content of this course. I felt that the mix of grammar exercises and translations was a great way to approach the learning of literary Chinese. I'm someone who likes having many small assignments throughout the semester and this course was like that. I also think after having spent so much time studying Chinese it feels like such a reward to be able to read Confucius and other Chinese philosophers in the original language."
