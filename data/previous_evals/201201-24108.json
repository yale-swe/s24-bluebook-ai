    "GREAT professor. Work is very manageable. That said, if you're not into Russian literature or haven't taken another class in it, you should probably take his Tolstoy lecture first or the Dostoevsky class. I do think having a background in it helps. That said, I highly recommend the class!",
    "Take it. But it is a very difficult course",
    "This is a course in which you discover great books and discuss them. I definite recommend it."
