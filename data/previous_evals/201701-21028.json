   "comments": [
    "General",
    "I learned a lot about humans and how they interact with each other and the world.",
    "Really interesting material in psychology about human behavior and how people are different privately and in social contexts.",
    "I honestly don't feel like I learned much new in this class besides the proper psychological terms for things that already seemed to be common sense.",
    "A good extension of Intro Psych. Focuses on group interaction, and is chock-full with specific studies supporting lecture points. I've started analyzing news articles (and my own life!) using some of these concepts. Solid class for any Yalie to take - whether in STEM, social science, or humanities.",
    "You get an excellent overview of social psych. I enjoyed learning all the theories and concepts which were very applicable to daily life.",
    "This class gives you an understanding of how the world works the way it does. You can understand why people behave the way they do, why we have stereotypes, and why our attitudes may not align with our behavior, among other things. I definitely enjoyed the content of this class and think it is very interesting, but it is a class you have to put a decent amount of time and work into.",
    "I learned about the ways in which psychology influences attitudes, behavior, goals, and human interaction. It offered a different way to think about the way we interact as people.",
    "It was a good introductory course into how the contexts and situations people are placed in affect behavior.",
    "I learned the foundations for social psychology, the principles for interacting with others and the unconscious motivations for various interpersonal phenomena.",
    "This was such an interesting course! I'm a bio major, but I've always had an interest in psychology and hope to study the brain in the future. I really enjoyed being in this class. I feel like I learned a ton about psychological research and concepts, and in general just how people work and what makes us act the way we do. I felt super engaged in every lecture because the material was so interesting!",
    "The material was extremely interesting",
    "I learned what guides our interactions when we are in groups and just how social humans truly are.",
    "I feel like this course was a solid grounding in social psych. I learned a lot of foundational stuff.",
    "I learned a lot about how people tend to be influenced in ways that they are not aware of.",
    "I learned how negligible cues might influence social behavior.",
    "Learned about how the mind works in different scenarios. Actually illuminated a bit about my own life as well.",
    "I learned very little that I didn't already know from this course. Most of the findings discussed in lecture and the textbook were covered in Intro Psych or deducible from common sense.",
    "Interesting topic with many factoids and useful psychological observations",
    "I learned how social psychology is applied to real-world situations.",
    "I learned about the way people interact, particularly in groups, and what kind of motivations influence them (goals, motives, emotions, other people, etc.). I also learned about several popular Psych experiments that will be useful to cite later in my career.",
    "A basic survey of social psychology. Mostly intuitive but definitely makes you more aware of dynamics in your everyday interactions.",
    "I learned about different social psychology concepts",
    "Interesting survey course, topics are surprisingly relevant to every day life.",
    "Social Psychology was a great course because I saw myself apply a lot of what I learnt in the class to my daily life. It definitely gave me a lot of insight into why I act and think the way I do in multiple situations and this was very fascinating to me.",
    "We explored how humans are very social beings and the implications concerning their interactions with each other (i.e. groupthink, in-group favoritism). We also learnt about self identity and how it is connected\/ dependent on social aspects of our lives.",
    "An overview of social psychology",
    "How people function",
    "Literally none",
    "I learned a great deal about the details of social psychology.",
    "I felt that I really learned a lot about social psych and therefore more effectively understand the world around me in everyday life.",
    "This class was very interesting in teaching on social phenomena. It's not sociology; it's about how individuals act in social settings. It helped develop a lot of the features that were touched on in intro psych.",
    "Psychology and it's interaction with larger social groups",
    "got an introduction to a psychology-based evaluation of social relationships",
    "I learned that social psychology is a real science but its validity should be doubted to some degree.",
    "I gained some knowledge of human behavior and the factors that contribute to attitude and perception.",
    "I learned how lots of things about groups, interactions, human behavior, etc.",
    "This course is a mostly knowledge-based course (your entire grade is based on three midterms), so it's a lot of reading, going to lectures, and learning facts, vocabulary, and concepts. It's very comprehensive and covers topics in social psychology, from attitudes to relationships to power and altruism. The course uses important studies and experiments in the field to illustrate key ideas and concepts.",
    "I learned a lot from this course. This course provides a great overview of social psychology and I learned how to analyze common social phenomena according to the theories that we learned in class.",
    "Great core class for psych majors, which is its purpose after all. Lectures were super interesting always and so much application to everyday life.",
    "I developed my knowledge in psychology, but more importantly, I learned lots of insights on everyday life and people.",
    "I gained a greater awareness of the factors that affect human behavior and thinking. I learned how to better interpret and gain insight from other's behavior and how to act when there is a specific goal I want to achieve.",
    "I learned more about what it means to be a part of a group, and the way in which one changes who he or she is based on social situations.",
    "I learned a lot about the external factors that can motivate behavior.",
    "I learned concepts related to the field of social psychology that blow my mind on a daily basis and change the way I view the world, especially related to social interaction. Power, bias, goals, attitude, behavior... all of this stuff is inexorably intertwined with social interaction, and I feel much more aware of my own influences now.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about many topics in social psychology, and learned how people have conducted research in this field to develop these findings.",
    "Although I definitely could have put more effort into this course and gotten more out of it, I actually enjoyed learning what I did about social psychology. I did feel like I gained insight into human behavior.",
    "A good overview of social psychology."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Easy Hard to pass if u are credit d",
    "The tests were very stressful as our entire grade was test based. Still, the book and lecture were both really interesting and I learned a lot.",
    "It is hard with a big class like this to get equal grading because of all of the different TA's. There were clearly some TA's that graded easier than others.",
    "Though it was nice to have a low-commitment course in terms of workload, at times I felt quite disconnected (especially when other important assignments caused my mind to wander during lecture) from the lecture and from the material. I think that discussion sections, even if optional, would greatly improve my retention of the course material by giving me an avenue by which to explore the most interesting and important material.",
    "Material is interesting but lectures seem somewhat random. It's a lot of material and the powerpoint slides aren't incredibly helpful. Really just need to pay attention to what is being said in lecture.",
    "I found the course to be both easy and comprehensive. I also too hath ought it was very interesting, but people who know a lot about psych might find it very repetitive.",
    "No complaints about the class. Readings could probably be slightly more spread out, but lectures were as well-run as they could be considering class size. Could probably focus more on how the studies could be wrong, or when the findings mentioned in lecture had caveats associated with them.",
    "I love the multiple choice exam format. It was a great way to make sure we learn the material without getting bogged down in the details like other psych classes. There are no weaknesses that I'm aware of.",
    "I think the lectures are structured well; however, I wish they covered more of what is covered in the book so that there wasn't so much extra material in the book we had to learn. The lectures only vaguely cover what the book does (big concepts, big studies, etc.) but doesn't go into as much detail as the book does. He also on some slides puts a lot of words but none on others, and on those without words, it's hard to fully comprehend what is needed to be learned from those slides (i.e. no definitions, etc.), which means the book becomes all the more important. I realize the book is something you should be learning on your own, but the discrepancy between how in depth the lectures are and the book is means you have to learn the majority of the material on your own.",
    "There is certainly something about taking a class with one of the most cited social psychologists of our times, whose work is mentioned over and over in the textbook. The textbook is interesting reading if care about social psychology at all. While there is a lot of overlap with Intro Psych, this course does offer a plethora of experimental findings that can add to one's understanding of human cognition and social psychology. While the tests are fairly straightforward, some of them very worded or chosen in such ways that multiple of the options seemed to be justifiably correct, and I found myself speculating what bit of knowledge was wanted out of the specific question, rather than searching for a single, true answer that aligned with the knowledge attained in the class.",
    "I did not like that Prof. Bargh did not interact with the students much. He only took questions at the end of class and the lectures were either really interesting or felt like he was just reading off the slides. I also did not like that the grade was entirely determined by the three exams.",
    "The lecture format is perfect for the material and the textbook readings are a solid supplement. The exams fairly and accurately test knowledge of the lectures and readings.",
    "I was very happy with this class! I don't think anything needs to be changed. The lectures were interesting and the exams were fair.",
    "I wish we would have had another assignment besides the tests that would have helped distribute the grades. I think it would have been beneficial for a lot of students to have a review session as well where the TA's go over the material both in class and lecture. I found some of the studies hard to understand and I think this would have cleared some of the material up.",
    "Very interesting material. Could be more clear on assessments (giving sample exams and explaining grading policy better). But definitely very engaging class.",
    "I really like that the lecture slides were all very filled out and made available to study from -- this was very helpful for tests especially since actual lecture could be a bit dry. It was obvious Prof Bargh is a leader in his field, I would've expected him to be more engaging during his lectures however.",
    "Strengths: consistent, pretty well taught Weaknesses: exams are entirely rote and nitpicky as well; I really don't think we should be tested on our ability to memorize everything covered in the course. Tests ought to do more to test competency rather than memorization skills",
    "There are only three assignments (three tests). Honestly, it would have been more engaging if we had had other assignments, in my opinion.",
    "The course was very straightforward however exams focused more on minute details rather than conceptualized understanding of the material.",
    "A major weakness is that the powerpoint slides are extremely unorganized. You can tell the professor has just copied and pasted slides from over the years. If there was more cohesion it'd be easier to pay attention in class.",
    "This course was not good. The content was boring and way too extensive. Even after studying for hours and hours I still could not get a good grade on exams.",
    "As an auditor, this course is not too hard for me to follow, which is good.",
    "Only 3 tests. No other way to demonstrate knowledge or engage with material.",
    "The different themes for each slide set off my OCD. Also there was 0 engagement with the material outside of lecture. It made it easy but I could've benefitted from reading responses\/section\/something.",
    "Slideshows went too quickly in class and were very confusing because all different formats of slides and also very repetitive.",
    "This class starts off interesting and takes a nosedive in the second half of the semester, where Bargh repeats the same set of studies in every lecture. He literally copy-pastes slides describing studies we'd already covered. There were 18 of those in his final lecture (yes, that is 1\/3 of the lecture). He's clearly very knowledgeable in the field and is very good at what he does, which is why it's bewildering that such a small set of studies actually make it into the class. Getting rid of redundant material would make the class significantly better.",
    "The class was interesting at first, but then everything becomes very repetitive. Everything in social psychology feels really intuitive until you take the exams. Read the textbook! A particular weakness is the grading of the short answers on the exams. It's really subjective.",
    "The course material was fascinating and the real-world examples were great.",
    "Having three midterms and no final is definitely the right way to go for a Psychology course, and I was grateful that Professor Bargh employed this system. I also enjoyed that many of the studies discussed in class were quite interesting and conducted at Yale. In terms of weaknesses, a lot of the material felt repetitive at times. There were several instances reviewing for exams where I reread the same information over from different days, which I guess was okay because I didn't realize it was repetitive when I was learning it since I had forgotten the first time, and it probably helped internalize the info more, but it would also be nice to include other information since Social Psych is such an interesting subject. The structure of the material didn't always make sense during lecture, and sometimes felt like we were jumping from one idea\/study to the next, but when I went back and reviewed everything, the structure felt more organized so maybe it was just a tad fast during lecture. I do wish that the exams were focussed more on lecture, specifically the last one, because I find it unfair to people who come every day and listen attentively to not be benefited for it compared to people who skip lecture and solely rely on the textbook. The textbook is interesting as well and it makes sense to also be tested on the main terms and ideas from it, but I do think there should be greater emphasis on lecture as well.",
    "This course tells you about social psychology's major findings, but I really don't think I have that much better of an understanding of what social psych is. The course is too reliant on the textbook and often makes lecture seem insignificant.",
    "The slides were somewhat disorganized and eclectic. I think this course has great material but it could be improved through more systematic organization of slides.",
    "The class teaches you many great concepts yet it is not very engaging",
    "The strengths are that the content is very interesting and easy to follow. The lectures were also engaging. However, the tests were harder than expected and a lot of the questions were a bit too specific from the readings. I also wish their were class sections and discussion sessions.",
    "weakness: the powerpoint slides were a bit confusing\/unclear-- sometimes too much writing and hard to know what the big idea was",
    "I wish the course hadn't consisted solely of three tests. I would liked to have a paper on a topic within social psych, or reading responses, or anything else that would allow us to engage with the material on a deeper level.",
    "Great course, for both psych and non psych majors. The neat thing about the course is that you directly see what your learning about in the real world.",
    "I think that the course material was very good in this course. I believe that the tests were more difficult then they needed to be for an intro social psych course and for the way Bargh lectures. In his lectures he barley focused on many specific details yet the tests asked for lots of details.",
    "This course was strong in that I learned a lot. I felt that the textbook reasons were very long and often hard to get through.",
    "It's a good course, and there's a lot of reading. Grades are based solely on 3 tests.",
    "This is an interesting course, but there is a huge problem with the grading system. Namely, there is a large discrepancy amongst the graders. It was upsetting and frustrating, and I hope that in the future all of the TFs are on the same page with the professor.",
    "Very interesting lectures and material. It would have been better if the lecture and reading content coincided more though.",
    "Very interesting but lectures are too fast paced with so much information, can be hard to keep up",
    "This class is fake news",
    "Lecture topics could be a little more related to the assigned readings",
    "I think that it would be a lot more helpful if there were more assessments in the course. Not necessarily more exams, but more ways for us to engage with the material. For example, if there were clicker questions and reading responses, we would have many more opportunities to test\/demonstrate our knowledge of the material. It would also be more helpful if the textbook and lecture complemented each other instead of being completely separate from each other.",
    "The lecture slides were all over the place, making it difficult to review material in an orderly cohesive fashion.",
    "The test questions were unclear at times, and the TAs\/graders did not always do a good job of grading accurately. I had to contest some points at some point due to the grading of one grader.",
    "The strengths were that the course is clear about what information the student should know. However, lectures could be organized so they line up better with the textbook readings.",
    "The fact that you don't really need to go to class and that most of the exams are on the book is a big issue that should be fixed.",
    "Fascinating material, detailed but fair exams. Big drawback: the constant fluctuation between powerpoint slide formatting was incredibly disorienting and distracting. I realize they're probably built from different powerpoints, but some consistency in the final product would make them a lot easier to read and follow.",
    "Prof. Bargh is a good lecturer and explains concepts in a very clear and easy to understand fashion. He also posts his slides online so you can catch up if you miss anything. The entire course is very straightforward (midterms are on the lectures and the reading) and you'll be able to do well if you go to lectures, take notes, and do the reading. It's not a very interactive course and doesn't focus on applying what you learn - mostly just wants you to understand the main concepts and terms.",
    "This class is very interesting, but there is a lot of repetition and not a lot of engagement throughout the course prior to the three tests. I would recommend having another category to increase engagement throughout the year (reading responses?) and allow some leeway on test performances.",
    "The grading system was not the best, I feel like it could be improved so that it could better reflect learning in the course. Learned a lot but felt that the 3 test system did not show this. The only people who really did well in this class were people who were good test-takers or were effective at getting good grades in classes with grades only based on learning material for a test.",
    "The topics are from daily experience so even if you are not a psychology major, the course offers a lot of new and useful information for personal development.",
    "Use more information from the lectures instead of the book for the exams because it is a lot of information to remember if we have to remember all of the lectures and chapters from the book.",
    "The strengths are that the lectures are very interesting and the exams are generally straight forward. An improvement could be in the lecture slides which sometimes did not go very in depth.",
    "I liked the lecture style of the class, and I really appreciated that the class lecture slides were all put online as well, which made studying much easier.",
    "Lectures were fairly interesting and the amount of reading was fairly manageable. The powerpoints were very confusing to study off of and they could be much more informational and helpful.",
    "I thought that the subject matter was well organized and very interesting. I thought that lectures could be a little more coherent. Sometimes it felt like Bargh was jumping from study to study without really going in depth. Sometimes, slides were skipped as though they didn't matter. That's fine in theory, but it'd be cleaner and easier to follow if only the pertinent information was there. I like to feel like a lecture is building up a picture as it goes along, rather than collapsing and being built up again and again. The graphic design of the slides is a little confusing to follow at times, so it might be good to unify the style and presentation (without being too boring of course!). As an example, I really liked the structure of psych 110, where the basic concepts are outlined at the beginning in a little outline, and then each bullet point is expanded into with studies, and then zoomed out and in again for each subsequent bullet point.",
    "The course was very reasonable in workload and expectations which I appreciated. Lectures were engaging and Professor Bargh was very good at explaining and teaching the information. I liked that he used so much primary research to teach the concepts.",
    "I think the lectures were interesting, although I thought sometimes they could have been organized better (for example, we learned about repeated experiments a lot of the time). The tests were very fair. I wish that there had been work other than the three exams. I felt like I would have gotten a lot more out of the course had we been required to do reading responses, for example, or some other written assignment based on one of the papers we read. I think I would have learned more this way and felt overall more engaged in the course if it were based on more than just memorization.",
    "It is a little dry."

    "Not reallu",
    "This is a great course but be warned, it is not easy to get an A. Make sure you read the textbook.",
    "This class was a fascinating exploration of the psychology of humans and the way in which we interact with society and other groups. While at times quite obvious, at others, the findings of this field are truly surprising and can actually inform how you act around your friends or in other social situations, which is a really cool way to apply class knowledge to real life. With a low workload (it's just reading), this course can fit fairly easily into anyone's schedule, but be sure to stay caught up with the reading, engaged in lecture, and try to study a few days in advance for the exams if you wish to do well.",
    "Yes definitely take this class. Low work, pretty chill, interesting material, and you learn a lot.",
    "Yes--good class to take regardless of your major.",
    "Only take it with a friend or friends. Taking it alone would've been unbearable -- definitely an experience that needs to be shared.",
    "Solid class for any Yalie to take, especially if you use it to analyze the news (i.e. politics, business) and your own social interactions. Important to know your own biases and unconscious motivations. An extremely easy class if you put in the work. (The class is mostly fact recall.) Just do the readings (carefully) and go to class, and you're really guaranteed an A. (I also reviewed the lectures after every class.) Don't do the readings, though, and you will not have a pleasant time.",
    "Would HIGHLY RECOMMEND, especially as a Cred\/D or fifth class. It was so informative and all the experiments were relevant to daily life. The textbook was fun to read!",
    "Take it. Great lectures, fascinating material.",
    "I enjoyed this course in that it is very interesting; however, I'm not sure I'd take it again. I took it Cr\/D\/Fail because I did need the credit for anything, and I'm glad I did. I was told that this is an easy class to take because it has only 3 midterms that are not cumulative, but I would say it was harder than I had anticipated. The textbook chapters are long and dense, and as a very slow reader, I found it hard to tackle all of the reading, and reading the chapters is important for the exam. The material itself is not hard, there is just a lot you need to know. The exam is 60-70 multiple choice with 3 short answers, so if you get just a few multiple choice questions wrong, your grade is already lowered quite a bit. While I think the class is very interesting and gives valuable insight into why things happen in the world, it was more work than I think people put it out to be, and had I had it as a letter grade, I definitely do not think I would have done well. If you can read the chapters and learn the material thoroughly (vocab, all the studies, etc.), then I'd recommend the class. If reading takes a long time and memorization is hard for you, I wouldn't.",
    "I would recommend it as a credit D or for the psychology major. Some of the lectures were very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in psychology. The lectures were a bit dry at times, but overall I thought it was an interesting class and very applicable to \"the real world.\"",
    "Professor Bargh is not a very good lecturer - the material is SO COOL but does not get delivered very well at all. The lecture slides are compiled from years and years, so there is very little continuity or structure, and things get quite confusing sometimes. If you can get past the boring lectures, the stuff you learn is super cool. You need to study hard for the tests, they aren't easy. He also tests on the textbook so definitely read it and take notes. Overall though the workload is not bad at all - the entire class is three tests, no reading responses or anything. And the material is insanely interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. No prerequisite knowledge is required, and anyone can learn the material and do well.",
    "Take this class!!! It's super interesting and you'll learn a ton about what makes people act the way you do. It's also not that much work as long as you stay on top of the readings.",
    "I would recommend reading the book chapters, some of the material is not presented in class and will come up on the exams.",
    "Yes would recommend overall content of the course was very interesting.",
    "I think this is definitely a manageable 5th class or a class that you may want to Credit\/D\/F to begin with. Your grade is solely based off of 3 tests -- all equally weighted. So if you are engaged in the course material, or a quick study, you can probably do very well in the class. However, if you are not at all interested\/engaged in the material, and you don't have the motivation to study the material on your own, then you may be surprised at how poorly you perform. While all of the material and concepts covered in class seem fairly intuitive, you still need to put in time to study.",
    "Really great credit\/d\/f class",
    "This is a solid but not a great course. Be warned that the tests are entirely memorization of the textbook\/lecture material, but are also very hard to do well on because they are so nitpicky.",
    "Maybe. I would recommend taking either intro psych or social psych, but not necessarily both. There's a lot of great material covered in this class, but Professor Bargh repeats things constantly (both his own material and material covered in intro psych).",
    "Pretty simple class with three tests. I did not show up to class and still did reasonably well. If you need a gut, this one isn't bad, but there is no curve, so think about taking it Cr\/D\/F.",
    "Prof. Bargh definitely knows what he's talking about. However, there is a lot of material covered on every midterm, and further, a ton of weight put on your midterm grades, so do not miss any classes since his powerpoints are pretty sparse. I went into this class hearing it was a gut only to find out it was incredibly difficult to do well in (B and above) despite days of preparation for a midterm. A lot of pressure is put onto the three midterms because there are no other graded assignments-- so do not underestimate the course and its perceived \"lightness.\"",
    "I took this class credit\/D and I was mildly interested in the subject (but not a psych major). This course was easy in terms of grading and workload, but otherwise not worthwhile. The lectures were repetitive and didn't require any participation from students, and I was never convinced that social psychology as a field contributes much to the world. It got me a credit, but I wouldn't recommend it for anything more.",
    "I would recommend the class if you enjoy learning right from the slides, and enjoy learning about a lot of studies. A majority of the lectures was just based on studies. I found it interesting, and their is only 3 tests that contribute to your grade, a majority of which is multiple choice which is very nice.",
    "If you want an easy class with minimal workload, take this. While some exam questions can be pretty specific, you can get by with common sense, knowledge from intro psych, and some material learned from this class.",
    "Do not take this course.",
    "Easiest class at yale. Read the textbook and you'll be fine. I don't know how lecture was, and I kinda doubt anyone else knows either.",
    "I would not. I think it's a really interesting topic, but the lectures were unorganized and not engaging.",
    "It's a fairly low work psych core but if you're looking for a fun class I would suggest something else. The material is interesting enough but somehow Bargh manages to suck the life out of it in every lecture.",
    "Social psych is memorization heavy, and essentially just based on whether you were at lecture and can take notes. They don't have to be great notes, but do need to be notes. Know what studies were done and what show what, and the exams are all easy. You receive literally no feedback other than the 3 exams, so there's not a ton of breathing room, but it's also not hard to do well anyway. There is a bizarrely strict curve for the class.",
    "Yes. This is a good course to fulfill the social science component of the psychology major.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the material, although Professor Bargh is not very engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was a fairly easy Psych course, and also quite interesting because you get to learn neat things about how people function and interact with each other. I feel like I learned at least one cool fact to that I would want to share with my roommate or someone during every lecture. It was all very relevant information, even if it was maybe presented dryly during lecture. There are 3 non-cumulative exams that are the only grade for the class. The exams were fair, based on the textbook and lecture. I'm honestly more of a go to lecture and not really read the textbook kind of person and it still worked out for me as long as I at least skimmed through the textbook terms and ideas before exams, and took good lecture notes to study from with the ppts as well. As long as you're willing to keep up with lecture notes or reading, you will probably do fine in this class and not have too much work besides right before an exam to catch up on whatever you didn't do (reading or going through ppts, etc.). Also a very easy class to credit\/d if you'd rather that option.",
    "YES. This class is so interesting and applicable and i LOVED it. Not super intense, but definitely engaging. Also, workload is very predictable and straightforward, 3 exams and textbook reading. Professor Bargh is so so nice and helpful when you make an effort to talk to him during office hours!!!",
    "I would not recommend this course. The material on the tests doesn't really align with that presented in lecture, as there is a heavy focus on book content. If that doesn't bother you and you want a very broad overview of the field, go for it.",
    "A good class to take if you are looking for an interested yet low-level investment course.",
    "Yeah really cool class take it even if you're not a psych major especially if you want to know why people interact the way they do",
    "Yes because I think the information you learn is very valuable and applicable",
    "Yes, I would. Interesting and relevant, but not too much work.",
    "Yes, definitely - even to those who are not psych majors.",
    "Greater way to learn more about yourself and others!",
    "This course is awesome. Take it.",
    "Take it credit D. It's an awesome class that seems like a gut at first, but there's only 3 multiple choice tests that count for your grade and they're HARD. No curve. Only 20% get As\/A-s.",
    "Yes, absolutely! I really enjoyed John Bargh's teaching style and found him to be very engaging. He was very approachable outside of class as well and clearly knowledgeable in the area.",
    "Good CR\/D.",
    "Bargh is objectively the worst thing to ever happen to America, and that's keeping in mind the man who became president at the semester's start.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in psychology. Bargh wasn't the most exciting lecturer but the course material was very interesting if you like psychology. The tests were more difficult than those I've taken in other psychology courses at Yale which was kind of annoying. Be prepared to study a lot...there is a lot of material on the tests.",
    "Yes I felt that this course effectively faught menimportant things about social psychology.",
    "It's a good course, but the \"low workload\" is only because there are no essays or homework assignments. You have to be able to do the reading on your own before exams, and the exams aren't easy. That being said this class definitely isn't designed to hurt you, and if you do the reading the exams are fair.",
    "If you aren't a psych major, take CR\/D.",
    "This class was very interesting but very challenging. The workload was very minimal but with only 3 multiple choice exams to determine your final grade, it was hard to do well. Really interesting but not easy to do well in",
    "This class is not a straight-up gut but some of the topics seem pretty common sense when you're going through them.",
    "Probably not. Though the course is interesting, it feels more like information is being thrown at you rather than being taught to you. The focus is more on absorbing information than learning about the field and engaging with social psychology.",
    "I would recommend this course, three midterms worth one\/third of your grade each and no homework. It's a no brainer. This class wasn't too difficult and the material was interesting.",
    "I would recommend the course due to the information, but I feel as though there should be more efforts made on the part of the TAs and graders to help the students and correct their mistakes when they have been made.",
    "Yes, very interesting course!",
    "Yes! Very interesting course, lots of great things to learn!",
    "Yes, if you pay attention to the lectures and do the assigned readings, the tests are fine and you'll learn more about psych and everyday interactions.",
    "Totally take it if you're interested in the topic. Just be prepared for very detailed exams -- it's possible to cram, but not fun (duh).",
    "This is a good fifth class because it's very educational and interesting but also doesn't have too much of a time commitment attached to it. Especially for those starting out in psychology, it introduces you to a lot of the concepts, key terms, and important figures in the field. Prof. Bargh is extremely knowledgeable and a good lecturer.",
    "Very interesting class!",
    "An interesting course if you're somewhat interested in the subject. Wouldn't recommend to someone with no interest in the topic. That being said, I think you learn a lot about social phenomena which is useful\/interesting.",
    "Yes, social psychology is a social science credit that even if it is not your strongest area you have fun reading new material and developing skills that help you understand yourself and people around you better. Also the course includes only three tests, so if you go to lecture and do the readings, it is not particularly challenging.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student because it is very interesting and easy to stay engaged in lecture. The readings may be long, but they are fun to read and easy to learn from.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student. The work load was not high, and the material was very interesting.",
    "The material is very interesting, but it can be a bit rough for your grade to take a class that is only based off three exams. If you did badly on any one of them you automatically did very badly in the class. There isn't much work at all, and as long as you read the textbook very well for each of the exams you should do okay.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course. I took it concurrently with Psych 110 on a cr\/d\/f basis as a senior, and it was great to go in, take notes, and then just digest the information. I learned concepts related to the field of social psychology that blow my mind on a daily basis and have changed the way I view the world, especially related to social interaction. Power, bias, goals, attitude, behavior... all of this stuff is inexorably intertwined with social dynamics, and I feel much more aware of my own mind now. Despite taking it CR\/D\/F, I think it'd be easy to get a solid grade with minimal effort if you just engage with the content and are naturally interested in it.",
    "yes - it was fun going to lecture and hearing from bargh. he is not the most fantastic lecturers and they can be dry but as long as you go you can basically do well in this class. just read the textbook and go to lecture. only three tests throughout the semester makes up the grade. i just took it for fun and i actually learned quite a bit. first psych class at yale and it was really interesting to me.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I found the topics very interesting and loved each lecture. The workload is very manageable and you only have three exams. You get to learn so much of the primary research in this field from one of the most prominent researchers in social psychology, which is really cool!",
    "Yes, it's not too difficult but is fairly interesting, and the exams are very reasonable.",
    "A solid, if unspectacular, lecture. I felt that I learned a number of interesting concepts, but there were other times I was extremely bored and really had to make an effort to pay attention in class. Grading was based solely on three equally-weighted and non-cumulative exams, which were made up of both content from lecture and from the textbook, and I had to read the textbook to do well on them. The unfortunate thing about this was that there was nothing taught in lecture that I couldn't just read in the book, but there was plenty in the book not covered in lecture. I probably could have read only the book and done just as well in the course. Speaking of grades, the curve is really rough, so if you are not a pysch major, I strongly recommend taking this class Credit\/D.",
    "It was an okay class, but I wouldn't take it again.",
    "It was a good psych class, but focused more on research. A little boring but interesting class!"
