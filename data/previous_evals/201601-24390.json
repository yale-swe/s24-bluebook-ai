    "Good class, expanded my understanding of governance considerably, (more-so than, perhaps, my understanding of Africa which is just too diverse to expect to cover in one course). Professor Lierl expects careful reading and critical thinking, but investing in this course definitely pays off.",
    "Awesome class, and very relevant. Prof Lierl is amazing. This was my thesis seminar, and I couldn't have picked a more helpful and enthusiastic and innovative professor. I am very grateful for his instruction, and appreciative of his direction in writing my thesis."
