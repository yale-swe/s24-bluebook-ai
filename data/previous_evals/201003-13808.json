    "Palestinian Lit was an eye-opening introduction to the poetry, short stories, memoirs, and novels of Palestinians living in Israel\/Palestine and the diaspora from the early 20th century until today. I would definitely recommend this class to another student whether he or she has background in this area or not. The only caveat is that Professor Nassar has strong opinions on the Israeli\/Palestinian conflict and is not shy about sharing them. While the class is technically about literature, the topic brings in a lot of politics and history. If you're up for understanding another's perspective that might challenge you at first, take this class!",
    "This class is pretty much what it sounds like: a solid introduction to the Palestinian literary canon. It's not a class that's very heavy into literary analysis for its own sake: it's about examining the Palestinian narrative through literature.Hala seems crazy, but she is actually not that scary, I promise. (Okay, maybe sometimes she is that scary.) She's a brilliant professor who expects a lot out of her students. Our class was pretty small, but I ended up getting a lot out of it, even though I spent the first few weeks afraid she was going to kill me with her eyes. Her passion brings the material to life in a way I haven't seen in any other class at Yale. I'd highly recommend this class to another student, especially because it gets at the Israeli-Palestinian issue from an angle that is essential to understanding it, but is glossed over in most classes that approach the issue from either the Israeli or the \"neutral\" political science perspective.",
    "This class is a survey of Palestinian Literature, beginning with poetry, then the novella, then full length novels. The readings are amazing, the discussions are great. This class is entirely discussion based, so if you do your reading and come prepared you will be fine. Professor Nassar is amazing."
