   "comments": [
    "I would summarize this course by saying that that topic itself is interesting and worth learning about, but that this course may not be the way to do it. I would not recommend this course to another student because I feel that I didn't learn enough about the topic given the full semester time commitment, and I was unhappy with the structure of the course and uncomfortable with the atmosphere surrounding it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Psychology 512 01 to another student, especially for student outside of clinical psychology who might have less prior experience with this research. The class is all about studying emotions and how it is realted to human behavior but each week we examined emotions through a different scope, including neuroscience, cognition, and physiology.",
    "I would because I think that this class overall provided a good review of the affective science literature, past and current. I think that I would like to see less emphasis on student led presentations, but overall the free-flowing discussion was a major positive aspect of this class.",
    "I would recommend it to any student who wanted a good review of the literature on emotion.",
    "Overview of current research in affective science. I would recommend for students specifically interested in learning about affective science.",
    "This class is worthwhile if you know VERY LITTLE or NOTHING about emotion, and don't have a very busy semester going on. Otherwise, skip it. If you know the basics already, you won't learn much else, and the aggravation is just not worth it.The professor was inconsiderate and inappropriate, and did not offer much feedback or seemed knowledgeable.The workload is intense, if you are juggling many other things at the same time (e.g., other classes, TFing, etc.)",
    "Yeah sure. Fairly interesting intro to important topics in affective science.",
    "Its requirements are the heaviest of all the courses I've taken so far: weekly readings, weekly writings, presentations, presentation evaluations (in class), final paper editing (your work), final paper critiquing (others' work), and then final paper itself (due relatively early). But there is a lot to get out of the class: critical reading\/thinking, public speaking, the art of peer review, and how to write a concise literature review. I'd recommend the class to someone who is willing to put in the effort.",
    "yes, especially as a requirement fulfillment, but it is a lot of work, so I would only recommend to students with a strong interest in the course content."

   "comments": [
    "Though I wish I had learned more from this course, I was able to use some knowledge I gained in my own work, and to take some of the writing I did for this course and repurpose it for other writing I have done related to my own research.",
    "I think this was a good course for me to take as I rarely read about human emotion research within my own sub-discipline. I study emotion but from an animal behavior perspective so I think it is valuable to know the human research that parallels my own work.",
    "I think that this course added to my existing understanding of affective science literature and the discussion of current topics\/debates\/controversies in the field was illuminating.",
    "I am now more deeply considering affective contributions to the phenomena I am researching.",
    "It's hard to say. I knew very little of emotion research prior to taking the class, so it did technically deepen my knowledge of the discipline. But I am not sure I will necessarily apply this to my empirical work, at least not for know.Many of the assigned readings were quite old. Sometimes it is good to read old work\u00e2\u0080\u0094--there are seminal articles that are must-reads in any field. But this did not seem to be the case, it just seemed like the professor was not up-to-date with the literature, very simply.",
    "It has the potential to impact my future research. We'll see."
