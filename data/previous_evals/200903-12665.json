   "comments": [
    "Waste of time. Professor Wargo did a poor job structuring this class. The specific assignments had not yet been decided upon--they were sometimes emailed out to us the day before class met, meaning few people did the reading. There was no connection from one week to the next. Professor Wargo did a poor job engaging students. ALthough he is knowledgeable, he made great generalizations and repeated himself often in class. Class time was thus incredibly frustrating, particularly since there is a great interest among students for this subject matter.",
    "Absolutely. It might take some time to figure out which reading to concentrate on, but the class is relevant and the readings are interesting.",
    "If you are willing to be patient as courses like this one continue to develop, then take it. You will get as much out of it as you awnt.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in the material.",
    "Take this seminar if you want to work with Professor Wargo on an individual project and if you are interested in having discussions about your ideas rather than something proscribed by an author (you won't be analyzing readings). You also might get a chance to go hiking with the class in the Adirondacks!",
    "It's a great course for anyone who has never studied environmental problems, but it gives a lot of freedom for anyone who wants to study a lot of different topics or something in depth. Reading isn't too bad, even though a lot of it is surveys or reports. Most of the grade will be participation and the final paper.",
    "this class is worth taking if only to get to know professor wargo as a teacher because he is very helpful and very interesting. otherwise, a pretty easy seminar."
