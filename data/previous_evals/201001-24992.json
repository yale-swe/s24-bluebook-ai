    "This is a very difficult class in terms of subject matter, but it is not hard to do well in the class. Simply try your best, and you will do fine. Heat and Mass Transfer is very important in a lot of engineering applications, and it would be worth it to take this class even if you are not ABET.",
    "The workload isn't particularly easy, and the material can get fairly heavy. However, the class provides a thorough understanding of one of engineering's most important subjects across all disciplines, and the professor makes it worthwhile so long as you commit to showing up for class."
