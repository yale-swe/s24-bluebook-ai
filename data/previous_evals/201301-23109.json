    "Overall a good course -- it provides a solid foundation for signal\/image analysis. There are a few sections on physiological modeling (which are really cool!), but it is mostly a math-based course. The work is very manageable, and both Prof. Duncan and Prof. Staib are committed to helping you understand the material.",
    "You'll have to take it for the major. It's not the most exciting class, but it's manageable by all means. The homework is relatively easy and the exams are open note. Staib and Duncan are extremely nice and approachable and really want everyone to get a good grade.",
    "The subject matter is interesting, but the presentation is really dry. Overall not too bad, and not much work.",
    "BME 352 is a fairly straight forward course. Expectations are clearly laid out, so its very manageable. Lots of fourier transforms and some modeling. Its a useful math basis for other imaging classes that may focus more on specific imaging techniques rather than the basic processing done to create the image. Lectures can be a little dry at times, but I think understanding its application helps you realize how relevant\/important this stuff is.",
    "Doable class. Lectures are often boring but the problem sets aren't too terrible and the TA is helpful. The professors tell you the types of questions that are on the exams and the exams are open book so they aren't bad.",
    "Kind of dry material, but the information is presented in a very organized manner that makes it easy to remember.",
    "352 is a good class. Duncan's lectures were particularly engaging. Problem sets aren't too hard and you learn a good amount of signal processing that can easily be delved into further by messing around with Matlab.",
    "Overall this is an interesting course. It is a very manageable course and has a fair amount of course work. The midterm and the final are open note.",
    "As a required course, this was one of my favorites mostly because Staib and Duncan present the material very well, even as someone who entered the class with little interest in imaging and signal procesing. Definitely look forward to it Junior year!",
    "I was just at the dentist, where a technician was looking at xrays of my teeth in an imaging software program, and it was so cool to watch them apply different filters to modify the image and understand how the program worked! This is just one of the ways in which this course teaches the theory and then the practical application of biomedical signals and imaging. Although the lectures can get a bit dry at times, I learned a lot, I appreciated that the professors were always available to meet with me when I was confused, and I thought that the problem sets were helpful to my understanding of the course material and a healthy challenge. Also, all of the powerpoints and class lecture notes are uploaded online, which is helpful. And the exams are open note \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is really great!",
    "This class is pretty good. I was kind of scared coming in, since signals\/images sounds like the \"hard\" part of BME, but it's not a bad experience at all. Duncan and Staib are awesome -- they teach the stuff really well, keep the course organized\/well-structured, and really care about the students. There were 9 psets, a midterm, and a final. Both exams were 4 questions each (2 for each professor's material), and were open book\/notes, so they're not too bad. Get together with classmates to do the psets, and they'll go by pretty smoothly. I didn't really go to section, but people said the TA (Austin) was helpful most of the time. You learn a lot from this course, and you have to take it for BME, so I'd definitely recommend it!",
    "Almost everyone taking this class is a BME major."
