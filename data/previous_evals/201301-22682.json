    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "Spanish 140 is basically exactly what you'd expect after 130, although this time you get to read an actual book in Spanish, which is nice. I've heard the class depends a lot on the professor, so definitely take it with Prof. Lomask if you can!! She is absolutely great.",
    "Yes. Like most other Spanish classes.",
    "I took 140 after 120 and it definitely felt like more work, but it was nothing too crazy. Take it with Laurie. She's the best!",
    "I would if you have to, and if you don't, I would still say that it is worth taking if you can find a nice professor. Laurie is the one to take.",
    "I would recommend it as a good way to improve Spanish.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student. Well organized, well taught and time well spent for those wanting to learn the language or improve upon already acquired skills.",
    "Good if you get the right instructor",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Great way to improve on your grammar! But keep in mind that there isn't as much of a focus on fluency, at least not in my class. Daily homework isn't too hard at all and you end up watching a few movies and reading a novel at the end which wasn't too bad. Laurie was always very friendly and willing to help, but not always well organized. We didn't get our homework assignments back for weeks at a time on occasion."
