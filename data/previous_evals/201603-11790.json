   "comments": [
    "I learned SO much taking this course. I learned about American history via a narrative I haven't heard before, one that goes unmentioned in standard high school education. I feel like a course like this is a must-take for Yale students. I realized my privileges to a deeper extent and how inequality has been systemically created both by the government and social forces.",
    "This class was a pure joy. The skill I really valued was learning how to evaluate race, class, and gender as spatial constructs. Both the Professor and the TA were excellent at synthesizing academic sources with personal experience. As a result, I walked away fro every lecture understanding more about how humans use urban spaces and what the consequences can be.",
    "I am now better equipped to understand the layered factors that are responsible for creating the complex environment we live in.",
    "This class does a great job at assigning reflective papers, such as field projects, that require you to go out into the world and explore something new. I also learned so much about structural discrimination in this class, and I truly enjoyed every lecture.",
    "I learned valuable frameworks with which to examine all historical threads I study\/come across. In particular, learned a lot about the politicization of space.",
    "This class provided a really eye-opening insight into the processes that occur in American cities that shape the way we view race, class, and gender. This class has definitely made me more aware of how I view and interact with the world.",
    "I developed the ability to go back to spaces I grew up with and in and analyze the ways in which that space was codified for particular groups of people. I very much learned to view race, class, and gender as spacial constructs as well as social constructs, and I very much learned that the spacial and social aspects of life are not as far apart as we make them out to be. It definitely helped me become a deeper thinker with regard to how a space can define certain things.",
    "The class was very insightful. I got a different perspective in regards to race, class, and gender in American cities. A lot of the things that I overlooked in my community have reasons for the way they are. The class changed my life and possibly my career path.",
    "A LOT! how to better understand society, I know that sounds vague but really this class touched on many different topics that pertain to the creation and facilitation of our society.",
    "Too much to list! Honestly, this course changed the trajectory of my career and life. Got much better at thinking about how systems intersect and produce cause-and-effect relationships that might not be obvious. I also think I'm a better, more informed voter and citizen because of this class.",
    "A broad introduction to urban studies, both historically and with present topics.",
    "I learned about a lot of historical processes\/policies that have really deepened my understanding of urban inequality and structures, and the role of spatial organization in creating race (this class was light on the Gender side, though).",
    "This class examined the underlying historical processes of the racial, gender and class inequalities that we experience daily. I learned a new set of vocabulary to speak about inequality in cities and a new lens through which to view it.",
    "I learned to think critically about the spaces I inhabit and how inequality is so entrenched in our lives. But the course wasn't solely about preaching the dangers of neoliberalism--it took us through the history that led to contemporary urban inequality. It was so interesting.",
    "I gained a much deeper understanding of race in American cities from this class. The readings and lectures challenged my previous views of discrimination existing primarily in intentional acts, but rather proposed a more structural view with its emphasize on space and physical infrastructure. I learned what words that I see a lot like \"neoliberal\" meant and how they related to the current policies prevalent in the USA. My understanding of issues of class and gender also improved (especially with regards to transit), though I think, for me, the history of race came across to me much more potently. (Perhaps because I had devoted more thought to class and gender in the past than I had to race)",
    "I learned about the ways in which race, class, and gender shape American cities. I particularly enjoyed learning about the ways in which 19th and 20th-century policies & events shaped much of what cities look like and how they function today. The material was very accessible, as someone who had limited background knowledge. Overall, I think this class made me a more mindful and aware person, and it has also made me wonder what I personally can do to improve certain situations. I can't think of the last time I came away from a course feeling this way, so I think that says a lot! (Thank you, Professor Barraclough!!)",
    "I learned how cities work for different groups of people. How they benefit some, and marginalize others. In a nutshell, we learned about the complicated inner-workings of American cities",
    "Woah so much. I learned how to see the world around me. Literally, I was attentionall blind to so much. this class got me WOKE AF",
    "intersection approach to politics",
    "WOW. This course opened my eyes and gave me a vocabulary to describe things that had always bothered me growing up, but never had the words to adequately discuss. I now have a far more critical eye to look at and understand urban development and planning and how those factors impact minority groups and favor very few.",
    "gained an incredible insight into american institutions and how they have historically and continue to perpetuate inequality along race, class, and gendered lines.",
    "I started to understand how racism and other forms of oppression aren't just individual acts but systems of oppression. I gained a vocabulary to explain and understand these systems and the trends taking place in American cities.",
    "I think this course should be required for all students. I learned so much about the history of American cities, and about why cities are the way they are. I feel I definitely have gained a vocabulary to talk about urban history and historic racism and inequality in our cities.",
    "The concept of spatiality was the biggest takeaway for me from this course. it relates to so many forms of injustice: gentrification, lack of affordable housing, the Middle Passage, man-spreading\/mansplaining, displacement from sacred land, etc. I learned about specific laws and policies that have led to race class, and gender inequalities in the US. I learned about neoliberalism, voyeurism, ruin porn, the possessive investment in whiteness, revanchism, urban farming, environmental injustices, foodways, and more!",
    "This class should be a must-take for every Yale student. The content covered in the course is so important for every citizen of America who wants to understand the nature of injustice and inequality in this country. Professor Barraclough carefully curated the syllabus to follow a straightforward historical narrative, and drew connections between every unit of the course. I feel like I now understand the history of injustice and how cities developed to look the way they do, privileging the wealthy and white over others. This course has given me incredible insight into American culture and history.",
    "Great Course",
    "I learned how to view urban development as a collection of forces that generated and still promote massive inequality in urban and suburban areas.",
    "Perspective, context, intersectionality. This class is the definition of comprehensive. Knowledge that is highly applicable to everyday life.",
    "A new framework for analyzing the issues we face today, which I've learned are rooted in historical processes and policies. A more practical thing I'm taking away is a newfound appreciation for the bus. Prof. Barraclough's field projects were the type of hands-on learning that is missing from college in general. I will notice things I did not before taking this course.",
    "I learned aboout my home city, and the processes that ocurred that allowed me to grow up in a suburban neighborhood. I learned that natural movements of people are in reality unnatural movements due to dehumanizing government policy. I learned how people have mobilized against this policy and the results of that. The knowledge I gained in Race, Class and Gender follow me when I visit my grandparenta in Buffalo, New York, and when I talk to my cousin about her work at a charter school in Minnesota. Race, Class and Gender permeates my life and enhances my understanding of the underlying phenomena that guide the subtle remarks of my friends and family about how they moved up in society and why others havent.",
    "None",
    "I LEARNED SO MUCH IN THIS COURSE! I gained a hands-on view of race, class, and gender in American Cities. Course material was woke, assignments were applicable, and the readings were incredible. I was able to apply my knowledge in class, section, and even just in conversation with friends.",
    "Learned a lot about how cities (including New Haven) are spatialized as a result of their histories and legacies of inequality. Good introduction to conducting fieldwork and making observations as an outside observer.",
    "I learned about the history of some types of inequalities in American cities, and why they are the way that they are today. I didn't learn a ton in this class, but got a good general overview of this way of thinking about cities -- through a historical lens that explains the inequality we see today.",
    "I gained a history of spacial inequality, constructed through the institution of whiteness, in America. I have historical background for the realities of spacial inequality that I can observe today. I also have technical terms for more of the systems I see and know cultural references and examples for both resulting and oppositional practices and justice groups today.",
    "I learned SO SO much about the ways in which cities operate as sites of struggle against various forms of inequality, and I thought about cities (including my hometown) in deeper and more nuanced ways. This is such an incredible course.",
    "I have a new perspective on how to view the constructed world around me. Now that I know the historical context within which these processes took place, and their subsequent social implications, I am able to question why and where things are in a new and meaningful way.",
    "Outstanding course! As a freshman, this class was exactly what I was looking for: a focused, informative, comprehensive introduction to the roots of urban inequality. I feel I have a stronger understanding of historical processes that have led to urban inequality and current policies and organizing efforts to combat inequality. I look at gentrification and opportunity in inner cities and in my own suburban community differently than I did before.",
    "How to understand and talk about complex issues dealing with race, class, and gender in modern America. You get a lot of American history and that tells you why things are the way they are. Shows you the intentionality behind the policies. Really really important stuff!",
    "Everyone should be required to take this class. It's interesting, fair, and I learned so much.",
    "I really appreciated how the course brought to our attention so many important issues in our society that can often be overlooked. It offered an opportunity to push oneself beyond the basic understanding of race, class, and gender dynamics.",
    "I learned how to evaluate the environment of the city I live in through the processes of inequalities that are perpetuated in the categories across the spectrum of race, class, and gender.",
    "I learned how to think critically about issues that are often generalized. I learned how to take an ethnographic approach to social history",
    "I learned about the intersections of race, class, and gender in cities from the time slaves were still being held up until now. We learned about processes that disenfranchise people based on their race, class, and\/or gender, and how these same processes prevent people from escaping poverty, working or not. The class was incredibly enlightening because it looked at a lot of patterns in housing, employment, and transportation that are right in front of us in our everyday lives, and yet go unnoticed as racist, sexist systems.",
    "I got to take a deeper look into race and ethnicity and its correlation to social and economic inequality, specifically through the lens of urban areas",
    "I learned so much about American society in this course. All the inequalities regarding race, class, and gender became so much clearer. Although I was able to notice the inequality around me, I didn't know the specific terms that explained these phenomenons until taking this class. Most importantly though, was how learning how these inequalities were perpetuated through the use of space. Analyzing issues in a spatial context was something I had never learned before and found it very enlightening. I definitely think that type of approach to issues can be applied to problems outside of race, class, and gender as well, which I really appreciate.",
    "I learned many concepts, both historical and contemporary in relevance, that have played a role in shaping the racialized, gendered, socio-economic distribution of today. My ability to discuss policies that pertain to such topics as housing, the gentrification of communities, displacement, environmental justice, policing, and other similar subjects has improved. I am more comfortable in New Haven, and find myself to be more of an observer of the palimpsests of history's effects on today's world. Most importantly, the class has made me feel like my passion around these issues exists in a much more informed, directed state. I feel empowered to make changes in my community, to support organizations or efforts that we learned about that are making a difference in the lives of low income, racial minority communities.",
    "restructured my understanding of how racial gender and class inequalities came to be. fascinating material that changed my entire perspective",
    "I developed insights about how the world works, how the US has worked, and how historical processes underlie current patterns of inequality. My eyes were opened by this class and I feel like I understand how everything fits into its historical context now in a way that I definitely did not before. I think about this class every day, in the majority of my interactions, and it has changed my perspective significantly.",
    "This course was fantastic. It gave a great background of how American Cities came to be how they are today, and explained a lot of racial dynamics I've always known, but couldn't explicitly state.",
    "I learned about the intersections between many different social forces that I had never considered before. I learned to look at the way things are, the way structures exist currently, more critically, and discern what forces went into shaping them. I learned that few things come to be \"naturally,\" most are a result of intentional policies.",
    "I learned to think critically about the structures of privilege that have shaped American metropolitan environments. This was some of the most tangible knowledge I've learned at Yale. It gave me a framework for understand the inequality in America today, which is invaluable.",
    "AMST 196 taught me to consider cities in light of the policies, programs, and practices that shaped them.",
    "I learned a lot about why there are racial inequalities in the united states.",
    "I think that this course allowed me to see the importance of contextualizing the processes that are considered \"race-blind\" but that instead have racism and inequality embedded in them.",
    "An incredible class, helps put the ways in which race, class, and gender are tied to space and the development of cities. Take this class!",
    "I developed factual, historical, structural, and socio-cultural understanding of the ways in which race\/class\/gender inequities are inscribed in urban settings. This was particularly oriented towards the production of public space, the politics of transit and the environment, and the mechanisms of social organizing. This understanding was an indispensable way of looking at the cities around me as well as a firm basis by which to counter arguments for neoliberal governance.",
    "This class confirmed many of the things I was experiencing in terms of equality and inequality within the spaces that I navigated as a low-income POC women. I also learned more concretely the specific processes and policies that exacerbated but also fostered and created this inequality of space as well.",
    "From this class I learned many of the underlying laws and policies that contributed to race, class, and gender inequality. This class emphasizes how segregation and inequality continue to grow, and that these processes are not natural, but nevertheless have become built into our laws and infrastructure and thus have become spatialized. This class gives you the background knowledge necessary to critically evaluate inequalities-- information that is essential to understand many equality issues going on today.",
    "The objective of the class was to be able to discuss systems of inequality\/explain why things are the way they are. It definitely worked!",
    "I learned incredible knowledge about urban inequality, some of which I've begun to use each time I go into urban areas.",
    "I developed significant insight into the inequalities that are present specifically in cities today, and the historical basis of these disparities.",
    "This course taught me how to suss out the historical processes behind today's stratified, inequitable urban landscape, how to engage respectfully and substantially with the city around me, and how to question my preconceived notions of the spaces I inhabit. By the end of the course, I felt comfortable enough with the material that I was able to successfully adapt it to different academic contexts: ideas brought up in this class blossomed into an extensive research paper for another.",
    "Tools to analyze patterns through a spatial lens, and see that these patterns are not merely an accident or \"the way things are\", but largely intentional effects of social views, authority, and public policy. It will give you the tools to investigate inequality, as well as the confirm that people are organized across space in the U.S. on the basis of race, class, and gender, with overwhelming evidence from readings, lectures, and observation.",
    "This class gives both a historical and a current view on urban issues in America and how they have developed.",
    "I gained great insights into the separation of spaces in city affect race, class, and gender. This course also taught me about the impact that housing discrimination has on current issues like Environmental Justice. This course provided a great amount of knowledge about racial, gender-based, and class-based issues in American cities.",
    "I learned a lot concerning the ways our cities have been shaped, and the problems that they face. It has also been interesting to see my own city, Saint Louis, reflected in our studies.",
    "This course had a really clear take away, which was that the past is crucial to understanding the present particularly with regards to inequality along race, gender and class lines in cities. I learned to take a more critical, radical approach to inequality in cities.",
    "I learned how race, class, and gender was spatially constructed. Now I can see the demographics of American cities not just on the surface but with a deeper understanding of the history and multiple structures that created how they are today.",
    "I mostly learned about the history of cities and some about policies. It got a little wishy-washy and simplistic in the second half, and seemed very one-sided.",
    "I learned how to notice disparities in urban space and instead of simply accept that that's just how things are, ask, \"what historical policies and actions are to blame for these inequalities?\" This class really challenged my perceptions of equality among city residents.",
    "I learned so much in this course! It has been one of my favorite courses at Yale. In general, I learned about the history of urban spaces with an emphasis on how race, class, gender play a role in terms of their theological and spatial consequences. I not only learned about history but gained knowledge that impacts how I look at cities today.",
    "This course was incredibly impactful for me; living in the U.S. I have been inherently aware of many of the systematic injustices faced by much of the population. However, this course directly and masterfully exposed the policy, the decisions, and the perspectives that form the results we have seen and see now. I learned skills to help me excavate issues in the future, as well as holistic, applicable knowledge relating to American cities. I left in reflection, sometimes angry, sometimes upset, but always inspired to share this important knowledge and make changes in the future.",
    "Learned about history of discrimination in US. Focused largely on racial inequality over space.",
    "Amazing insights",
    "This class taught me about the interactions of race, class, and gender at levels far beyond that of urban space. From this class, I learned about constructions of privilege, about crucial, under-discussed histories of many great U.S. cities, and more broadly, about the profound effects governments have on their constituents. This class has taught me to look at urban centers as we know them today with a completely different lens.",
    "I learned the history behind the racial and gender based stereotypes and actual patterns of living in american cities",
    "-Practiced how to skim readings effectively -taking good notes in a large lecture class -policies and historical causes of modern de facto segregation and racial wealth gap -the terminology and understanding of modern urban issues"

   "comments": [
    "I think it would have been helpful to have one more assignment at some point in the semester to do more integrated thinking, drawing together ideas that we've had throughout the course. Maybe a creative writing assignment or something low-key, but I wished I had one more opportunity to reflect on my learning. Other than that it was wonderful!",
    "I loved this class. My only remark is that lecture discussion was lacking, but that is to be expected in a 200+ person class. Also, I would have enjoyed more specific New Haven examples.",
    "Only strengths - Barraclough and the TAs were fantastic. Course material was relevant and sections were hotspots for productive discussion.",
    "THIS CLASS IS AMAZING. This class is the best class I've taken at Yale!! I've learned so much about discrimination, both implicit and explicit, in the world around me that I feel like a different person. Prof. Barraclough makes her lectures interesting and exciting that you'll actually want to attend every one! The assignments are perfectly laid out- two 5 page papers (reflective projects), a midterm and a final (both with extensive study guides)- so there are no surprises and you don't feel like you're being tricked. She wants you to take in the information and become a better person. Perfect class in every way!",
    "I really enjoyed this course!",
    "I think this class gives a really good overview of a lot of key topics. It was generally paced really well, though at times it seemed like some topics we kind of only glanced over. Generally, the material was really interesting and engaging. I really loved how at the end of the course, the class was tied back into where it began (even using the slides from the first day!). This helped ground and summarize the trajectory of the course and put into context everything we had learned. One weakness was the spacing of the field projects and film screenings, they seemed very lopsidedly towards the end of the semester.",
    "I think the course was strong in many ways. There was a lot of discussion about many different aspects of urbanization and living in cities. There was a lot of discussion about the lived experiences of individuals, which balanced out well with the discussion of space and provided a gateway through which to see race, class, and gender as social and spacial constructs. I also think that the field projects were a good way to get students to really \/see\/ what was happening for themselves, because while some may have been raised with the experiences described in class, many weren't. In terms of weakness, I do think there was a documentary that we watched in late September\/early October (can't quite remember the date) that was problematic in many ways. It did discuss a couple of points that were relevant to the class at the time in large ways, but the overall film made it very hard to really takeaway from without feeling some sort of discomfort, disdain, or disgust from the way particular groups of people were represented.",
    "I love prof. Barraclough. I think the only suggestion would be to add maybe a lecture on what we can specifically do. Yes many factors have produced the massive injustices of our society, but what can we do NOW that these injustices are already in place?",
    "Strengths: great TF, Prof. Barraclough is amazing!, surprising level of audience engagement despite large lecture, manageable but useful assignments (both readings and exams\/papers). Weaknesses: none I can think of, except that the class was big, but this isn't really an issue.",
    "The expectations for the two \"field\" assignments were really vague--they were looking for something specific but that was poorly communicated, and the grading between sections was all over the place.",
    "This class did a great job of linking historical processes with today's state of urban inequality.",
    "The lectures given in this course were very well thought out and interesting to listen to and contained a lot of useful information. I thought that the readings were well-selected as well, for similar reasons. The one criticism I have is that it was sometimes the direction of the course was a bit unclear, which made it difficult to pick out what was important. This was especially true when we shifted from history to current practices and had a bunch of readings about the new organizing - it seemed like a big shift with not too much announcement and confused me a little.",
    "Prof Barraclough's lectures were well-organized and engaging. She planned them very well for the amount of time we had in class twice a week. The syllabus, too, was well-organized - I felt like I had a very good sense of how race, class, and gender shaped US cities throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Also, the amount of reading assigned each week was usually very reasonable, which is not always typical of history lectures. I really appreciated the way that Professor Barraclough provided study guides for both the midterm and the exam. This helped me focus my studies and stress less, which was definitely conducive to more effective and mindful studying! I probably would have appreciated this lecture more if it were in a smaller, more personal space? (especially given the subject matter) The room felt too large - and it was hard to see some of the smaller text on the screen from the back of the room.",
    "Strength: I really liked the field projects. Getting a chance to engage with New Haven outside the Yale bubble is not something I've done through class until this course. Weakness: Sometimes specific terms were glossed over and not explained very well",
    "All strengths. Everything. Take it. Wait, the films were bad. Change the movies. But take it. All good.",
    "amazing professor, material and readings were engaging,",
    "The courses strength is the course itself. It's sososo fantastic. Seriously, take it. That said, I really wasn't a fan of the first field project. It felt a little uncomfortable having to take notes on people while they were going about their day. Wish it had been a bit more focused on personal troubles encountered while using public transit instead of other people.",
    "Great survey course, wish i could have taken it as a freshmen. loved the field assignments, definitely give yourselves enough time to grapple with them fully. You'll usually want to spend more time than you thought.",
    "I thought this class was excellent for a student like me: willing to learn but completely uninformed about urban studies and really systems of oppression in general. Some of the assignments felt somewhat voyeuristic and othering of the people who weren't the assumed student, which seemed to be white, middle class, and suburban. This describes me fairly well so I rarely felt out of place but I felt like some of my poc friends in the class were kind of frustrated by the tone of \"these people live like this, believe it or not!\" that sometimes permeated the lectures and assignments.",
    "I think the lectures were very interesting, and there was the perfect amount of reading. I actually enjoyed doing readings each week, and never got overwhelmed by having too much reading to do as often happens in other classes. I also think the range of readings was great; I was exposed to a lot of topics related to the field, and found some interesting things to look into further. The field projects were also great. They were not too much work, and they really made us think and apply what we had been learning, which was very valuable. I think this class more than any other I have taken so far has really pushed me to think creatively and come up with original ideas and arguments to write about, and I think the field projects helped a lot with that.",
    "I think that one major weakness of this course was that it attracted people who already held very leftist economic\/social\/political views, so most our discussions sections were echo chambers and my views were rarely challenged. I wish the readings and lectures were less biased toward the left; I think there are valid arguments for some types of gentrification and neoliberalism, for example, but these concepts for immediately cast off as terrible. In that same vein, one of the strengths of this course was the discussions led by student activists who know a lot about issues of inequality. Although they rarely challenged my views (because I generally agree with them), I did learn from them, giving me a deeper understanding of concepts Id only read about or heard mentioned in theoretical contexts. This course is great because all of the lectures are well-organized and easy to follow. Prof. Barraclough is extremely kind, understanding, and humble when it comes to discussions of race, class, and gender inequality. She handles controversial topics calmly and eloquently. One of the weaknesses of the course is that its not challenging enough, so I didnt learn as much as I could have had the readings been more mandatory or the content more advanced.",
    "The course material was incredibly engaging and contained a lot of new topics and ideas I had never seen before. Lecture complemented readings perfectly and were very obviously prepared with care and consideration of how to make the 50mins of best use for covering the material. I thoroughly enjoyed this class and it was actually the course I looked forward to going to the most this semester.",
    "This course does an amazing job focusing on racial and economic injustice. However, the discussion of gendered inequality often seemed like an afterthought, and the discussions of gender lacked real depth. The online readings are great, although the main text of the course, \"The Origins of the Urban Crisis\" was dense and data-heavy and not a very interesting read. The rest of the syllabus and the film screenings were great.",
    "The lectures are engaging and section discussions varied. The exams and field projects synthesized the course material quite successfully. However, the field projects could be improved by offering more room for new arguments that haven't been discussed in lecture or section, rather than just testing our comprehension of course themes.",
    "No changes. Loved this course. Must take for everyone at Yale.",
    "Strengths: Interesting concepts that are applicable to the lives of many, giving names to phenomena that are very present in the modern world and gives understanding the historical roots of said phenomena Weaknesses: Very low engagement needed to be successful in course, not challenging",
    "The lectures and readings were very informative and interesting. The field projects were a great way to get to know New Haven. Many of the questions asked for reflections, essays, etc., however, were extremely broad and therefore difficult to answer sufficiently.",
    "Strengths: the aforementioned field projects, and that it treats itself differently from most classes: it opens your eyes along with your mind. Weakness: I got away with not doing most readings, even though I really enjoyed the material.",
    "This course was engaging and is critically important for all Yale students to take. It widened my view on how cities change and how they move the people within them. This courseis inspiring and also depressing -- it made me realize how far cities have come and also how car they still must go to be able to overcome the inherent discrimination that permeates their borders.",
    "This was the same as any other urban studies 101 class. Should be marketed like that, not like some super special lens of race, class, and gender.",
    "I can not think of any weaknesses to this course. All material was tied together very well. Slides and lectures were engaging. It was easy to take notes. Professor Barraclough explained phenomena in plain english. Exams were EXTREMELY fair, but not gutty. I honestly feel that the way they were structured helped me learn so much. Best class at Yale.",
    "I loved the assignments. Just wish the readings could include a mix of more journalistic\/ less academic writing. Sometimes it is hard to parse through the ideas.",
    "Very well-structured class overall. I would say that I think students would learn more if the midterm and final did not have \"study guides\" that were basically the test given out ahead of time--this tends to make students study only that material, sometimes ignoring the bigger pictures of the overall class. The fieldwork assignments are excellent and force students to engage with the larger community, something encouraged in very few other Yale classes.",
    "This course appealed to me because of my interest in urban studies. It was good overall, but it should be great. For one, I think it is too simplistic in its presentation of some of the issues it treats, like transportation inequality, neoliberalism, and gentrification. I would love to get into each of these issues in-depth, but the syllabus only allowed students to acquaint themselves with them just barely. In other words, the workload was one of the lightest of any classes I've taken at Yaleand I would have liked to do more reading about these issues! For example, what are the benefits (if any) of gentrification and neoliberalism? Could we have looked at New Urbanism (Celebration, FL?), Section 8 housing, and other facets of the subject? In sum: all of the pieces were there for this course, I just think there should be even more! This said, Professor Barraclough is brilliant and a huge asset to Yale. Also: although my TF was fine-to-good, I heard unfortunate things about other TFsthat they were inaccessible, inconsistent with grading, wrote the same feedback comments verbatim on multiple papers, or showed no interest in discussing assigned readings in section. I hope this can be taken into consideration if the course is taught again next year!",
    "The strengths of this class are in Professor Barraclough's passion for this subject and linking the historical parts of the first half of the class to the trends in the second half of the class. It was interesting to view cities through this lens, and the class was well-organized -- in thinking about the historical forces (industrialization, etc.) have shaped inequality in cities today (environmental inequality, race-based inequality. etc). The weakness is that, honestly, I don't feel like I learned much. The lectures are interesting, but pretty cursory - about a lot of general ideas and themes, with some specific anecdotes - and there is really little work\/very little expected of you. A lot of this does depend on TA's, and my TA was absurdly relaxed - there was a tiny amount of reading, and relaxed field projects, and then super easy tests (she even gave us study guides for tests, which I haven't had since high school). So the class was very chill, which was nice - but it's also a weakness because I felt like I didn't actually learn that much\/get much out of the class.",
    "Strengths: incredibly interesting and necessary information; efficient lectures; great professor; stayed on schedule; feasible workload weaknesses: sometimes repetitive; perhaps a variety of qualities depending on your TF",
    "Professor Barraclough is amazing, and she brought so much scholarship, witty ideas, energy, and knowledge to lecture every day. It was never boring.",
    "Laura's lectures were outstanding: efficient, engaging, informative, well-paced, incorporating a variety of sources - I came away feeling like I'd learned exactly what I needed to know. My section was incredibly helpful in reinforcing the lectures - I liked doing the weekly blogs to process the readings, and our discussions were passionate and pushed me to think more deeply about the material. I thought the readings were well-chosen. Both of the projects were interesting, thought I felt the bus project forced me to be overly judgmental and create broad generalizations from observations of a few people. The gentrification project felt more genuine.",
    "Incredible course! I learned so so much on a really relevant topic. Strength: the focus on lots of different types of policy and how those policies shaped space for different races, classes and genders. Really makes you realize how important policies are. Weakness: Focused a lot of blacks and latinos for the first have of the semester and low-income people for the second half. Felt a little repetitive after a while. Would have liked to see more discussion on Native Americans and Asian Americans. As well as more economic analysis on socioeconomic class. It's easy to say \"oh low-income people are marginalized and that sucks and we should fix it\" but what are the obstacles to fixing it? There is an economic trade-off, not just a moral trade-off, and I don't think we addressed that enough.",
    "I really enjoyed the lectures, and the tests were well-structured. the essay questions on the tests each seemed to be two separate questions, however, so I would appreciate them being more specific. Additionally, while the writing assignments were useful in learning the material, I would appreciate more liberty with coming up with a personalized project to allow for greater engagement.",
    "I think for a survey course, it does an amazing job of talking about cities in a way that is alternative to the normal discourse. There is SO MUCH material, and time is of the essence in a semester-long course, but I think Professor Barraclough did an amazing job tying together themes and issues that relate to race, class, and gender. it would be a disservice to only address one of these things, as they work in tandem, as we learned. I do think that the field projects were super interesting and were one of the more unique aspects of this course. I wish there was a third field component added in the first half of the semester. Even with the midterm, final, and 2 other projects I don't think this would be too much work for the average course.",
    "One of the strengths of this class was the lectures. They were very straightforward and interesting because of the diverse examples used. I enjoyed the second film screening (though not the first). I also liked the way midterms and the final exams were structured because I knew exactly what was expected of me and I could prepare accordingly. I also really enjoyed both field projects because they allowed me to engage with New Haven. However, some of the readings for the course were a bit tedious and often times restated material from lecture rather than maybe providing real life examples of what we learned.",
    "The professor, lectures, and TAs did a great job at making the course interesting and enjoyable",
    "The strength of this course is that the lectures are really well executed and profound. I really came to understand the way in which space was leveraged and exploited in the past that still affect our society to this day. Also, the field projects helped me understand the concepts taught in lectures by experiencing and seeing them take shape in my environment. Although the field projects took some time, it was a great opportunity to explore different parts of New Haven outside of the Yale bubble. I do wish that the readings were a little more engaging. While the readings were very informative, they were often quite dense as well, making them difficult to understand at times.",
    "I really, really loved this class. I almost have nothing negative to say, except that I might choose a different guest lecturer in later semesters. Although what he had to say was interesting, I didn't find that his talk really matched the size of the audience. His talk was also very difficult to follow. All in all, that, and maybe selection of the first movie that we saw, would be my only changes.",
    "it's definitely one-sided from a political perspective which it sort of has to be, but also might be interesting to present other perspectives. Also specific to neoliberalism, it was something we talked a lot about in the second half of the course, but i didn't really understand what the common fiscal ideology was before neoliberalism which would be interesting to talk about. it would also be interesting to talk more statistically about the effects of certain policies.",
    "Strengths: the material, Professor Barraclaugh, how relevant the course was to everyday life, how engaged it made you as a student Weaknesses: harsh grading",
    "This was an incredible course. It's difficult to cover so much ground in so little time, but I thought Professor B did an excellent job. It was engaging, relevant, and well delivered.",
    "This course was so strong. The lectures were engaging, the readings were wonderful, even section was great. I only wish that everyone at Yale were required to take this course. My only complaint was that the grading of midterms\/assignments wasn't super straightforward and seemed a little arbitrary.",
    "Materials feels somewhat intuitive, but is placed in a non-intuitive historical context. Very pertinent to contemporary sociopolitical issues!",
    "I liked that the class was divided in half. The first half was focused on historical processes that shaped the city and the second half was focused on considering cities, especially New Haven, as they exist today. I enjoyed the field projects in the second half.",
    "This course is strong in its organization and its clear narrative and explanations of inequality. It is a little weak in its consideration of all disadvantaged groups, like disabled people and children, but it's hard to include everything you want.",
    "The professor is AMAZING! I think I could have benefitted from a better TA that made s actually discuss the readings. We had to do a lot of work on our own.",
    "The lectures were engaging and all of the TF's I've heard about, including my own, were spoken of highly. The one weakness of the course seemed to be its organization\/timing towards the end - the final field project was assigned and due dangerously close to finals, and thereby caused (what I feel to be) unnecessarily timed stress. Had it been spread earlier in the course, or had both project been shifted up, this could have been avoided. The final take-home topic was also announced quite late, giving people who live far away little time to decide whether they were going to go home early or take the Dec 21st final exam.",
    "This course is absolutely amazing. I would say there is no weakness, all strengths.",
    "Overall the course was incredibly insightful. The organization of lectures allowed for us to discuss a wide variety of themes in relation to their place in history and contemporary times. However, the second half of the course readings and film screenings seemed focused on a very specific southern California area. In doing so the information seemed more narrow and less transferable to our studies of other cities. My main critique of this class is that we never discussed education as a medium for race, class, and gender inequalities throughout the history of American cities. I think this could be very interesting and should be discussed even if only briefly.",
    "I thought this course was great overall. The course did a good job of engaging students in a variety of ways. I enjoyed the field projects because they let us apply the readings to something that is actually going on around us, something that we don't get to do very often in classes. An improvement to this course, at least in the later material, would be talking more about other perspectives, such as the logic of those who supported neoliberalism (which she did a good job of). When we are better educated about both sides, we are better able to make arguments against those who have supported laws and policies contributing to inequality.",
    "I loved the way the course was taught and how the grading was very straightforward and low-stress. I also loved the objectivity regarding touchy subjects like white privilege. As a POC, I would have liked to hear more about white poverty because that's an issue of inequality that we didn't cover.",
    "For a lecture course as big as this one, I thought the basic lecture\/discussion section style worked very well.",
    "It would be interesting if this course focused more on the history of these issues in New Haven.",
    "The main strength of the course was probably the extremely engaging lectures by Professor Barrouclough. I often felt like I should applaud at the end of them.",
    "This course was amazing. Historical and present-day topics were conveyed with equal clarity and depth. Although I've already taken various urban studies courses, I feel as though this class has both offered me novel insights and immensely increased the number of questions I have about the American city that I can't wait to find the answers to. The assignments were particularly inspired, getting us out into the city that most of us tend to avoid, though I found myself wanting to do more than simply observe New Haven and its residents; taking things a step further and using our observations to create some sort of policy\/community organizing plan would be really interesting and satisfying.",
    "The instructor and my TA (Javed Jaghai) were its greatest strengths.",
    "The lecture is great. Prof Barraclough is an engaging lecturer and has set up a great syllabus. The one issue is that the TFs vary completely, so grading and timeliness of grading is completely variable.",
    "There weren't any weaknesses I can think of for this course. This course was thoroughly enjoyable despite the content of the subject matter being depressing, but that is expected of most American Studies courses. The pace was great and organized. In addition, the field projects added another layer of understanding to the course material.",
    "The course was very well taught. The lectures never felt too slow, or useless, and the visual aids were always welcome. I would have fewer sugrue readings simply because the book repeats itself often, and can be tedious, for little additional value past what it has already given before. I would also try to address the education in relationship to cities because it seems like a major part not talked about much in class.",
    "strengths: the topics discussed were generally interesting. weaknesses: it's a huge lecture. The Professor's method of lecturing something seemed overly simplified, like everything could be reduced to key points. It helps like a very key points kind of class and not a very in depth class at all. I wish we had considered more specific cases or been shown a more complicated, tangly, even less organized version of things.",
    "The professor is a great lecturer, she was able to get students to participate despite the class's big size. The readings were good as well.",
    "My TA was awesome and Laura Barraclough is an awesome lecturer. It got kind of wishy-washy by the end, meaning it was full of more of a one-sided political statements without acknowledging the complexity of problems in cities. It also seemed to get too segmented into specific topics without discussing as much how they were interrelated (which isn't so bad, the course kind of leads students to this conclusion)",
    "I know that there is a great deal of material that has to be covered in this course, but I would have liked to learn more about how Asian Americans are affected by the processes we studied.",
    "The lectures were very engaging. I also enjoyed the readings.",
    "Very stellar setup to this course. Lectures were engaging (entirely thanks to Prof. Barraclough) and informative; though slide-based, they were never dry, always applicable, and often engaged multiple forms of media to tell a nuanced story. There were many photos, maps, videos, and audio excerpts masterfully chosen to complement statistics and theory, providing many different perspectives to tackle the same issues. Section was a gift (again, entirely thanks to my TF Pedro) in which we engaged with each other not specifically on the readings but on whatever insights brought individually to the table.",
    "Subject matter is interesting, but presented in a very one-sided way. I am liberal, but I hoped to learn about other viewpoints as well. Reading tended to be very long and technical, as well as one-sided.",
    "Amazing course",
    "This course is phenomenally taught. Even in a massive lecture, the content alone was interesting enough to keep me in attendance every week. I think it forces all students to think more critically about spaces and structures they interact with every day. Prof. Barraclough is very knowledgeable and engaging. Section, however, had a tendency to be very dry. It was often just a dogmatic regurgitation of things found in the readings, which at a certain level I suppose section should be, but we never had many opportunities to really think and critically discuss the things we were reading and how they affect us.",
    "The strengths of this class are the teaching staff, including the prof and the TA, thanks guys!!",
    "I absolutely loved this course and can think of no weaknesses. The lectures were absolutely amazing. Professor Barraclough lectured so incredibly that I always felt engaged, even though there were 100+ people in the course and we moved quickly through the material. I loved that the readings always supplemented or provided examples and a bit of background to understand the lecture. The lecture and readings were always complimentary and rarely repetitive."

   "comments": [
    "Please take this class. It might be redundant if you've already done a lot in urban studies, but I learned SO much about how American cities have formed and my assumptions about their layout have been challenged. I'm so happy I took this course, both to further my understanding of inequality in America and also my own privileges.",
    "Most definitely. There isn't much work assigned, but it's impossible to walk away having learned nothing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Barraclough and the TAs were fantastic. Course material was relevant and sections were hotspots for productive discussion.",
    "Yes. Everyone should take this course. The topics it covers are so important, and Professor Barraclough teaches it in an amazingly comprehensive way.",
    "THIS CLASS IS AMAZING. This class is the best class I've taken at Yale!! I've learned so much about discrimination, both implicit and explicit, in the world around me that I feel like a different person. Prof. Barraclough makes her lectures interesting and exciting that you'll actually want to attend every one! The assignments are perfectly laid out- two 5 page papers (reflective projects), a midterm and a final (both with extensive study guides)- so there are no surprises and you don't feel like you're being tricked. She wants you to take in the information and become a better person. I'm a conservative and she even made me love the material! Very fair class. Perfect class in every way!",
    "I would definitely recommend! Although at first it might seem like these are familiar topics, Professor Barraclough sheds new light on them in a way that should not be passed up.",
    "I would definitely highly recommend this course, particularly if you're looking for a sort of introductory class that still covers a lot of really really fascinating material. Professor Barraclough ids great, and the class was thoroughly enjoyable.",
    "Absolutely! It provides an in-depth look at the ways in which cities can be breeding grounds for certain aspects of life and culture. Professor Barraclough is also a dope professor, so I would highly recommend it!",
    "It was a wonderful class with a stellar professor. Anyone who wants to understand an change inequalities in America.",
    "YES",
    "Yes. Good insight on how race, class, and gender are spatially constructed within the context of a city. Provides a really thorough explanation on gentrification, which I found to be particularly helpful.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. It honestly changed my life. Prof. Barraclough is so wonderful and knows so much, and she's always willing to meet with you and chat about the material or just about life. She's an engaging, funny lecturer, and the material we learned will honestly make everyone a better thinker, voter, and citizen. I'm of the opinion that everyone should have to take this course, it's literally relevant to everything!",
    "A great class!! The lectures are riveting, and Prof. Barraclough does a good job of making it interesting with recent pictures, videos, asking for student input, and having us do small discussions with our neighbors. The first half is a historic review of urban issues, and then the second is different urban issues in the present day (e.g. gentrification, transit, food\/water), while incorporating the historic trends. Section holds great discussions. This class is shaping the type of jobs I'm looking for after graduation -- a must take!!",
    "YES. Take this class. DO it. I made one of my friends come to the second lecture with me and he was hooked. You will be too. Professor Barraclough is amazing and intelligent and caring and wonderful, as was my TA. (For example, she told us for the midterm and final \"she wasn't trying to trick us, she just wanted us to be able to go home and tell our friends and family about what we learned,\" and she made an out-of-class alternative to the final so that students could go home earlier because it was scheduled for the last day). The class taught me SO much about how discriminatory policies shaped american cities into what they are today. It was fascinating to talk in discussion section and hear everyone relate their own hometowns to what we were learning in class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It will give you a totally new set of tools through which to view and talk about inequality in American cities. The workload is pretty light but designed effectively to make you think. Professor Barraclough is a great lecturer and while the material can sometimes be depressing\/frustrating she is sure to always inspire hope. 10\/10 would recommend!",
    "Excellent course about a subject that isn't really taught elsewhere at Yale. Super important to take, especially as a resident of New Haven",
    "Absolutely. I think it is an important class for everyone to take in order to understand how cities came to be the way that they are now. Like I said, I think the class made me a mindful person - and I think anyone could benefit from this.",
    "Everyone should take this class. I think this actually shouldn't even be a class but incorporated into lifestyle, like instead of reading the NYT or listening to NPR, just talk to Prof Barraclough. Honestly yes to this class!",
    "YES. Take this class. Take. This. Class. It's mind-blowingly amazing. It's eye-opening, engaging, informative, and just a real joy to wake up to twice a week.",
    "100% take the course no matter who you are. not too much work if you want to chill but well worth the time if you go to lecture and section",
    "I would suggest this class to students who, like me, are willing to listen to and engage in racial discourse, but actually know almost nothing about the field.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It's not a whole lot of work, the course material is fascinating and important to know, Professor Barraclough is an amazing lecturer and great person to talk to.",
    "I would recommend this course to my more moderate\/conservative friends who dont understand white privilege or the need to radical activism. I dont think the course is that valuable for people who are already well-versed in leftists social justice movements, because all of the information will come easily to them and they might even get bored. That said, leftists students will still learn a lot (especially vocab terms and public policies). The course is not time-consuming at all, especially because the readings arent really required. If you choose to do all the readings, then the class is more demanding.",
    "This is an amazing course. Professor Barraclough very obviously cares about her field and her students. It was a great course on the history of the American city that covers topics I had never heard about before. Readings and lecture complemented each other perfectly. The workload was completely manageable. I thoroughly enjoyed this class and it was actually the course I looked forward to going to the most this semester. You will not regret taking it at all.",
    "This class is a solid overview of the inequalities present in cities. I would highly recommend it to someone who hasn't taken an American Studies\/ERM class before. It is not too much work, and the material is very interesting!",
    "I would recommend this to any student at Yale. I think the content is so important and so foundational that regardless of someone's major this is a relevant and highly interesting course.",
    "ANYONE WHO LIVES OR HAS LIVED IN A CITY (THAT MEANS YOU BECAUSE I KNOW YOU LIVE IN NEW HAVEN) SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO TAKE THIS CLASS. The material is so so so important and interesting and relevant to all of our daily lives, regardless of your race, gender or socioeconomic status--YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "This is an outstanding lecture course on inequality in American cities. Professor Barraclough's lectures are engaging and eye-opening and her slides are easy to follow\/take notes on. It's an excellent introduction to the intersecting histories of discrimination in housing, transportation and labor in U.S. cities and how policymakers and activists are addressing inequality today. As a senior now, and also as a white male, I wish I'd taken this class or something like it my freshmen year--I truly believe that every citizen should inform themselves on this topic as it pushes you to confront your own implicit biases, analyze the world around you with a lens for social injustice, and critique Eurocentric narratives of US history.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, as it offers a lot of learning and does not require too much work. However, you get what you put into this course, so simply coasting by will not provide a meaningful experience.",
    "Absolute must take. Barraclough is a living legend. Fantastic lecturer and fantastic TAs. Take this course before you graduate.",
    "This is an interesting class that teaches the foundations of inequality in American cities. I found some topics much more interesting than others: the history of housing discrimination, for example, was the foundation of the racial wealth gap that still exists today; by contrast, a whole week on transportation in cities and another on food justice (ie where supermarkets are located) felt a bit tedious. I now feel more confident articulating my opinions on social justice issues, which is a useful skill.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students, regardless of major. Professor Barraclough is a fantastic lecturer, and my discussion section was enjoyable. The field project assignments were very useful in improving my understanding of the course materials and some of New Haven's history. This was an engaging and enjoyable course, I hope to take other courses with Professor Barraclough in the future.",
    "It is different from most classes you'll take. You will ride the bus around New Haven, you will see what it's like to face the issues you discuss in class. If you're a fan of hands-on learning, you will love the field projects; if you're not, you'll still learn from the themes of the course, which become more and more relevant every day. I strongly recommend taking this class if you are at all interested in learning about the problems that befall cities, and understanding why they occur. The workload is more than ok: I did not do most readings (was taking it as a fifth class) and still felt comfortable with the graded work, and, moreover, felt that I learned a lot.",
    "Highly recommended. A class that really should be required for all Yale students. If you can't fit this into your schedule, take ER&M 200, they have a variety of similar themes and were almost equally fulfilling, inspiring and necessary to my Yale education.",
    "DEFINITELY! Take this class if you can! I feel that this should be a requirement for all Yale students.",
    "Absolutely take this class regardless of your major. Not too much work, but the work you do complete is meaningful and thought-provoking (primarily fieldwork assignments in the greater New Haven community). Every class is really interesting and definitely worth your time. You learn so much that is actually really relevant to your life at Yale and beyond. Take it!",
    "Yes. Great course, and great introduction to how race, class, and gender affects groups of people's experiences in residential and commercial spaces.",
    "This course appealed to me because of my interest in urban studies. It was good overall, but it should be great. For one, I think it is too simplistic in its presentation of some of the issues it treats, like transportation inequality, neoliberalism, and gentrification. I would love to get into each of these issues in-depth, but the syllabus only allowed students to acquaint themselves with them just barely. By the same token, though, I found the class to be unexpectedly easywhich can be convenient, but also make it harder to remain excited and engaged. Professor Barraclough is an asset and offers wonderful insights; if anything, she is a reason to take the lecture.",
    "I'd recommend this class as a chill and interesting way to learn about inequality in American cities. It's a good intro class (for things like American Studies, sociology, etc.) in thinking about why cities and the inequalities in them are the way that they are - you learn about broad historical trends (industrialization, deindustrialization, etc.) in the first half of the class, and the inequalities that they shaped (environmental, race-based, etc.) in the second half. It's interesting and Prof. Barraclough is a solid lecturer, and clearly cares deeply about the class\/the material. At the same time, it was so relaxed\/so little was expected of us that I felt like I didn't learn much - there was minimal reading every week that you didn't need to do, one extremely easy midterm, two field projects with short response papers, and an easy final or take-home final paper. This was the first year the class was being taught so it might well evolve, and it was definitely an enjoyable class, but don't expect anything mind-blowing or incredibly engaging from it.",
    "Yes. This is an excellent lecture. You learn a lot of important, critical, current, and interesting information while doing minimal work and meeting awesome people. Absolutely take, regardless of major, background, etc.",
    "Yes!!! Please take this class. It's not extremely difficult, and you'll learn so much valuable information.",
    "YES",
    "This class was an outstanding introduction to the historical roots of urban equality and current policy and organizing efforts to combat it. Professor Barraclough's lectures were outstanding - efficient, well-paced, and deeply informative. The readings were varied and interesting. The two field projects were engaging and helped me examine New Haven more critically - particularly the gentrification project. The course was a great introduction to urban studies, and deeply relevant to real-world issues.",
    "Yes! Highly recommend! Very engaging. Super relevant! Take this course if you want to learn about race, class, and gender. Gives you a really broad overview and at the same time goes really in-depth. You will never be that ignorant person who doesn't understand the struggle ever again. Really light courseload. Exams are a breeze because Barraclough gives you a study guide",
    "This is a must take course especially if you don't think about race, class, and gender too much. It's worth it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course as it really breaks down terms that you may have thought you knew about but you actually do not know about the depths of these processes until you take this course. Anyone that wants to learn more about the processes that define the city they live in shouldn't hesitate to take this great course.",
    "Yes, this class was absolutely amazing!! Please take this course; it will totally change your outlook on the workings of American cities and helps you understand how various institutions have privileged and disprivileged certain groups.",
    "Yes. Professor Barraclough introduces really important concepts and theories about social justice using the composition of cities to ground her theories and those of other academics. If you live in a city, or if you don't live in a city, it's super important to understand the social and political processes that have created urban spaces. She's a super clear and engaging lecturer, doesn't try to trick you on tests, and is incredibly committed to teaching relevant material in a way students can engage with successfully.",
    "I think this is one course that should be required for every Yale student to take. Definitely eye opening and relevant today. One of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was such a great experience. Looking at race, class, and gender through the lens of \"American cities\" was a very interesting and different way to consider the subject. I felt like I learned so much and I actually enjoyed going to lecture. It was an eye-opening experience and helped me gain a deeper, more complete understanding of many of the social issues that are still discussed today.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It really opened my eyes to processes that occur in everyday life that I hadn't thought of before.",
    "If you are interested in the topic, would strongly recommend",
    "Yes! Not only do you learn a good amount of history, but you also become much more aware of the environment around you. I definitely began to consider how the cities that I lived in where shaped. Also, the processes and phenomenons that we learned in class, really helped me empathize with the struggles of people of different ethnicities and economic standings. You learn just how real inequality is in America and how certain racial groups or income groups deal with it.",
    "I have recommended this course already to so many students! I think that for anyone remotely interested in justice; in issues of race; in gender, environmental, incarceration, anti-homelessness issues, and so many others in that vein, then this class is invaluable. My reasoning for this, beyond all else, is that the class makes the student feel empowered by their learning. I would wish so much for every student interested in making a difference.",
    "yes, really important information that changes your perspective on important issues.",
    "Absolutely wonderful class. Very interesting and applicable\/relatable material, and prof. Barraclough is very engaging and sweet. Without a doubt recommend the class.",
    "I would 100% RECOMMEND race class gender to any and every student at yale. Prof B is an INCREDIBLE and inspiring professor. She makes the material come to life and I think about the class and what we learned every day, in many of my interactions and experiences and choices. This class is deeply relevant to every student, and I would take it if you can. Do not miss this opportunity!",
    "Yes! It's not a lot of work (two short field projects, midterm and final with review sheet), but you get so much out of it. I think that everyone at Yale (and really also in America) needs to take this class. It not only gives a really helpful background, but also gives you an understanding of race, class, and gender relations today.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It's incredibly interesting and relevant information, taught in a very clear, enthusiastic and accessible way. I learned so much about why current systems and structures the people often take for granted exist, and I've learned to question the things that people think are \"just the way things are.\" Professor B is an excellent teacher, incredibly sharp and knowledgeable, and very approachable. One of the best classes I've taken.",
    "Absolutely, 100 percent. As I said above, I wish that everyone at Yale had to take this course, because most of us are going out into the world in urban environments and don't understand the forces that have shaped them.",
    "Yes because the material is so important!",
    "AMST 196 was very enjoyable. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes",
    "This is an awesome class. Really good explanations of structural inequality, great sections, clear expectations, helpful professor. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Yes. Professor Barraclough is wonderful!",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I highly recommend this course.",
    "Highly recommend this course to everyone and anyone. It is incredible to learn about the fundamental processes driving that were started so long ago, but continue to drive this country today. Very engaging material and the field projects in New Haven also help one engage outside of the Yale bubble.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student. I think the knowledge gained in this course is essential to understanding the inequality issues that continue to grow today, as shown by the recent election especially. I think this course gives basic knowledge that all active members of society should know, and would recommend to any student regardless of their major.",
    "Not if you're a person of color. A lot of the material covered in this class, despite being cross-listed in multiple ethnic studies departments, was not new information for anyone who has experienced structural racism firsthand. Sections often placed students of color in the position of educators or rhetorical devices who served the purpose of \"exposing\" white students to gentrification, etc. for the first time.",
    "I think an introductory course about inequality like this one should be required. I think conversations would be a lot more productive and a lot easier to have if everyone had the knowledge provided by this class.",
    "This is a great class. I learned a ton about urban inequality and characteristics, some of which I use on a daily basis. I would definitely recommend taking this clas if you have even a remote interest in city characteristics.",
    "I would recommend this course; the content was extremely interesting and relevant to everyone's lives, and I think it is important that often-sheltered Yale students become exposed to the kinds of systemic inequalities that we discussed.",
    "Take it, take it, take it. This course was amazingone of the best I've taken at Yale. Historical and present-day topics were conveyed with equal clarity and depth, and I left the class with vastly more insights and intriguing questions than I could've imagined. Although I've already taken some urban studies courses, this class uniquely incorporated field projects in a way that both reinforced what I already knew about cities and shed new light on the pivotal role that space plays in cementing urban inequality. Favorite class of the semester.",
    "YES!",
    "Great class, I learned red a lot about American cities and how they became to be what they are today. Definitely has changed the way I see cities. I would definitely recommend.",
    "This class is just one of those classes that you should take to understand more about the world. The workload is very low, the reading isn't super necessary, but lecture is super informative and it's a good fifth class.",
    "Yes, I absolutely would. This class has challenged me to think about space and culture in completely different ways. The material was as engaging as it was informational, and the lectures were full of new insight. The assignments allowed us to work hands-on with the subjects we were learning, which was a more exciting way ti challenge ourselves and familiarize ourselves with the material.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes this is a great course. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "This course is a wonderful look into the social inequalities and processes that make our society look the way it does. I would recommend it for everyone, especially those from cities, or passionate about social change.",
    "Definitely - this was arguably the best course i've taken at Yale so far. It really challenges you to question the societal conditions that so many of us live in or observe daily. It provides you with the specific examples and vocabulary to talk about things that we can see in out cities and metro areas but often don't know how to explain. 10\/10 would recommend",
    "I would recommend this course to someone looking for an easy introductory course, or to someone who has not done previous coursework on these topics. If not, it's a little simple\/ basic\/ outline-y. But it was a solid course with a clear message and I learned a decent amount.",
    "Anyone who wants to get an idea of how American race, class, and gender discrimination was constructed should definitely take this course.",
    "Yes, great course that isn't too difficult",
    "Yes, it's easy and fairly interesting if a bit self-important and unfocused at times.",
    "Absolutely! Laura Barraclough actually cares about her students and their well-being. Not to mention that she is incredibly well-spoken and organized in her lectures (which are dense but entirely worth attending). The readings (30-60 pages per week) can get a bit dry sometimes, but the material was usually interesting enough to keep me engaged. Yes, there is a lot of material to cover, but Barraclough does such a wonderful job presenting it and it's so relevant to current society that I highly recommend taking the course.",
    "Yes. Whether someone is interested in urban planning, race, class, and\/or gender, this class has relevance to everyone. Besides that, it is a well taught class that is interesting and engaging.",
    "This course is a valuable look at the history of American cities and the processes that shaped the inequalities that exist in them today. I highly recommend this course to everyone interested in better understanding our society.",
    "Yes, this is one of the best courses and Prof Barraclough introduces many ideas, including how policy is heavily integrated with communities of color and how that affects our understanding of the urban spaces around us today",
    "Absolutely. If you are at all passionate about social justice, urban studies, and\/or the intersections of race, class, and gender, you will leave this course with valuable insights into why disparities have manifested in the ways they have and what we can do to start to change them. Barraclough is a stellar lecturer, and though section quality is definitely dependent on the TF, all of them this year were at least great--and some are truly stellar (Pedro!!!).",
    "I would recommend this to students who want to learn about discrimination over space in the US and don't care if it is presented in a political, one-sided way.",
    "AMAZING",
    "This is a fantastic class. Prof. Barraclough is incredibly knowledgeable, engaging, personable and funny. You will carry the things you learn in this class with you wherever you go, and you will start to look at urban, suburban, and all other kinds of spaces from the lens of the historical factors that have created the space. It provides really crucial insight to how deeply interwoven this country's history is with racism and misogyny, and in general is really eye-opening.",
    "Absolutely. This is a great way to examine your own residential past in the context of a larger story of the development of the history of where people occupy space",
    "If any student got the chance, I would 100% suggest that they take this course. In one of the earlier lectures, before the midterm, Professor Barraclough said something along the lines of, \"My goal for this course is to equip you so that you can go back over winter break and talk to your families\" and use our knowledge of historical and modern policy-making to convince people of systemic oppression and inequities. This class has the highest ratio of educational-value-to-effort that I could imagine. You could honestly learn so much just by showing up to lecture and nothing else because Professor Barraclough is such an amazing lecturer who will give you all the information you need to know in an engaging way. The readings and film screenings are so incredibly interesting too, especially if you're like me, grew up in a city, and can personally relate to the material. But they're just the whip cream on the shake. Take this course if you can! It'll clarify so much about why American cities and society in general are so divided."
