    "A really interesting class for Shakespeare lovers, music aficionados, both, or none of the above. The pace of the class is very relaxed, and homework consists of reading plays or articles, listening to music snippets, watching movies or operas, and occasional short writing assignments. A good class to help you ease into your first semester at Yale, since it is for the most part a very relaxed course.",
    "The best freshman seminar with the best teacher.",
    "This class is mostly operatic interpretations of Shakespeare, rather than contemporary music of Shakespeare. Be prepared to spend a lot of time with opera in this class (including a trip to the Met). It's best if you already like opera before signing up for this class. I didn't know anything about opera until this class, and once I found out I didn't like it, I was stuck. It's not a particularly hard class, but it'll definitely be better if you enjoy the topic.",
    "A course worth its weight in gold. This course was so much more than I had expected. We dug into Shakespeare's scripts and picked up the musical nuances of his texts. It was phenomenal. And Professor Malafronte is fantastic! She's very knowledgable about classical music and is engaging and funny in class.",
    "Excellent freshman seminar, I would say that the music element is emphasized much more than the Shakespeare bit and brushing up your knowledge of both couldnt hurt.",
    "This class is fun, engaging, and a fantastic opportunity to learn about Shakespeare and music from someone with a great depth of knowledge about both and how they connect to one another. The trips are great, and the material is fascinating, especially if you come in with an interest in either topic. I learned a great deal, especially while preparing my final project, and had a very good experience learning from Professor Malafronte and from my peers. It is not a heavy workload, and I definitely recommend the class!",
    "This class is absolutely wonderful!! If you get in take it! Each class is spent listening to the music of the plays of Shakespeare (as well as operas and other adaptions), and then discussing it. No knowledge of music is required--just a willingness to learn. This class will teach you to appreciate many different kinds of music, and will also provide a basic knowledge of different types of classical music. Plus, Professor Malafronte is amazing and there's a field trip to the Metropolitan Opera. This class has everything you could want from a freshman seminar!",
    "This course examines various musical embodiments of Shakespeare's works, which allows for technical and historical research while also accounting for emotional responses of viewers and listeners. The analysis component is prominent, and discussions are collaborative."
