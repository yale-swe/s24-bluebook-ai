   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: great introduction to some really powerful ways of analyzing healthcare decisions that I would never have known about otherwise; the technical skills taught are also really helpful Weaknesses: at times, the structure of the course could feel kind of tedious -- copying Excel code isn't always the most exciting way to learn something. However, I'm not entirely sure there is a better way to teach the material. Perhaps, Reza could have assigned us some homework before each class to practice the steps in Excel, that way we wouldn't have to spend all class working on it. That might leave more time to analyze the results, which is a part of the course that often got rushed at the end of class.",
    "A broad set of decision modeling skills was taught. Compared to HPM 570 it is more excel-oriented. The instructor took a lot of time on the probability theory and excel steps, but did not give big pictures for the modeling methods. So this course might be hard for students who are not able to fully understand course materials of HPM 570.",
    "Strengths: great format of the class--Keep the same for next year (i.e. students bring laptops to work in VBA alongside the professor). This is so helpful to retain the knowledge. At the end the professor began to record his screen--try to do this from the beginning and post helpful videos on classesv2. Weaknesses: consider creating more refined parameters for the group project. Do not allow students to attempt a model type that was not explicitly taught in the class. 2 hours is a long class to code the whole time. It may be helpful to have this course two times per week.",
    "Strengths: as data becomes more prevalent\/important in healthcare, knowing how to manipulate it and analyze it is a valuable skill to have Weaknesses: as this course is Excel-based, sometimes it was difficult to follow along in class because if you miss one step, you fall behind. This could be remedied by having a \"lab\" portion in 47 College. This would also remove the barrier of having a Mac vs PC (Excel runs slightly differently in these two operating systems).",
    "VBA was incredibly confusing. Would have liked a better explanation, introduction, or instruction on this class instead. Additionally, notes could have been uploaded based upon what was to be covered per class.",
    "I liked this. It was nice to gain tangible marketable job skills at YSPH. I learned how to code in excel. I would not consider myself an expert by any means but overall this course was a value add. I think having it once per week is less valuable. I would prefer it more often for less time. Suggestions for the course: Final project- due dates as we go along. More structured guidance. It was a serious challenge and if we had built a model more slowly over the course of the semester it would have been helpful Break up lecture and lab. Screen captures A excel bootcamp in the beginning",
    "The course systematically covered introductory topics in modeling health care interventions and decisions. Overall I thought it was well managed and well run, with mid-term adjustments to the course material and syllabus to accommodate the pace of the students and class.",
    "This course was, overall, not the best. A lot of it was plug and chug and by the end of the class, I think most students felt like they were completely underwater. I was so overwhelmed by the assignments and felt like it was very difficult to keep up during class because it moved so fast.",
    "Too much content for one semester. The material should be divided up into two semesters. The first half of this course should be cost effectiveness, and this course should be a follow up course that's more advanced. The first course should have a lab and go up to the first cost effectiveness lab. The second course should be to more complicated changes such as discrete time which was not explored as strongly.",
    "very good! I learn lots of practical stuff.",
    "Stengths: the structure is good (i.e., doing in-class exercises followed by relevant homework). Weaknesses: there is a steep learning curve, and if you don't spend a lot of time doing independent learning at the beginning, you will fall behind and be lost for the rest of the semester. Improvement: Spend more time at the beginning of the semester teaching VBA code and the concepts behind the models. Oftentimes, it was a struggle just to keep up with the excel commands that it was difficult to understand what the purpose of the particular component of the model. It might be beneficial to test people on VBA and the concepts of the model. It will force people to spend time with the material in the beginning of the semester. Sadly, if there are no tests, students are likely to spend their time doing something else.",
    "very useful contents, but too much emphasis on excel without enough instructions on the concepts. The first half of the semester moved in a really slow pace.",
    "Strengths: This course was great in that it taught a practical skill that is rarely offered at YSPH particularly for Health Policy and Management students. One of the biggest shortfall of the health policy and health management concentrations at YSPH is that they do not provide modeling skills that most employers ask about during interviews. In that, many students feel that they are ill-prepared to aim for job opportunities that they really wish to explore. This course fills that vital gap and equips students with concepts that can help them be more competitive in the job market. Weaknesses: The structure of the course needs more work. On the one hand, this course teaches students how to implement Excel models, so it has to be more of a \"sit and learn codes\" style. On the other hand, learning to copy and implement the codes that is already created for students is not a good use of course time as students can learn codes on their own via sources available online. Perhaps the professor can structure it so that he focuses more on the concepts and theoretical work behind models during class and the codes are a way to show the implementation of the models. I often felt that he glossed over some crucial theoretical foundations (i.e., what exponential model actually is, what statistical assumptions are we making) that explain why the models work the way they do and only emphasized the implementation portion of modeling. To ensure that students learn these statistical concepts, the professor can create homework problems that also focus on solving equations by hand, rather than running Excel codes from beginning to the end. Ideally, this course would be matched with Professor Ed Kaplan's Policy Modeling course to reinforce both the intuition of models and Excel executions.",
    "I think this is a very difficult course to teach as it is essentially how to use excel to address the complicated problems and\/or decisions. It is especially difficult when students have different understandings of how to approach problems and how to use excel. I think this first time through teaching it is a good learning experience for how it can improve next year.",
    "Very interesting. I think I realized the limitations of Excel during the class. I think I would have preferred using R, but I understand why we didn't. Discrete event simulation was very confusing. It might be because we never had a homework associated with it though, so I couldn't actually implement what we had learned.",
    "I thought this class was done really well for the first time it was taught. I think we deviated from the syllabus a lot and spent more time on some things than initially planned, but I really liked that the course was interactive and that it would be lecture but then actually learning the techniques in Excel. I definitely learned a lot about using Excel, though I'm not sure how much I will be able to utilize VBA outside the scope of the exercises that we did in class. I think a lot of us struggled also with the few lectures on discrete event simulation and comprehending those concepts\/what we were doing in VBA. Overall though I think this is a great class.",
    "I really enjoyed the class at first and could see the relevance to my future career. However, mid way through the course, I felt that it moved too fast for the amount of material that we covered so I started feeling really lost. Additionally, I didn't feel like I had a strong enough grasp to build the models on my own so I had to rely heavily on the in class examples and previous homework. I think it would have been nice to do a mid-course feedback to check in with how the students are doing.",
    "excellent",
    "Great course, even for the first year. Teaches valuable modeling skills.",
    "I am really happy that I took this course. I feel like I was introduced to topics in it that I would not have been otherwise. I also feel that I learned a lot about excel that I was previously unaware of. A few suggestions for room to improve: taking more pauses for questions between going through in-class exercises. I know that VBA works less well on macs, but if there was some way to make a windows version of excel available to students during class, I think it would be easier to follow along (maybe strong encourage access to PC Excel during first week of class). This might make things too complicated, but I do think that some of the techniques we did are better executed in R than in Excel...maybe introduce this in the class (I know not everyone has an R background, but it might be useful to see for those who do and even those who don't).",
    "Really good for someone interested in cost-effectiveness analysis. I was nervous about it because I didn't take Dr. Paltiel's course in the fall. It required a little bit of extra catch-up in the beginning but in the end I felt fine about going straight into this course.",
    "The course is informative, but feels largely like a \"how to excel\" style class instead of an advanced modeling class. A large portion of class time is spent learning new coding techniques in VBA or how to manipulate excel into completing a proposed model. For the most part, I think the course has a tendency to push students into missing the forest for the trees. Regardless, it's a great primer for using Excel and VBA in a more policy\/management realm."

    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Strengths: available and responsive to students, friendly and great professor Weaknesses: sometimes, felt like we were just reading off notes. Although, there may be no better way to teach modeling?",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Reza is kind and attentive. I think it would be helpful to have screen captures of all the lectures because its hard to learn how to code without being able to go back and listen to the logic of the code. I can type fast and pay attention so labs were easier for me, but sometimes I was just trying to follow along and my concept retention suffered as a result. It would be great to have something to go back to. The lecture portion was often too slow and the lab portion was often too fast. I appreciate his willingness to hear feedback, but it is really hard to gauge a room when all you see is the back of people's laptops. He was supportive and approachable which is great when the material is very new and somewhat challenging. I feel like there should be some kind of bootcamp or upfront coding session to get people more comfortable.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Reza was overall a very good instructor. He clearly put in lots of work ahead of class meetings to ensure the material would be communicated clearly and methodically. He also was receptive to student feedback and was clear with his expectations of the class.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Reza is very sweet and a super nice and helpful guy, but in the future, I think the course should be taught differently - it was much too fast-paced. We didn't have time to grasp the basics before we sped on to super difficult modeling concepts. I think he needed to spend more time on the basics.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Good Instructor. Very patient and kind and understanding.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Excellent",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Strengths: very knowledgable and organized! Knows modeling concepts well and can explain them in detail when students have an issue understanding. Amazing when you go to office hours. Weaknesses: Spends too much time doing the excel exercise and not enough explaining of what's happening with the model (i.e., the purpose behind it). Improvement: Spend more time lecturing about the concepts. Although students can read your slides (which are great), it's always better to hear a detailed explanation from a professor. If there's no time for that, you should test us so we are forced to learn the topics independently.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0very approachable and kind",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Strengths: Professional and knowledgeable. Weaknesses: better structuring of class time and materials.",

    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Reza was a great professor! I really enjoyed his classes. He is very understanding and patient about re-explaining concepts that people don't understand or going back to something that he did in excel and doing it again. His notes are also really good. He was extremely helpful during the final project and willing to make time to speak to us when we needed help.",

    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Sweet and knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Reza is a very intelligent and knowledgable professor. He knows what he's doing with model design conceptually and practically, but it is hard for him to adjust to feedback. For some, the course was progressing too slowly, for others, the course progressed too fast. He would probably mostly be helped by some form of an anonymous feedback system to indicate when to slow down\/speed up."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in the data analytics side of healthcare or to anyone who is looking to build their Excel skills. While recruiting, I found it extremely valuable to reference this course and think that many potential employers would find quantitative analytical skills useful in any applicant.",
    "Take it. Excel is cool. You will learn how to navigate in VBA. The course evaluations will likely help make the course better in the future.",
    "This is a great introductory course to decision and intervention modeling with a health care focus. Very useful but does include a moderate amount of work.",
    "If the course was taught in the exact same way I would tell my fellow students not to take it - more time not he basics! However, the final project was helpful in learning because it was very hands on and Will and Reza are both very, very nice. Thanks!",
    "If the workload can be balanced to make it less stressful, this course has a lot of potential",
    "definitely recommend",
    "Very good exposure to excel's more complicated features and to modeling. We covered a lot of material in a short amount of time. I would recommend this course; however, I would say that it's a lot of work compared to other elective classes because the coursework is so different to what is in the core classes. It takes a lot of time to understand the model frameworks and to learn VBA coding. Although a lot of work, it's definitely a useful skill and a great way to supplement one's understanding of statistics and probability.",
    "I would recommend the course with a caveat that it is slightly confusing and unstructured the way it is now.",
    "Great course! Definitely worth taking.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in modeling policy decisions!",
    "recommend",
    "A great course. Once the kinks get worked out it will be even more useful to students!",
    "Yes, would recommend! Useful course that allows you explore your own policy problem and gives you skills in policy modeling.",
    "This course is a large step up in conceptual difficulty and excel proficiency from previous modeling courses at Yale. These skills in Excel and VBA are used more in the HPM\/HCM side of public health, so bear that in mind if you're coming from a different concentration and taking this course. If you want to get into the nitty gritty of serious modeling, I highly recommend it, but start your final project EARLY."
