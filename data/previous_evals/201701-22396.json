    "The course is complete and well-structured. The professor is very kind in answering questions and keen in having students involved, carefully explaining algebra and intuition.",
    "I think the problem sets, while overall good, could be tailored some to facilitate learning. The bulk of the problem set questions are quite difficult, and extend what we say in class in some way. However, for those of us to the left of the distribution, I think our initial goal is simply mastering the contents in their most basic form. I therefore think it would be useful if, (perhaps even in addition) to the existing questions, some quick, easy-ish problems to really develop the core material would be useful. An example of a problem set that did this well was the one with log-linearizations, which while tedious, was extremely valuable in developing the skill needed.",
    "The amount of material were sometimes a bit overwhelming.",
    "The pace of lectures is quite fast, leaving little time for questions."
