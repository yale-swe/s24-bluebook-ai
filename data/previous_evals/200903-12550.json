    "This is a really great course that does everything it sets out to do.",
    "I would absolutely recommend.",
    "Great course with interesting topics and reading. Professor Brown-Dean is great and knows her stuff. Take it.",
    "Yes, take this course, if you're lucky enough to get in. Professor Brown-Dean was funny, insightful, knowledgeable, warm, and clearly a rising star in the field. The readings are manageable, if sometimes a bit too, shall we say, statistically exacting to engender interesting discussion. That being said, it was worthwhile to be exposed to a type of rigorous political science research that few other polisci seminars include in their syllabi.",
    "Suuuhhhwwwweeeeet",
    "This is the worst Political Science class I've ever taken, and it's entirely because of Professor Brown-Dean's laziness or incompetence.Each class consisted of her spending about 1\/3 of the period discussing readings that arguably should have been assigned as reading for the week followed by an extensive regurgitation of the week's assigned reading by a group of student presenters. The combination of this resulted in a situation that led students to essentially abandon any effort at doing reading as it would be a waste to spend time coming up with complex, critical thoughts about the reading when we knew that we would never have a chance to discuss them in class.On top of this, I got the distinct impression that Professor Brown-Dean behaved in a passive-aggressive manner towards certain students, and that she was more inclined to go out of her way to make and maintain contact with certain students than she was with others--essentially, it looked like she was playing favorites.Not only do I strongly advise AGAINST taking this class, I advise against taking any and all classes with Khalilah Brown-Dean. If you need to take a class on race, ethnicity, and American politics, I suggest looking around for a different class or perhaps attempting to synthesize elements of several different courses."
