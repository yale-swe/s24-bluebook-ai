   "comments": [
    "This class is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. You learn a ton through the readings (there's quite a lot of it, although most of it is very interesting so not that painful to go through). The topics covered are really important too (e.g. the 2008 Financial Crisis, the Eurozone Crisis, history of globalization, climate change economics), and this was probably one of the best econ class I've ever taken (I'm an econ major). Zedillo has lots of interesting insights to share about the topics covered in class. Nevertheless, don't expect this to be an engaging seminarmost of class time is taken up by student presentations and comments made by Professor Zedillo. There's a reading response due every week and a midterm and final paper. Overall workload is very manageable.",
    "Check in with the TA in the beginning of the course to see what he\/she is looking for in the reading responses and then repeat that standard throughout the semester. Same for paper - make sure the formatting, thesis, etc are what he\/she is looking for. Zedillo speaks about his experiences pretty often in class, which makes everything worth it. If you're a senior and looking to chill, maybe learn a bit, but mostly hang out\/say you've hung out with someone cool, take this class.",
    "I have probably learned more from this class than any other class I have ever taken. To learn from this class, though, you need to be willing to do the assigned readings, which can total hundreds of pages a week. If you are willing to do the readings and put a lot of effort into your reading responses, presentations, and final paper, you will probably find this class extremely rewarding. Otherwise, though, you might become frustrated with the workload very quickly. Also, weekly class sessions are far, far more enjoyable and informative when you've done the reading than when you haven't. Professor Zedillo is an excellent lecturer and discussion leader, but much of the class is occupied with student presentations. His personal anecdotes are fascinating and often funny. Most of the learning takes place outside the classroom, from doing the reading and working on your assignments. A huge perk of the class is that Professor Zedillo offers his students incredible access to events (2nd row seats to President Jimmy Carter's talk in Woolsey, access to a private carbon tax summit of leading economists, etc.). He also takes everyone to Mory's for dinner during reading period.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is fascinating and you come away from the seminar with practical knowledge and understanding about economic globalization - past, present, and future challenges.",
    "This class is Ernesto Zedillo (former president of Mexico) teaching undergrads about globalization. The content: you read a lot - maybe 500 pages a week or so - about the debates on economic globalization: trade, capital liberalization, migration, global warming, etc. You also write a reading response each week, have a rudimentary midterm exam, and write a final paper. So it's a lot of work, but since the syllabus is very well curated I found it really interesting and engaging. The reading responses also help make sure you actually do some reading. The structure: twice in the semester, you'll present on a reading. And every day, you'll hear three presentations. Unfortunately, these could sometimes drag on so much that there really wasn't any time for discussion. Zedillo often interrupts presentations to give his take on things, which is almost always really interesting. The prof: I thought Zedillo was great. He used to be president of Mexico...but he's also a Yale econ PhD who's an academic econ nerd at heart. So he, as a human, is the perfect bridge between theory and \"how stuff actually works in the 'real' world.\" He has incredible stories to tell, is really likeable, and incredible smart - so he'll push you if you let him. Overall, the structure of the course should probably be changed but if you put in the effort to do the work and seek out more discussion outside of class time, you can get a lot out of this class.",
    "Yeah, taking a class from Zedillo is pretty cool. Most of the class is people giving presentations on the readings, and Zedillo interjects when he has something to add. Would have been nice if he talked more during class, but its a great opportunity to hear him speak on a topic he knows so much about. You don't really know what your grade is going to be at all."
