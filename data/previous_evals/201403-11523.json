    "This class will teach you how to read and write using the Persian alphabet. You'll learn basic grammar (present and past tense, verb conjugation, etc.) and many useful vocabulary words, far beyond the small lists in the textbook. There's also a cultural component to the course, where we discussed Iran's religions, ethnic groups, history, geography, holidays, etc. I would recommend this course to any student who is willing to work hard and really wants to learn Persian.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone who wants to learn Farsi."
