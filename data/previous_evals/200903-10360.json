   "comments": [
    "a complete course in basic cellular biology. I would recommend it to anyone that hasn't had cell biology.",
    "I would recommend this course. I would summarize it as a specific overview of general topics in cellular biology.",
    "A good introductory course to cell biology that coversa good background to the subject",
    "Yes, I would recommend other students totake this course as I did learn many from it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another studentbecause biology student must have a knowledge of cell biology.",
    "I would recommend the course because it provided me with a plethora of new information about recent cell bio research, but I would also say that sometimes it is too detailed when not necessary because the mid-term and final do not reflect this level of detail.",
    "Some truly interesting topics presented in an uninteresting way.Recommend only to those without cell bio experience. Reading a decent textbook would substitute well.",
    "I would recommend this course because people with no previous cell bio classes should definitely take this.",
    "I would recommend this course because I think that it is critical for someone intending to do any kind of biology related research. I would warn them however that the material is somewhat disjointed and there seemes to be no cohesiveness. In addition, many of the lectures are not very engaging.",
    "MCDB 602 is a very basic cell biology class, and if you have ever learned about cell biology, i don't really recommend you choose this class.",
    "Decent presentation of general concepts in cell biology. Lecture format is problematic, as student are not engaged in the material. Would hesitatingly recommend.",
    "This courses covers a lot of topics in cell biology and exposes you to a number of different teaching styles\/approaches. In terms of workload there's only the midterm and a take home final, which went well. It's especially helpful to meet up with other students in a study group and discuss all the questions.",
    "twice weekly lecturers that cover the major areas of cell biology. I would recommend the course for people without a lot of background in cell bio",
    "Sure I would recommend it. It is a very basic course, especially for graduate students. But it is more important because lots of stuff is based on a solid foundation.",
    "I would recommend the class to all entering BBS students. Experts in their fields lecturing to a relatively small body of students about interesting and relevant topics in cell biology.",
    "Very dull. Huge lecture, with instructors not really connecting to the students at all. Take it if you're required.",
    "I will recommend to another student. I learn a lot. Some lecutres are very interesting and exciting.",
    "I would not recommend it if you have had any cell biology before, it is al repetitive.",
    "Yes, very good introduction to cell biology.",
    "It was a very informative class and the test questions made sure you thought about the material. It also wasn't a very high stress class because the exam was given out beforehand. Overall, I would recommend the course to other people. However, it might be a little difficult for someone with no background in cell biology.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student. While not all lectures were as helpful as others, the informative lectures tended to be incredible and outweighed the lulls in between.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other first-year students since it is a great introductory course for those interested in biomedical research.",
    "This class is very interesting - one can learn a lot by attending the lectures, and the class is not very difficult.",
    "Yes. It is a good way to get a basic knowledge about cell biology especially cellular trafficking.",
    "If you have not ever takena cell biology course, and even if you have, this is a must take course. I learned a tremendous amount throughout the semester and am very glad that I took this course.",
    "This was an advanced summary of cell biology. Since it is required for MCGD students, it doesn't matter if I would recommend it.",
    "You'll learn a lot from this class, even more so than in undergrad cell bio. You should definitely take this class!",
    "A great combination of review and update of cell biology. I would recommend this course because it was a good course for building a strong background."

   "comments": [
    "I guess this class filled in any questions that I may have had about cell biology.",
    "I learned much new information about cellular biology that I did not know before. very helpful",
    "I did learn both of the basic and new knowledge from the classes. The instructors are all experts from their own fields. It's very helpful to me to take this course.",
    "The course provided me with a general knowledge about cell biology that will not specifically help me with my research interests, but it will make me more knowledgeable as a scientist.",
    "I don't think I learned very much at all.",
    "It helped somewhat. I had a lot of undergraduate courses in cell biology that covered much of the same material.",
    "This course increase my knowledge of this discipline by going into further detail that previous undergraduate course. It also covered some new topics in a good level of depth that I had not covered before. I do not know however, how this course will help me in my dissertation since I have just started and it\u00b4s too early to make that assessment.",
    "A few of the lectures are inspiring and helpful.I don't know how much this class will contribute to my dissertation.",
    "Helpful background, but I had already learned 75% of the material in undergrad.",
    "This course refreshed my memory on different topics of cell biology and added to my knowledge on them. I'm not currently planning on joining the cell biology department - it's not really my passion - but I'm hoping the knowledge will still help me. i think it's always useful to learn how other people do science.",
    "the course deepened my understanding of cell bio but could have been better if it was more than just lectures",
    "I really feel I can associate more things when I am reading paper. All the cellular activities are somehow related.",
    "This course solidified an expanded my knowledge of cell biology.",
    "I feel as though this class gave me a very broad sweep of many different specific sub disciplines of cell biology. I'm not really confident it will be that useful to my career or thesis research.",
    "I got an overview of almost all areas in cell biology, as well as some details.",
    "very much, since I had never taken a cell biology course before.",
    "I've taken a few cell\/molecular biology classes but I think that a lot of the information was new to me. It also gave me an idea of the current state of cell biology and new techniques that are being used, or old experiments that I wasn't aware of. I don't know if it will necessarily be helpful for my research but I'm only in my first year so it might still come in handy.",
    "Sandy Wolin's treatment of small RNAs was enlightening.",
    "This course highly contributed to my research since I was able to merge the course material with my project. This was very helpful since I was able to fully understand my project.",
    "This course was a nice refresher of many topics in cell biology i was already familiar with. Also, it covered a few topics I had never covered before. I feel like my background in cell biology is much more thorough now.",
    "The course greatly enhanced my understanding about membrane and cellular trafficking.",
    "I feel like I learned more about cell biology in this course alone than I have in all the other lectures that I've ever had on the topic combined.",
    "Provided a lot more detail on cell biology than I had previously.",
    "I definitely learned a lot from this course - esp more about MT dynamics, membranes, cell trafficking, and stem cells.",
    "The course provided the knowledge that I need for grad school career. I learned new materials as I reviewed what I learned previsouly."
