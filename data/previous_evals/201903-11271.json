    "Multivariable calculus.",
    "I learned multivariable calculus and furthered my understanding on previous calculus concepts.",
    "- Rigorous computational thinking and execution - Strengthened previous calculus knowledge - Learned how to work through units at a quick speed, focusing mainly on computations as opposed to concepts - Learned how to visualize graphs and surfaces in 3D and work with them to solve problems - Learned theorems to simplify problems - Discovered new ways to apply math",
    "I gained a basic understanding of multivariable calculus.",
    "This course taught me to efficiently apply computational techniques and problem-solving skills to topics in multivariable calculus.",
    "I am now better able to visualize objects in space.",
    "The class taught me the importance of consistent studying. I had come to Yale believing I could make it through without studying everyday, but this class showed me that in order to truly understand the content, you must always be looking over the material.",
    "I gained a lot of insight into what I want to study in the future. The class helped me realize that I do not want to pursue mathematics any further. However, with that being said, it was a useful experience in learning to study for a subject that I wasn't necessarily good at.",
    "- Multivariable calculus (except limits) - how to form study groups - how to find professor for help in office hours - take better notes in class - find practice problems and other supplementary resources on the internet",
    "I learnt to calculate multivariable calculus and solve mathematical problems"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Some section teachers are bad, but that isn't too important since you learn everything from doing the PSETs. The worst part of this course are the exam graders. Multiple people grade your exam, and they all have an opinion. Graders will take off points for the dumbest things, and they'll refuse to give the points back when you point it out. Your prof can't do anything about it unless they were the one who graded that section of the test.",
    "This course is so rushed to the point that in lecture, it's hard to learn anything at all. I understand that they have to go through the material quick to get through everything, but it got to the point where it went so fast that it felt like nothing was really being taught at all. Much of this course felt like independent study, and I felt like I could have done equally as well even if I didn't attend lecture at all.",
    "Strengths: - Bolsters mathematical ability - Improves ability to work individually - Boosts ability to work at a fast pace Weaknesses: - Taught weakly--pace is fast, explanations are shallow, focus on computations over concepts - Lack of reasoning provided as to why we are doing what we are doing - Extra resources are useful, but none are good enough to provide the student with a complete understanding of the course; it seems rather difficult to be able to master the course given only the materials provided from the course",
    "The strengths are that you do learn but the pace is also really fast.",
    "The math 120 curriculum is very well-designed and there are a number of ways to get supplemental instruction and practice for difficult topics.",
    "The content covered in the course makes it necessary to maintain a fast pace which, I felt, made the class difficult to keep up with. Perhaps better organization of the subjects could allow for a better-paced environment.",
    "The course was well taught and planned out, but the similarities in formulas\/theorems got confusing towards the end. Better review materials and more opportunities for solving problems in class may have improved this.",
    "A strength of this course is that there are many review sessions and opportunities for one to succeed. A weakness is that sometimes he is hard to understand, and combined with how complex the concepts are, the course is much more difficult than it needs to be.",
    "It would be helpful if we were given a packet or problemset that followed according to each day's lecture. Some example problems were gone over too quickly, making it a bit hard to follow.",
    "Strengths: - pretty standardized, among the sections and with other intro multi-variable courses, so it was easy to find notes and practice problems beyond what a single instructor would give out - small classroom setting Weakness: - ability of instructors varies greatly between sections - grading curve\" rather difficult, little room for mistake, hard penalty for calculation mistakes",
    "There is too much variability in techniques and processes taught by the different professors.",
    "Lectures are generally clear, the content is straightforward; teaching varies significantly according to the section",
    "Strengths: Workload is appropriate, each subject gets about the right amount of time. I didn't have Sudesh but his review sessions were great. Weaknesses: I really wish psets counted for more (hanging 90% of the grade on three exams might be the usual for STEM courses but I don't see why it has to be. Or have quizzes every couple weeks, then at least I'd feel more in control of my grade). Also if instructors could generally present information in a more logical\/clear manner that would be nice."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "If it's required for a major you are thinking about, then just take this. Workload is pretty light despite how fast we go, it's just workbook exercises every week. The people who say \"only take it with Sudesh\" are simply lazy. Every section has the same resources, how well you do in this class just depends on how many practice problems you do. If you want to learn multivariable calculus for whatever reason, just use khan academy instead.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. I feel like this course really takes the fun out of learning math as I really enjoyed math courses prior to this one, and now I don't think I will be taking any more math courses in the future.",
    "If you feel like you have to take this course because you've finished Calc 2\/BC but don't have any other reason, then wait to take the course. My opinion of the course is that it is certainly useful in improving your mathematical abilities and making you a faster worker and learner. However, this comes with the consequence of the course moving very fast with little explanation as to why the things we learn are useful or important. you like math and want to continue, take the course, but expect to be challenged rather than encouraged to understand multivariable calculus. My advice overall was to hold off on the course and see if you actually need to take it because you shouldn't rush to take this course simply because it is the next course in sequence. The professors of the class are intelligent but do not facilitate learning from my experience. If you decide to take the course, keep up with the material, always watch supplemental videos, do extra problems, and seek help off the bat. Falling behind means you have a lot to catch up on and the material builds on itself so it's important to get a solid foundation. Shop a class with a professor you like as well.",
    "I don't think I would recommend this section. I explained why in Question 10.",
    "I think this course is fairly well adapted for both students with a high school single variable calculus background and those who have already taken multivariable before.",
    "I would recommend the course as it is a good gateway into the workload one should expect from Yale.",
    "I would not. Especially if you don't need it for your major. It is not organized for you to succeed, and it ends up being needlessly stressful.",
    "- take ENAS151 if you want an easier time with the marking - take MATH 120 if you really like your instructor",
    "Yes! Very organized",
    "This course is fine. I don't regret taking it because I kind of need to. I would say don't stress over it too much during the semester, but when the exams roll around, do literally every practice problem available. And you'll be good."
