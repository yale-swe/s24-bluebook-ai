    "Yes, it's a great course! It also forces you to get up in the morning, which is a good thing.",
    "I highly recommend the French 120 course, especially Dustin Hooten's section. As someone with no prior knowledge of french, the course taught me to engage in conversational french with relative ease.",
    "It is a french class with a test every Monday. Sure, that part isn't that great, but overall it is a great class, especially with the teacher.",
    "French 120 is a very intensive workload, so be prepared. That being said, it is an excellent french program and you will come out feeling very comfortable in your skills. Put in the work necessary, and you will be well-pleased. I definitely recommend this class. Dustin is an excellent teacher, and you will really learn and feel comfortable speaking French.",
