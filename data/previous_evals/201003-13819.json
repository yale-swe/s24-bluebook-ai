    "Yes, the library helps a lot.",
    "I only needed the Haas Library and other Yale libraries to conduct my research. The Haas library, for its size, works very well. I was always able to scan quickly and keep a digital record of all my readings. Linking the scanning computers to the arch-server would streamline the process of moving files, though.",
    "Everything was good.",
    "Yes - the library was available but as usual the one night check-out limit makes it very difficult to conduct university-class research - especially over the Fall break.",
    "Yes we can find most of the reference in our library.",
    "All the necessary resources were available to fulfill the requirements of the course.",
    "The nature of the study during the course required the student alone to fulfill the resource expectations. There wasn't much material required, and the readings that were given in the beginning of the semester were easily available.However, the eternal frustration regarding the use of the library downstairs (in relation to its difficult \"1-book-per-day\" policy) makes research and writing very difficult! I understand that students are supposed to use the library to do research and therefore material has to be available for everyone to use, but some of us are just not able to write in that environment and prefer to work in our workstations in the studio or at home; such preferences are impossible to fulfill under the current situation. Could something be done about this?",
    "Yes"
