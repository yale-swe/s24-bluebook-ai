   "comments": [
    "Do not take this course unless your KNOW you like the subject. Otherwise, it will not be a fun semester.",
    "A great introduction to the subject, and (as taught by DeRose) it proceeds at a slow and steady pace.",
    "Epistemology is a pretty great class. The issues are fascinating and DeRose is really solid lecturer--very personable and funny, but insightful and with a comprehensive grasp on all the major concepts and arguments. The readings cover all the major topics. Fascinating subject, very well taught. I recommend it. Be advised: 270 is rigorously analytical, and all of the readings are drawnfrom papers written by university philosophers in the fast few decades. Definitely a contemporary philosophy class.",
    "Good course.",
    "This is a very good introduction to Epistemology. The material is hard and it is slow going, but it is not unreasonable amounts of work. Professor DeRose gives good lectures. Even if the class is very small, it will not turn in to a seminar, which can be seen as a plus or a minus, although I felt it was a drawback. All in all, I recommend this class to another student who has taken more than one philosophy class previously and is interested in epistemology.",
    "Epistemology really grew on me over the semester. We were introduced to the major strands of modern epistemological work through a series of important journal articles. Aside from an interesting foray into Descartes\u0092 Meditations, this course was strictly modern. Weekly assignments require a close reading of the journal articles, but it\u0092s worth the effort: coming into each lecture, I was well-prepared to follow along with Professor DeRose\u0092s excellent lectures and to ask questions. I got a great initiation into what it\u0092s like to think like an epistemologist."
