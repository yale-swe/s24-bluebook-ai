   "comments": [
    "not a course.",
    "We only had to complete an online training and upload it online. We didn't have an instructor, nor any feedback on anything.",
    "Didn't see a purpose in this course.",
    "These trainings are important to our research as students and professionally.",
    "Strength: Professor is qualified and knowledgeable Weakness: I cannot understand the Professor because of his accent. The SAS is taught absolutely poorly.",
    "Overly simplistic and kind of a joke. If the university is serious about research ethics, it should devote more time to it than just assigning a 20 minute online course.",
    "ONline 1hr reading followed by test. not much to evaluate",
    "All that needed to be done for this course was to submit proof you had taken a training. I am not really sure how this qualifies as a course.",
    "This course is not relevant to the management concentration who does not do research or a thesis.",
    "I don't understand what taking that module was supposed to do. I read the first few pages then just skipped to the test and made educated guesses and passed.",
    "It's alright. Important information to know and have, but I don't know how much of it I retained.",
    "The purpose of this seminar is unclear. No evident structure, poor communication with the facilitator.",
    "helpful",
    "Not sure why we needed to register for a separate course to do this. It would make much more sense to include this as a required aspect of a course taken by everyone at YSPH (like Epi I or Biostats I). Not to mention, the fact that we did not know when the module was due until four days ahead of time. Thankfully I had already completed it for another class, but had I not it would have been an extreme inconvenience.",
    "this course could have been improved by making us take an actual ethics course\/\/have us read papers\/scenarios\/discuss ethical topics and issues in research. it is absurd that this is our only ethics course and that we could \"exempt\" by just submitting official ethical training.",
    "I am not sure how to rate this course... I think it would be great to provide it before the beginning of the spring semester (like during the Winter Break) so that we may have the information before beginning our own research planning.",
    "Is this a course? I feel like it was just a request to complete an online training and upload the certificate... These topics are of high importance. I think it would be interesting to require the online training and then do a structured lunch seminar with faculty members where faculty members discuss ethical issues in research with students from their department. This way students have the opportunity to discuss questions, issues, or the reality of ethics that might not be fully attainable when reading information online.",
    "I learnt only a little and feel like this course should have taken the format of a workshop instead with a possibility for interaction and questions about real-field life examples",
    "Good.",
    "More communication is needed about this requirement. Most people did not know when it was due and what was involved until very late in the game.",
    "boring but necessary",
    "This was a rather pointless seminar, and I do not think it is necessary.",
    "The module was quick and seemed more like busy work than anything else. I'm not sure what I should've gotten from it.",
    "I thought this was a good research ethics online class to take. I wish it was instead a one-day event in which students were in attendance instead of having to complete the training over the computer. I know some students didn't really pay attention to the material and instead was just skimming, trying to find the answers to complete the training. It would be better to have this be a one-day, 2-hour event in which there were relevant lectures.",
    "Using the online study tool to \"teach\" a course in ethics might not be appropriate - many topics are worth discussion and revision.",
    "It's a bit frustrating to have something like ethics reduced to one 20-minute session that nobody really cares about or seems to want to engage in. There must be a more interesting way to present this information than through a tedious online format.",
    "Very simple. Finished in under an hour.",
    "I had already done all the required training for this course as part of my on campus job so it required no additional work for me.",
    "It only involved completing online training. Not much to assess.",
    "Was this a course? I just had to submit my IRB certificate. Not sure the point of it."

    "I had already taken an online training module for a different class so I found the material to be a review. However, I do believe it's important that students have a good understanding of research ethics before they dive into their own research.",
    "Necessary, but not exactly useful.",
    "I think it is reasonable to expect all YSPH students to take this course.",
