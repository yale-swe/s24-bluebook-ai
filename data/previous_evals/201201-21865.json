   "comments": [
    "Don't waste your time. You'll regret taking this.",
    "It's interesting and easy. A very good class.",
    "PS113 is a crash course in the Political Science literature about Public Opinion, Congressional behavior, the American Presidency, and Beareuocracy. This class will NOT repeat what you learned in AP Government. You will gain great insights into what incentivizes certain types of political behavior.",
    "Everyone needs to take this course to have a basic understanding of the pitfalls of government.",
    "The lack of tests or a final makes this class seem very easy, but as you progress later into the semester you will find yourself reading 150 pages a night in order to prepare for the quizes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It gives an interesting perspective on American Politics and raises ideas that I had never thought of before. It is not too much work, and the professor is awesome.",
    "It's not as easy, or as interesting as it first seems.",
    "This is a really chill class, but the quizzes can get a little annoying. He says that they are easy, but many times they are not. I did every reading and would still miss a question sometimes.",
    "Very interesting class without an overbearing workload. Would recommend to anyone interested in learning more about voters perceptions of politics, voter ignorance, and in what ways our political system breaks down.",
    "A better look into our government and what shapes motives for each branch and the problems with it today",
    "Good intro poli sci class. Not a gut per se because you have to go to class for the quizzes, but if you skim the reading you should be fine. The topics were actually more interesting than I expected, and the class overall was fairly engaging.",
    "Hmm it was luke warm class so you choose. You learn something but not that much.",
    "Dont take it. The reading quizzes were annoying because you literally have no wiggle room when you don't have time to do the reading.",
    "In this class, you learn about various aspects of American politics, from how voters and politicians behave to why they behave the way they do. It's a really helpful intro to thinking about and studying political science.",
    "While 113 gives you a good new perspective on American politics, there are probably better introductory politics classes.",
    "It's a great class if you want basic knowledge on public opinion and the American political system. I would recommend this class because it's enjoyable and informative.",
    "Take it. Don't be dissuaded by the fratty composition of the class, this course is actually really interesting. It's not AP Gov, like most people think. It's a really interesting take on American politics\/democracy that mostly works in the theoretical world, with some case studies to back it up. Awesome class. Do the readings - the reading quizzes count for a lot and can really come back to bite you in the @$$ if you're not careful.",
    "Go to the lectures during shopping period and only take it if you are truly attracted to the teaching style and course material.",
    "The class was interesting, and gives one an interesting take on the American Political system. The class was structured more like a big seminar than a lecture. Professor DeCanio would spend a little bit of time drawing attention to certain parts of the reading, and then the class would participate in a conversation about the reading, which I liked.",
    "A good class, but make sure to talk to DeCanio outside of class (or at least to your TA) so that you realize life is not as depressing as DeCanio makes it seem.",
    "I would recommend the class if you are open-minded about the positives and negatives about the American political system. Professor DeCanio is very interesting and a good lecturer, but sometimes the class got bogged down by students making irrelevant points.",
    "Big gut. 1 Paper and in class quizzes. No midterm, no final. Little reading.But there was so little work that I found myself doing absolutely nothing at times. A course with this easy a workload makes it very difficult to be motivated. If you trust yourself to be on top of the work and stay engaged, then take it because you'll probably get an A. But the only real graded assignment is the final paper. So you need to make sure you ace the quizzes.Careful. And make sure you know your work habits before you decide to take the course. it's far too easy to do nothing.",
    "Yes. interesting section",
    "Your grade is divided between reading quizzes (which are for the most part very easy), a final paper (you can write about anything basically), and section participation. Very manageable workload. Nice not having to worry about exams. As long as you keep up with the reading, you should be fine.",
    "No, there are better courses to take at Yale. If you've taken AP Gov, you literally know everything.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. Besides the pessimism, it is difficult to commit to this course.",
    "i would recommend it if you are at all interested in politics and want a fairly easy class to round out your schedule",
    "This is a good class to take if you want to get a new perspective on democracy and the inner workings of government.",
    "A basic political science course, though I don't really feel as though I learned much in the actual class. Section was interesting though."
