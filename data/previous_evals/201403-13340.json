   "comments": [
    "Pretty straightforward in terms of logistical requirements of the course. Much more engaging and interactive than Cold War (no offense, Gaddis). Tooze is simply amazing and this is a MUST take for any major before you head into the real world.",
    "It's crucial to our understanding of the world today.",
    "very informative. most people just don't know what they're talking about, and you'll see that after taking this course. Get ready to get slammed by readings though if you do.",
    "AMAZING.",
    "Absolutely. HIST 277 is an exciting course taught by a fantastic lecturer. I came into the course with a pretty strong background in economics and a weaker background in history, but I did not feel that my lack of history experience made me worse-off in this course. The course explores why and how the US financial crisis occurred, what efforts were taken to combat it, the origins and effects of the crisis in Europe and elsewhere abroad, and the social and political fallout from the crisis. The lectures are really great. Tooze is funny and makes the lectures engaging. Workload is manageable--1 midterm, 1 paper, 1 final, weekly readings (ranging from ~30 pages\/week to ~200 pages\/week). Grading is fair, certainly not overly lenient.",
    "A conflicting class. It starts out really positively -Professor Tooze is really smart, and it's so important to learn about what happened in the 2008 financial crisis. That said, the crisis takes up about seven weeks, and after that it's all downhill. The class from the midterm on is basically Tooze proving how smart he is and listing unrelated current events and linking them tenuously to economics. Nearly no cohesion from week 7 on. I'd recommend sitting in for the first half, but the work isn't worth your time.",
    "Really great class, super interesting topic, but more complex and challenging than most history courses I've taken.",
    "A surprisingly in-depth course for something so recent. A lot of Econ majors in the course (myself included), especially since the department agreed to grant major credit for it. The course isn't that much work: there's a 2000-word op-ed, a midterm, a final, and section. Readings aren't too bad either. Tooze's lectures get long, especially with slides that are full of text, though that does make studying for exams easier. Also, the fact that it's a Hu credit is huge for Econ majors.",
    "Very good summary and analysis of the Great Recession's causes and effects.",
    "Yes. The recession is such a huge part of the economy and politics today that every Yale student would benefit from this class.",
    "You will learn a lot, Tooze is an expert lecturer. Tooze will vehemently deny this, but some macro knowledge is a prereq. Overall, one of the few lecture classes here really worth your time.",
    "TAKE IT! One of, if not the, best class I've taken at Yale so far. Tooze is amazing, the material is very interesting, important to know and relevant and you will leave with a comprehensive understanding of the 07-08 financial crisis and also the sovereign debt crisis in 2010-2012 in the EU.",
    "Something every econ major should know. This should be cross listed with Economics.",
    "Phenomenal. If you don't understand the financial crisis or why it was such a big deal, take this course. I heard a rumor that Tooze won't be teaching it next year, so I can't say how good the new instructor will be (if it's even offered). But seriously, this is a great class, even though the econ is daunting at first (speaking as a science major who has never taken a single economics course).",
    "An absolute must take. Single best class I have taken. Totally changed the way I see the world. Also, if you are considering a career in finance or policy, this is some of the best background you can get at Yale.",
    "Overwhelming",
    "Absolutely! The best class I have taken outside of my major at Yale. I started this class Cr\/D and converted to a letter grade after the midterm and dont regret it one bit. Tooze is the best! His lectures will blow you apart, his slides are informative, concise yet hilariously entertaining. I am yet to take a class that has been better organized or whose lectures have blown me in this manner.",
    "Yes, take it.",
    "This is a great lecture course on a fascinating topic. If you're an econ major with an interest in macro, or even in history\/poly sci, you will find this class really easy. The class is geared for history majors, so anyone with an econ background will have a huge leg up. The class is also a good lecture to Credit\/D, but the workload is light and the grading easy enough that you may want to consider taking this for a grade.",
    "Fantastic course that anyone interested in current economic or political conditions in the US, Europe, and Asia should definitely take. Worthwhile especially for anyone interested in working in the finance sector (as any Yalie is likely to do post-graduation). Tooze delivers wonderful lectures that both broadened and deepened my understanding of what caused, happened during and after the economic crisis. Assignments weren't difficult if you did the readings and paid attention in lecture. Not necessary to have an econ background but a well informed reading of the news or a willingness to learn are definitely need to get a handle on some of the technical stuff that Tooze goes through. Section is a bit of a pain since most students are lazy and unwilling to participate but the TFs and Tooze do a great job of making the class for the people that are really willing to engage with the material. Definitely take it.",
    "It's great if you're willing to put a lot of effort in it. If not, don't bother.",
    "If you are interested at all in recent developments in transatlantic political economy, take this course.",
    "This class is amazing. It will push back against all the conventional narratives you hear about the crisis and its aftermath, and will make you think differently about the economic structure that governs the world today. Also, Tooze is one of the most dynamic and intelligent lecturers I've experienced at Yale - he alone makes the class worth it. Be warned though: there is a fair bit of economics in this class, and some people who weren't as familiar with economic concepts struggled at first. Provided you have either an interest in econ or a small background in it, taking this class is a no brainer.",
    "It puts the Great Recession in a historical context, so that by the end of the course you really understand why and how everything went down. I would recommend the course.",
    "The Great Recession as History is maybe the best class I've taken at Yale. I learned a truly incredible amount about the event(s) that will most shape the coming decades. Thanks to Professor Tooze, class was always interesting and sometimes even funny. No econ background necessary, but pay close attention and do the readings if you don't have a good grasp of the macroeconomic factors at play already.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is an excellent thorough study of the financial crisis and how it actually unfolded (housing market crash, bail outs, too big to fail, macroprudential reform, fiscal stimulus, debt the Fed's role, quantitative easing, effects on emerging markets, the debt crises in Europe and subsequent lack of recovery etc.) but it was great how Tooze put the events in their economic historical context (financialization of the economy since the 1980s, neo-liberalism vs. Keynesianism, roots of the crisis in the Great Depression, the history of monetarism and monetary policy). I would say having some knowledge of finance or basic economics (especially macro) would be good to have even though it isn't technically required. Only criticism is that in the last 3 weeks, the course begins to wander adrift from the original subject and just discuss all sorts of contemporary economic problems in the world, which was somewhat unstructured. Manageable workload and assignments, and a great reading list.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken so far at Yale. Professor Tooze is one of the best lecturers I've ever had and he explains the events of the Great Recession as well as the underlying economic theory and ideology in a really engaging and thorough manner. Also, the class covers a genuinely interesting topic. However, the class is quite economics heavy; I felt as though I would have had trouble following some of the concepts were it not for my Econ background.",
    "It is an incredible course that will teach you so much about the world. If you are not an econ person it may seem really overwhelming at the beginning, but you should definitely stick with it.",
    "Fantastic class on not just the financial crisis and its political\/policy\/legal outcomes, but the historical threads that led up to it in the US, Europe, China, Eastern Europe, etc. The workload isn't bad at all, save a couple of weeks. Midterm and final were fair. There's also a 4-5 page op-ed. I thought Tooze did a good job of striking a balance between accommodating econ people and history\/humanities people. Also has a British accent, so that improves lecture all on its own, right?",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It offers economic students, political science students, and history students the same chance of analyzing the crisis both in ways they already know and ways that they do not.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE IT. I don't know if Tooze will be teaching it again because I think he's leaving, but Tooze is a legend. The first part of the class is about the financial crisis itself and then it transitions into the general problems with the neo-liberal project around the world. Should be re-named \"the crisis of neoliberalism.\" If you want to understand the major macro-economic trends of the last few decades and how they've culminated in what we have now, take this class. Hands down one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Sometimes lectures were fast and a bit confusing, and the topic material is tough for those without macro-economic experience, although very doable, and don't let that scare you away. The midterm was super easy, and the final was fairly easy too - all the lectures are up on line and everything is pulled off of those.",
    "This class is super interesting, and I was able to do reasonably well as a non-econ, non-history major, so it is possible. That being said, there is a TON of material and a lot of reading that is worth doing, so be prepared to put a lot of effort in, especially if you don't typically read the news. The midterm and final cover a TON of material, but aren't necessarily super challenging... but if you don't pay attention in class, you'll be lost.",
    "Yes. This is extremely important material as it is relevant to our daily lives and our futures.",
    "If you haven't taken any Econ class before, I would not recommend taking HIST 277. I didn't take macro before this class, and found many of the concepts hard to understand. Other than that, it's a very informative and thought-provoking class on the financial crisis.",
    "Take it, without hesitation. The lectures are an absolute to joy to listen to, and they are not just engaging, you also learn a lot about financial crises in each one. The content is fascinating and so clearly relevant. If, like me, you haven't taken economics before, you'll be totally fine, and you'll be glad that you chose this class to teach you the basic language and ideas of Macro Econ. The workload is reasonable, the readings are fun, and it's one of the best lecture classes I took here.",
    "This is a course which every yale student should take. Not only is it well taught but also extremely practical. It gives you a true understanding of the economic and geopolitical situation. People always throw around terms like subprime mortgages, credit default swaps, and sovereign debt but this course gives you a true understanding which most people just fake.",
    "A really interesting class and definitely one of the best ones I have taken at Yale. The material is extremely relevant and Professor Tooze analyzes it from a global perspective, making it even better. The class itself had great lectures and the workload was an ideal amount - midterm, paper, final. I really enjoyed how in-depth the material was and the fact that everyone could understand the material without necessarily being an economics major. Definitely a must take class. Professor Tooze is great and extremely knowledgeable. He seamlessly integrated what he knows with the class lectures and better yet, is very funny. His perspectives on the financial crisis were consistent and refreshing.",
    "This was a fantastic 5th class (and Cr\/D\/F) for me. I learned a lot about an incredibly important subject -- how the crisis came into being, what it means, its historical background, some of the economic aspects, etc. -- and enjoyed the lectures immensely, even though I didn't agree with everything that Tooze said (considering his far left political leanings). He's incredibly articulate, funny, and knowledgeable. Sections were fine, but didn't add a ton to the class from my experience. The midterm op-ed was fun to write.",
    "Take it. Great survey course. Comprehensive lecture notes provided. If you are interested in the history of the financial crisis, this is a must-take class.",
    "A really interesting and extremely well-taught course which gives a broad overview of current affairs in politics and economics. The crisis and its implications are so vast that this is a necessary, daunting, yet rewarding endeavour. I have only good things to say about this course which is one of the best I have taken at Yale (though should the instructor change I would be hesitant to recommend it so fervently).",
    "I think everyone should take this class. It gives an interesting insight into one of the major issues of today and is not terribly difficult.",
    "TAKE the class! This is the most relevant class you could take at Yale and Professor Tooze is amazing.",
    "One of the two best courses I've taken at Yale in 7 semesters. Amazing synthesis of economics, history, and politics. Tooze is brilliant in his lecturing and his thinking. Unbelievable course and I would take it again, and again, if I could. As an American Studies major with no econ background, the course is a bit challenging at first, but you learn the necessary econ concepts quickly and it's fine.",
    "Absolutely take it. Tooze is one of the smartest people at Yale, his lectures are fascinating, and the topic is important.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, although with a warning. It is incredibly useful in giving you a detailed knowledge of the recession as well as global financial systems, and I found the subject matter fascinating. That being said, it is listed under History and advertised as needing no prior knowledge of economics, but if you've never taken econ, there's a lot you'll need to look up on your own to understand some of the readings and lectures. Many of the readings are memos, speeches, and academic papers by economists, so those require some decoding if you aren't familiar with the terms and concepts used. Tooze's slides are very detailed but he doesn't necessarily go over everything in lecture, so be prepared to go back on your own. Overall, though, this is an excellent and supremely interesting class that will bring you up to speed on the recession and leave you with a very solid foundation from which to read the news and look toward the future.",
    "Greatest class I've taken at Yale so far. Incredibly relevant material and amazing lectures by Tooze. Take this if you're at all curious what happened in '08-'09 and how that affects us today. Tooze lectured for the entire 75 minutes each class, and I was on the edge of my seat for most of that time. The reading list was also very good, with a good blend of straight nonfiction finance books and Michael Lewis-type books with a journalistic spin. We also read a number of current articles about QE and other pertinent topics. Tooze also addresses the social implications of the recession, something that very few people have done. Instead of just focusing on the financial impact, Tooze looks at how the recession affected average Americans and how their plight was generally ignored, an instead attention was focused on bailing out the banks. If you are an Econ or History major, or if you are just curious why America's economy isn't really rebounding to full strength , I 100% recommend taking this class.",
    "THIS CLASS IS AWESOME YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT. Tooze is a brilliant professor and makes everything super interesting and so you learn a lot. The subject material is fascinating and you find out what actually went down in the great recession and how it has been interpreted by various people. This class is the best class I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "Phenomenal course.",
    "Great class, take it",
    "Take this course!! Especially if you are an economics major. It is a fabulous \"history\" course that gives you the foundation to make educated judgements about current events.",
    "This class was a fascinating exploration of one of the most defining events (or, more accurately, series of events) of the 21st century. Tooze brilliantly presents a narrative that highlights the excitement of the world's economic disarray, creating an analysis of contemporary events through a historical lens. The class was a bit econ-heavy for a history course, which, as a humanities major, was a bit intimidating. But by the end of the course you end up with a working knowledge of the increasingly complex and interconnected global economy (and all its flaws). The workload is manageable: midterm, creative paper that asks you to write an op-ed piece on any facet of the crisis that interests you, and a final that's just a longer version of the midterm. The readings are compelling, but you can get by skimming and skipping when necessary. The saved slides on classesv2 become your textbook, often containing large blocks of text that Tooze never got to read and intended to be reviewed at home. Any informed global citizen of our generation should know what happened and why, as well the international geopolitical implications. Therefore, take this class.",
    "Take it because we all need to know this history.",
    "This is a great lecture course. Professor Tooze is entertaining and engaging. If you don't have much knowledge of finance going in, you'll definitely have to work a little harder over the course of the semester, but it'll still be manageable. Take the class if you want to be able to formulate educated thoughts about the crisis or if you even want to have a better understanding of what's going in the news. Not too much work at all, but the second half of the semester is trickier than the first, so make sure to keep up with it so as not to be overwhelmed by the final. (Though that said, the exams are really fair, and you have a lot of say in which IDs\/essays you get to answer)",
    "Easily the best lecture course I've taken at Yale. After four years here, this is the only course that I can say has lived up to its claim of being \"interdisciplinary\". Prof. Tooze is also absolutely brilliant.",
    "take this class if tooze is still there",
    "Absolutely without thinking YES. Best class ever. You will not regret it. No econ background required but you;ll come out of the class with incredible perspective on the world",
    "Hist 277 is an incredible opportunity to learn about a recent event that has shaken the world in more ways than you probably understand (though you will have a greater appreciation after you take this course). Be prepared to learn about aspects of the crisis you haven't yet confronted, even if you are an avid reader of the WSJ. I would absolutely recommend the class, both for the content of the course and for the presentation. Professor Tooze is truly one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale."
