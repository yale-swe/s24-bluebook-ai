   "comments": [
    "Take this for a science credit, not to learn that much about how chemistry works in food.",
    "Yes, it was a lot of fun and not a ton of work",
    "Really elementary chemistry course that is dumbed down to a level that doesn't even make sense. You end up being expected to google the answers for your homework-- you could learn the whole course online in a 20 minute youtube video",
    "Chem Cooking was a great science credit! Don't be intimidated by the chemistry since Dr. G and Professor Yan do a great job making the concepts easy to understand an apply. There are cooking demonstrations every other week that allow you to apply what you have learned to real cooking! It was pretty good with workload as well with a problem set every other week and three tests in total. It really changed the way I look at food and food preperation!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student even slightly interested in the scientific principles governing cooking and food.",
    "Not really. It sounds cool and you want to take it because it's about food and cooking, but it's more chemistry than either one of those things, and you don't learn that much. That being said, it's not too much work and not too hard (just a problem set every other week, one project, and three tests). It is super far and very early in the morning, so don't take it unless you know you will wake up for every class and make it up science hill. Don't just take it because it sounds cool!!",
    "Great class for non-science people. Really manageable workload and a fun subject!",
    "This is a really good course, especially if you are looking to fulfill a Sc requirement. I learned a lot about the chemistry behind cooking, such as the science behind the sous vide method. You start out each module learning just the chemistry and then go on to apply this knowledge to cooking and food. There are 3 midterms and a group projects (which is a cooking demonstration!). TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "I would recommend Chem 104 to another student looking for a manageable science credit. However, if you are not interested in participating in small groups, I would not recommend this class since the cooking demonstrations are done and presented in small groups.",
    "Not as easy as it may seem initially. Boring and not very engaging lectures. If you are taking it for a science credit there are probably better options out there unless you really like chemistry and cooking food.",
    "In its current state, almost never. It isn't worth getting up at 8am to go up science Hill for an unhelpful lecture. I would tell some people that need a science credit to consider it because the work is really easy even though class can be a pain. It's worth it for that young Sc.",
    "Yes. It was an interesting science course to take--not too challenging if you understood the psets. Only downside was that it was 9am at the top of science hill.",
    "Good class, not too hard, very fun. Was a little uneven, because it's the first semester it was taught. Just stay on top of things and you'll do fine.",
    "I think the class was a fairly easy science credit, but I would probably not recommend the class because the structure of the class was not very good and was often hard to follow."
