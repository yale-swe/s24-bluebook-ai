   "comments": [
    "Yes, would absolutely recommend. This class can teach a student about Haiti and its very unique circumstances and how they influence its problems or facilitate its solutions, but on another level, they can teach you about yourself. Listening to other students- not even trying to jump in to the discussion for the sake of doing so- and hearing ideas being formed, debated, compared, and contrasted really helped define my own ideas based on my own morals.",
    "Make sure that you really want to spend a semester studying Haiti. If so, then it is a good choice.",
    "It's definitely worth it. You're learning about a country that is normally neglected and you get to talk about it in depth, not just the environmental aspects of Haitian society. TAKE IT!!!!!",
    "This class focuses a far broader array of disciplines than purely environmental science. It is a comprehensive review of historic, artistic, cultural, economic, environmental and health issues in the context of international relationship and politics, under the theme of sustainable development. Be prepared to open up your mind and speak out in class.",
    "This is a fairly easy class where you get to have some interesting discussions and do research on a topic of your choice. It is what you make of it, but if you really want to learn a lot in a seminar and have complex discussions this isn't the class for you.",
    "I would not recommend this class to other students because although parts were very interesting and it was fairly laid back, I do not feel like I learned very much or gained any new skills.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it. I didn't think that it helped me grow as a student.",
    "I would recommend this class for someone looking for a very intersectional exploration of a country, rather than someone looking for an environmental studies class specifically. The workload is heavy if you choose to do all of the reading, but speaking with several of my classmates led me to realize that if you skim, it is much more manageable. The class is seminar-style, of course, which provides a unique and valuable experience, particularly as a freshman. Overall, not exactly an inspiring course, but worthwhile for someone interesting in Haiti or Latin America, or in exploring a single country in depth.",
    "I would definitely suggest the class to another student because of the sheer wealth of knowledge you'll acquire about a country that isn't studied enough. While the primary goal of the course is to focus on sustainable development, Prof. Geballe recognizes that a lot of factors are at play when trying to implement plans in a country (history, culture, economics, etc.) and therefore includes the study of those factors in the class.",
    "Haiti is a country that many people only view as the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. This class is crucial to show that there is creativity, solvable problems, and humanity in a region that is often dehumanized. Very interesting class, highly recommended, and you get to dig into an area of study that you're most interested in the ought the research papers.",
    "I would summarize EVST 020 as a comprehensive overview of the history and current issues of Haiti. I would recommend this course to another student for the communication skills gained through the seminar format and for the interesting subject matter. I am shocked by how much I learned about Haiti, developing nations, and the world as a whole. I was routinely challenged to think critically by my peers and the readings.",
    "You learn a lot very quickly about Haiti and it is a good introductory course to the country. However I don't know if I would recommend it just because I probably could have taken something more interesting.",
    "Each homework, we have reading between each class. In class, we then discuss the reading. Each class discussion is lead by one student. The main project of this class is a 15 page research paper about Haiti at the end of the semester. In class, we learn a lot of interesting facts about Haiti and explore challenges facing development. While the class is interesting, I am not sure that I would recommend it to another student given the abundance of other interesting courses offered at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it as a complete study of Haiti that would likely qualify as an ethnic studies course if the course title was changed to reflect the culture and history that is discussed at length in the course.",
    "Yes, especially anyone interested in Environmental Studies, or simply the country of Haiti.",
    "You will gain the most from engaging with your peers inside and outside the classroom."
