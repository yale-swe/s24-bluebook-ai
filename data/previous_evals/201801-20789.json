   "comments": [
    "Quantitative evaluation of the macroeconomy. Very useful to get a overall understanding how the economy works.",
    "Professor Peters did an amazing job in connecting the lecture points to real-world examples.",
    "How to look at the world in a more structural framework, probably one of the clearest econ classes I've taken at Yale thus far.",
    "I learned about central bank policy, income inequality, and a variety of other interesting economics subjects.",
    "Stronger understanding of the fundamental economic forces that are acting around us, and of the construction of various macroeconomic models.",
    "Picture intro macro but less fun stories and more equations",
    "I learned more about macroeconomics, ranging from the Solow Model to the AS-AD Model.",
    "We learned how to analyze fluctuations in the economy in the short-run and causes of economic growth using the many economics theories such as the Solow Model and Romer Model. This included learning about the how fiscal policy, monetary policy and other policy tools affect and are affected by demand, supply and more.",
    "I learned a lot about the nature of growth in the economy.",
    "The course goes through long-run models (Solow, Romer, Modern Growth theory, Malthus) and short-run models (AS-AD framework via exploring the IS curve, monetary policy, and Philips curve). It is basically about understanding the intuition behind these theories and putting them into mathematical frameworks.",
    "This class taught me a good deal about more advanced models in macroeconomics from the short-run to the long-run.",
    "Relatively comprehensive view of macro. Cool stuff.",
    "I learned so much in this class!! Finally I understood how interest rates, unemployment and inflation work and influence each other. The longterm growth theory is super helpful in guiding thinking about inequality between countries and growth within countries.",
    "Honestly, this class is just intro macro with more algebra, so much of the material is seemingly pointless, as its already been covered. PSET's aren't all that helpful for learning the material covered in lecture (actually, I'm pretty sure the PSETS are designed more for the intuition of what is covered, and for deriving what we establish in class).",
    "This course provided basic macroeconomics understanding both in a mathematical and conceptual sense.",
    "I learned macroeconomic models that describe the process of growth in a country\/economy.",
    "Extention on the foundations of Macroeconomics learned in the introductory course",
    "I learned about the greater patterns of the world and found how to use math to predict future economics events of the world.",
    "I learned basic macroeconomics concepts",
    "I learned about Economic Growth theories.",
    "A solid grasp on the workings of the macroeconomy, that builds on the concepts in the introductory course.",
    "This class developed some of the themes explored in Intro Macro further, such as the models for long run growth and short run fluctuations.",
    "Economic thinking and analysis, putting models and formulas into the real world.",
    "I gained invaluable insights into the state of macroeconomic research and our understanding of an economys behavior.",
    "I got a better understanding of how inflation, output, and interest rates affect each other, and what certain models predict will be important for growth. I wasn't convinced by either main argument of the course (i.e. that the Romer model and AS-AD models are legit), but at least i understand them better now",
    "Macroeconomics",
    "More in-depth understanding of Solow\/Romer, AS-AD than in intro macro.",
    "Intermediate Macro is a good overview of macroeconomics built on using models to understanding the macroeconomy.",
    "Topics covered included short run model: Solow growth model, Romer Model and Long run model: ASAD model (IS cure, Monetary policy, and Phillips curve).",
    "I learned about basic Macro Econ with some theory. Long-term growth and short-term fluctuations were emphasized in this class, but I feel like a lot of the assumptions were not emphasized and taken for granted in the class. For example, we derived the Euler equation to explain consumption, but we took the IS curve and MP curve for granted and assumed consumption followed a basic model. However, Prof. Peters lectured well.",
    "More mathematical approach to macroeconomics",
    "I learned about macroeconomics! I also learned how stupid a course can make me feel and how much I can dislike the material of a course, despite really liking the professor.",
    "Intermediate Macroeconomics.",
    "This course expands on the short-run and long-run models seen in Intro Macro. Questions like \"Why are countries different?\" and \"What explains where countries are in terms of GDP per capita and capital relative to one another?\" are answered in the course. Of course, it would not be Macroeconomics without models explaining aggregate demand and supply in an economy, along with monetary policy and its effects on short-run outcomes!",
    "I learned about common macroeconomic models and about the causes of some economic phenomena."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The office hour with the professor is extremely helpful and engaging. The professor might consider to quicken the pace of teaching.",
    "This course (by Prof. Peters) is very well designed. He is constantly asking feedback to improve his teaching\/dynamics. I wish there was a paper for this course, rather than a math-heavy midterm\/final that does not necessary proves our full understanding of macroeconomics. The math part should be part of the intro, not intermediate. The only weakness I could say is that the psets\/exams are too math based while the class is not.",
    "Strengths: slides are clear, my TA was AMAZING (Marcos Frazao), Prof was super approachable the nice and really wanted us to enjoy learning about macro and connecting it to real life situations, feel like you get a lot out of the class, very approachable and fair problem sets which is not always true about other economics classes Weaknesses: a lot of material and definitely moves quite fast so missing just a little bit will confuse you",
    "This course is well organized and the problem sets are helpful for learning the material. However, because problem sets are graded pass\/fail and almost everyone passes, your grade in the class comes down to the midterm and final.",
    "Michael Peters is a blessing of a professor and probably the best economics professor I've had during my time at Yale. He really takes the time to make sure we understand the concepts he teaches, and his last lectures on economic inequality in America were a real highlight for me. I've felt like I've learned so much through this course, from new ideas to making formerly foreign seeming economic ideas much more understandable. Grading expectations, in particular on the exam true\/false, were unclear to me and annoying because of it, lost points for reasons that were sorta stiff expectations",
    "I loved the news stories we did in class. I thought those were so interesting. I also thought the last couple lectures on inequality were so neat. I think that the lectures on the regular macro were also informative, but perhaps it would be helpful to give us a huge overview at each class to give us the big picture.",
    "We spent way too much time on discussion of current events (this is a lecture class). The \"discussion\" ended up only being between Professor Peters and 1-5 students (usually the same ones every time). The rest of us were not at all engaged with this part of class (the beginning of most classes). Good effort on the part of the professor though, to try to keep us engaged. Unfortunately, it was not that effective.",
    "This class really made me appreciate macroeconomics as a whole and I learned so much from the intriguing lectures. The frustrating thing was that the psets were not really graded in a way that feedback could be given effectively.",
    "Strengths - the lectures were interesting and the slides were comprehensive. The professor and TA's were all great and very helpful. The professor takes time to talk about current events each lecture which was very nice.",
    "The powerpoint slides are a little hard to understand. However, I like how the professor spends time covering how the material is applicable to the real-world. The TA (Marcos) was very good.",
    "strengths: -MP is an excellent lecturer. he's always excited about the material he is covering and really takes the time to explore current events in relation to the theories that we're learning. really the best part of this class is his willingness to engage students. if you want to take macro, take it with him, bc he really cares about his students -problem sets are graded leniently weaknesses: -cover material really quickly, with enough space to \"understand\" it but not truly digest it -TAs were not very engaged - they walked through problem sets during section but not much beyond that -class was very much about concepts\/intuition, problem sets and especially EXAMS were actually pretty math-heavy and dependent upon you having a strong command of algebra and being able to play around with variables\/numbers. -exams tried to pack in too many questions into time period which made them very difficult. there is the curve in the end but you might walk out of the exam feeling really exhausted and stupid. this wouldn't matter except that exams make up essentially the entire grade distribution since problem sets are essentially pass\/fail. -spending more of the class on practicing with the models would be helpful.",
    "This course was generally enjoyable and engaging. However, there was no clear feedback provided on the psets so I didn't really know how I was doing regarding taking in the information until the tests.",
    "Peters was a great lecturer, good at explaining macro concepts in a way that framed them nicely in the context of current events etc. Only thing I would change is make the problem sets worth more\/grade them more comprehensively instead of check\/checkplus. Felt like a fair amount of work for almost no reason.",
    "Loved applications of concepts to the real world, especially the last two lectures on income inequality, possibly the most important economic issue we're facing to this day. It's great the professor recognized this and took time to explain this. The professor is also super nice and clearly cares about our progress in the course. Exams don't throw left-field questions for the most past, you get what you earned. Overall, really like the structure and execution of this course.",
    "I wish problem sets weren't out of 2 because I didn't know how I was doing relative to my peers until the first midterm.",
    "The lectures and problem sets did not coincide as much as I would have liked. But both the lectures and sections were interesting and helpful!",
    "I wish that the problem sets resembled the exams more.",
    "The lecture slides and the textbook are both very helpful, and the pace of the class was perfect. I wish we had more materials available to us to help us prepare for the exam\/midterm (maybe one more practice exam).",
    "The course was very well structured to facilitate learning. The professor is amazing.",
    "Great course. Lectures were always very engaging. TFs are all very helpful. Plenty of resources to learn. TF office hours could be a bit more spread out throughout the week, but everything about this course helped learning become easy.",
    "Good class. Lecture notes could be improved and lecture focused more on testable content",
    "Very well organized slides. Professor mentions about relevant real-life examples\/news in the beginning of class. Super accessible professors and TAs.",
    "Excellent course.",
    "Great course! A lot of material but very useful for understanding contemporary economic issues.",
    "The professor opens the lecture up for questions but it would be much better if it was more discussion based.",
    "The major weakness of the course is that both major models have big holes in them that are totally unaddressed. Like, they say the Romer model makes sense unless you have population growth, but then they just leave it there. Like uh what if we actually have population growth? Like you know in the real world where we have population growth. So I'm not super clear on why we spent so long on a model that has a gigantic hole in the center. Also, in Intro Macro, Aleh shows you a paper arguing that the phillips curve is totally BS and that no version of it is more predictive than just assuming that inflation will be the same this quarter as it was last quarter. If that's true, the entire AS-AD model goes out the window. Was that just like fake? It would be nice if the intro and intermediate macro classes weren't operating in wholly different paradigms, or if there was a stronger defense of the phillips curve in intermediate.",
    "Lots of real world discussion",
    "Peters is very kind and is good at explaining things, but the lectures are far too long and boring (by nature of what's being taught) for most people's attention spans. Posted slides and a great textbook (which could be found cheap online) made it easy to learn the required material.",
    "The structure of this course often made it difficult to truly gage how well you knew the material. While there are weekly problem sets, because they are graded on a check\/check-plus basis, I often found it difficult to know exactly how I was doing, especially relative to my peers, which is important in an economics class because of the curve scheme. Peters is a good professor, but his tone and manner often seemed more suited for a seminar or smaller lecture although, he's excited and knows his stuff, it was sometimes too easy to zone out in lecture. Additionally, I wish there had been more available problems. For the midterm and final, one practice test each was released, and the Jones book did not provide questions of the level of difficulty anticipated on evaluations.",
    "Great class.",
    "Class was good! The sections could focus more on rehashing the material learned than just working on the psets.",
    "Strengths: The curve. RIDE THAT WAVE, BABY! Weaknesses: I don't understand economics, this course exploited that flaw to the highest degree.",
    "Michael Peters is nice and he's a pretty good lecturer. I'd say the material is a bit dry, but he does his best to explain it. The TAs are also nice and problem sets weren't too bad. The one thing I didn't like about this class was the exams. It was super hard to prepare for them and I didn't really know what to study. Many of the questions were also weird or unclear and the grading seemed a bit arbitrary. I'd also recommend adding an extra midterm or changing the weight on things because the final was worth way too much in my opinion (50%).",
    "Great slides. The pace of certain material is too slow.",
    "The course was excellently taught. Michael Peters has an incredible way of explaining the material and his lecture slides are phenomenal. Problem sets and exams were reasonable, however many students struggled with timing on the midterm. A weakness would be the differences among TA-led Discussion Sections that were not publicized. The TA's were great, however it seems like one TA always led discussion sections covering the week's problem set, while another would speak only on the material introduced in class. Students in one section would then be at an advantage over their peers in the other section. Symmetry among the Discussion Section would be great. Furthermore, I don't get why problem sets were graded on a \"check-plus\" system, as we could never get feedback on our work!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. This course is extremely helpful to understand how the economy works.",
    "Yes if you want to learn about Macroeconomics in the real world. Intro to macro is too much model-based, so you don't feel that you can really apply what you learned. Psets are not long and very reasonable. Lectures are amazing! Professor Peters is a rock star.",
    "Do yourself a favor and take intermediate macro with Michael Peters if you can! He is a really good instructor, his lectures are very organized and straightforward and he keeps even the most boring concepts relevant to current social and economic issues. This is the only Econ requirement that I can say I really enjoyed.",
    "Definitely! Especially take it with Michael Peters.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially with Professor Peters. The math used is not daunting and the actual material is interesting. Professor Peters does a great job of relating the material to current events and ongoing debates and is an engaging lecturer.",
    "For sure! 200000x better than the rest of the intro\/intermediate classes. Michael is dope. His lectures were the most engaging I've seen, and he really takes the time to make sure we understand certain ideas\/concepts. 10\/10",
    "I would recommend this course to the student who is good at taking derivatives and wants to take one econ course to learn how the economy works. I would also recommend it to econ majors because they need to take it for their major.",
    "I really liked this class, in particular with Professor Peters, who made each lecture more interesting",
    "Yes. The material learned in this class is pretty interesting and helps you get a better understanding on how the economy functions.",
    "Yes, since it is a pre-requisite for the economics major. If you're not an economics major, then I would say to just stick with the intro course.",
    "Yes, if you want to truly understand macro. Not going to lie, took away a lot from this course and MP is a great professor. However, this was also the class I spent some of the most time on and still felt like I wasn't doing well in it. Maybe I'm just bad at critical thinking or something, but it always felt like I understood the content in class\/manipulating the equations on problem sets but not when it came to exams. chances are if you're shopping this class you are required to take it for the major, so I'd recommend doing it with MP in the spring. if you just want to better understand econ though, look elsewhere.",
    "Yes, you probably have to take this class so just take it with Michael!",
    "Yes, absolutely. Anyone even remotely interested in how economics applies to the real world\/policy etc should take this class. Relatively low workload and super interesting material.",
    "Like all required core courses, there are things that you'll like and understand well in this course and things that seem unnecessary and frustrating. I found the exams to be excessively detailed in the short response sections, and a bit too cumbersome in the long response sections that were often variations of the models we studied in class. While the problem sets were somewhat helpful in preparing for this, I think the lectures could have emphasized exactly which of the details of the models were most important to know for the short response sections, and generalize techniques for applying the models to different situations. Overall deceptively challenging, but Michael Peters was considerate and willing to help if you made an effort to do so, which I can't say I did much.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course - especially if it is taught by Professor Peters. He is absolutely fantastic and clearly cares a lot about the students.",
    "Please take this class!! This class made me confident in my decision to major in Econ. Every lecture you learn something new and fascinating. And the little quantitative thinking in the class to facilitate the concepts actually makes sense.",
    "The spring term inter-macro is pretty much the same course content as the spring-term intro-macro I took last year, but the instruction is much clearer and I know what to expect on the exam.",
    "Take it if you're an econ major. Otherwise, if you've taken intro already, you don't really learn much.",
    "Yes, Professor Peters makes this course more tolerable! Required for econ majors, of course.",
    "Take it for your major if needed! It was an important class, but I wouldn't necessary recommend it if you don't need it for your major.",
    "Take this course. It is very interesting, and having gone through the intro micro and macro and intermediate micro classes, this class was much better than all the others.",
    "It is a great class and I would recommend however I don't think anyone other than economics majors would find it genuinely interesting.",
    "Yes. Especially if you want to major in Econ, or you want a solid understanding of how the economy works.",
    "YES. Understanding the patterns of the world is crucial to operate in a globalized world.",
    "It is probably for a major requirement, but yes if you want to know if you are interested in economics",
    "Definitely take it with Prof. Peters.",
    "Yes, if you want to gain a solid understanding of the economy.",
    "yes",
    "Take it if you need it for the Econ major, and try taking it with Peters- he's a good teacher.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in learning about the most important macroeconomic models revealing invaluable insights into our economy. The class is difficult when it comes to midterms and exams but the topic is really interesting.",
    "It's fine. Lectures are not riveting. I would not recommend it unless you want to take higher level econ courses. Most of it can be googled or is arguably wrong. You'll learn some models, but you won't really know if the models are worthwhile",
    "Yes",
    "Unlike with micro courses at Yale, I always find it easier to know what I'm supposed to know, and subsequently to be prepared for the tests, with macro courses. The subject matter can feel dry to learn, and I personally prefer learning on my own from lectures and the textbook than from going to class, but the stuff covered is really interesting if you take interest in international disparity and the economy on a national scale.",
    "Macro is often said to be a more intuitive course than micro. That has a flip side to it. If you, like me, don't particularly have the macro intuition, this course can be challenging and often frustrating, because it seemed like there wasn't much to do in terms of putting in work that might make up that lack of intuition. That being said, most students who are looking at this course likely are required to do so, and it's still a generally manageable class.",
    "Professor Peters was great! He did a great job of bringing current events and combine it with the material. I thought the class was incredibly interesting.",
    "Odds are this course is required for you. Overall, it's pretty good with Prof. Peters. However, if you're looking for a really rigorous treatment of macro, you might want to take the smaller, math-intensive section.",
    "Yes, Michael Peters is really great!",
    "Holy moly, this one's a doozy. First of all, I want to say that this has nothing to do with the professor. Michael Peters is a god\/Saint and I would take a bullet if it meant protecting this man's luscious German locks. However, I would never recommend taking ECON 122 to anyone. The course itself is fine; Professor Peters was a fantastic lecturer and engaged the large lecture more others would, often asking questions from the audience to check their understanding. He also connected our course material to the real world with relevant news articles that made the class much more enjoyable. If I never saw a Solow Growth Model curve again, that would be too soon. Maybe Econ just isn't for me, but this class was dreadful. On the surface level, I understand everything; however, when the PSets and tests begin to ramp up in difficulty, I found it very hard to keep up. Ah well. You know what George Bush says. \"To those of you who are graduating this afternoon with high honors, awards, and distinctions: I say, \"Well done.\" And as I like to tell the C students... 'You too can be President.'\" Welp... here I come, Oval Office.",
    "Intermediate Macro is just kind of all around dry and doesn't seem very applicable. But if you can take it with Michael Peters, he does his best to make it interesting and applicable. This class is probably your best best to get through intermediate macro.",
    "A great class with Michael Peters. He elaborates concepts well and really tries to help everyone learn.",
    "I would recommend this course to all students at Yale (Econ majors and all varieties of the sort, you're stuck taking a wonderful class!). The course offers a way to think about the world around us in a different way and allows one to make sense of economic jargon often heard\/read in day-to-day life.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student taking economics (you really don't have a choice) as well as any student who is really interested in learning more about macroeconomic theory."
