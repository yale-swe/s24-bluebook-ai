    "A solid introduction to directing for students who have either never done it before or have only tried it once and aren't quite sure what being a good director means. The slow pace of it (especially if the class is small) can sometimes be frustrating, but the skills you learn -- how to read the play, break it down into comprehensive beats and then stage it to convey your vision of it to the audience -- are invaluable and will prove useful in your career if you choose to pursue directing.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to be a \"theater-maker\" as a career. The class is not only useful for the conventional \"Director,\" but for anyone who want to get a taste of what it's like to create new theater. I highly recommend the class to actors, who often need a dose of reality and a glimpse into what its like to be on the opposite side of the table. The class is not a walk-in-the-park when it comes to the workload. You are expected to prepare a writing assignment for nearly every class and keep a well-maintained journal, but the work rarely felt superfluous. Additionally, Toni is a great person in the Yale theater community to get to know: a valuable brain to pick!",
    "If you want to learn how to approach a scene, or a play, from various angles as a director, then take this course. Professor Dorfman assigns a variety of exercises that really help the students tackle the job of directing in many different ways - some practical and some more intangible. You will also get to direct 2 scenes (and rework each of them 1 time) and get feedback from Professor Dorfman and the class."
