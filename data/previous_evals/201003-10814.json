   "comments": [
    "Actually a very relevant class. While it may seem less important or less exciting because it seems most of the work in this area was done 20-30years ago, as you move through the other courses it becomes apparent that you do need to know the material and it will in fact play a vital role in your research.",
    "A good overview of Advanced organic chemistry covering solvent effects, acid and bases, kinetics and supramolecular chemistry. I'd recommend if they are interested in going back and understanding exactly how basic chemical reactions work and how they can be changed.",
    "In summary: if you are an organic chemist or work in an organic lab, it will make a huge difference to the way you perform research and think about reactions, especially solvent effects and other binding effects. I do believe that for anyone in chemistry this class should be required.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Despite its incredible focus on memorization, the topics are very applicable to all areas of chemistry and many topics come up in other courses. It is good to see them from different perspectives and it helps to link together different areas of chemistry.",
    "Very good course. Definitely would recommend it. The topics discussed could easily come in handy in any area of chemistry.",
    "Fundamental principles are the basis of organic chemistry.I would recommend this course because it can help understand organic chemistry on a more fundamental level",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student because it makes you understand important aspects of phsyical organic chemistry.",
    "It depends on the field they are in. If they are doing a lot of wet lab research then this course can be useful. If not than there is no reason to take the class.",
    "I would recommend this course to those who want to gain basic physical organic chemistry knowledge.",
    "Chemistry 518 is a look at the familiar rules of organic chemistry from a slightly different angle. As the course goes on, many of these \"rules\", once accepted as axioms, will become clearly explained. This is not a course that requires much work outside of studying for exams and as such may be a good choice for busy undergraduates and graduate students who want to take a course outside their comfort zone and learn about a different field of chemistry."

   "comments": [
    "I have a whole new appreciation for solvent effects after this course.",
    "Not sure this is overly relevant to my research, but I feel like it was information I should know and will probably use some cinceots taught from time to time.",
    "(read above responses please)",
    "Very enlightening course. Again, the subjects discussed in class are likely to come up in every line of research, so I imagine I will use them at some point.",
    "It helps give physical explanations for organic chemistry reactivity",
    "Since I am in organic synthesis, this course has given me enough basic information that I should know to do research in synthesis."
