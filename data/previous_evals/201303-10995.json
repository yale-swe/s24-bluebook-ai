   "comments": [
    "Physics 320 is much more work than it appears for a writing credit. Do not underestimate how difficult it is to confine a convincing argument into a maximum of two pages, 1.5 spacing. The most rewarding part of the class is the final 15 page research paper and the guest lecturers are excellent, but the regular lectures are very slow and repetitive. The class will prepare you well to present material to an audience in a very short period of time and boil down arguments to brief, yet effective memos.",
    "Definitely. It's science from a different perspective.",
    "A fair overview of topics related to science and public policy. The case studies are repeated throughout the class, which is great if you are interested in particle physics. I liked the class as a whole, but with so few students, it would have been more engaging as a seminar.",
    "If you're interested in taking a class about science policy, you should take one in a department which actually studies policy. The class, being run by DoE-funded researcher, was rather uncritical. I suppose the class did give me a new perspective on public science funding although probably not the intended one. Before, I would have heartily endorsed the idea that government funding for science should be increased. Now, I'm incredibly sick of listening to scientists complain about how difficult it is to get their billion particle dector funded and built by the US taxpayer.",
    "Taking this class depends on how much you care about your GPA (your interest in the topic vs. taking a not-so-great grade) and how good of a writer you are.The grading (of papers) is extremely harsh (I got something below a C on my first and second papers) and it is the only thing your final grade is based on.It might also be a little challenging for students who have no background in science. I wouldn't really recommend taking it if you're a freshman either (the vast majority of the class are seniors).Other than that it is absolutely fabulous! A very interactive class with a lot of interesting things to learn.",
    "Lectures are boring, but I personally got a lot out of this class because I'm very interested in science policy. Through this class, I gained concrete skills in writing and presenting policy memos, which I found to be very, very useful. Definitely recommended if you're interested in pursuing a career in science policy or if you're a science major looking for a chill WR. If not, you might want to look elsewhere because lectures are rather dry.",
    "Great overview of science policy, with the opportunity to learn a useful, real-world writing skill: policy memos. Interesting balance of science topics and political realities governing the funding and legislative regulation process. Professor Fleming brings in a few interesting presenters, and the workload is quite reasonable (and evenly spaced throughout the semester). Grading can be a bit arbitrary, but working with the TA's to develop your ideas should help this. The class is heavily skewed to high energy physics, so having a preexisting interest in DUSEL\/SSC\/FermiLab\/CERN will make the class more enjoyable.",
    "This class is great for science students - they should all have an understanding of science and policy in the United States whether they're interested in being in academia, government, or the private sector. Also good for anyone interested in being in science policy or a science staffer. I really liked the policy memo writing practice, and would recommend this class as a writing credit for anyone interested in policy in the future, but I wouldn't recommend it to any friends that aren't interested in science policy because the class would be pointless for them.",
    "This was a really interesting class, and the lectures were quite informative and enjoyable. For me personally, it was a great WR credit because of my interest in a health policy career and the practice we got in memo writing. I really appreciated how Professor Fleming encouraged discussion in class - it definitely exposed me to some interesting insights and opinions from my peers. Even though I'm not a Physics major at all, the class was still great, and I had opportunities to choose my own memo topic and orient it more towards my own interests.",
    "If you have interest in forming science policy in the U.S., this course is a useful one to take. The writing assignments in this course are things that one might be expected to do as someone in a think tank, as a congressional staffer, or as a lobbyist. Each assignment centers on creating a professional document which you could hand to someone (say a congressperson), and they could go into a debate with an informed view. These assignments include 3 2-page memos (these take a bit longer than one might expect) and one final ~15 page policy brief paper. Lectures in this course could be a bit dry, but they gave a very good overview of the history and current state of U.S. science policy. I would recommend this course to any person with an interest in STEM and policy.",
    "A really good course. Dr. Fleming is amazing; she obviously really knows her stuff and knows how to teach it. Uses examples from her own experience working in physics to help us see how science policy works on a real anecdotal level AND has a great facility with statistics from different respected reports to back up what she's saying. Also she's just so excited about physics she gets everyone else excited about it too. The visiting speakers offer a great expanse of other views, as well."
