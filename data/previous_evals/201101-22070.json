   "comments": [
    "The class is structured well, starting from the basics and covering a good amount of material. The powerpoints and lectures are very well-organized and easy to follow along with. The problem sets pretty effectively cover the material taught in class. The material is interesting stuff that seems quite relevant to real-life applications.",
    "This is a good course to take to fulfill a computer science elective. Avi is a good teacher. The lectures are clear. The work is relatively manageable.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student if they had a more than trivial interest in databases.",
    "This is not a particularly difficult course in the Computer Science major. That said, it's not a cakewalk either. Listening in class is essential, even when the material moves slowly.",
    "I would recommend it as an intro in databases or a nice CS elective that has some work but is not super crazy.",
    "If you're a CS major who plans to work in the private sector, definitely take it. An understanding of databases is essential for such a career path, and this course does a great job of giving you a solid understanding.",
    "Relatively straightforward material... got a little rushed towards the end... and there was a lot of material to cover for the final. Useful stuff though!",
    "Intro to Databases is a good overview of Database concepts. Avi is fun, and I enjoyed his lectures. The work is entirely based on the TA's; Avi does not write the homework or the exams. In years past I've heard the class was easy, but with our TA it was mildly challenging.",
    "Not a gut class despite what people say, however definitely manageable. Interesting class with practical applications (up until the half way point of the course when it all gets theoretical).",
    "For a computer science elective it's very low workload. This is very much a broad intro course where you don't do much work. The exams are a lot of memorization which I found annoying and you don't really do anything in depth, but if you have an otherwise heavy course load and need a CS elective this may be the one to choose.",
    "I came into this past semester looking for a class that would teach me something I could easily teach myself in three days with an online tutorial, but would leave me a lot more confused and uncomfortable. I wanted a course that would have me always wondering what my grade would be, and that would be provide seemingly random grades for problem sets and tests, regardless of the effort put in (I wanted major points taken off for minor errors, no points taken off for major errors, etc.). I wanted a course where the professor would refuse to answer questions in class, and I wanted the lectures to be deathly boring. I wanted a course where the slides and textbook (both written by the professor) were so riddled with errors as to be unusable, and much of the material was so obscure as to be unfindable on the internet. I wanted the material to be misunderstood even by the TA who works with the professor on research, and I wanted literally every person involved in the course (students, TA, prof) to have no idea what was going on most of the time. Fortunately, I found all of that with this course!",
    "Definitely recommend \u0096 it\u0092ll give you a great nuts-and-bolts overview of most aspects of a database, ranging from query languages to design to implementation and optimization. A very useful course because databases have so many applications. Warning though, it\u0092s a crash course and goes by very quickly, leaving a more shallow understanding of the field."
