   "comments": [
    "The only real problem with the course is the mixture of grad and undergrad students, which this year was lopsided in the direction of the latter. Sometimes this mix was productive -- undergrads generally had a strong background in econ and psych, for instance, which was useful in class discussion. But grad students are more focused on the questions involved and have a different way of reading texts. Prof. Bullock did a good job of trying to please everyone -- I don't think the fault is his -- but I think it's just hard to run a course with this sort of mix (a grad class with a few upper-level undergrads makes more sense). If you're a grad student with a working knowledge of behavior, I'd skip it, even though it's a good course. If you do need an introduction to the subfield, then it's definitely worth taking."
