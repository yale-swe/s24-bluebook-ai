    "Solid organized course, though material\/lectures may not be the most interesting at times.",
    "CENG 480 is a difficult, but ultimately very rewarding chemical engineering class. Finally, after three years of learning all the building blocks, you finally get a dose of real chemical engineering. Professor Altman is a eloquent and smart professor with a cute\/quirky sense of humor. The final project will bring back memories of PChem Lab, but you'll survive. Also, Altman does not like Macs; if you go into office hours with a Mac, he will judge you.",
    "Process control is actually a pretty cool class, and if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re even considering it it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re majoring in CENG, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like you have a choice. The problem sets are reasonable and the exams are tough, but fair, which is better than you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get in a lot of engineering classes. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid to ask Altman for help, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always more than willing to give it. It sucks to have both a term project and a final exam, but if you start the project early and actually keep up with the checkpoint tasks, you should be fine.",
    "A very interesting class, could be useful, probably required for you if you're looking at the class in the first place. The class is straightforward in terms of lecture, and the homework is very manageable. Beware of the final project and final exam come end of term. They are very very difficult, and the final project is extremely time consuming if you plan on doing something right or something close to right. Do not put it off, and be wary of the final exam as well. At the end, you might find that there wasn't that much you could do to be better prepared for it anyway.",
    "This is required for the chemical engineering major. Even though it is fairly difficult, you do feel like you've learned a lot at the end of the course, and the information is extremely useful for chemical engineering. The problem sets aren't too difficult, but the lectures can drag on a bit especially for a 9am class. The midterm and final were fair, but the final project was extremely difficult. Be prepared to spend at least a week straight on the project and ask a lot of questions."
