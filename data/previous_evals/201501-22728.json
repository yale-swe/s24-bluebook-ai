    "The last semester of L5 Russian language is definitely worth it!",
    "If you're at this point in your study of Russian, don't give up now! Irina is the most perfect, caring, lovely professor. She wants nothing more than to spark\/maintain her students' interest in the Russian language. She is willing to talk about anything with you to improve your conversational skills, from literature to history to math.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course for anyone wanting to continue their study of Russian and bridge the gap between more elementary study of Russian towards more advanced Russian literary studies."
