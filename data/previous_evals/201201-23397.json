    "The course was very valuable and the work very targeted and focused, even though it is quite demanding as a course.",
    "Homework was so hard but it was very helpful to understand GIS overall.",
    "I know that, ultimately, I learned quite a bit from this class. Having absolutely no GIS or mapping background, and minimal computer background outside of the standard Microsoft Office packages and Adobe Suites, I definitely had a hard time understanding what I was doing most of the time. I have also not yet taken a statistics course. This class taught me how to use tools in a GIS toolbox, but I definitely still feel fairly confused about what, precisely, the tools are telling me. Dana gave us ample opportunity to work with other students, which, given my schedule, I didn't take full advantage of. He also gave us opportunities to ask questions and trouble shoot. I, however, felt perpetually behind and though I knew I was confused, I was never quite sure of how I should articulate my confusion. Meaning, I knew there were things that I didn't understand, but I didn't know where to begin asking. My questions weren't so much how to perform a task, but how to interpret the task that I am performing. Without completely understanding the numbers or the math, it is difficult to know what operations are best to carry out.I spent more time working on projects for this course than any other course. I have never invested so much time and achieved such mediocre outcomes.",
    "Very interesting class, both conceptually as well as practically.",
    "I took GIS mostly for my own interest, and not really because it fits with my professional goals. I'm glad I did though. I'll never be the technician in charge of GIS for work, but I know I'll be glad to know its capabilities, so I'll know how to ask the pros for just the kind of spacial analysis I want."

    "Learning a tool that I can apply in future work projects.",
    "Learning how to use GIS.",
    "very useful",
    "The Professor is absolueteltborganized, cares, and ensures that students get the information they want and need.",
    "Dana is a great teacher, but focuses more on the conceptual basis for GIS and raster thinking than on the function of the ArcGIS software. I learned a lot about thinking analytically for solving complex problems.",
    "Dana does a fantastic job explaining somewhat complicated concepts.",
    "You learn to effectively and efficiently use a very important tool.",
    "(1) This course provides an in depth understanding of raster graphics manipulation in GIS. While time consuming, the exercises truly leave the student feeling competent, and able to explore skills on their own.(2) The instructor is methodical, and takes appropriate conceptual leaps. This allows for optimal skill development, where you are challenged but not lost.(3) The instructor is very responsive to any inquiries.(4) This course is as much about conceptual brain gymnastics as it is practical GIS use. The conceptual skills really train you to think outside the box.(5) The final assignment\/project was built into the last four weeks of class. This was a brilliant model for everyone, I think, in that we turned in work on the last day, and had no further obligations (assuming you were caught up). This allowed time for all of the other classes that had more traditional schedules.",
    "Learning to think in new conceptual was ways. Also, the instructor was great.",
    "The instructor and his ability to explain concepts very clearly. His class notes were very detailed and the professor was usually always available for help.",
    "Professor's quick response and well designed problem set.",
    "The professor was very clear about his subject in the class that it made it easy for me to learn the concepts.The professor tried using different examples to make the students understand the concepts.",
    "Involves a lot of work, in which most of the learning are happening.",
    "The very expressive way in which the instructor conveys concepts.",
    "Dana Tomlin is a master of his art and an excellent pedagog.",
    "Dana is breathtakingly knowledgeable, and incredibly adept at communicating obscure spatial theory.",
    "You can get the idea of how to use ArcGIS.",
    "The best thing about the course is learning skill. Learning GIS is a very good skill and it is used in every field. I liked the way Professor taught us this course."

   "comments": [
    "I didn't' enjoy the homework where we had to deal with others models. It required extensive time to fix others mistakes, instead of focusing on developing and honing new skills.",
    "workingload is a little bit heavy",
    "Nothing. The course is designed perfectly, really.",
    "I think it would be great if Dana and Stacey team-taught this class, so that rather than meeting once a week for 3 hours, it met twice a week, with one session taught by Dana and once session taught by Stacey, who is much better at showing step-by-step how the various software tools work. Alternatively, having an established Lab session to accompany the 3 hour lecture, led by either Dana, Stacey, or a TA, would help immensely. While TA office hours are great, I think that a lot could be gained by having a structured instruction time with the software- and students would learn as much from having that time than from puzzling through things blindly on their own.In addition, I think it would be great if the course materials (online handouts) could be printed and bound as a text book. I spent more time puzzling through the names of handouts looking for the right material than was necessary- if it was in printed form, or even in one, searchable electronic form- it would make life a lot easier.",
    "Nothing really.",
    "My only complaint is that the professor, with his busy teaching schedule at different schools, is never present in person to work through technical challenges. While prompt and thorough when addressing email inquiries, I do wish he was present on campus for some time each week, whether to talk about assignments or discuss outside research. That said, Stacey Maples in the map department is always on campus if professor Tomlin is not, and between the two of them and the TA, help is only a short way off.",
    "The pace can sometimes be overwhelming.",
    "None",
    "Would have liked instruction on how to get data from online sources or \"clean up\" our own data.",
    "requirements and instructions of the homework were not so clear and often got me confused.",
    "I think it would be useful to have more opportunities for class DISCUSSION or CRITIQUE. I know there may not be a lot of time in the way that the class is structured, but I think I would learn more if I\/other students were made to explain (verbally) the steps that they took in order to carry out an assignment. While it's valuable to see the steps that someone else took to address a problem, I think it is more helpful to discuss the train of thought that brought them to that conclusion. Peer review is useful in many ways and may command students to bemore thoughtful in the steps that they take as well as in the manner in which material is presented. Perhaps a two hour lecture and an hour for group review?",
    "Bowers auditorium is a terrible classroom.",
    "Nothing. Very well designed course.",
    "Hmmm... More TAs so that there are more pros around to help.",
    "There were confusions about the assignments in the last few weeks of the class. The assignment curriculum can be developed more concretely in advance. Also, the assignment description was often too brief and confusing.",

However, she was unavailable (away from campus?) from Spring Break onwards, so we no longer had someone to ask questions in person - this was especially tough at the end of the semester as the homework assignments got longer and more complex. Anobha was fantastic, approachable, and very knowledgeable, but in the future, it would be better to have a TA who was going to be available for the full semester.",
    "a lot",
    "The instructor was very available electronically, which is great but only so helpful when you are puzzling through the mysteries of ArcGIS. Having in-person office time, as Dana started to do toward the end of the semester by showing up in the Sage computer lab before class time- would be far more helpful.The TA office hours were helpful, but she was gone for 2 or 3 weeks right when our assignments were getting more difficult- which was not helpful.",

    "Fantastic email (and some in-person) responses from Dana outside of class, and ditto from the TA when I could make it to office hours. But more TA hours would be incredibly helpful - for a class this size and of this complexity, having 3 or 4 TAs worth of office hours would make a world of difference.",

In this light, I occasionally worked with others to make sure we all understood how we should be thinking about the problem, and what some possible techniques that we might use, were.",

    "(1) Prepare for a significant time commitment, but know that it is well worth it!(2) Keep a list of questions in a word document as you do each assignment. Bring them up at the beginning of the next class.(3) Do each assignment immediately after class. This provides the easiest transition to working on one's own, and for, provided good reinforcement.(4) The lab computers work better than even a new mac with book camp.(5) Use an external hard drive for your assignments, since some of the data takes up a bit of space.(6) This really is a wonderful course. Very thorough, with the exception of Python, and excellent in both physical and intellectual development.(7) I conducted a time tracking project all term, to assist other students in planning their lives. This course took me 250:55. In many cases, I did an excessive amount of work, relative to what was needed. With 106 days in the semester between the week of the first class and the week of the last class, that is about 15+ weeks including spring break. That equates to about 16.5 hours each week. Again, this figure includes the spring break weeks, but resulted in no work beyond the last class.",
