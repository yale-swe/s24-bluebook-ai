   "comments": [
    "Great experiments--anything modern physics is awesome. Unfortunately the particle accelerator couldn't get set up in time our year ): Long writeups. Much more than one credit's worth of a class.",
    "I hate lab in general so my response may not be a good indicator of the course. I dreaded lab and lab reports and would never recommend anyone take a lab if they have an extra course to take It's very tedious and laborious",
    "Much more interesting than 205 lab, but at the same time, much more work. Labs themselves are generally not very stressful because you have 3 hours to only collect data, but the lab write-ups can be long and time-consuming. You also get to pick which labs you do, which makes the experience more fun. Just make sure you pick the right labs!",
    "Intense physics lab, only take this lab if you are serious about physics and are prepared to spend a lot of time (10 hrs a week) on it.",
    "Required physics lab, so you probably have to take it if you're taking it; consult friends on which labs to do, and depending on your TA (which you can't control) and the labs you choose, it can be great or a pain. It's kind of a lot of work for a half credit though; the reports are quite lengthy if done correctly and completely.",
    "Introduction to more serious physics experiments and lab writeups. Much less stressful than 205, and really fun too. Would definitely recommend, even for non majors if you're interested in working with superconductors and electron beam experiments.",
    "It's a decent course, infinitely better than 205L. Do the Milikan, it was really fun. Some of the labs have really old equipment though.",
    "If you're taking it, you need it, so whatever. 206 is a lot harder than 205, but the experiments are more exciting. However, the TA shapes the experience of the course way more than he or she should. My lab partner and I got a TA who was very judgmental to questions and very discouraging. My least favorite class this semester was by far PHYS 206 L, because of this TA and the environment he created. Talking to students in other sections, he also requested a lot more theoretical information in the reports than the TAs of other sections. This made my lab partner and I spend a lot more time on our lab reports than on any other class we had (and trust me, I had a lot more advanced classes than lab this term). This was very very very annoying, specially because it's only half a credit. Try to find out how the TA of the section you're in is. My TA made my life hell, and I almost gave up on being a physics major. Going to lab was the one part of my week that I hated. Sometimes I would come out of it almost crying of anger. Our section's TA was very judgmental and discouraging. He made us write up to 16 pages every week, which was waaaaaay more than any other TA of any other section. It was like writing a final paper every week, and I have no freaking idea of why his class is only worth half a credit. You won't have much interaction with the professor, since you'll be in a separate room with your TA, your lab partner and your experiment. SO DO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW YOUR TA IS BEFORE YOU PICK THE SECTION.",
    "The enjoyability of this course depends entirely on one's TF. Far too much autonomy is given to the TF, so there is little standardization across sections in terms of procedures and grading. Be aware that what is asked of you may vary wildly and grading may either be quite lenient or very tough depending on year and TF.",
    "If you're doing it because it's required, go ahead. It's not crazy hard, though the lab reports can be a pain, especially if your TA is a harsh grader. If you're not taking this to fulfill a physics lab requirement, I find it really weird that you're taking it at all, but I figure you know what you're doing so best of luck to you."
