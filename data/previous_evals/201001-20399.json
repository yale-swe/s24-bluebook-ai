    "Overall a very good class. Really interesting readings, and nice to be in such a small graduate class. There is a really big paper at the end, but it's really the only assignment. If you are interested in international development, you should definitely take it.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it. heavy reading load (compared to undergrad classes) but they are all interesting . it's great for anthro majors or anyone interested in development..although leaves you feeling pretty hopeless for the state of the world!!",
    "Overall a fantastic course. Really gives a great entry into the anthropological critique of development. If you are at all interested in conservation\/development, then you must take this class, as I feel it's one of the only ones at Yale that actually offers a cogent critique of what is otherwise depicted as a singularly positive enterprise. Prof. Carpenter is absolutely outstanding; she is very approachable -- I have never been made to feel so openly engaged by a professor. I think Prof. Carpenter really put it together well."
