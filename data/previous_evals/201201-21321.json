    "This course is an overview of the history of the Jews with respect to nationalism and language. I would recommend the class if you are very interested in either of these things.",
    "A survey course on the issues of language, community identity and nationalism for Jewish communities in different times and places. I would recommend the course, but only for students with previous background or interest in Judaic history --- the pace of the class and the specificity of the subject matter makes it ill-suited for an introductory course of Jewish history.",
    "YES! If you are interested in this particular subject, I would recommend the class.The course is basically a survey of the history of the Jewish people, but through the lens of language. We learned about the many languages the Jewish people spoke when they were living with various host cultures. The class was all discussion. We read several articles each week-- the class required a lot of reading-- and wrote two papers.The class is challenging but if you invest yourself in it, you will gain\/ learn a lot.",
    "This seminar involves a very intense treatment of Jewish history through the lens of language and its connection to nationhood and nationalism. The class covers a wide range times and places, from Yiddish in medieval Germany and 19th century Russia, to Ladino in the Ottoman Empire, Hebrew in Eastern Europe and Israel\/Palestine, and even 'Judeo-English' in America, but I didn't think it felt disjointed or overly broad in subject. There's a lot of reading - probably more than your average history seminar, I'd say. The papers are manageable and actually pretty enjoyable, though. It's a pretty accessible course, but I'd recommend you have some prior knowledge of Jewish history going into it; otherwise you might find yourself looking up a lot of terms and references in the readings\/discussions. Overall, a strong class and one I'd recommend, although since Professor Halperin is leaving, I don't know how it will be if taught by someone else.",
    "Professor Halperin is going to be teaching at Princeton next year so I think this question is not relevant. But I will answer it anyway. I would recommend this class for a fellow student with a couple of caveats. It was hard at times for me, and for other students I talked to, to have discussions in class that were purely about the readings, because a lot of us had deep personal connections to the material. In some ways these connections made the experience of reading and discussion richer, but at times they also got in the way of analysis. I also felt that a lot of the reading was at a level higher than what I was comfortable with. This wasn't a bad thing - it was great to be challenged - but much of the reading was very different than what I was used to. Many of our texts were analyses of literature I had never read or even heard of. This was a type of academic writing I had not come across before, and I had some trouble figuring out what to draw from it. Some of it presupposed knowledge of Jewish history, whether Biblical or modern, than I didn't necessarily have."
