    "Span 130 is a great course to take if you enjoy spanish and want to work on your fluency. The course will push you to speak more and truly comprehend and use the grammar learned in previous courses.",
    "An excellent way to further develop your spanish skills, especially speaking.",
    "Solid overview of grammar, reading, and contextualizing what the student has read. Lots of work but worth it at the end of the semester.",
    "It was about the same as L2 with more review and more busy work. Less hands on learning but more grammar.",
    "The class is a solid grammar based class with a fair amount of writing. I enjoyed It."
