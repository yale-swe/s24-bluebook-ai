    "Learning week by week and piece by piece how to write a strategic communication plan for an organization",
    "incredible wealth of knowledge in the course readings and throughout the lecture on strategic env comms. wonderful ah-ha moments throughout.",
    "A really great walkthrough of a PR campaign. Step by step it's difficult but at the end you have a very useful demonstration of a comms campaign. Tony's career and insights are invaluable.",
    "I took this class at the same time that I was taking Behavioral Economics at SOM -- and I think that was a great pairing, since it helped me put into practice the concepts and ideas I was learning there in a communications context. I liked learning how to write in a way that is going to be very useful in the real-world -- and how to arrange it to make the case internally for particular strategies.",
    "Very helpful overview of strategic communication for environmental issues!",
    "I learned how to develop a public relations campaign through following steps in a book. Tony gives interesting PR and communications examples and stories in class."

    "Very well aligned",
    "This class surpassed my expectations - Tony was a good teacher as well as a knowledgable practitioner.",
    "Very well",
    "Very well!",
    "I think they aligned about average. I didn't have a background in PR, or communications, so this course did teach me a lot. But if you have a background in this area it probably would not be as useful."

  {
   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: learned about the elements behind effective communications, had a useful deliverable to create and distribute Weaknesses: level of feedback on weekly memos was low",
    "Any 3 hour class is going to feel repetitive, but I felt that the structure (lecture, workshopping, feedback) could have had greater variety, with perhaps a real time editing exercise or reaction to a piece or writing or video.",
    "Strengths: Even though it felt like a lot at the time to have a brief due every week, it really helped to build the campaign book throughout the course and allowed the book to come together easily at the end. How to improve: I think it would have been useful to require 1-on-1s with either Tony or Franz to ensure that we were getting individualized feedback -- even though we discussed it during class, it sometimes felt like certain projects got more attention than others.",
    "Did not enjoy the readings, and think it might be interesting to explore the concepts through more in-depth case studies.",
    "Tony did not workshop on personal campaign books as much as I would have liked. It would have been better to break off into smaller groups for that part of class."

   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn how to think about effective communications strategies for environmental work, take this class.",
    "Try to get in, because it's worth it.",
    "Choose a client where you have at least some access to \"inside\" information -- it's hard to write a targeted and useful communication campaign without some non-public information.",
    "Helpful for those who want to learn more about developing a communications strategy or just understanding how to be more strategic in framing the issues you care about.",
    "This is a class on Tony's work, and Tony is very interesting and engaging and I learned a lot from his stories. The applied campaign book was more just for completion, then actually worthwhile in my opinion. The campaign book was disappointing because I wanted to give a good product to the organization I was working for.",
    "Be sure to choose a project that you are interested in working on carefully, as this is a great opportunity to connect with and work with an organization you are interested in and offer them value from the strategic communications plan."
