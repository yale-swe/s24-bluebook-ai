    "This course is essential for anyone interested in forests. Mark Ashton is the best and most dedicated professor I know of at FES.",
    "I'm not studying forestry, but I would highly recommend this class to anyone, regardless of study emphasis.",
    "The field trips complemented the field work nicely as well as the homework assignments.",
    "There are not a lot of opportunities for students to synthesis what they've learned prior to taking the test apart from the exams. The paper provides such an opportunity but it's handed in so late that there isn't time for feedback and reflection. I think having bi-weekly problem sets would help me learn the material better than only studying for the mid-term\/final.",
    "This is a really good foundation course, even for non-forester types. Integrates a lot of ecology and other subjects but with a very applied focus that is lacking in many classes here. Lots of field trips, they were mostly useful (especially Yale-Myers) but took a lot of time. The work load was manageable as long as you keep up with reading and get to work on the paper early.",
    "Mark provided a relatively in-depth look at silviculture. At times he could be relatively hard to follow, but given the complexity of the material and the differing backgrounds of students in the class, this was to be expected.",
    "I was personally encouraged by the commitment and dedication of the Professor and his team of TAs to this course. Even though it was an 8 o' clock class, the energy of the professor was infusing such that it was bearable to wake up earlier than the norm on Mondays and Wednesdays to head for this class.",
    "Mark is difficult to get answers out of when students ask questions.",
    "Question 3: The paper helped me put together a lot of the concepts we were learning, toward a specific example. But it didn't really help prepare me for the exam, and nothing throughout the semester really helped students prepare for the exams except seeing examples of exams from previous years. The workload is already rather large, but perhaps instead of a paper (which loads a lot of work onto the end of the semester with a paper and a final), there could be several short answer or essay-like questions (similar to those open ended exam questions) throughout the semester, so we could get practice thinking about how to answer them. They could be follow-ups to field trips, or unrelated. Somehow I think the exams, field trips, and other assignments (e.g. paper) could be better integrated to promote learning.",
    "- Lectures covered interesting material, but were sometimes repetitive and unclear. For example, Mark repeats things unnecessarily which can be frustrating in a 2-hour lecture. Also, if one looks back at the slides, it is difficult to tell what the main ideas were - of individual slides or even how they are connected to the particular lecture topic.- This should, in no way, take away from Mark's obvious warmth and commitment to the course and students, and of course connection to the course material itself. He's obviously a remarkable wealth of knowledge.- The field trips were fun, but didn't always reinforce the important concepts of the course. I would also say the research paper assignment could be refined more to reinforce particular portions of the course - it's pretty broad, and I didn't leave that experience feeling like it added to my understanding of the material covered in lecture. It felt pretty separate, and as the only out-of-class assignment, might be better spent on something that reinforces the classwork.",
    "3. Would suggest that exercises be given as assignments that force us to practice the skills we have to demonstrate on the midterm and final exam. The easiest way to do this would be to give us assignments to work on questions from past exams regarding natural regeneration, thinning, and treatment methods.7a. The amount of preparation Mark Ashton put into every lecture far surpassed that I have experienced in any other FES course. It's a pleasure to listen to his lectures, which are eloquently and complexly delivered.7c. TAs could have been better prepared for all but the last tutorial session. Answers provided in these sessions were often hesitant and inconclusive. More struture to the sessions would have been appreciated, rather than just taking questions from the class.9b. Sad we didn't have the opportunity to plant seedlings\/learn how to girdle firsthand because the first trip to Yale Myers was cancelled. Appreciated Mark's willingness to move some trips to Saturdays in order to avoid conflicts.",
    "Work load was heavy, but that's why it is a 4 unit class! This class has been taught for so long at this school that all the kinks in the curriculum have long since been worked out- smooth progression of information and material, measurable progress in each student in terms of understanding both of forest ecology and silvicultural treatments; field trips were an excellent means of putting theory to practice and taking the class outside of the lecture format.",
    "One of my favorite classes at FES, Professor Ashton is wonderful.",
    "I loved this class, really - unfortunately I found out I'm not very good at getting up in time for an 8 am class. I wish I had taken advantage of the lectures fully, but even so, I think the class was one of my favorites this semester. Mark is an encyclopaedia, and extremely accessible. I would like to point out that he sent an email, to FES announce, offering office hours to any student who was interested in working on summer projects with him - I can't think of anyone else at FES who has that much to do, and is yet so ready to engage with students on a one-to-one basis. No fighting over office hours, or limitation of access... I was shocked he knew my name after I spoke to him once. Wow.",
    "More quantitative work would have been useful for those of us who plan to be or work with field foresters.",
    "This is magnify class. A core, basic class recommended to everyone entering in a Forestry School. This class was the one from which I got most exposed to new things. Professor Ashton is remarkable professor and person. Really dedicated and comprehensible in flexing the class to a diverse attendance (from master\/phd to students like me baby on dippers to silvicutlure).I strongly recommend on optional basis that TAs give a weekly session reviewing whatever was taught in class."

    "field trips!",
    "Field trips. Excellent.",
    "The way that Prof. Ashton incorporated a wide range of interests into the subject material, his clear and eloquent lectures, depth and breadth of knowledge, and obvious enjoyment of teaching students made it a pleasure to be in class (even at 8 am).",
    "its broad intellectual reach",
    "Mark Ashton is very engaging as a lecturer. The lectures were well organized and had plenty of concrete information to help solidify the concepts.",

    "The field trips were especially helpful. I learned more in one field trip than in several weeks of classes. Do not miss them!",
    "Great professor, really well organized and well prepared. Good applied focus that integrates ecology and theory with what you really need to know on the ground. Engaging lecture.",
    "Listening to Mark discussing something he's clearly passionate about.",
    "The Professor's presentation style and patience to explain concepts. For me, the course was an entirely new window into ecology.",
    "Field trips",
    "The broad amount of material covered and the focus on New England forests (which is otherwise lacking at FES!).",
    "The material the course covers is, in and of itself, fascinating. In particular, the forest ecology overview that began the class was much appreciated.The opportunity to experience and learn from Mark Ashton's wealth of knowledge.Lots of time in the field where we got to experience the material firsthand and put our observational skills to the test. The exercise where we picked which trees we would thin at Yale Myers was fantastic. More exercises like this where you get to 'test' yourself would be appreciated.It was very nice of Mark and the TAs to provide tea, hot chocolate, and coffee at each class!",
    "Mark. His knowledge, clarity in explanations, and unique perspectives on the material he teaches really makes the students look at something they may have seen a thousand times in a whole new light. He never has anything but time and an open door for students and their endless questions and problems, and probably has converted more FESers to foresters than any other factor at this school. It was my hope in coming to grad school that I would find this kind of an educator- Mark has a real gift for teaching and is one of the things I will miss most about this school.",
    "Field trips and lectures.",
    "The instructor - unmatched dedication to students. When I approached him with a comment or concern, I expected to have to follow up - but magically, Mark took care of everything immediately and without any need for me to do anything! Also, Mark is really exceptionally good at picking what to answer, and where to say, I don't know. Most professors try and muddle through without admitting they don't know - it's very nice to have someone just say, sorry, ask x. I also think it's fantastic that Mark actually WENT to the field trips (unlike many other FES faculty), and came to the final - and brought us pizza! And tea, every class!The field trips, obviously, are a highlight, and I think that it all really comes together during the trips.Hard to believe, but I really enjoyed both midterm and final (and studying for them). Some things that were nebulous or confusing or didn't seem to have any real connection to what I thought I was learning all became very much more clear while preparing for and taking the exams - the kind of questions that make you really think about a problem but leave you some freedom in how you answer them. I think the exams were a great didactic tool, and I only wish we would have had to turn in a problem set or two based on the part III questions of the exams during the semester to force us to get to that state of illumination earlier.",
    "Mark's enthusiasm for the material and breadth of knowledge.",
    "Excellent lectures that were reinforced by field trips...go on the field trips!",
    "learning about silviculture, friends, get exposed to forestry.Professor Ashton.",
    "The field trips were definitely the best part. That is when things really start to make sense.",

    "Better organization within lectures- topics felt all over the place sometimes.",

    "The exams are mostly very good and comprehensive but the multiple choice questions are very random! Little tiny vocab words unrelated to the core components of the course. There was also a lot of quantitative work at the end but no real way to practice--a problem set before the final would have been really helpful to get familiar with the techniques.",

    "Assignments could be more useful; students could be better prepared for exams; TA sessions could be more helpful (rather than Q&A all the time, which assumes a certain level of understanding, tutorial sessions should be tailored specifically to students who are NOT foresters, who might need more help with basics).",
    "Starting the class on time and shortening the length of the break would have been appreciated.Hard to read handwritten comments on exams and papers.The TA run night sessions need to be reconsidered\/revamped.",
    "It would be helpful to have the supplemental field trip information given to us the day before the trip. It would have been good to read much of the information provided to us before we were out in the field.",
    "8 am start...also, I'm sad the first Yale Myers field trip was canceled.",
    "I think everything was well done. My only suggestion is to incorporate more picture examples of all the different treatments throughout the course...",
    "TA review session. The class is taught in a very fast pace. Many topics, many things to cover, therefore it would be helpful to have a weekly session to review the main concepts taught in class.For example: As a foreigner and new to silviculture vocabulary I had problem taking notes, instead of asking my friends to see their notes once in a while, it would be most helpful to have a TA session on a optional basis, which students could go."
