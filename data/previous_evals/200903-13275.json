    "Take spanish. You'll get a better grade.",
    "It's a good class and I suggest taking it if you want to improve your German grammar and speaking skills and have an overall good time doing it.",
    "German 130 was a lot of work and a lot harder than previous German courses. Most of the time the homework was tedious but necessary to learn German. I enjoyed the course, and my language skill has noticeably improved. Reading and writing is emphasized over speaking.",
    "Yes if you want to continue learning German.",
    "Solid class, great teacher.",
    "I would reccommend it for language requirements and to refine your german grammar and reading. There is lots of day to day work but it's worth it to maintain and improve your german skils.",
    "Most people considering this course are either taking it to fulfill a requirement, or to continue learning German of their own volition. Both of these people are forced into taking German 130 when they have reached this level of German understanding. That being said, the grammar and vocabulary are furthered within this class to a point that one can truly feel in control of the German language. The class is painless and interesting at best, at worst it is boring, but one learns all the same. To wrap it up, the course teaches the material in such a way that it is learned efficiently and permanently, while managing to keep German interesting."
