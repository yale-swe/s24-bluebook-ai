    "I gained a broad understanding of the field of algorithmic composition and computer music, and was able to further deepen my knowledge of particular topics that I found interesting thanks to the many projects. The course inspired in me a newfound love for computer music and has prompted me to want to further explore the field.",
    "I learnt to program in SuperCollider. I also learnt about several different algorithms and systems, and how to use them to create music.",
    "I learned how to use SuperCollider.",
    "Learn various computational models and a bit about computer music",
    "I learned the basics for creating computer music using algorithms and different systems. We explored creating music with rules, cellular automata, L-systems, and other algorithms and forms. We learned the foundations of SuperCollider, a domain-specific language used to create music.",
    "The course covers various chaotic algorithmic methods to generate music or music-like noise.",

   "comments": [
    "The course be improved with more course staff, for both teaching and grading. Regular and open office hours would have been extremely helpful. The delay with which we received grades was unacceptable.",
    "The freedom you are given for approaching projects is refreshing. The material is interesting, and the professor is charismatic and entertaining. The in-class coding (which happened only once or twice) was really fun. The classes were often long - the no-laptop policy can make them pretty tedious (although admittedly I did focus much better on the material and learn more). It would have been nice to get more help for final project ideas, and more deadlines would have helped me complete my project earlier. The grading is also incredibly slow, which is not the professors fault (despite his efforts, he was only allocated one grader), but does make it difficult to know how youre doing sometimes. Finally, I tended to put way too much work into projects - its hard to know the expected scope. I learnt a lot that way, but I wouldve preferred to have a better idea of how much I was supposed to do.",
    "The open ended-ness of some of the assignments is definitely a positive. It allows you to be more creative. If you don't have any prior music theory knowledge, however, the learning curve is pretty steep.",
    "The course kinda repeats the same lessons that \"computer music is hard\" over and over again. Adding more computational models that don't translate super well to music seems not very effective.",
    "The content is fascinating, and lectures are pretty good. I feel like each topic was covered in pretty good depth. Our class [of students] wasn't very engaged at all, but I think with a different class personality the lectures would be phenomenal. (It's worth noting that the course requires more music theory experience than you'd think, and you might feel left out of the conversation without a background in music analysis.) On the other hand, the course was somewhat disorganized, making the problem sets tough and useful feedback difficult to find. Also, the class is as much about SuperCollider [a computer music DSL] as anything else, and there's a weird tension between knowing enough SuperCollider to do the assignments and having enough time to discuss more detailed theory.",
    "Strengths: Fun interesting, professor cares a lot Weaknesses: Difficult to learn entire language in one semester"

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone in CS that is interested in exploring creative ways to apply their programming and algorithms skills. Thanks to both the enjoyable professor and fascinating content, I believe the course will go down as my favorite one I take at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this for anyone who is interested in the intersection between music and computer science. Its a great introduction to electronic music (specifically algorithmically-generates music), and although its a tedious class most of the time, its also a great framework for learning about that topic. A lot of its merit is in exposing you to those topics - I would never have thought of learning SuperCollider or using an L-System to create music before this class.",
    "The course has interesting topics and Scott is an enthusiastic teacher. The assignments are not overwhelming and you do get to make a few cool things. Overall, you'll get out what you put into it. People who have already used SuperCollider and understand music theory seem to make cooler projects (I was not one of those people lol, but it was still fun to make projects).",
    "I wouldn't recommend this to another student unless you really like computer music",
    "If you are interested in creating computer music using algorithms or fixed methods, then you should take this class. If you are more interested in how to synthesize music, it would make more sense to take 432. I think I was more interested in synthesizing music, and feel like this class goes more in-depth into methods of generating music based on rules rather than the actual sounds themselves.",
    "The content's awesome, particularly if you're into CS for the beauty of the field. (On the other hand, if you're not so interested in computer science aesthetics and care more about development, business, or other things, this is not the course for you.) Be ready to deal with a bit of disorganization, though. Two pro tips: 1) Sit in front. 2) Scope your projects very carefully.",
    "Yes! Super fun and cool to learn about"
