    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the course. The course is a fair deal of work, but worth the incredible trove of knowledge you garner. I would recommend that undergrads talk to the professors before they turn in papers, however, so that they have a better chance at succeeding.",
    "It is like MB&B301 but less stressful, focuses more on the concepts and how the literature discovered\/supports a given model, and there are discussion papers.",
    "This class dives deep into experimental design for MBB experiments. Only take it if you actually want to do graduate work in biochemistry\/biophysics."
