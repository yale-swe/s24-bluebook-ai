    "Very interesting course on a variety of different themes and subjects. It was hard to see how they all related to the big theme of the course at times but nonetheless it was cool. Not a lot of work. Great credit\/d class because only one paper and a presentation.",
    "Its a fine class, and the lectures are pretty interesting, however I still don't know what it was about. Be prepared to talk about some pretty absurd theory in section",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to people from really any background, but I think it helps if you know which parts relate to your interests and generally how. For architecture majors, I think the course is different from most urban studies electives in an interesting and productive way, and probably provides a kind of counterpoint to some of the more traditional political science and urban studies classes that I've chosen not to take.",
    "This is one of the most interesting classes that Yale College offers. A totally radical take on the biggest influences of our lives--globalization and the way it has turned into infrastructure and system. The class dips into political theory to get some fancy terminology, like scripts, errors, etc., which may be necessary for it to be college-level but which doesn't seem to add to the course. The best part of the class was really the history of it all, and the effect infrastructures from Wal-Mart to oil pipelines have on the world. Take it!",
    "Definitely recommend. Great class, interesting material, teaches you to think differently about the world.",
    "An interesting look at an amorphous group of topics that lies somewhere in the general vicinity of the socio-political aspects of globalization and the ramifications of globalization on politics. Interesting, but apparently a bit hit or miss concerning how much you'll get out of it.",
    "Globalization Space is a survey course into cultural framework behind out built environment. It is a great course with fun readings, and I highly recommend it. The topics are relevant to everyone.",
    "I am not sure that I would recommend this course. On one hand, it is not a large amount of work (readings, a four-minute oral presentation, and a twelve page paper). On the other hand, most of the time I felt very confused by the scattered course material and dense theoretical readings. When it came time to write the paper, I had no idea if what I was interested in was relevant, or what they really wanted. So I guess if you're really interested in the type of theory that Keller does, take it. If not, might want to stay away.",
    "It's an okay class.",
    "Not a lot of work, but I question how much concrete knowledge I got out of it. Easterling is great and what she says will be new and interesting. Almost no architecture is involved, this is very much a global studies\/ poli sci course. Overall worthwhile course because the lecturer is great and the readings are great as well.",
    "Greet course about some fascinating subtleties and duplicities. Keller is WONDERFUL. As with any class, the more you are into it, the more you'll appreciate it. Work is not too bad, but readings can be somewhat dense. I would absolutely recommend."
