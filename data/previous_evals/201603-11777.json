   "comments": [
    "I learned about a few key case studies in masculinity studies that will be useful in considering the issue going forward.",
    "I learned a substantial amount about how important it is to study masculinity. There are many masculinities that exist and are obscured by a hegemonic masculinity, and this course allowed me to see this and interact with my world differently.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this class. Though I've taken several gender and women studies courses, I had never done any type of academic inquiry into the social and cultural influences of masculinities. Read Freud, Halbertam, Butler, and other sex and gender theorists for the first time and applied them to a cultural artifact of my choosing, which I really appreciated.",
    "I developed some critical thinking skills about gender theory, but at the end of the class, I was left more confused about what masculinity is than when we began. I did not feel that this class helped me to answer questions about the definitions of masculinity--while it was a worthwhile exploration of some of the concepts of gender theory, I do not think that I left the class with much insight.",
    "Through this course, I developed the ability to explore the often unmarked category of manhood. In an immediate sense, it gave me tools to assess masculinity that I see around me on the college campus, to analyze its source and impact. It also opened up exploration into nuanced analysis of how manhood influences creation of identity of all genders, and across intersecting categories like race and class.",
    "I developed a stronger grasp and skill in the analysis of the concept of masculinity in society. In a field where most of the focus tends to be put on marginalized groups, it is useful (and I believe necessary) to also try to understand what is thought to be the dominating group against which subjugation occurs, which may not be masculinity, but a specific type of masculinity. Thanks to this class, I have been able to add much needed nuance to the structure and fields of power in manhood and masculinity beyond a superficial view of it as monolithic and universally dominant.",
    "I learned so much in this class. I would say this class gave me a deeper understanding of sex, gender, and evolving masculinities."

   "comments": [
    "I did not love this course. The readings were difficult to understand, and often just not interesting. I did not learn anything from the readings most weeks. I'd rather pay for a course packet of readings or read ethnographies that are good instead of just working through the Masculinity Studies Reader. Discussion a lot of times was not educational. I wonder if having a printed discussion guide with themes and questions on it would inspire more conversation? That has worked in my other classes. I also felt like this was one seminar in particular where people said things to sound impressive rather than to contribute to conversation. I would leave class with no major conclusions or takeaways written in my notes. Also eight responses is a ton. We could have done with fewer.",
    "This course was extremely engaging and classroom discussion were always provocative. Prof. Dowe was an excellent facilitator, but could have been more critical grading (though I appreciated his positive reaction to my work).",
    "This is an amazing class. Professor Dowe is a wonderful instructor who worked very hard to make the class so great. He was very flexible with our research project ideas, so people came up with incredible, unusual ideas. Excellent class with a professor who is sure to become one of Yale's superstars!",
    "Thought this class was well structured. I understand the value of focusing on one primary text, but would have liked to see greater inclusion of texts addressing intersectional non-sex based masculinities.",
    "The biggest weakness of the class is the readings that are selected. Drawn almost exclusively from \"The Masculinity Studies Reader,\" most of the readings were dense, dry, and not particularly engaging. It was extremely difficult to dive into them right away at each meeting when many of them were so difficult to engage with while reading before coming to class. The discussions were student-led which is an asset to the course, but each pair of students structured the discussions differently which made it difficult to know how to prepare for each class. There was sometimes a single guiding question used for the class discussion, but we never knew what direction the discussion would take and it was often difficult to stay engaged. Even though we had project presentations for our final paper as well as in-class workshops, almost no feedback from the professor was given on our ideas despite significant time devoted to the projects in class.",
    "A strength of this course was the well-crafted syllabus and the student role in guiding discussion. I think it really allows students to own the conclusions that they draw from the materials and to challenge others rather than simply parroting material in response to questions. However, I think slightly more guidance from the professor would be helpful - sometimes the conversation derailed slightly and strayed from the main topic in ways that felt unproductive. I think we could have benefitted sometimes with a little more wisdom.",
    "I felt as if there was a good deal of repetition in the readings as we progressed through the course, so by some of the later discussions, we were just rehashing ideas we'd already discussed in earlier classes. The readings were generally pretty interesting, ranging from the more theoretical to ethnographies and more practical research. Class discussions were generally fine, although I do wish that Professor Dowe were a bit more involved. Student led discussions definitely have their strengths and weaknesses, but I felt as if we could have benefited from his insight more, as he generally just spoke at the end. I also felt as if the topics for each week could have been more clearly defined. Sometimes there was an obvious reason why the readings were grouped together, and sometimes it seemed a little more random, which made for somewhat disconnected discussions in class.",
    "The reading material of this course was a great strength. Each article and ethnography we read was more interesting than the last, and our discussions did a good job of tying them together. A weakness of this course may be its teaching of theory. A timeline\/overview of modern gender studies may have been useful."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course unless you need major credit. I don't know what masculinity is or what I learned after having taken the whole course. It also was a lot of work doing eight responses.",
    "Yes, absolutely take this course. It is very important to take at least one gender studies course while at Yale, and this is a great one.",
    "Yes! It was super relevant. I felt like seminar discussion was a space to reflect on the news of the week and talk about pressing modern issues.",
    "Yes, absolutely - the only (tiny) drawback was the 8 reading responses over the semester. But still a truly excellent class.",
    "Yes! I found that the course materials assigned by professor Dowe were often quite interesting, just the right amount of challenging, and highly relevant. The workload is considerable, 8 reading responses about 2 pages each, a class presentation, and a final paper. professor Dowe is often accessible to meet and is happy to address any questions. Students take turns facilitating seminar discussions with a partner.",
    "Yes. I greatly enjoyed this class and it is the only one on campus, that I saw, addressing masculinity specifically.",
    "There are so many great anthro and WGSS seminars, don't waste your time on this one. The readings are bone dry, the class isn't very well-organized, and in the end, you don't even learn that much. The professor is young, so the class may get better in a few years, but in its current state, I would not recommend it now. It's not a ton of work, so if you're looking for a gutty seminar, I guess you could take it, but you might bore yourself to tears first.",
    "Certainly. I think it does the important work of challenging frameworks that are often taken for granted. The weekly writing assignments, while sometimes frustrating, means that students have to form original arguments about each of the pieces and draw connections between them. This is a useful skill and also an effective way of synthesizing the course material.",
    "A fun course, even if you see a bit of repetition in the readings as you go along. Masculinity studies is definitely an understudied area, so it was refreshing to take a course which focuses directly on men instead of referencing them peripherally or only in relation to women as many other WGSS classes have done. Professor Dowe is very kind, and when he does speak in discussions, he usually provides some good insight. There are definitely some more theoretical works in the course, but nothing too intimidating or overwhelming, especially if you have a social science background.",
    "Definitely. The readings are very engaging, and I found myself searching what else the authors had written. I also think the structure of the course added another interesting dimension to the readings. The seminar was purely discussion based, where the professor rarely spoke and groups of students were assigned to guide discussions. Due to this student based structure, there was rarely an authoritative interpretation to appeal to, which made a \"correct\" interpretation more difficult to pin down, and therefore allowed for more freeing and empowered discussion. We found ourselves questioning both what the authors meant, and what was wrong with their argument more often and more explicitly than we would have if the professor had interjected more and guided us into a more narrow take on the readings. I recommend the class because what is encouraged most are ideas to adapt to other situations.",
    "Definitely! The material is so necessary and interesting, and Professor Dowe is the greatest. A true pleasure!"
