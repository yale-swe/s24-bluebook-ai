    "I LOVED THIS CLASS! Professor Gaifman is absolutely fabulous...take this course!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if you are interested in art history or Greek history. This information is important to learn and understand even if you are not an art history person. It is a great class that has changed the way I understand and interpret ancient art. Definitely take this class!",
    "It's all things Greek.",
    "This is a great class! Even if you have never taken an art history class before, I think you will really be able to gain a lot from this class. Professor Gaifman is absolutely wonderful and really a beautiful lecturer. The 75-minute lectures did drag a bit, but then she would bring you back in with an incredible story or presentation of an object. Also, she is always willing to help and make sure that everyone is able to succeed. I think an understanding of Greek Art is so important to understanding art, and this class has more applicability than in just a discussion of art in the ancient world. There are 2 papers, a midterm, and a final. Very doable.",
    "no comment",
    "Great class - don't miss it, no matter what your major!",
    "Greek Art and Architecture is a very good intro art history class. Professor Gaifman is an engaging lecturer and clearly likes the material. The lectures are perhaps a little bit on the long side, even though they are well done. I would recommend the class, especially if one is interested in the material.",
    "Fantastic course where you will actually want to attend every lecture",
    "This course teaches you about the greek culture along with the art and architecture and allows you to analyze and see art in a different way. Yes I would recommend this course to another student because it is very engaging and fun.",
    "Great course. Take it. The material is plentiful and very interesting. Whether you do the readings or not, (you should, it helps) you learn a lot in lecture. Gaifman LOVES the material and you can't help but love it as well. Her enthusiasm is contagious and you become intrigued by the material. The course is organized remarkably well and covers plenty. I would say that the only downfall is the exam; there is a lot of information you have to memorize for it, and it's an overwhelming amount if you're not particularly good at that kind of thing.",
    "Greek art and architecture is a solid art history survey course. We don't go particularly in depth, and the course can be repetitive at times, but overall I think I learned a lot. Milette was amazing and helped make what can be a boring topic to some much more exciting. Standard amount of work, so not too bad.",
    "This course was very enjoyable and not too difficult -- a good way to learn about the basic principles and themes of ancient Greek art and architecture. The structure of the course (two weekly lectures, no section, two papers, a midterm and a final exam) was easy to manage throughout the semester. The final exam gets to be a little difficult because there are so many artifacts to memorize, but all in all it's a very straightforward class.",
    "Definitely! Ancient Greek art and architecture is so integral to the visual aspects of our culture today, and it's something everyone should know about. You won't find anyone better equipped to teach you about it than Professor Gaifman. If you come to class and take good notes, you'll be rewarded with a rich knowledge of a fascinating area of art history. Be warned, though: the tests involve a lot of tedious date memorization.",
