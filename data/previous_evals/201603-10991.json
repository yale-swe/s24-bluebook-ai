   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Knowledge: I learned how inquisitive people (yes, scientists, but others as well) approached learning about natural phenomena from ancient times onward, with specific focus on the the Scientific Revolution in Europe, from roughly 1500-1750. This includes a deeper understanding of where scientific authority has historically resided, a more nuanced perception of prominent figures such as Galileo and Newton, and an appreciation for those who made important contributions to science and yet did not attract as much notoriety. Skills: Sharpened my ability to rethink a narrative that has been ingrained in our society, i.e. one of linear progress. Insights: One insight is that science is often perceived today as something that is antithetical to religion; but historically that has not been the case. Many scientists had deep religious beliefs, and it was often faith that drove their efforts to better understand the world.",
    "I learned about the history of the scientific revolution and the origins of modern science.",
    "I learned that scientific discoveries and progress are not independent events. There is much more intertwinement with current political atmosphere, religious tensions, other major events to consider events, even those as objective as made by science, to be independent.",
    "This course gradually debunked the common myths and misconceptions surrounding the Scientific Revolution. It taught me to look beyond the widely accepted understanding of the period and to piece the \"Revolution\" together for myself, focusing specifically on the individuals and ideas that brought scientific change about.",
    "This course taught me how to look at the advancements of sciences in a new way. I learned how take the advanced sciences and use them to analyze how we use science to talk about the future.",
    "If you have difficulty with analyzing and understanding prime sources, this is the class for you. Professor Bertucci does a great job of actually connecting lectures with the readings, and section is enjoyable. The class has good flow between lectures and you feel like you've really learned something in the end.",
    "This course not only teaches the history of the scientific revolution, but also teaches about the social conditions surrounding discoveries and events. It also developed the skill of writing short historical essays",
    "A lot of knowledge about the Scientific religion, attitudes about progress, the position of the establishment on scientific matters and how scientific institutions developed to the state that they are in today.",
    "I learned a lot about the people and events that made up the Scientific Revolution and gained insight into topics like the relationship between science and religion and past and present.",
    "I re-learned a new perspective on a seemingly static, on-dimensional historical narrative. This class taught me that, as silly as it sounds, history books aren't always right, history is living and breathing and we must dig deeper to reveal its hidden contours. Say goodbye to teleology.",
    "Each student will come away with an understanding of the main figures and trends of the Scientific Revolution. That is to say, each student will learn about both famous and less well-known scientists like Newton, Brahe, and della Porta, while also engaging movements like alchemy and the growing interplay of science-religion-ethics.",
    "I learned about the context of the Scientific Revolution and gained an understanding of how the knowledge of the Scientific Revolution was received. Furthermore, I learned how these contexts shaped the production of knowledge.",
    "I feel like my perspective of the world and history has really expanded because of this course.",
    "I learned to consider how I think and obtain new knowledge, as opposed to just valuing the understanding for the raw facts I obtain.",
    "Throughout this course, I gained knowledge of the basic fasts of the scientific revolution and the skill to examine artifacts in their scientific context.",
    "This course gave me a new and very interesting perspective on the scientific revolution. The most important thing that I took away from the course was that the scientific revolution was not really a revolution but a slow and evolutionary process which required the work of countless people, not just the greats of early science.",
    "This course complicated my view of the Scientific Revolution as well as the early modern period. Prof. Bertucci helped students understand the worldview of the learned and elite of the period through which to better appreciate their actions."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The course is unique in that it gives a more holistic narrative of the Scientific Revolution that what is often taught. What I mean is that Professor Bertucci does not simply discard the stories of approaches to science that we know today to be futile. Instead, she includes them so as to accurately illustrate the different ways people have tried to understand nature since antiquity. Several of the lectures I found to be fantastic, particularly the on demand lecture about the idea of human difference in a scientific context. Weaknesses: The course does move slowly at times, which got in the way of some of some of its brilliant overarching themes. For example, there is a lot on alchemy in the beginning which I felt could have been condensed. It is certainly important for the reason above, i.e. it was a major field for a long time, but I would have liked to have spent less time on its minute details, and more time on big-picture things such the human difference dynamic (again, fantastic), or the interplay between the Church, state and science during Galileos time.",
    "The lecture material is extremely interesting and engaging but some of the readings could have been more engaging and relevant.",
    "This course can appear to be a bit \"floaty\" sometimes and the topics can seem to be irrelevant.",
    "This course was well-organized and engaging, and I truly enjoyed Professor Bertucci's lectures as well as the class visits to the Beinecke, Peabody, and Medical Historical Library. However, the writing assignments were quite unclear, and a more detailed rubric describing the purpose and requirements of the assignments would have been extremely helpful. Also, (and while I understand this is not always possible), a greater variety of section times or TAs would have been helpful, as my athletic competition schedule often conflicted with section and the make-up assignments I completed effectively doubled the required course-load.",
    "I think that this course could be improved with more active learning during lectures. I think that if the lectures were more active and student engaging, they would be easier to follow along.",
    "This course was very well taught. It flowed in a very sensical order, and Professor Bertucci is a very good and passionate lecturer. The papers are short, and are spaced well to avoid conflicting with exams.",
    "This course is very enlightening and Professor Bertucci is kind and knowledgeable. At times, I found the course to be a little bit too theoretical and hard to grasp, even if I knew the concepts weren't particularly difficult. It would be helpful to start with more basic, concrete concepts and build to the more theoretical explanations.",
    "Strength: Well presented A lot of information Weaknesses: Low engagement with Yale collections e.g. Bienecke\/Peabody although a few lectures did happen there.",
    "The lectures were always interesting and beautifully presented\/worded, and Professor Bertucci really made use of all of the resources available at Yale with field trips to some of the libraries and museums on campus. I think the only weaknesses I can think of are that the readings were sometimes difficult to understand. In regards to improvements, although I enjoyed the course the way that it was taught and the tests seemed like they were an appropriate level of difficulty, it might be nice to have a better idea of the expectations for each section (e.g. how detailed ID answers should be) and options (e.g. identify 10\/11 pictures or choose between essay prompts).",
    "The course material is very rich and sometimes certain names or events would be skimmed over while others were given one or two lectures. I'd rather choose carefully a smaller group of people\/events and go into each in depth as opposed to breezing over dozens of seemingly arbitrary men with names I can't remember even weeks after the course. It clutters the course and makes it confusing at times.",
    "The lectures were all very well organized, and Professor Bertucci was clear in all her descriptions and analyses. I also enjoyed the field trips as they made the class feel more alive and the connections to past texts\/individuals more relatable. The outside reading was not as engaging or interesting as I had imagined. All three papers lacked direction and were graded harshly given the lack of guidance we were provided. Similarly, some of the material on the midterm and final was a bit unfair, as the image\/ID was discussed very briefly or the image was not even in the lecture notes. I note these just as possible ways to improve how students feel overall about the class. There was no doubt that the material and teaching were great, but some of the assignments and grading negatively affected the way students felt about the class in general.",
    "A strength of this course is how it covers so many years, mostly following chronology, making it easy to understand how different events were connected. I believe there is room for improvement in how much time is spent on the philosophers, especially Descartes, as his ideas were difficult to grasp. More time could have been spent unpacking what his philosophies were and how they were interpreted.",
    "Lectures were amazing. I found the class trips really fun. I feel like I learned the most from the historical medical library. I really disliked the Beinecke lecture hall. I feel like I didn't learn anything significant from that lecture, although it was amazing to see those artifacts in person, so perhaps if there was another way to see the books that would be great.",
    "Course was fabulous",
    "The strength of the course was in the amount of information it covered and the accessibility of the information. The weakness was the irregularity of work load. Also, it seemed like the professor and the TAs were looking to disprove a specific notion or prove a certain narrative. It would have been better if they were upfront about that.",
    "The strengths of this course are how wonderful Professor Bertucci is, the breadth of the material, and the interesting excursions to Yale Libraries to see primary source material related to our course.",
    "Very interesting material, but sometimes hard to tie it all together.",
    "The trips to the libraries and the Peabody were good because we got to see the books and instruments we talked about in class. Sometimes the lectures were not engaging and offered too much information at once (the Newton lectures as an examples)."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Under certain conditions I would recommend this course: Firstly, if you are strapped for time, this is a good option because there is not much work (3 essays, each no more than 1,000 words, a midterm, and a final). However, do not come into each lecture expecting to be blown away. There are a few great lectures along the way, but the payoff is really at the end when you have a better sense of how it all fits together. Therefore, if you are willing to do a bit more work, and want something that is fascinating day in and day out, I would look elsewhere. But if you are looking for something low-key (readings are really only necessary for section discussions, so you can skim them or even not read and be fine) and can stand a bit of boredom on the way to some worthwhile takeaways, go for it.",
    "Great class to take, especially if you're a STEM major. Really gives you valuable insights about the origins of modern science and the evolution of knowledge.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Bertucci is an excellent lecturer and is quite knowledgable on the subject. Her lectures gradually linked the broader themes of the Scientific Revolution, and she made sure to highlight the smaller more interesting details that are typically overlooked. The class trips to the Beinecke, Medical Historical Library, and Peabody were also wonderful additions to the course.",
    "Absolutely! I think you really do get out of it what you put in, however, so if you don't do the readings and attend lectures you obviously aren't going to have the same takeaway as I did. But if you really engage--an awesome class!",
    "I would recommend this course. Professor Bertucci is a great and passionate lecturer and the content has a clear and logical order. It's not too difficult in terms of workload, but it is consistently interesting if you have any interest in the history of science.",
    "Overall, this course is pretty interesting and you will gain lots of insight into the history of \"science\", and how people have thought in relation to the collection and accumulation of knowledge. Some specific concepts\/lectures are hard to grasp in a concrete sense. It's different from other history classes at Yale in that it's more a history of what\/how people thought, instead of things that happened and why.",
    "Yes. The lectures are well presented and the readings are very interesting and enlightening.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is truly one of the most fascinating courses I have taken at Yale. Every lecture contains new and exciting material, and Professor Bertucci is an excellent lecturer. The workload is relatively easy: two 500-word essays, one 1000-word essay, two tests, and a presentation in section (in addition to weekly readings). To top it all off, this course makes excellent use of Yale's resources, and you get to see\/touch some really cool stuff like old microscopes and works by Galileo, Copernicus, etc.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants context on the time period. It illuminated a lot of non-scientific events involving politics, religion, economics which were affected in tandem. Also, it provides a new perspective with new elements that you probably didn't learn in your high school history course.",
    "I would recommend this class because the material and professor are very engaging - though I would hope that the assignments become clearer in the future.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot in this course and enjoyed the material. I thought the lectures were structured in a way that made sense when considering the main themes of the course.",
    "This course is incredible. The assignments are very fair, and the readings are not too challenging. Lectures are very enjoyable, and you definitely learn so much about scientific history that is often omitted in traditional stories about famous scientists. This is the most accommodating course I have ever taken.",
    "Yes I would",
    "Yes, but be warned of sometimes heavy, non-engaging reading",
    "Yes. It was a good HSHM course and I thoroughly enjoyed lectures. Would have liked to see more emphasis on alchemy and the \"occult\" sciences, but for an overview of the Scientific Revolution (1450-1800) this was definitely a great course.",
    "This is a very interesting course if you want to learn about the early part of modern science. Professor Bertucci is a very good lecturer. The lectures are interesting and always add a new twist to the standard story of the scientific revolution.",
    "Yes, decently fun course with a science twist",
    "Yes, this is one of the few courses I've taken that kind of captured my imagination and wormed its way into my thoughts.",
    "It's an easy enough class. That being said, you need to put it in some work to get an A. The material started out really interesting (alchemy and ancient natural magic) and then got a bit dull for me (philosophy and scientific institutions). You can get away with skimming the readings but I recommend going to the lectures (no matter how boring) because that's where all of the information for the tests comes from.",
    "Although the subject matter was interesting, the grading was highly arbitrary. We received very little information about essay prompts and exam format. The long essay was harshly graded due to expectations the students were not made aware of. I would not recommend the course."
