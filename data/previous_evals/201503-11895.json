   "comments": [
    "It's called a play a day for a reason, so if you feel weird about spending one day on Waiting for Godot and one day on Oedipus Rex, pick a different course. I'm an English major, and I took this class because I felt like I lacked a lot of the literary background of a lot of other English students. Conversations were always fun and interesting even though were moved rapidly through the plays, so I always felt like I got something out of it. Definitely don't skip the readings-- it's a lot, but it's totally manageable and you're just wasting your time if you don't do them. The papers are graded fairly and it's overall not a ton of work in spite of the reading load.",
    "Yeah, it's a \"great books\" course, but they're actually not the insufferably stuffy tragedies that I'd thought they might be (gotta get that WR credit somehow, but this isn't a huge sacrifice like it could have been). You read a lot of material, and the discussions are incredibly insightful, so you come out of the class feeling like you've really gained something. And the value of a small class or seminar cannot be understated your freshman year. If you're choosing between sections like I was, Robinson is probably your best bet. He's really got this stuff down, and he creates a comfortable but intellectual environment. This was a class that was really worth it. And the workload eases up after The Iliad, so don't let shopping period fool you.",
    "Yes. It is a very good course in all regards.",
    "A course I always looked forward to taking. The reading list is long and daunting, so make sure you really WANT to read the books before you start. That said, there's something in that list for just about everyone, and professor Robinson is the bomb.",
    "I would recommend this class to students looking for a crash course in great European literature from all time periods. It is definitely a lot of reading and not worth taking if you don't think you can do the work. Also, since the course covers almost a book per class, the discussions can be somewhat limited and superficial with so little time spent on each text. However, the class is still really interesting and Prof. Robinson is a very considerate professor.",
    "A play a day, but plays worth reading.",
    "If you're planning on being a literature major, this course is a must. It covers a few classics that everyone read in high school (Hamlet, the Oedipus plays, &c.) but also goes over some more collegiate works. Even if you're not thinking of taking a literature route, this class is a great way to fulfill a writing requirement. The essays are easy and fun, the books are all legitimately compelling reads, and the seminar setting of the class is something that I and my classmates actually looked forward to every day. It's not a \"must-take\" class, but I highly recommend it.",
    "A \"Great Books\" course in the format of a small seminar, focusing specifically on plays. Extremely valuable foundation for those who made the choice not to do Directed Studies.",
    "A good amount of reading, but if you enjoy plays and want to read some of the greatest plays ever written and have stimulating discussions on them, take this class!"
