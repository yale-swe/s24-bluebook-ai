    "If you want to understand the relationship between South Korea and North Korea, and how the US impacts that relation, take the class!",
    "Since Prof. Cho is leaving Yale, this class won't be offered anymore.",
    "This has been my favorite class this semester. I learned so much about the political situation occurring in the Korean peninsula. I would highly encourage everyone with an interest in East Asian politics to take it. Professor Cho is extremely knowledgeable and willing to help and answer any questions students have. Moreover, I think this class covered a lot of material on different topics, but also allowed us the freedom to go more in depth with one in the final paper. I really loved this class. One way it might have been improved was more discussions. Many classes felt more like a lecture than a seminar- but I actually liked that in the end because I think I got more out of the professor sharing his insights.",
    "Not the best course you'll ever run across but it's not terrible either. Fairly low work, but the Monday 9am time was killer this year. The format is half discussion-half lecture, with the first couple weeks of class lecture and the rest discussion. Professor Cho is very sweet but he can ramble sometimes, though he is very knowledgable on the subject. If you want a fairly easy credit and learn quite a bit of knowledge about Korea, take this course. However, it is a very specific topic so it might not be for everyone.",
    "Good readings, nice balance between lecture and discussion. Professor Cho is really very nice.",
    "Yeah I would, but not as the best EPE\/PoliSci has to offer or anything. It's really interesting material, and Cho is nice, but it was more of a lecture than a seminar. Cho talked for most of class time, and though you learned a lot, it wasn't too intellectually challenging. Sometimes that's what you want though. It made for a chill environment, and the readings are manageable, and having a take-home option instead of a final paper was incredible.",
    "I would highly recommend it to anyone - as someone who didn't know a lot about Korea, feel like I really took a lot out of this course. You will do a lot of learning from the reading, so be prepared to do some work.",
    "Awesome class on Korea. Only criticism: it's more of a lecture and less a seminar. Set ur expectation accordingly",
    "I recommend if you are interested in Korea."
