    "Fantastic course overall! We started the semester with a list of specific AEA rules to cover, but then kind of just went through the book point by point - it feels like there may be big later sections we didn't hit because we focused on the first quarter so heavily. Would it be possible to cherrypick sections throughout the contract? It would also be great to hit on other unions besides AEA if possible.",
    "Harry's class could probably be two or three workshops. But a class is a bit much. There's a lot of material, but he doesn't really put much of it to use."
