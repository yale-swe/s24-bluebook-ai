   "comments": [
    "I recommend taking this course if you have some background in bioethics and are interested in learning non-American systems.",
    "YES. very interesting. Don't miss the lectures and do all the readings carefully. Then you'll learn a LOT.",
    "International and comparative bioethics is an excellent course. Since all the other bioethics course offered at Yale are American bioethics, it was great to have an international bioethics course. The strength of the course is Professor Latham--he is an excellent lecturer and you come out of each lecture truly engaged with the material. Since it was the first year that this course was offered, some of the topics discussed in class had less comparative\/international aspects and there was little variety in the countries that we used for comparison (very Europe based). Professor Latham mentioned he would work on improving this in the future so definitely take this course if you want an international perspective on bioethics. Professor Latham really breaks down the important concepts of each bioethics issue in his lecture (which is extremely helpful when writing the papers) so make sure to go to lecture.",
    "Survey of comparative health\/bioethics law which meant that you touched on a lot of different countries but couldn't really get into the meat of the issues.",
    "Absolutely! I took this course on a whim and am so glad I did! Not too much work, and fascinating material. More like a comparative law course than a traditional bioethics course, however.",
    "It was an interesting look at various bioethical issues from around the world, both how the countries functioned legally and the social context for such laws. I would definitely recommend it to another student, even if they aren't particularly interested in bioethics, because they are the type of issues that affect all people.",
    "Great introduction to international laws and policies on bioethical issues. Read the syllabus for exact topics but ranges from organ transplant to access to reproductive technology.",
    "You will not debate bioethics in this class. This class focuses primarily on policy comparison and less on policy analysis. If you want a snapshot of how other countries do bioethics, then this class gives you that. Lecture was pretty boring though because it was just going through different policies and skipping over the juicy parts.",
    "I really didn't like this text. Some of the articles were interesting, and I enjoy reading cases, but the Notes on the classes or articles were never helpful and I was often very confused.",
    "Awesome! Wonderful class with a wonderful TA. Latham and bioethics are great!!!",
    "Interesting course covering most major modern bioethical issues. Heavy focus on US\/Western Europe, although he may be changing that. Papers are easy to conceive of and research, but style of writing takes getting used to. Class discussions are pretty interesting, almost like a seminar. Take it!",
    "This is a really interesting class. Definitely take it if you are interested in international law or bioethics. It could be taken as a fifth class because the workload isn't substantial (readings each week and 2 papers over the course of the semester). Make sure the papers are good because they are worth 40% and 60% of the grade respectively but the material is really interesting so it's not difficult to write the papers and there is lots of info available on the topics.I would recommend this class. Professor Latham is great and the class was really engaging and informative.",
    "This class is a great way to explore bioethics issues in different parts of the globe. You learn about other countries policies and regulations. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in health policy!",
    "It is a fine course and Stephen Latham is a great lecturer. If you arent as concerned about the international aspect and are just looking for a bioethics course, Latham's course Bioethics and the Law is offered in the Spring and is much better.",
    "A solid bioethics course. You discuss most of the major topics briefly. Lectures absolutely not required if, like this semester, there are no exams. (The papers were do-able.) Beware that there will be a significant amount of repeat if you've already taken Prof Latham's other course, though he said he'd try to fix this in future - just read the syllabus carefully. He's a great professor, just sometimes dumbs things down a bit too much.",
    "Yes! Very interesting. It's pretty self-explanatory, though. If you are interested in comparative law and\/or bioethics, take it. You'll love the readings and the papers are interesting too. No exams either!",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - great overview that really opens your eyes to where the US is not doing well (health care systems and organ transplantation, for example)"
