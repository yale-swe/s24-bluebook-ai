    "Take it if you want to actually learn what econometrics *is*.",
    "Economics 551 is a great class for learning the kind of econometrics that you need to know to do applied work in economics. I would recommend this class to students from a wide range of disciplines.",
    "This course summarizes the statistical methods needed for economics research. While it focuses on methods important for economics, it will be useful for all social sciences.",
    "I would recommend this, but obviously most people taking it have to anyway. Just please ask for a better TA.",
    "you should definitely take this course (compared to metrics 3) if you intend to do any sort of applied work and aren't already really comfortable with metrics.",
    "Yes, very helpful for empirical research.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. It was a very useful survey of econometric techniques.",
    "Good mix of theoretical and practical applications.",
    "If you want to do empirical economics research, this course should be on your list.",
    "This is a must-take class for economics students as well as students in other disciplines who want to be familiar with quantitative methods.",
    "Yes. I will highly recommend the course. The materials are very relavent to the research and current.",
    "It covers several topic in econometrics in a good deal of depth, and balances theory and applicability of the topics covered extremely well.I would recommend it highly to another student interested in econometrics at a graduate level.",
    "The is a practical course that gives good background on applying econometric theory to data sets. I would recommend the course because it is important to understanding different ways of analyzing data.",
    "Yes if you have not take any Econometrics course before.",
    "Again, this depends on the level of the student I address. If he\/she knows basics of econometrics I'd not recommend a lot. Nevertheless, it can still be helpful for understanding the theory behind the topics and do some intermediate applied work..",
    "I would recommend it to any economics student, as it is very useful for doing any sort of applied work.",
    "I recommend the course based on the practical and technical skills I've gained and the theoretical background I can now use to analyze papers. I think the methods I learned are critical to doing good empirical research.",
    "I would recommend 551 to a student looking for a better exposure to current methods in Econometrics."

    "This course greatly improved my knowledge of econometrics, which will be very important in my own research.",
    "This course will make a great contribution for my research as I'm planningto work on empirical studies. Frankly, it has already started contributing to my research by helping to form my proposed summer research.",
    "I think it helped me learn the methods of econometerics.",
    "It introduced me to new regression tactics and helped solidify existing knowledge of them.",
    "Undoubtedly deepened my knowledge of econometrics. I am much better able to read empirical papers and understand the methodologies used.",
    "I feel much more secure in reading works in the field that use statistical tools beyond basic OLS."
