   "comments": [
    "Spanish 224 is a great opportunity to improve your Spanish and learn about Latin American politics (especially current issues in a handful of countries, like Bolivia, Venezuela, and Cuba). Despite the course title, you won't learn too much about the media, although you will learn a little about US relations with some Latin American countries. Professor Carballal is generally engaging, thoughtful, and warm, and the course is interesting without being too challenging. I definitely recommend this course to those interested in learning how to discuss international politics in Spanish -- although realize that the course will not provide an incredibly in-depth look at complex political issues (if that's what you're looking for, you might be better off taking a poli sci course).",
    "This course looked at the general concepts of politics in Latin America. We started off with some theories about the region in its entirety, and then started focusing on certain countries and certain leaders. There was reading each week, which was not too long but took a while. The papers were about topics of your choice, so you really could write about whatever interested you the most. I would recommend this course if you have solid conversational Spanish abilities and are interested in politics, because that is really all that we talked about. If not, I would look into another L5 Spanish course.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "This course is great to take if you're interested in learning about Latin American politics, especially from a perspective that is not totally expected if you've lived in the USA your entire life.",
    "Especially if you are interested in political science and international relations, or are unfamiliar with Latin American history, I would highly recommend taking this course. The seminar format is excellent and very well-suited to the subject matter, the teacher is great, and I guarantee that you will get something out of taking it. The workload is rather difficult, and a degree of high fluency is required, but if you feel you are up to it, it is a highly rewarding class.",
    "This was an excellent class\u0097both in terms of helping me improve my level of Spanish conversation and reading and writing, and also in teaching me a tremendous amount about the history and political cultures of particular countries in Latin America and across the region generally. The readings could have been a little less theoretical at times, but as it was, the class was fantastic.",
    "I recommend this course very highly, but make sure you know what you are getting into when you enroll. The level of spanish in this course ended up being much higher than I had anticipated in shopping period, and I wish I would have taken it next term after having taken a lower level course.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone on an advanced but not quite fluent level with Spanish who aims to take a (Poli Sci) class taught in Spanish as opposed to a more \"traditional\" L1-4 model language instruction class. This class may not be ideal for someone who still has a lot of basic Spanish grammar to learn."
