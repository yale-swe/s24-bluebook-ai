   "comments": [
    "Not only did I attain a vast and all-encompassing knowledge of musical theatre from its genesis to current day, but I also learned how to critically view the theatrical narrative with greater precision.",
    "Wow. I learned so much about american musical theater history - from musical analysis to observing larger trends.",
    "I came into the course with a solid knowledge of musical theater, but the course gave me a significantly deeper knowledge of the art form and understanding of the historical\/cultural context surrounding it, in addition to the skills to think about and discuss trends in the American musical theater in a critical academic setting. The reading and writing-heavy aspect allowed me to develop the skills to write about theater, especially the technical musical aspects that I didn't initially grasp as easily. I also developed the ability to hone my points and contributions in class to accommodate the fast-paced nature of class discussion.",
    "Developed a working knowledge of AMT within a short semester as well as provided with interesting perspectives of different vantage points for the material.",
    "I learned how to analyze the evolution of American Musical Theater as a genre over time through changes in music, writing-style, content, etc. One of the most valuable things I learned in this course was how to use a basic understanding of music and music theory to enhance my analysis of musical theater (and more broadly, works that use music as a central element). I also learned how to assess the validity and strength of arguments made by various scholars re: American musical theater. Dan does not expect us to hold the ideas put forth in every book\/article as sacred. Instead, one of the real skills he pushed us to develop was our own theoretical understanding of musical theater and to apply that to the various authors we read.",
    "This class is extraordinary. I had the opportunity to develop so many different realms and intersections of critical thinking and analysis - historical, musical, stagecraft -- this is exactly what I've always wanted a Yale class to be, and I'm so grateful for it.",
    "Dan Egan's course on American Musical Theater history helped me to develop an academic lens and language through which to discuss my favorite topic in the world. Dan Egan encourages each person to find their unique angle into the topic, i.e. composition, business, acting, but to also seriously undertake comprehension of all the realms of musical-theater. Dan Egan encourages in depth reading of various types of texts, including magazine articles, coffee table books, scholarly analyses, and musical-theater librettos.",
    "This course gave me the tools and skills to analyze and appreciate American musical theater, an art form which I previously generally enjoyed at face value. The class gave me a working knowledge of the musical theater classics, as well as their production histories, which is incredibly helpful as someone who is looking to enter the theater industry. Additionally, I gleamed an understanding of how an analysis of music informs story and character within a show. Finally, this class allowed me to consider the economics of productions, which gave the class an incredibly relevant and practical application.",
    "This course helped me learn how to better approach a piece of music or theater and discuss it academically rather than simply how much I enjoyed a certain aspect of it. The course also pushed me to get better at speaking on the fly, on keeping pace with rapidly changing conversations.",
    "I learned how to apply academic frameworks and analysis to a genre of art that I have always love. The course provided me with new access points for understanding musical theater, and gave me the tools to put musical theater into the context of American history as well. I appreciated learning to analyze music and scores as well."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths lie almost entirely in Professor Egan's incredible wealth of knowledge of the subject material and his ability to inspire discussion throughout the entirety of class.",
    "Strengths was that it covered and explored a large amount of material. Also professor tailors and spins the lecture to fit the class discussion. Weakness is that we often did not get to all the material.",
    "Strengths: Dan is an amazing professor, who does a really excellent job of curating the arc of the course. The weeks build on each other in a really helpful way, and every class discussion was focused enough that we developed the foundational understanding we needed to have as the term progressed. This course also allows for students to access the material in a variety of ways, depending on their background. At the same time, Dan does a great job of pushing everyone outside of their comfort zone in terms of academic background and how we think about\/talk about musical theater. This course also adds important value to the Theater Studies curriculum, as there are very few courses that delve this deeply into musical theater. Weaknesses: I wonder if there is a way to allow for greater discussion of how musical theater has interacted with other theatrical genres over time. What does musical theater have that, for example, straight plays don't? What does musical theater lack in relation to straight plays and other forms? Etc.",
    "This class is amazing - everything strikes me as a strength, frankly, and I struggle to see particular weaknesses - other than that we don't have more time to cover even more!",
    "This course is extremely powerful in that it is well curated. Dan Egan crafts each class with devotion and meticulous care. He harkens to the magic of the theatrical form in his readiness and pizazz. Still, the course remains free flowing. He still allows students to contribute frequently and considers even the most abstract approaches. Dan is also extremely helpful when it comes to papers. He keeps his students on their game, and challenges them to write authentically and professionally.",
    "What I particularly enjoyed about this class was its hybrid seminar\/lecture format. I continually appreciated how the class kept moving and never dragged specifically because we were never sidetracked. The only weakness (per se) of the class is that we often would have to table certain discussions because we had so much to cover by the end of class.",
    "For the most part, I though the course was very strong. There was a lot of reading that at times felt onerous, but were still very relevant to the course. I also appreciated that we discussed a wide range of musicals, from very well known shows to the more obscure. It did help to have a background in music theory and prior knowledge of musicals, though, if you wanted to be able to keep up with everyone in the room.",
    "Although it was a survey course, on occasion I would have liked to have had a slightly deeper dive into some of the musicals on the syllabus. Overall, I liked the combined listening and reading assignments on the syllabus, and Dan structured each seminar incredibly well. Discussion were productive and engaging."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely.",
    "Take it if you can. I'm an applied math\/CS major with no background in analyzing musicals or thinking about them in an academic context, and at first it was a bit intimidating to see how much stuff everyone knew already, but if you do the readings and listen to all the things Dan tells you to, it totally levels out the playing field. It was a super super great experience.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course, regardless of theatre background. If you have any interest in musical theater and the discussion of it in an academic\/cultural framework, definitely take this course. The course has you listen to a wide variety of scores, read\/discuss diverse scholarly perspectives, and write analytical\/editorial papers that ask you to approach the academic study with your own unique perspective and sense of this dynamic art form. The workload is manageable, and Dan is an amazing professor.",
    "Absolutely, if you have any interest in AMT then you should try to take the class. Dan is a great professor.",
    "Yes, I would strongly recommend American Musical Theater History to other students. Dan is an amazing professor, and he will make you a better thinker and writer, regardless of your skill level coming into the course.",
    "Absolutely. This is everything a Yale class should be and more.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in American history, arts culture, or musical-theater. I think this is a really beautifully curated and intellectually stimulating course that made my semester a happier and more challenging one. I think this course is essential to any intelligent musical theater performer's growth.",
    "Definitely! If you love musical theater, (or even if you dont!), this class is a must. The assignments are reasonable (3 papers), the weekly listening assignments\/readings are a pleasure, and class is a joy to be in from the first minute to the last. Dan Egan is an enthusiastic and engaged professor who makes each class a blast.",
    "This is a great course. It's challenging, engaging, and gives you a good sense of the history of musical theater and how it develops and responds to the rest of history. There is a fair bit of reading and you really need to do all the homework every week. You will get out as much as you put in for this course. It definitely helps to have a background in musical theater and music theory for some of the lectures, but if you ever need help, Dan Egan is one of the most kind, patient, and wonderful professors you could ever hope to have.",
    "Absolutely! Each week this class brought me so much happiness. It's really fun to listen to musicals each week, and then analyze them in class and understand them in entirely new ways. Dan is an incredible teacher and so generous. He really encouraged us to take risks in our written work and provides comprehensive feedback. It's been one of my favorite classes at Yale."
