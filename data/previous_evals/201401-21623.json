    "The best part of 491 is having the opportunity to sit down every week to brainstorm, update each other, and share ideas. Having this forum to support each other as we put up our senior project shows (and even prepare for future, post-grad theater work) has been terrific - and our class is full of wonderful people doing exciting things in Theater Studies, so it's been very cool to hear all about their projects. Dominika and Nathan set a great tone for the class, and it's been amazing to work with and learn from them. I also really enjoyed studying Peter Brook, whose work I hadn't previously encountered. Another way 491 has been very helpful is that, throughout the semester, we've been compiling information (about ourselves and our projects) into portfolios that will serve us well moving forward in the theater world. Throughout the (demanding and rewarding!) process of working on our senior project production this semester, it's been great to have time set aside each week to touch base with other THST majors, share ideas and provide feedback to make each other's work better.",
    "Well, you have to take it. Try to get out of it what you can. I found the design presentations to be the most interesting part of the class, and good practice for trying to express your artistic ideas to other people. Other than that, I think it was largely a waste of time. You spend a lot of time on assignments without getting feedback or grades on any of them, culminating in a large portfolio, on which you also get no feedback after submission, and the class review of your project will only involve as much feedback as your classmates feel comfortable saying to your face. If you are interested in going into theater as a professional, you will find some of the assignments useful to have been forced to write, like short bios or resumes, although, again, these will not be reviewed in any discernable way. There are many things that I think could improve the class, so hopefully in the future it will undergo some significant changes to make it genuinely helpful for THST majors."
