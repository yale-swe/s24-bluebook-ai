    "Do you want to learn about the origins of EVERYTHING (or rather, 10^-43 seconds after the origin of everything until now)? Then take this class! I was seriously surprised by how much I enjoyed this class. I came expecting a boring but easy credit, but instead got an INCREDIBLY INTERESTING (and also easy) class. Professor van den Bosch is the perfect professor for this course; he explains weird, complicated stuff in a fun and engaging way without resorting to heavy math. I almost always left class marveling at the wonders of the universe. If you need a science or QR credit or just need a credit for graduation like I did, this is a good class to consider.",
    "take this class if you want to learn more about cosmology. Some of the concepts are really tough to grasp, but the professor makes things interesting",
    "If you're into astronomy. I thought I'd try it out, and it was a rough class for me, especially having never taken physics. Kinda cool sometimes.",
    "This is a good class for science-haters. The professor is engaging and will give his all to help you understand incredibly complex principles behind the formation and structure of the universe. At times the lecture style can be a bit boring--huge power points, peppered with the hilarious professor van den Bosch's jokes--and you might feel frustrated by the (admittedly necessary) lack of depth employed in favor of quantity of material. The problem sets were easy as long as you put in the time, a lot of people got low grades because they failed to put in the effort. Not a huge time commitment at all, and, if you're looking for a fairly easy Sc credit, I think this is an informative and useful course.",
    "Sure!",
    "Fairly good\/interesting science credit. It can't be totally blown off, though--the exams and psets take some work.",
    "This class is awesome as long as you have my boy Frank. He's freaking hilarious, the class isn't difficult, and the material is actually interesting",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The material is very interesting, and Professor van den Bosch presents it in a very clear and engaging way. He is always happy to answer questions, and provides an extremely honest picture of both the pros and cons of modern comsological theories.",
    "Cosmology is not actually a gut. The problem sets are tricksy and the average on the midterm was a 70%. That said, getting an A\/A- is extremely doable if you are willing to put in the work. Plus some of the stuff we learned was neat, if you're into that kind of thing.",
    "A great thing is that he puts up every single thing on the slides, so if you have to miss a class then you won't fall behind too much. Not the easiest QR out there, but pretty interesting overall.",
    "Cosmology was a really great class and I'm so glad I took it. The problem sets are quite difficult but if you can find a group of students in class to work with they are much more bearable. Professor van den Bosch is a really talented professor. His passion makes every lecture interesting even when the topics get very involved. You will have a vast knowledge of the universe and how it works by the end of the semester.",
    "A not-too-strenuous but still engaging and interesting science course that actually covers very fascinating and relatively uncommon material. You get enough of the Planets and Stars overview of astronomy, but also a lot of other cool stuff about the bigger questions. It's a perfect way to learn something completely new about science and the universe, especially for non-science people. I highly recommend it!",
    "This was an interesting and well taught course on the Cosmology of the universe. The professor's energy and deep knowledge of the subject were the highlights of the course. The material is something most people have heard of (Big Bang, Special Relativity, Black Holes) but know little about. The course is taught for a fairly basic math level but you should be comfortable with long answer physics problems (beware!).The course goes over some great Ancient Greek cosmology and Scientific Revolution material, making it a good science course for Philosophy \/ Humanities students.",
    "The course is interesting if you want to learn the details of the Big Bang and you're willing to memorize a lot of material for the exam. There isn't a lot of work (only 5 psets in the whole semester) but in order to understand the math you really need to go to the sections because no math is taught during lecture. Frank is a very funny professor and his sense of humor keeps lectures interesting. He's probably the best part of this course and he makes very complicated topics of Quantum Theory much more relevant and understandable.",
    "Some surprisingly difficult physics, however, if well prepared for the class, it should be not too hard. I recommend it wholeheartedly as long as prospective students are interested in the universe and are strong in physics\/math.",
    "The course covers basic astronomical concepts, some more in-depth than others. It is very easy to follow and it definitely deserves recommendation to other students. I was thoroughly intrigued and the course was very straightforward.",
    "Great class, tons of interesting material, more students should definitely take it.",
    "If you have previous knowledge in astronomy, you might not find this course informative. Five psets, a midterm and a final are pretty manageable. Definitely not a gut but worth taking because Prof. van den Bosch is really cool.",
    "Astro 170 is a really interesting (although also challenging) class. I definitely recommend it. Lecture is a pleasure, because van den Bosch is fabulous, his slides are entertaining, and his lectures are well structured. Section was useless, but that depends on your TF. If your section sucks, go to van den Bosch's office hours, I think they're super helpful.The material is really fascinating if you're at all interested in how the universe functions. The main challenge, for me, was grasping how to do the psets. If you can deal with that, you're golden. I think that interesting material and good professors are the most important parts of a class, so I highly recommend this.5 Psets, 1 midterm, 1 final. Definitely manageable if you put in the time for the psets and the studying for the exams.",
    "A survey of cosmology, from the ideas of the ancient Greeks up through the pillars of modern Big Bang cosmology: dark energy, dark matter, and inflation. I recommend this course to anyone who wonders about the stars or the Universe. Workload consists of 5 problem sets, one due every other week. An enlightening and low stress intro course.",
    "This is course is fantastic, you ll learn so much ion such a short time it's amazing!",
    "take it if you're not afraid of math and converting between units of measurement. material is interesting, but if you're scared of numbers, it will make the class a difficult experience. the math doesn't get complicated in terms of numerical calculation, but it takes a lot of creativity. people skipped lecture a lot, but i wouldn't recommend doing that because a lot of conceptual things get covered in lecture that aren't emphasized in the slides. however, missing one lecture here or there won't hurt because he always repeats the end of the previous lecture at the beginning of the next lecture. since there's 1 problem set every 2 weeks, it's a good 5th class for a SC credit if you're majoring in something quantitative already. this class is a gut most of the time, except you should actually study a lot for the midterm and final.",
    "AMAZING LECTURE!! Professor van den Bosch knows everything about astronomy. You really do learn about the coolest, trippiest things in astro-physics. The universe is a pretty crazy place and learning about it is awesome. I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE UNIVERSE.A LOT.I know enough to explain the basic concepts behind general relativity, special relativity, black holes, the big bang, star formation, inflation and the higgs field.I left that lecture everyday questioning the universe.Downsides- it does go really pretty fast. As far as science for non-science majors go, it's pretty hard, and you will spend a long time on the psets. If you get a good study group you'll be fineOverall- TAKE IT.",
    "ASTR 170 is a good SC or QR credit for a non-science major who has a good background in high school math and physics. Be prepared to spend 5-6 hours on each of the5 problem sets.",
    "I would, it is a great course period. It is difficult and it has definately stressed me out far beyond the normal relm of classes but I have walked away with a greater understanding of just about everything. This course really has made me appreciate the world more.",
    "Take this! I went in looking for an easy science credit, and found an exciting course chock full of new information and intriguing concepts. It was very refreshing to take a course that was so conceptual and mathematically based, yet one that was not that difficult at all! No calculus required -- take it if you enjoyed physics or math even a little bit in high school.",
    "In the first dew lectures, this class will look like the guttiest gut that ever gutted. That isn't entirely accurate - it certainly is a fairly easy class,and the first few lectures cover very, very basic material. That said, the later lectures especially are interesting and take a fair amount of thinking. A good science class for non-science majors looking not to overload their schedule."
