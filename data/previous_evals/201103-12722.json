    "Workload:-one paper (10 pages, pretty open as far as topics go, and no secondary sources required)-two \"one-hour tests\" (basically a short mid-term and a short final)It's pretty chill. Listen to your friends (who are much wiser than you)and take good notes. Just go to class, take good notes, and complete the paper and tests. You will be fine.GH-10 forever...",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. If you want an introductory course, and some survey information into Jewish history, this is the course you want to take. It gives you a nice overview, and the material isn't difficult to follow at all. A definite recommend.",
    "I would recommend it other students.",
    "An engaging lecture course on an interesting topic. It teaches about the roots of all three Abrahamic religions.",
    "Good class for the major. Way less work than most classes. Nicely inflated grade as well.",
    "This class is great for people who don't like to do a lot of reading. The entire grade in the course is based on a 1-hour midterm, a 1-hour final, and a 10 page paper. The midterm and the final basically all come from class lectures (you can consult the readings if you want, but it's not necessary). So all you really ever need to do is just come to class and take notes. The 10 page paper is pretty easy and the tests are pretty easy too, provided that you've been coming to class. Also, of those three things, he bumps up the lowest one by a full letter grade, so it's not very hard to get an A.",
    "This course is a good introduction to the early history of the Jews, and while it may be more difficult, it is accessible to those with little or no knowledge of the subject. I would recommend it to another student if he or she wants a solid overview of early Jewish History.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It gives a good survey of the history of the Jews. The course load is not too bad at all. If you take it make sure to attend the lectures. The course has a lot of reading but if you attend the lectures and not sleep through them then you can still do fine without doing the entire reading.",
    "You don't have to do reading, you basically only have to go to class every day and take good notes. There are two tests and a paper, and the lowest grade gets raised a full letter grade. It's a pretty good deal, but be careful on the tests because he can get tricky with the IDs.",
    "Take it only if you don't know the history of Jews from Ancient to Early Modern and want to know about it."
