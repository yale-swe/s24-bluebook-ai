   "comments": [
    "Definitely take it. It's a fantastic course that utilizes visual images to complement the usual historical approaches. Professor Faragher is a wonderful lecturer. Also, try to get Andrew's section--it's awesome!",
    "Absolutely, for history and non history majors alike!",
    "This course teaches about Western history in a somewhat abstract sense, meaning that it's more about the frontier than about any particular region called \"the West.\" It starts with the explorers and conquistadores in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and goes until the end of the twentieth century. There is a lot of focus on historical images in this course, which makes it an unconventional history course.I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but it depends on what you want and like. If you want to learn western history, then yes, take it. If you would like to see a history class with a focus on images, then take it. If you're just looking for a history class, then maybe, but it's not the first recommendation that would come to my mind.",
    "It takes you from the first contact with native americans in Mexico to present day. I would definitely recommend it, it is very interesting and well taught.",
    "GREAT. TAKE IT. It's a good amount of work but its one of the most rewarding classes that I've taken at Yale in so far.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. The lectures are boring and the readings uninteresting, you aren't forced to think analytically but rather just too much 145 terms for the midterm and final combined. I would definitely not recommend this class. Also the demands for the final are just outraging. 65 Id's about 35 paintings to memorize and four essays to prepare. The midterm you have to memorize 80 Id's twenty paintings and prepare 3 essays. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!",
    "Take it if you like art history--I ended up hating the fact that we had to memorize photos\/paintings\/artists\/dates.Exams are HARD.",
    "Absolutely",
    "One of the very best history of lectures at Yale. Its focus on images makes it almost an art history class, which is frustrating to some -- but I had no complaints. Professor Faragher is a captivating and eloquent lecturer, and the subject is equally captivating. I hung onto his every word and never once zoned out the entire semester. As a bonus, he resembles the cook of a covered wagon in a cheesy bad mid-century western.",
    "Great survey course on the American West. Definitely recommend.",
    "A very interesting, fun history class. Professor Faragher is one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale. He tells fascinating stories that illuminate the history just brilliantly. The way he uses images to explain the history of the West is different from most other history classes, and I think it's a really valuable way to look at history that you don't often get the way you do with this class. The final paper is also a lot of fun to write, as it's a short research paper that you're encouraged to use the Beinecke for.",
    "Interesting history course. Not too hard.",
    "Fantastic class, definitely take it if you think you might be interested in the course topic at all.",
    "Yes, I say take this class if you're interested in a new way of studying American history.",
    "Only if you are really really interest in the subject and can bear a boring way of learning about it. Or if you have the patience to sit through lecture.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It is the best course I have taken at Yale so far, and it has completely changed the way I approach the West and American culture as a whole. The course is definitely not a gut, but is still manageable. I would not take this as a fifth class. Faragher's lectures are captivating and the final term paper was surprisingly fun to do. Memorizing terms and images for the midterm and final were challenging, but if you paid attention in the lectures they came relatively quickly. Definitely take this course. You won't regret it.",
    "American West is basically taught like an art history class with lectures focusing on images, paintings, and photographs of the topics. This can be fun but it can also be really tedious if you don't like that kind of class.",
    "A fabulous image-based history course covering the whole of the history of the West, from Spanish exploration to modern Alaska. The course does a great job of including images, textbooks, and some really good literature for source material. Most people I know, though, were incredibly unhappy with their sections\/TAs and found the midterm VERY difficult (it was an incredible amount of writing in a very short time). Still one of my favorite classes at Yale!",
    "This is a great class that is so interesting. It covers a big topic, but it does it well and focuses on what the West is and what it means for America. I enjoyed all of the readings for this class. It is largely image based and Professor Faragher uses them in lecture to illustrate themes. The format midterm and final is very difficult, though.",
    "This is a great course that covers a lot of material from a very interesting period of American history. The exams are pretty hard, but the material is great.",
    "It is a high likelihood that Professor Faragher's Midterm and Final Exam will be unbelievably unfinishable.The prospect of doing well on these exams will be the bane of your existence for this class.",
    "Survey course of the past 500 years of American history pertaining to the frontier. Whether you're an american history buff or know very little about the American West, you should take this class. I would totally recommend this course: great lectures, awesome professor, compelling material, interesting books. It's awesome.",
    "I would recommend it. Both interesting and easy. Exams are straight-forward as you are given a sheet with everything you need to know at least a week prior to the test. It is engaging but not exhausting and worthwhile regardless of major",
    "One of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Faragher is amazing, the course material is fascinating, and all my section discussions were very well taught. The course is very organized, and all the lectures were spot-on. TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. Actually - it's phenomenal.",
    "Sure. Though the exams are tough sometimes (the midterm). Taking notes is sometimes a challenge due to alternating between images and narrative, but lecture is very interesting.",
    "Definitely take American History if you love fantastic classes. If you enjoy learning a bunch, working hard, and having a blast at the same time, then this class is for you. Don't be afraid of the work load. If you just work hard it is manageable.",
    "Great class, but beware taking it credit\/D. You'll need to use about 90% of the energy you would have spent taking it for a grade just to pass (exams are thorough and the paper is non-trivial) so you might as well get the grade for it.",
    "I would recommend it if you took AP US History and you really enjoyed it. If you have any interest in the history of the expansion of our country, take this class.",
    "It is a great history class that focuses on the imagery of the west and its effect on our culture. The tests are basically memorization though, which is a shame.",
    "Fantastic. It was entertaining, engaging, thought-provoking, and different. If you are interested in history, and in actually seeing history, take this class.",
    "Take this class. Faragher is an amazing professor and the material is fascinating. Every single person I've talked to from the class (across a wide range of majors) loved it and thought it was valuable. Midterm and final are difficult but worth it.",
    "This is a must take course, especially for people interested in History or the West. The coursework was manageable, the textbook and additional books extremely interesting, and the professor awesome. What more could you want?",
    "This class is very interesting and engaging if you like the subject matter. Professor Faragher knows what he is talking about, and his lectures are clear and engaging. Because he wrote the class text book, the lectures are almost verbatim of the weekly readings, which can make things a little dull, but is immensely helpful in studying or if you miss out on lectures. The paper is relatively straightforward, with so much topic freedom it is easy to get done. The midterm and final require an immense amount of memorization, both of IDs and images, so be prepared for that kind of mindless studying if you sign on for this class. Overall, you are given the resources to succeed if you choose to, but it definitely requires self-motivation and an interest in the subject matter. Definitely a good basis for American history.",
    "Defintiley recommend. It covers about 600 years of colonial history and is not just limited to cowboys. Amazing class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It's easily been my favorite at Yale thus far and made me fall in love with my major. For people from the West, it's an amazing class to learn more about your part of the country. For people from the East, it's an incredibly informative look at a part of the country East Coasters often know far too little about.The text book is great, the reading enjoyable and fair. The exams necessitate a good bit of studying, but they give you the IDs and essays ahead of time so just know them.Seriously, this class is amazing and Faragher is a fantastic teacher and lecturer.",
    "It's a broad overview of the history of European encounters with the frontier since 1492. It's easily the best course I've taken at Yale.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale. Very interesting style combining images and texts makes the class unique and very enjoyable. Great lecturer and very interesting readings. Only downside is a sizable workload, nevertheless a phenomenal class.",
    "Great class - be prepared to memorize A LOT for tests.",
    "Definitely. I would recommend this to anyone with the least bit of interest in American history (I definitely didn't have a huge interest before taking this class). Lectures are great, readings are interesting, you'll learn a lot, from many different perspectives. Take this class!",
    "YES YES YES. TAKEEEEEE IT. It made me fall in love with California, deserts, Native American culture, and history all over again. It is such a great 5th class; the intrigue of the course compels to keep up with the readings and pay attention in class, which I have realized is rare here at Yale. Seriously, I'm already planning my road trip to visit all the important \"Wests\" of American history.",
    "I definitely recommend this course, but not if you're looking for an easy lecture.",
    "This course is engaging and interesting, and attacks a lot of the myths and misconceptions about Western History. The lectures are very well polished and rehearsed, making each class seem like an episode of a documentary. The focus on image analysis brings in some art history elements (or so I've been told) and is generally pretty cool,though it can get in the way sometimes.I Credit\/D'ed the course, which I think was a mistake. The work is fairly substantial, but not much of it can really be skipped or left out. I ended up doing a fair amount of work for it. It's a worthwhile course, I think, so if you decide to take it, try taking it for a grade.",
    "Do it",
    "A reinvention of popular conceptions of the American frontier and its encounters, John Mack Faragher's lectures transformed an otherwise elementary\/middle school topic (white settlers stealing Indian land = sad, white Americans treating ethnic minorities\/immigrants badly = tragic) into a truly profound meditation on frontier wilderness, cultural encounter, and the long view of American history. The primary source-based paper was enormously helpful in acquainting me with Beinecke et. al., and there isn't too much reading. But take the warning about the exams in these course reviews seriously. I thought, \"How hard can it be to study for it? You get all the IDs and essay questions ahead of time?\" Uh huh. There are 80 terms and approx. 50 images and three possible essay questions for the midterm. You have to memorize exact years for all the IDs, and the images require artist name, publication, AND title (which tend to be longwinded). The essay questions aren't straightforward either. They require creative application and organization of the course's themes. So start memorizing the moment you get the study guide, which for us was exactly 1 week ahead, and work with others. The good news is that once you get through the midterm, studying for the final is easy since you've brushed up the rote memorization pathways in your brain again.",
    "History 141 is an immensely entertaining class. There were several adults auditing it this term, and I can see why; it must have been the perfect lecture to just listen to, unburdened by note-taking, contently absorbing the stories presented through prose and picture. Professor Faragher is almost more of a narrator than a lecturer, guiding the students down Route 66 as we examine the myths of the American west. The class is challenging, with a difficult final and midterm, a term paper, and sizable weekly readings. But I would recommend it for anyone looking for something enjoyable and worthwhile to study."
