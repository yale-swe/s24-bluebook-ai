    "This is a really fascinating course and Professor Amanat is a true expert. There was more cultural and religious history than I expected, and I am glad for it, because it's much more interesting than just viewing Iran through the lens of European and American foreign policy. Professor Amanat was a little busy doing publicity for his new book, so the structure was at times somewhat confusing, but he was always very helpful when I had questions about how to write my essay."
