    "I would recommend this course to anyone with a strong penchant for math that wants to be challenged while expanding his\/her horizons.But for the math neophytes \u0096 I will be reinforcing the course's already existing reputation - that this may very quickly become a depressing experience despite the professors\u0092 good will.",
    "Yes, I will definitely recommend this class",
    "I would recommend ENAS 505 to other students, especially to students from backgrounds other than engineering (chemistry, physics etc).",
    "Yes. It gives good foundation in math neeeded for routine engineering work.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "Yes I would. But I would suggest them to put a lot of time into it in order to do well.",
    "It is an useful course and the fellow student should consider to take it."

   "comments": [
    "This is where the evaluation becomes hard. Despite the challenges during the semester at the end of it I have gone from no advanced math knowledge to speak of -to understanding most of the math in my field of research. This process happened spontaneously- one day to the next I wasn\u0092t skipping the math parts in publications but rather understood the overall ideas. So maybe at the end of it all- there is just no other way for math neophytes to absorb the amount of knowledge required within 3 months.",
    "It provides the fundamental for future work.",
    "It allowed me to understand certain ideas much better. Until now I knew that a derivation of an equation exists and that there is a method to prove it, now I can go through the derivation myself and analyze the problems from a different point of view.",
    "This course provided an excellent overview of differential equations and linear algebra.",
    "The basic concepts and practice on linear algebra, ODEs, PDEs are actually commonly used in kinetic and fluid computation. And the course helps me to understand some software better."
