   "comments": [
    "ECON 116 is a broad intro to macroeconomics. The material isn't always thrilling, but it will give you an understanding of the workings of the macroeconomy. The course is front-loaded, in that very little new material is discussed after the midterm. Professor Fair's lectures are often pretty dull, which keeps lecture attendance relatively low, but he and the TFs are helpful and happy to answer questions outside of class. The weekly problem sets are straightforward and the exams are quite fair. I would recommend ECON 116 only if you are genuinely interested in the workings of the economy--I am, so I enjoyed the class overall, but many of my classmates found the course uninspiring.",
    "The lecture for this class are not particularly engaging, but the material is helpful for understanding world events. The problem sets are very doable, and the professor focuses more on understanding the intuition behind economic events than formulas or calculations.",
    "A recommendation to a fellow student would be very succinct: if one wants to learn about macroeconomics, Econ 116 isn't a bad course to take. However, under no circumstances take this class with Professor Fair.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone. It teaches you so much about how the world economy operates, leading to insights about politics as well. It's only a one semester intro course, but it teaches you a lot. Some people may discourage you from taking Professor Fair's course. He is actually very knowledgable and has a fun personality, and I enjoyed the course.",
    "An informative class, not bad, not fun, just try your best to enjoy it!",
    "Horrible class, interesting material. Do not take with Fair.",
    "Professor Fair is very boring. So difficult to sit through lecture. The material though is very interesting and he does a great job of bringing it into the real world and making you understand the concepts you need to to be an informed citizen about monetary and fiscal policy. The textbook is very helpful, and do your best to get a good TF (Nipun Kant is great, Haobin Wang sucks) otherwise this class will be very difficult. The tests are not easy, but not unfair.",
    "Easy course with a light workload (psets took 1-2 hours a week) that's interesting and timely. Some fundamental knowledge of how the macrooeconomy works is really key to understanding all the weekly news about the Fed's quantitative easing program and the Eurozone debt crisis.",
    "I think its a good class with proper teaching. It is helpful for life.",
    "This is your standard macro class--to my knowledge nothing really stands out (though I suppose Prof. Fair did write the textbook, for what that's worth). Professor Fair is an interesting guy who has done some interesting research--some of which he discusses in class.",
    "Boring with Fair, because he has a monotone voice. However, this class is very useful and important. He wrote the book, and he teaches it to you in class. Although tenured and important in his field, he takes the time to make sure you understand. He's willing to take questions, too. Straightforward. Better than micro.",
    "More interesting than micro but no one takes intro macro for fun. The final is ridiculously long and difficult.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class unless you're an Econ major and have to take it. It may be helpful if you just want to learn macro but I would credit\/D it so that you don't waste your time on this. It isn't too hard but lectures are dull. All you need is the textbook.",
    "Fine intro class, most of the answers are in the book.",
    "I think it is one of the most important (and relevant) courses in Yale whether you want to do anything in economics or not. It teaches you how to analyze financial news, how to make sense of government policies and many other things you hear about in your everyday life. On the contrary to what most people say, I think Professor Fair was actually a decent instructor. He is knowledgeable and if you listen to the lectures, it gives you a good sense of what is important in the book. He also summarizes the things he sees as important, and usually asks related questions in the exams, so paying attention in the lectures Is sometimes useful. That said, his tone of voice and lecturing style is very boring, and it is very easy to get lost during the classes. As such, you will likely to put effort outside the class to actually learn the material. I would recommend benefiting as much from the textbook as possible, it does a pretty good job at teaching the concepts. Overall, I think it is a pretty manageable course.",
    "For a class required for the major, it is not bad at all. It's enlightening and there's a certain satisfaction you get when you can explain the concepts that are really relevant in the news. Ray Fair is obviously brilliant, even if it's hard to pay attention at times.",
    "Intro to macro class as explained. Class is dry but material is interesting. Take as pre req but don't do it if you don't have to",
    "Horrible. Objectively the worst class I've taken at Yale so far. I don't even know where to start, but everything about the course (other than my TA) was just such a disappointment to me. I expected so much more from an \"elite\" university than this course. The only strength was my TA (Nipun Kant). I'm sure Ray Fair is a nice guy but he honestly is a horrible instructor. I'm not sure why he didn't change his teaching style when he noticed that maybe only ~10% of the class showed up to lectures. He speaks in monotone, and doesn't even use a microphone so it's extremely hard to concentrate and even understand what he is saying. Also, in lecture he often goes on tangents that I feel like doesn't help one bit with the tests, understanding the textbook, or doing the problem sets. Sometimes, he even goes into some complex topics definitely beyond the scope of the course, which nobody ends up understanding. Of the few times I went to lecture, I felt like I learned nothing. There are so many great courses here at Yale and I feel tricked into using up a precious credit slot on this waste of a course. Just don't take it if you don't absolutely have to. Honestly, the econ department should consider doing some serious reform to their intro macro classes. They're just not up to par with other courses in the University, even the intro micro classes. My friend sums it up well.",
    "I learned a lot from this class. The textbook is a good base for the theoretical material covered by the course. Lectures are sometimes slow when going over things that the book covers more efficiently, but a lot of the most interesting material is often covered in class in addition to the text book review.",
    "Good overall course, would recommend.",
    "Great class for learning about the general national and international economy.",
    "I would recommend ECON 116 because I think the macroeconomic concepts are extremely important. The class, however, depends highly on the instructor and their lecturing abilities. In this case, the lectures contributed little to the learning.",
    "Very reasonable intro to macro and very important to understanding current events.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Only take this class if it is literally 1000% necessary",
    "I think Intro Macro is a necessary class. The course material is very interesting, the workload is average, and the lectures are a little dull, but it's a very important course that I think is essential in life. So take it.",
    "I am not an Economics major, but I think introductory micro and macro are must takes for anyone. This course allows you to understand how our economy actually works. If you want to understand what it means for the Fed to \"rein in the economy\" or how inflation in the U.S. impacts the value of the euro, you should take this class.",
    "DO NOT TAKE ECON 116 WITH RAY FAIR. EVER. JUST DON'T DO IT. If you need to take ECON 116 for your major, please do so with another professor.",
    "Only take this course if you have to. Professor Fair is the driest lecturer in the history of humanity; you will have my undying respect if you can stay awake and focused for a full session. If you do take the course, make sure you read the textbook. It's really helpful.",
    "Everyone should probably take this class just so they have a basic understanding of how the macroeconomy works. It's very helpful in reading the world news.",
    "Take it",
    "I would recommend this course with a different professor",
    "Yes, I enjoyed the course. Maybe take it in the spring though.",
    "ECON 116 us an introductory macroeconomics class an there is nothing particularly special about it. The material is just what you would expect, and I found it very interesting and informative. But that is certainly not due to how the information was presented to me, seeing as Ray Fair is the dullest Professor I've had. His lectures put me to sleep on a number of occasions, and a few time I really would have been better off not going. However, If you've taken micro, I suggest you take this class because it is a very different take on the economy and it could awaken in interest in economics (as it did for me, desire the boring lectures). The homework is pretty easy, and the midterm and final are fair, and if you study from the old ones, you will do fine. Basically, there is nothing surprising about this course--it's not really fun, but the information may be surprisingly interesting to you.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in economics. It's an introductory course but Prof. Fair includes current events, so it makes the course more than just fact-based but also relatable to our everyday lives.",
    "Take it if you want to major in Econ or required by your major. Otherwise you can just read the textbook and learn by yourself.",
    "ProFessor Fair has probably been my least favorite Yale instructor thus far. He has a monotonous near unlistenable voice, yet relies solely on that voice for instruction - there is next to nothing useful to be found on the power points, he opts to just talk about things for 75 minutes, and trust me the going is rough. I don't think most students feel as strongly as I do about Fair or this course, and that's because no one goes to class. If you go into the course as most do, accepting that you'll be teaching yourself the material without the help of the professor or the TAs, then it should be a decent, if dry, experience that introduces you to many macro concepts, some of them pretty cool.",
    "PSETs are easy and graded for completion. The textbook must be read in order for success, unless you already know the concepts from before. Class notes are not very helpful, but lecture and section are. It's important to stay with the material and not just complete PSETs without knowing it because the class moves pretty fast. Overall an average class that serves as an adequate introduction to macroeconomics so if that's what you are looking for, I recommend it.",
    "Easy class that was poorly taught by Ray Fair.",
    "No point wasting your time on it really"
