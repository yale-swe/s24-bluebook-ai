    "Great seminar, especially for those with little exposure to stem cell science, politics, or personhood philosophy. Science majors beware, you will be bored for the first few weeks (it's basically intro bio for stem cells).",
    "Yes!!!I LOVED this course. It was basically 12 of us talking about stem cells with a super intelligent, super invested guide for two hours each week.Dr. Amos was great. He clearly was very engaged in the information and very invested in our learning it. He was super patient for all the various technical questions that we had, and never got annoyed when we interrupted his explanations for clarifications. After this course, I really do feel comfortable with and discussing and relatively knowledgeable about stem cells.The problem sets were a little hard, but if you went to his office hours, he gave you all the answers. The papers were pretty enjoyable to write and it was really cool that, thanks to this course, I was capable of reading scientific reviews on stem cells and actually understanding them.Best Science Credit EVER.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it for a student interested in learning about the science of stem cells and discussing different aspects of stem cells in ethics, religion, media, business,etc.",
    "Yes. It's a great way to get a science credit in a doable class. The papers can be fun if you choose our topic creatively, and you'll learn a lot about the entire field of stem cell research, not just the science of it.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are a non-science major but have some background in biology.",
    "I would probably not take this class if I, you know, understood science at all. But if you need a science credit that isn't a gut but isn't hard at all, this is the way to go!",
    "I would recommend this course with reservations. The material is fascinating and the essays are fun; discussions are often meaningful. The religious and philosophical discussions around stem cells are certainly eye-opening. A few caveats: (1) The problem sets are often difficult without reliable reference to any source apart from the class powerpoints. The best way around this is simply to start early and e-mail Dr. Amos questions; he's very understanding. (2) Science majors and anyone versed in science may find the pace or questions trying at times. Otherwise asolid class."
