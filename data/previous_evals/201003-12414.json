    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE. The class is small (we only had about 12 people), the professor is awesome, the material\/reading is super interesting, and the workload is manageable. About 1 pset\/week, a midterm, a final, and an observing project. Be prepared for Professor van Dokkum's slightly unorthodox approach to writing problems (he intentionally gives you questions you've never seen before to test if you have a grasp of the concepts and not just the numbers). The observing project was a lot of fun. Made me want to do astrophysics as a major.",
    "extremely interesting material, van dokkum is a great lecturer, tests are pretty random and hard, not a lot of work though. overall very good course if you're interested at all in how the universe came to be",
    "This course was a great way to learn about astronomy for someone who may not count science as their passion\/strength, but who want more of a challenge than Planets and Stars. It's definitely not a gut course--the material is engaging, there is regular homework (although not too challenging) and the exams require studying and thought. Having taken basic high school physics and calculus, I found the math level completely manageable and would encourage people to not disregard the class because of anxiety about the math aspect.",
    "Yes, as long as fellow student is not simply looking to get by with an effortless credit.",
    "This class is more difficult than the lower level astro courses, but probably worth it if you'd be bored in those.",
    "Very interesting, I'm glad I took it.",
    "I took this class because I thought astronomy sounded kind of cool and didn't like the way \"Planets and Stars\" would look on my transcript. As far as I can tell, this class is more than a little more difficult than ASTR 110 (which is not a gut itself). If you're just looking for a Sc or a QR, there are much easier ways to get it. However, this class gets into some REALLY interesting stuff (mostly in the second half--galaxies are sort of cool, I guess, but humanities\/philosophy-type people will find cosmology SO much more awesome). van Dokkum is great, the observing project is cool, and COSMOLOGY, SERIOUSLY IT IS A MINDFUCK. Overall, I am glad I took this class even though it may tank my GPA for the semester. You should take it if you want a serious (though still basic) introduction to the field of astrophysics.",
    "If you have gotten so far to look at evaluations, you at least have a passing interest in this subject. That said, TAKE THIS COURSE! Professor Van Dokkum is engaging and takes a real interest in having people learn the material rather than just know enough to pass. The problem sets are fairly straightforward, the exams are not incredibly difficult (but certainly expect you to know the material), and the observing project is fun. If you are just looking for a science credit, you probably should take something easier, but if you are looking for an incredibly amazing course that will make you look at the sky in a completely different way, take this one."
