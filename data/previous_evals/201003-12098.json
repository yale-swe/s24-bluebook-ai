    "I would have to say that I don't recommend this course. Overall, it was a very frustrating experience. Expectations were unclear and we never know what was going on. However, the workload was uncommonly easy: readings every week (which were usually hard to follow because of technical jargon, therefore I usually only skimmed them, or read them superficially), a problem set every week (graded Pass\/fail, which was awesome), and three midterm exams (2nd one was completely strange and we never learned anything on it). So if you don't mind feeling kind of useless, then I guess you could take it, but practical learners should be dissuaded. I would have dropped it, except I had already dropped a different course.",
    "This class definitely appeals to a very specific type of person. I personally enjoyed it very much, but I know many people who didn't like Pinango's teaching style. It's taught very much like a math class, starting with the basics of the types of problems we solve in class (many times students solving sentence puzzles on the black board), and then building on those foundations, compounding the knowledge from the reading into the ideas previously covered.",
    "This course was a process class in the basics of linguistics, which was a struggle for me. I came into it thinking that linguistics (especially as it relates to processes of mind) would be very interesting. In reality, it was terribly boring to me (and everyone else I knew in the class). This is because while we were ostensibly to study what language is, how we know it (acquisition, etc), and how we use it, what we really ended up doing is trying to learn how to draw endless charts to illustrate syntax and semantics and lexical items (basically, words) in a manner that fit the field of linguistics. This means re-learning your traditional grammar to fit a system that is new, constantly changing, and not even yet aware of its implications or meaning or purpose. I love language, and I love English. But this class threatened to murder my appreciation for language. If you are anything like me, a person with an innate affinity and sense for English (the whole problem being, incidentally, that grammar and expressing oneself through speech is innate for everyone!), DO NOT take a course exploring your own language from a linguistic viewpoint, especially from a non-native English speaker who will teach you grammar with examples that every once and a while aren't even quite grammatical...and who will attempt to make you learn by trying to lead you into extrapolating some kind of from-thin air discovery of obscure concepts rather than just teaching them to you.",
    "It's a great class if you want to learn a lot more about linguistics and really dig into some of the basic building blocks of language. If you're just looking for an easy psyc class, this is not it. The reading is dense, the material is not that easy to grasp, and you really have to work at the class. In the end it was fun and totally worth it for me, but if you're not willing to put in the effort, it won't be as worthwhile.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "The course focuses on the structure of language in our mind. There are weekly problem sets that are pass\/fail - pretty easy, but they make sure you go back over the readings and have an understanding of what was done. There are 3 exams, that really aren't that bad, as long as you go over all of the readings\/information. Much more focus on language and the brain that I thought initially, but now I see why. I would recommend it to anybody who is interested in this kind of stuff. Shop it to see you if you like the professor and class, and go for it.",
    "Language and Mind was a good general introduction to several of the major fields of linguistic enquiry, though it was not billed as such. It covers a wide swathe of content, and it provides a good basis as to how fields like syntax, semantics, morphology, acquisition, and neurolinguistics relate. Likewise, Professor Pinango is adept and engaged, though not the best at managing class time. However, as the class lacks a section, prepare yourself for flurries of confused questions (that Pinango entertains) from those who have not done the readings. The fact that the problem sets are graded on completion is also a lifesaver some weeks. Overall, I found the course worthwhile.",
    "An objective way to understand the English language, and language in general. I would recommend it to those who are interested in coming to a better understanding of how language works the way that it does - even if it feels at times that you are taking something that you already intuitively understand and making it very complicated.",
    "I would not recommend this course. The lack of concrete, agreed facts makes the course hard to follow; terms are frequently made up in class and then referred to as if gospel in homework. Furthermore, the quality of the teaching is poor, and lessons lack focus.",
    "Yes, take it. But not if it is your first exposure to linguistics.",
    "I would not recommend psychology 137 to another student. The course was not well organized, and it was difficult to learn anything through Professor Pinango's teaching methods.",
    "An interesting way to start thinking about linguistics without getting too heavily into the neuroscience aspect. A course to take if you enjoy quibbling over grammar and dissecting syntax. The light assigned reading is interesting, but so much of the nature of the subject is speculative that the leaps of faith get a little tiring.",
    "Probably not, unless the class was restructured. I would have enjoyed this class so much more if it had a bit more structure to it in terms of the lectures. Until that occurs, I would honestly stay away from it because I spent many frustrated nights wondering what descriptions of various processes or theories actually meant."
