   "comments": [
    "You read Borges stories from several of his collections of books (Historia Universal de la Infamia; Ficciones; Otras Inquisiciones; El Informe de Brodie) and a little of his poetry. 4 quizzes (announced) and a midterm exam that is totally doable. It's definitely a struggle to get through the class and Borges's abstract, philosophical concepts at 9 in the morning in LUCE, but it's definitely worth it.",
    "I really, really, really, really wish this class had been a seminar. Which Prof. Gonzalez really understands, so it's definitely on the right track. Prof. Gonzalez has a lot of interesting things to say about Borges. It's a shame that they're confined (along with students' contributions) to a not-very-conducive lecture just because of the room that we were in. Even though the workload will increase (you actually have to do readings in seminars...surprise...), if it's clear that his class will be run as a seminar, then know that it's worth taking.",
    "Yes, it is a great class, with great readings and learning experience.",
    "You read Borges and take a quiz every other quiz (reading verification mostly). There's a midterm halfway through the course and then a final paper.",
    "Definitely. It is a really interesting and not too demanding spanish class",
    "Very good class. Readings--concise like Borges' writing style--were never excessive, and each was every bit as interesting and challenging as the last. Though I am a native speaker and cannot comment on difficulty from the perspective of someone learning the language, I found the quizzes, midterm, and essay to be quite fair. Anibal is a kind and dedicated professor. It is his style to conduct his classes as lectures, so if you seek discussion out of a Spanish class rather than critical engagement with literature, 350 may not be for you.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to everyone interested in literature, improving Spanish reading skills, or simply reading cool stories. The work load is two or three short stories a week, with a midterm exam and a final paper. If you want to improve your speaking skills, this is probably not the class for you, as the class is more of a lecture than a seminar. It is, overall, a great course.",
    "If you are interested in Borges, take this class! The readings are all very interesting, and it really is a survey of Borges's work. The workload was very manageable, and Professor Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez was always accessible. This class is definitely more of a lecture, so don't expect a lot of class participation (although Professor Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez welcomes questions and comments). The class is very organized, and all readings and quizzes are posted at the beginning of the semester.",
    "If you are interested in Borges, take it. Borges is a bit difficult to understand but Professor Gonazlez does a good job explaining the works. I would suggest shopping the first few classes and doing a little reading on Borges, and then go with your instinct on this one.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Especially to students who have a firm grasp on Spanish literature and would like a little more specific instruction on a specific and in this case such an important writer.",
    "Good course covering some of Borges' most important works in the context of the author's life and events around him. Workload is light (usually no more than one short story per lecture), but the final essay is quite a killer (12-15 pages in Spanish). Get started on it early if you can!",
    "Absolutely - this is a great course! The literature is, of course, wonderful (it's Borges after all), and Professor Gonzalez is brilliant and insightful. If you're looking for a literature course in Spanish, this one comes highly recommended.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is willing to be up early enough and will committ to the readings because they are vital.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to really improve their comprehension of Spanish lit, and to anyone who has responded positively to reading Borges before. The workload on a week to week basis is light, but the class isn't exactly an easy way to get a language credit, because it is Borges after all.",
    "Everything about this class was awesome! I didn't know much about Borges before coming into the classroom but I absolutely love him. Definitely keeping and rereading the books I bought for the course. Professor Gonzalez always had interesting lectures prepared and his quizzes were really chill. The midterm was actually kind of fun. Writing the essay was also really cool. This class is really chill. Loved it."
