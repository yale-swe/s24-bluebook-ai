    "I think that the course was taught at a level only a small number of students could truly grasp. While there was a \"review\" of math concepts at the beginning of the course, but it was in no way comprehensive of the understanding that students should have entering the course. The prerequisites are also not a good determinant of whether a students is equipped to take the class and should be reconsidered.",
    "N\/A",
    "Important subjects, but taught in a way that does not make it intuitive. I would recommend working on explaining economic concepts in a more easy-to-understand way, rather than relying on mathematical proofs.",
    "Professor Fenichel truly wants his students to engage with, understand, and care about the material. He clearly puts a lot of effort into the class and is always encouraging questions and asking how he can adjust the class to make it better for the students. All this intention and effort is appreciated. Unfortunately, the conceptual material is simply not explained in a way that is easy to grasp. The professor seems very mathematically inclined and isn't always able to translate the equations on the board using non-mathematical explanations that make sense to his students. Questions about equations were explained with more equations, instead of stepping back from the equation and trying to think of what was happening \"behind\" the equation. Instead of talking about what was happening to the fish or trees and then showing where that was incorporated into the equations, we just dove deeper into more equations and further derivations. This is not an inherently bad teaching style, but for many FES students it is not their best way of learning. The professor asks questions of the class to foster participation, but the questions are often broad or too-obvious-sounding (seeming like trick questions), and students who tried answering at the beginning of the semester were usually wrong or at least didn't provide the answer the professor was looking for. This quickly led to an assumption among students that they would never be able to answer a question correctly, leading to silence when the professor asked questions for the rest of the semester. This topic is really interesting and Professor Fenichel is invested in the class, but the teaching style overall did not foster the most productive or effective learning environment.",

    "I appreciated when we discussed the concepts with concrete examples as a reference",
    "The best aspect of this course is that you acquire an understanding a very relevant issue for sustainable development. The pricing of natural capital is a key concept for environmental managers. Furthermore, Eli is a very good professor who is always looking for different ways to teach.",
    "I took this course (despite the fact that I don't have an environmental economics focus) because I think it is valuable to understand how to value natural capital. I thought the course had promise, initially (based on shopping period) - while the content is interesting, I don't think it was delivered well.",
    "It was very neat to gain insight into the current state of knowledge regarding natural capital, and also to gain a sense of the historical development of the field.",
    "The interactive class days were a particular highlight.",
    "Learning to use Excel to model dynamic optimization problems. The problem sets were hard and took a very long time, but they did help me learn about ecological-economic modeling. I feel much more confident facing large equations and Excel modeling now.",
    "The final project, and the process of building a financial model, was the highlight of the class to me.",
    "The exam was a good opportunity to show what you learned if you had a difficult time with the problem sets.",
    "It changed the way I perceived the approach of thinking about natural resources as capital.",

   "comments": [
    "Classroom environment wasn't great",
    "A prep class for calculus review would have been extremely valuable--the math prep offered a week or two into the semester did not review derivatives\/ integrals enough for people who needed the review to complete much of the work on the problem sets. Something similar to a \"bootcamp\" offered for many finance classes would be helpful-- a 3 hour or so session with a TA who could walk through calc concepts most important to have to be able to complete expected work in the class. Often I did not struggle with conceptual understanding of the material, but rather the mechanics needed to complete the problem sets. While it is possible to try to review and catch up as needed-- a good primer at the beginning of the semester would go a long way.",
    "I think this course should be 4-units",
    "The course should either be marketed as an upper-level class for students interested in economics and mathematical concepts, or be taught at a more introductory, conceptual level to a broader audience of students.",
    "This course was very frustrating for me. The work load was very heavy - to the point that I felt like my learning was inhibited. Eli discussed wanting to push us to learn but most of the time I just felt like I was frantically trying to complete what I could and not really digesting the material. I wish there had been more practice problems in class as I did not feel well prepared to do the homework. Often if felt like Eli was frustrated that we didn't ask more questions in class, but when we did ask questions he became irritated that they were so base level. There were also too many out of class videos, readings and papers to be able to work through. I think students would actually get more out of the class if there was less work.",
    "In my opinion, Professor Fenichel spent an inordinate amount of time working out the math behind theories instead of explaining to us the concepts behind the math and theories. We spent 4-5 class periods, JUST doing math on the board. While I'm not averse to using math to explain concepts, I think Prof Fenichel didn't do a great job of translating the math into explanations. Additionally, the problem sets were not entirely connected to the content we were learning in class. We spent a lot of time de-bugging excel and inputting equations into excel and not enough time understanding WHY we used those specific equations\/where they came from.",
    "I think that the course might benefit from more clearly defining an audience. It seemed like the people in the course came from a wide variety of backgrounds and it seemed like some people benefited more than others from certain sections.",
    "It would be useful to have a weekly TF discussion section.",
    "The explanation of class concepts and atmosphere surrounding class participation. Please see answer to Question 13 (\"Use the space below to comment on questions 1-14, if you wish (please indicate which questions you are commenting on)\").",
    "Basically, I think a lot of us needed to be more prepared. I think you need to stress the need for a (rigorous) intro Econ class.",
    "The way it is taught is incredibly confusing.",
    "The examples covered in class are too simple compared to the ones in the assignments. The material for the course ended two weeks before the end of the semester. The extra time could have been used to cover examples of similar difficulty to the ones in the homeworks.",
