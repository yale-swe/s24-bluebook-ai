    "This course helped me think theoretically, develop my ability to read texts closely, and provided me with a new vocabulary for writing about film.",
    "By taking this course, I gained a vocabulary for intelligently discussing cinema and was exposed to important current debates happening at the intersection between race studies and cinema studies. To my surprise, at the conclusion of the course, I was able to put together a definition of the academic buzzword \"affect\" as it differs from emotion, which will be incredibly helpful in my own research. The class expanded my thinking about performance, racialization, and affect and made me a more discerning spectator toward a variety of cinematic genres from within and beyond the American film industry. The course gave me expose to theorists, critics, and artists who I had heard of but had yet to engage with as well as new people whose work proved just as interesting and worth exploring further outside the course. Although many of the readings were excerpts, the longer books, chapters, and articles are pieces I intend to read over this summer and into the coming year."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: -Depth of the material engaged -Strong Syllabus -Intelligent Instructor -Theoretically Rigorous Weaknesses: Should consider either being a lecture style course or incorporating more room for class discussion.",
    "Upon attending the first class, I understood that the course would be demanding and rigorous which was persuasive for my choice to enroll in the class. The course was strongest in regards to aiding students to unravel and grasp critical theories about several films as well as concepts such as affect, blackness, humanity, and more. The cinematic works and readings selected for the course were all fantastic and were a representative collection of pieces from the 20th century and into the 21st. However, the readings always seemed to overpower the cinema that we were supposed to be analyzing. Often, the student presentations often did not engage with the weekly film as thoroughly as I would have liked. And as the readings became longer and denser, the films would barely be discussed in class and sometimes not at all. The most glaring weakness of the course was the imbalance between the readings and the films during class discussion; much of the cinematic analysis was done individually through presentations or essays although the class seemed eager to have more in-depth discussions about the films as a group."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. This course was one of the most challenging and intellectually engaging courses I've taken while at Yale. I would recommend it to students who are looking to engage with critical theory and contemporary thought in Black studies.",
    "I would enthusiastically recommend this course to other students and I have done so even before the semester was over. I loved the rigor and originality of the course. The course seemed to emerge out of an urgency to address blind spots in film and cinema studies and affect theories in regards to race. I would sincerely recommend this course to any students who want an introduction to affect, cinema, or race studies as well as any students who want to take a class that pushes them to think more sharply in the chaos of a discussion or in the more organized fashion of a paper or presentation."
