   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it if you're not confident in any aspect of your grammar or are just looking to practice writing and speaking in a non-threatening environment.",
    "This class is great for reviewing Spanish grammar topics you've already studied to get to L5, and it goes deeper into the topics so you really understand the intricacies of the language. I would recommend this class to anyone trying to solidify their Spanish skills.",
    "This is a very good course to take if you need to brush up on key grammar points that may have been left out of of previous Spanish classes. The class is a grammar class, so it's not always the most exciting, but it it very helpful.",
    "I liked this course better than Advanced Conversational Spanish. This is an advanced grammar class, so as expected, the grammar was hard and sometimes tricky, but I liked it a lot more. Advanced Conversational Spanish was exceptionally painful, and this was fine. You learn some Spanish grammar, yes there is homework for three times a week, but not so much you feel like you want to die.",
    "If you want to refine your grammar this course is pefect not only as a review, but it will help you explore things that aren't always covered in more basic courses. For example, usually a spanish course will teach you when to use preterit and when to use imperfect for describing past events, but this course will teach you that in most cases you can use both but it will mean something different. I took this course before I take a literature based class so that I could rehash all the grammar I've learned over the last 10 years and it was totally worth it.",
    "This class is like a very solid high school language class. It'll basically do exactly what's advertised--improve your grammar skills, not help too much with speaking fluency, nothing else particularly exciting."
