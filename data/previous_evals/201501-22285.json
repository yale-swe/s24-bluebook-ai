    "This is a history seminar that examines Stalinism as an ideology and in practice. The course begins with the Russian Revolution in 1917 and concludes with the death of Stalin in 1953. Most of the focus is on the 1930s, which are the archetypically \"Stalinist\" years. The class is based on historiography: you will get an overview of the field by reading historians' arguments. The major topics covered are the Revolution, Lenin, the New Economic Policy, collectivization, industrialization, the Purges, and World War II. Within these you study more specific and interesting facets of Soviet society, e.g. Uzbek Muslims. At the end of the course you write a final paper surveying the historiography of a topic of your choice. In addition to the final paper, there are two shorter papers and weekly reading responses. The workload is manageable, and I actually rather enjoyed writing my final paper. I would recommend this course if you want to learn more about a fascinating area of history. It will give you good practice reading historiography, which I think is an important analytical skill.",
    "If you're interested in the period, it is probably a good class for you. That being said, I think background in the historical events of the period would have been immensely helpful.",
    "Take the class. If you're a history major, you should certainly take a historiography seminar before you graduate and this is one of the best. You'll learn a ton about how to identify and critique different schools of historical thought. If you're not a history major, Stalinism is an extremely interesting (if sometimes depressing) topic that is becoming more relevant every day.",
    "If you would like to learn about Stalin's reign, then this is an excellent course. I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in the subject."
