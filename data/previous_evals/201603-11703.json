    "One strength of the course is that it forces you to speak and listen to Spanish every single day, and there are enough essay assignments to help develop writing skills. I think that a weakness of the course is that you don't receive much feedback when you have to speak Spanish, so it is somewhat difficult to improve in speaking the language."
