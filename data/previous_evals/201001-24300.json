    "The readings are fantastic; they and Professor Lu make this class a worthwhile one to take. But if you are, like me, shy and easily intimidated, it can be hard forcing yourself to talk in a seminar filled with people infinitely more knowledgeable than you.",
    "This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Tina Lu is fantastic, and class discussion is always interesting and dynamic, mainly because of her consistent opening lectures. The course is fairly broad, and very text-focused, but the texts are really fun. I did almost all of the reading, as I genuinely enjoyed it.",
    "Come get a wide-ranging introduction to the classical Chinese canon, taught by Tina Lu, one of the coolest professors you will ever meet. You'll read many interesting and exciting works of literature, and I mean exciting: you'll pass by a threesome of fox-lady, ghost, and scholar, on your way through an astonishingly pornographic classic (best scene: the sex-starved wife smashes all the sex toys her doofus husband buys for her, before she becomes her previous fling's seventh wife), only to then approach the story where a particularly badly-endowed casanova increases the size of his manhood by graft...well, I don't want to spoil everything for you. Go see for yourself.But, seriously, the charm and appeal of this course isn't in some of the crazy things we read, but rather the breadth and depth through which you will immerse yourself in the tradition, spanning genres and eras. At the end, I really feel like I have a good sense of how a good portion of the canon has developed and changed. And Professor Lu's allusions to Jay-Z and Lady Gaga don't hurt anything either, right on the heels of her astute observations about the production and contexts of the literature we read, informed by a lot of good and interesting critical theory and scholarship.One final point: the reading and workload is quite high, with two papers, a midterm, and a final, as well as often boatloads of reading. But everything is very interesting. Highly recommended.",
    "Yeah! It is one of the best classes I have had at Yale!",
    "Take it."
