   "comments": [
    "The textbook was burned in Wiemar Germany for warmth because it has more value as a source of BTUs than as an academic resource.",
    "Hard, but supposedly not as hard as when Stone teaches 410. The material is very cool, but it took a while to set in. Very different from any other physics class you've had before, except a little of quantum. hard to get used to the probability\/statisics way of thinking and solving problems. hope you like combinations and logarithms.Stone likes theory problems, so not very many numerical problems here...psets take maybe 10-12 hours.I took it without having classical mech before, and that wasn't a big deal. however, having some quantum first will be helpful.Would be completely lost without Alex Cerjan the TA. Alex is amazing, you will come to agree, hope you get Alex.",
    "Great class. Stone works you hard, but you get a lot out of it. Wasn't as bad as 410 with Stone, although I also had a semester with him under my belt so that probably helped. He doesn't often stop during lecture, so if you're confused, raise your hand and butt in for clarification - chances are, other people have the same question.",
    "Don't take it for fun.",
    "you already know if you're going to take it. if doug stone is teaching, be prepared for a lot of pain. if you make it out on the other side, you know you're a pretty decent physicist.",
    "This is an intensive course in Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics. Professor Stone makes it quite challenging: the problem sets are quite long and the exams are highly rigorous. Professor Stone will make sure that you get a lot out of the course, and you will come away with a thorough understanding of the material. Also, Alex is an awesome TA. This is a very complete course that will leave you feeling rewarded in the end, despite the large amount of time it takes during the semester. You'll take this course if you have to, and I don't expect anyone outside the physics or applied physics major to be looking at it.",
    "Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics as a subject is probably the most boring course out there.I just had a hard time putting in the effort to learn the difficult material because it seems so boring and abstract. I'd gladly take up the challenge of learning difficult things if I felt it worthwhile. This was not the case.We used the Sturge Textbook, which is the worst textbook I have ever used. Unclear explanations that go all over the place, lots of errors, etc.The problem sets were ridiculous and unnecessarily time consuming. They take 8-10 hours each, and are so filled with algebraic manipulations and dry mathematical manipulation that it's hard to glean any physical insight that can't be gained in in a 10 minute problem. Everybody also gets nearly perfect scores on them, so that hurts too.",
    "Statistical mechanics is less equation-based than other physics classes, especially coming from something like classical mechanics, where Lagrangians give you everything you need. As such, it is more difficult to understand and harder to convert any understanding into calculations. Professor Stone does a good job of covering the material, but I think the subject is inherently difficult. A lot of material is covered as well. Problem sets and tests are the typical difficulty for Stone, which is above average.",
    "I'd take it if you want to learn Thermodynamics and Stat Mech or are remotely interested in the concepts. The material has very interesting connections with other kinds of physics.",
    "Physics 420 is an excellent class. Lectures are far more engaging and informative than the textbook. Physics 420 presents statistical and thermal physics as propitious fields with many applications, and if you haven't had a comprehensive stat mech class yet you will definitely be more excited about physics after taking 420.",
    "Better hope your TA is good. Enjoy.",
    "This will be the hardest class of your semester by far. Just prepare yourself to take a class from Stone.",
    "Physics 420 was well taught, and has very interesting material. However, it has a lot of work. This is not something \"bad\" about the course, that work is not busy work, and will help you understand the material better, as similar to any other Math\/Physics course, you learn mostly from the problem sets\/exams. Of course recommending this course is a superfluous exercise as everyone who takes this course is required to. If you are one of the few (mad respect by the way) who are thinking of taking this optionally I would recommend it as long as you are willing to put in the time (this will not be an easy 5th or 6th class) but you will come out of it not only understanding the material, but the math as well.",
    "Stone's physics classes are always hard. He's a genius and most of the time understands the level of his students, but occasionally does teach above class level. But that's usually fine because Alex is a fantastic TA and can explain everything you have questions regarding. The exams are painful and excruciating exercises in futility, but don't worry because he curves them.",
    "Physics 420 is your basic intro to thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. If you've taken chemistry some of the thermodynamics might be review, but it will quickly progress to new stuff. Professor Stone is a good teacher and 420 with him isn't as hard as 410 was.",
    "This course was great, although it took me a while to really understand all the concepts. Looking back though, I now have a firm understanding of stat. mech. and intuition for many of its important concepts. Of course, with Professor Stone, one can expect long hard problem sets, but they do teach you the concepts you need to know.",
    "It has interesting material that you may not have seen before; on the other hand it is difficult and a complicated subject, and you should only take it if you really want to (you should probably be a physics major).",
    "This class is a challenge, no question. But it's a cool and obviously important topic. Stone is the most difficult prof you'll ever have - exams are killer - but he's a great lecturer and you'll learn a lot."
