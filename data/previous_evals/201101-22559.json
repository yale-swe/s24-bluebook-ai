   "comments": [
    "This is what language learning should be. If you're serious about learning Italian, and you're willing to put up with the workload, take this course (and consider doing Yale Summer Session in Siena afterwards). My favorite class this semester.",
    "I would recommend this to a student who is really dedicated to learn the language or who will have a significant amount of time to devote to this class because that's what it will take, especially if you don't know any other romance language. Be aware that it's easy to get loss in the class if you don't have previous, substantial knowledge of another romance language or you don't catch on quickly.",
    "I am definitely happy that I took this intensive Italian course over the regular L1 and L2 classes -- you learn just as much Italian in half the time, and the pace of the class (although daunting at first) is actually quite manageable. I think I actually came out of this class better at Italian than my friends who took the regular L2 class. And even though you meet 5 times a week for almost 2 hours, the class goes by relatively quickly because the class is pretty fun -- Michael Farina would mix up grammar lessons with movie screenings and cultural discussions about Italy, which was definitely enjoyable.Most of the people in this class have either taken or speak Latin, French, or Spanish, so it definitely helps to have some knowledge of Latin or other Romance languages.",
    "TAKE IT. JUST DO IT. You will feel SO comfortable with elementary level italian, it's amazing. Even intermediate. You'll just be great.",
    "Ital 125 is a wonderful class. Michael is amazing - he brings you breakfast and occasionally surprises you with movie days if the class does well on things. There is a lot of work - a quiz every day and a test every week. But it's totally worth it to have a great professor and 2\/3 of the language requirement done in a semester.",
    "it is a lot of work, but if you are willing to study a lot, you will get rewarded",
    "Farina does a great job of making sure learning happens in a fun way. It's easy to make such a class tedious and boring, but Farina also shows that it's not much of a learning experience if it is. His teaching has an end, even if it's not always clear until the end itself. This course as well is truly incredible! The best part of the course is getting to learn from someone like Farina, whose humor and attitude is wonderfully conducive to learning a foreign language. Dai! Hai bisogno de farlo!",
    "I'd really recommend to anyone who has a flair for languages (because it would in no way be an easy course otherwise!). A fantastic immersion in the Italian language, and very useful for laying the foundations for further study."
