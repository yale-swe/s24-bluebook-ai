    "Cards on the table: I'm a Christian. This is a fantastic course for people who already know the New Testament pretty well and want some exposure to some of the critical scholarship out there. Even though a lot of this critical scholarship is absurd (Really? You can read 1 Cor 15 and say that Paul DIDN'T believe in the bodily resurrection of Jesus as we read in the Gospels?), it's good for Christians to have an understanding of how this critical NT scholarship game is played, if only to point out the ways in which the game is silly. If you, as a Christian, are going to take this course, I would strongly recommend having some weekly time with a pastor to discuss this course. There will likely be some ideas presented as fact that will rock your world (like that reading of 1 Cor 15, or the discussion of the so-called pseudo-Pauline epistles), and it'd be good to have some space to give a more balanced approach to the text. That being said, this has been by far the best course I've taken in my four years at Yale, and Matt does a great job of teaching it. I've learned a lot that will help propel me in my study of these texts after Yale. And c'mon, it's a Yale course credit for reading and talking about the New Testament. What could be better?",
    "YES",
    "This class is great! It's a fantastic class regardless of your background, whether you're coming in as someone who may not have a dog in the fight at all, as a really conservative Christian, or as a more liberal or mainline one. You'll find a classroom that's open to your ideas the vast majority of the time. Unless you're coming from the same background as the professor and are pretty open minded, you'll feel uncomfortable with something at some point, but that really, really, really shouldn't stop you from taking the class. If you have issues with something (whether that be what the Resurrection is like or whether Paul really wrote some stuff or whether bishops have more power than the NT gives them), think about it and talk about it with Matt or with someone else who's knowledgeable about the topic. The most important thing is to keep an open mind with everyone around you. You will learn!",
    "Yes, absolutely! It is a great follow-up class to Christine Hayes' class on the Hebrew Bible.",
    "It's the New Testament. Read through it all (it isn't as long as you might think) and learn how people try to understand the texts. We look a lot at history and how people try to find out about where the texts come from and their contexts. Also look at the variety of ways these texts have been interpreted. If that sounds fun, take it.",
    "Yes! Take this class if Matt is teaching it!",
    "RLST 151 is a very informative course when it comes to the difficulties involved in interpreting the New Testament. It equips one to critically reflect on the Bible and take apart the working pieces, but it does not necessarily equip one to put the pieces back together because of the lack of comparison and focus on criticism.",
    "Yes- especially to anyone who does not have a well-rounded understanding of the New Testament."
