    "Gained a new perspective on socioeconomic\/racial\/gender inequality and the issues with trying to solve these problems. It was very helpful not only from a theoretical perspective but also covering real-life movements today like Black Lives Matter and the Alt-Right. I'm not sure how much my writing improved but definitely felt better as the year progressed.",
    "This course really dug into the core of the difficult nature of equality and our class was challenged to identify issues while also searching for potential paths to address inequality. I learned a huge amount about modern and historical incidences of and opinions about inequality throughout this course.",
    "A lot of ways to think about inequality",
    "I learned how to create various essay types, such as text analysis, text comparison, and argumentative research."

    "The readings of the course were fantastic, I felt as though the conversation in class, especially because it was in a smaller setting (seminar) could have been less politically correct (for lack of a better term). I felt as though at times we did not talk about the most difficult issues in a satisfying and convincing way, rather beating around the bush to a certain extent.",

    "This course is a must-take for anyone interested in understanding and helping solve the inequalities in our society today!",
    "This course is certainly a good writing credit, and the readings were short, concise, and interesting.",
    "Readings are very interesting. Like any English 114 class, the work is concentrated in a few different papers so at times it's a lot, while other times there's little to no readings.",
    "If the topic sounds interesting to you than take it, there will be no regrets, but if you don't think you're gonna love discussing the subject matter you shouldn't enroll."
