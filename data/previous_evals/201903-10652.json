    "This course was a beautiful introduction to the basics of Latin grammar. We progressed an enormous amount over the span of a semester and picked up the fundamentals of Latin. As someone who wanted to check Latin out not for a language credit but because they genuinely were interested in learning, I could not be more happy I took this class.",
    "Quite self-explanatory. The class taught us the main elements of Latin grammar."

   "comments": [
    "This class covers a huge amount of material, which is great, but by the end of the semester I found myself wondering whether we might have covered nine chapters instead of ten? We essentially studied an entire chapter over the Thanksgiving break, and looked at the final chapter in the final few days of reading period (not a period of the Yale semester designed for the introduction of new material). A lot of this material then appeared on the final, which struck me as less than ideal, given that much of it hadn't been discussed at any length in class. To be clear, none of this is any fault of Sylva's, who is a fantastic teacher! But I wonder whether the class might gain a lot pedagogically from slightly slowing the pace.",
    "Strengths: Excellent professor (Sylva), cover basics of Latin in comprehensive survey, high workload (but also 1.5 credits so that's expected) Weaknesses: sometimes goes too fast for long periods, then will be really slow. Wished work was more evenly spaced. I would often spend 3 hours a couple nights in a row or, other weeks, do about an hour over the span of several days.",
    "I believe that the class is made quite unstable by being placed entirely in the hands of PhD students. As far as I am aware, Harvard has professors teach Intro to Latin and so do the rest of the colleges I know. It is not the case that PhD students are bad at teaching (I happened to have had a competent main instructor). Nonetheless, when their other responsibilities get in the way, they seem to be prone to lower the priority of the class, which makes for a bad experience for the students. I think it is very important that the tests be given a bit more attention. Otherwise, I am glad we were able to read real Latin texts.",
    "By no means, I think, should we try to cover ten chapters when one of them requires self-study over Thanksgiving break and the other is done over reading week"
