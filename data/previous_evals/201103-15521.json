   "comments": [
    "This is a fine class. It's funny because it doesn't feel earth shattering as you're sitting there at 9 am, but really, some of the concepts are just mind-boggling and fascinating. It think that it's a lot of information, and maybe not the best-taught course at Yale, but the textbook is really pretty good and it's an important class for future studies in math, medicine, economics, engineering. I'd recommend it.",
    "Math 120 is a course for Multivariable Calculus. Some of the concepts are difficult at first but become easier to grasp over time. The teacher is very friendly and should be able to explain anything to you. If you enjoy calculus or need a Multivariable class in order to take higher mathematics\/science courses, I encourage you to take this course.",
    "Yes, take this course if you are interested in math or wish to fulfill requirements. Just get a good teacher though.",
    "If you like math, and if you can get a great teacher like Dean Frailey, then yes! It is hard, but definitely manageable if you put in the work and ask for help when needed!",
    "It's an introduction to multivariable calculus. If you have a good instructor, the concepts usually make sense, but some things can be hard to visualize and take more of a time commitment to understand. It's significantly more challenging than single-variable calculus, but it's still not too bad. The course overall is definitely worth taking.",
    "Only take 120 is you want to be a scientist. If you want it for social science then take 118 instead. The advantage that physicists have in this course is overwhelming.",
    "Math 120 is a rather straightforward, standardized class. If you're the kind of person who thinks you'll do ANYTHING of a quantitative nature (math, science, econ, etc.) for a major, this is certainly a must-take. There are tons of resources to help you do well, from practice exams to office hours to extra review sessions, so as long as you put in the effort, you should get results! And if you can get Conor Frailey as your instructor, absolutely do it. He is SO personable and SO warm (he learned all of our names in my section!), and he presents everything really clearly. He also makes a huge effort to help each of his students stay on the same page as him as he navigates what can be difficult material. Overall, a solid course, and Frailey was a stellar instructor.",
    "Yes but work your ass off to get a good TA - that's entirely what makes the class. Lauer or Frailey are fantastic, get them!!",
    "Math 120 is a course in multivariable calculus. If you've taken AP Calculus BC, whether you got a bad score or not, you'll be prepared for this class. I got a 3 on the AP, and I did very well in this class. Of course, this is one of those classes that a lot of people HAVE to take, but it's not very hard. The topics can be a little weird, but if your prof is good, you'll be set. It picks up a lot during the last couple of weeks of the semester, but as long as you do practice problems, go to office hours, and do the problem sets, you'll be great!",
    "Take it if you genuinely like math or if you need to take it. The final exam is brutal. No amount of studying could have prepared me for that torture.",
    "If you are interested in taking a few more math courses in college, take Math 120 to get a feel for college level math.",
    "Math 120 is a reasonable class that is easy to complete with proper study. The class should be take only if necessary for a major or if someone really enjoys math.",
    "This course moves quickly through many topics that challenged me. I would definitely recommend this class to someone interested, like I was, in exploring calculus further and in a new direction.",
    "Having taken multivariable calculus in high school, I expected this course to be simple for me. Not so. But if you spend time beyond just the p-sets in working to fully understand each concept as it arises in class and in the text, it turns out to be quite fascinating. Conor Frailey is really helpful at explaining, as well as very sympathetic. Go to office hours, study with friends, and get a tutor; I wish I had."
