    "Well structured. Could have been better organized as to what was going to be tested. Other than that kept you engaged and made you study the vocabulary well.",
    "nothing to improve",
    "Strength: constant exposure to Korean and daily homework was helpful Weakness: sometimes the lesson plans seemed not to be very coordinated",
    "A major strength about the course is that it covers a wide array of topics. One drawback may be that some teaching areas are not developed thoroughly.",
    "Strengths: relaxed environment which allowed for a free, no pressure situation for students to make mistakes freely and learn. You can tell the professor cares about each student and puts in effort to adapt to everyone's varying skill levels. The professor made it fun and I looked forward to going every day. Weaknesses: wish there was more dialogue practice, pace was a bit fast at times and did not feel we thoroughly got to practice what we learned due to the pacing.",
    "The strengths of this course is that there was a lot of student participation, and there were many different methods the professor used to teach the language including watching a drama and singing songs.",
    "More opportunity to practice speaking."

    "Yes, to take advantage of the immersive language program if they are ready to commit to the work hours required",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It was challenging, yet I looked forward to attending class every day.",
