   "comments": [
    "Great class! interesting readings -- you're way better off in the class if you actually do all of them. Professor Thachil is great at leading discussion. You learn a lot if you're at all interested in Development or India, but it is a little light on the economics if that's what you're looking for.",
    "Definitely take it if you are interested in the topic. The readings can get a little dense sometimes but every seminar, we go over the main arguments of the readings and talk about them. Decent amount of work two 5page papers and one 15 page paper at the end.",
    "Yes- this is one of the best classes that I've taken at Yale on development. The readings are enjoyable and the class discussion is even more so.",
    "YES. The course gives a strong grounding in the main development paradigms of the last several decades, critical to both international and domestic politics. Professor Thachil is a pleasure to work with. He has an amazing ability to analyze the readings and show what is at stake with their understandings. Take it!",
    "Yes, absolutely. Prof Thachil, unlike far too many Yale profs, cares deeply about the act of teaching. He's young, dynamic, engaged, and builds a good rapport with students. He does a good job provoking and managing classroom debate.I was not especially interested or educated in India, international contexts, or development before I took this class, and I was still able to succeed and do fine (I say this for the benefit of other people in a similar situation who are considering taking the course).Fair, though not particularly easy, grader. Standard workload for any (non-gut) seminar.",
    "This class is fantastic. Professor Thachil is one of the best professors I've had. He challenged me to produce better work and it an amazing leader of class discussion. Wanted to nominate him for a teaching prize, but forgot. Promote him! He's amazing!",
    "Yes, if you are interested in development, and want to know more about south asia.",
    "Great class; take it. Prof. Thachil is incredible and really knows his stuff.",
    "Development in South Asia was a great course, with well-chosen material that provoked discussion. The greatest strength of the course was its teaching - Prof. Thachil, like a good political scientist, understands how to incentivize students to work! The topic areas ranged from gender and microfinance to import-substitution and colonial legacies. I came in without a very strong economics background and had no trouble. We addressed each set of topics as a problem... how do these different theories contradict each other? Does this education policy work, or not? How would you do it better?The course had very few weaknesses. Occasionally readings had less to do with the week's topic and were more grab-bag, but I still found them interesting and looked forward to doing the work for this class.I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Relevant topics, good discussion, fun. TAKE IT!",
    "I would whole-heartedly recommend this class to a fellow student. I have no reservations at all in my recommendation as the class was basically flawless. It was challenging, though-provoking and, if I were to critique it at all, I would only say I wish it were a year long so that we could cover more material. That material which we did cover, we discussed and debated thoroughly. This class is very rare at Yale - a blend of theory and case study - and anyone with an interest in South Asia, politics, development studies or economics should definitely take it.",
    "yes! definitely take it! This is a great class. I learned a lot about development - in India and elsewhere - from a very different perspective. Most of the readings are very interesting are engaging, though some weeks the readings do drag on.Discussions were lively and entertaining. I liked that we started each class with a reading from a newspaper article or a speech and then got into the assigned readings. This really helped get the conversation going. Prof. Thachil is amazing. He is very accessible and down to earth, and always willing to help you out with your work and other stuff - he genuinely cares about his students.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student, especially because the professor puts a lot of time and thought in to crafting worthwhile discussions. I would say that some background coursework in economics or international development would be very helpful, as some of the readings can be a bit technical. Overall, it was a wonderful course, and Professor Thachil is approachable and funny. A LOT OF READING."
