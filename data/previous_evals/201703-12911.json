    "I learned a great deal about judgment biases\/behavioral decision making phenomena such as the availability heuristic, focalism, mechanisms behind adaptation, contrast effects, the illusion of explanatory depth, and the use of feelings as information. I developed by research skills, understanding papers published in the field as well as foundations in experimental design and what it's like to conduct such research."

   "comments": [
    "this is a course where you get out of it what you put in, which is a strength and a weakness. sometimes classes felt a bit lacking in direction. maybe having a few discussion questions created by the professors would be nice. the times I felt that I learned the most were when one of the professors asked a question about why they authors did something the way they did or what would happen if the authors of papers had done something differently that really made me think about they underlying theory of behavior.",
    "The structure made a lot of sense for the goals of the course. Each week, three papers were assigned and one person led the discussion of each of them. The papers were highly relevant, new, and interesting. The only thing I would've wished, which was partially my own fault, was that I'd had more mentoring in the research proposal development process for our final paper."
