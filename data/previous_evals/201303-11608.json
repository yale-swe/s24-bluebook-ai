   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this if you're interested at all in the Middle East or Middle Eastern\/Muslim culture. You learn a lot about that. While previous knowledge will absolutely help you, don't feel like you can't take this just because you've never taken a class about the Middle East or are unfamiliar with the region. I think there were definitely a few of us in the class who were in that boat and we all ended up fine. Also a relatively light workload.",
    "This class was essentially a quest to explain the \"exceptionally\" violent and undemocratic nature of the Middle East in the context of political science theory. I would recommend this course if you have a genuine interest in both of those things--the Middle East and reading theoretical articles. To be sure, you also read a lot of things that are more focused on specific countries and not so theoretically grounded. Class discussions were fun and relaxed. Adria Lawrence is a great professor--very approachable, down-to earth, funny, and engaged with the students.",
    "Yes, I would. The workload isn't overwhelming and the payoff is worth it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is a great course if you are interested in learning how to construct and deconstruct arguments while also learning about the Middle East. I would not recommend this course if you are looking for a foundation in Middle Eastern History or politics, but rather want to investigate why we look at the Middle East the way that we do and what truth there is to the Middle East being different from everywhere else.",
    "Bigger focus on research design and methodology than I was expecting. Adria Lawrence is good and nice. Overall, ambivalent about the class.",
    "I would recommend it if they are interested in the academic side of studying the Middle East.",
    "A course that is really interesting for understanding more about the Middle East today that will challenge your view and perception of the region. However, a great deal of the class is spent examining the political science literature on region and proceeding to tear it to pieces, with the remark being made that \"political science treads the fine line between being tautologous and downright wrong\" about two thirds of the way through the class. This made me think that greater attention could be paid to actual developments in the middle east and away from what political scientists think the developments mean in a wider context, since every article we read seemed to have its argument dissected to the very minutiae and proven to be massively flawed or wrong (though this is perhaps more of a reflection on the academic subject that is political science than the class as a whole)",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they are very interested in the Middle East. As the class delves right into some pretty hardcore readings, I would recommend having some background in the Middle East before taking the class (although not required it'svery helpful). The class readings aren't too long (120 pgs. a week max) and are quite interesting. The workload for the class centers around writing 3 reading responses (500 words) and one final paper (12-15 pgs.). Professor Lawrence is very nice and specializes in Morocco. She may seem a bit of a tough grader at first but in the end it all works out. The class primarily focuses on methodology so if you don't like that then I would not recommend it. I would definitely advise for you to go to her office hours. Professor Lawrence is quite helpful during that time and you thus you will get a lot out of it.",
    "Take it. It's not at a bad time and you can definitely participate even if you haven't done the entire reading.",
