    "HIST184 is an excellent introduction to the important issue of slavery. Dr. Rugemer had a folksy style and at times I felt like a boy scout sitting around a campfire. While he was a strong lecturer, he could have done more to distinguish the most salient points from the smaller details. I also felt that there were significant issues in the way the assessment for the class was structured. While the proposal and draft for the final paper was a good attempt to provide feedback on student writing, the \"objective\" mid-term was highly arbitrary (by Dr. Rugemer's own admission), and assessed low-level skills.",
    "Totally take it. You learn a ton about slavery in the entire Atlantic World, not just the US, and attack the issue from many angles. The readings are VERY interesting, though the books are long and a few are pretty dry. I learned a lot about the challenges involved in historiography.",
    "Really interesting class that covers the Atlantic slave trade from its beginning to emancipation. The lectures are engaging and the readings assigned are sometimes long, but worth discussing! Assignments include a midterm, final, and a ten page essay. One thing to note is that formatting of exams is a bit different than typical history courses.",
    "Pretty good class. Lectures aren't mindblowingly good, but will still provide a strong overview of Atlantic slavery beyond the US context. The readings are pretty good, so do them even if you have to skim. There is about a book a week assigned, but no one reads them in entirety.",
    "Really great class to take Cr\/D! I found that I learned a lot and always enjoyed coming to lecture. The grading is very fair.",
    "This class is a more in depth look at the contributing factors to the rise and fall of Atlantic slavery, with a variety of historical interpretations and perspectives. It's definitely an important class to take in order to understand the long history of oppression that has shaped Atlantic society and the way our society remains haunted by this dark, often oversimplified history.",
    "A lot of people take it because they have to, but you will learn a lot. Maps are important. Read the books if you can because they're interesting, but not very necessary.",
    "Absolutely fascinating course that covers the rise and fall of Atlantic slavery. It is particularly fascinating because it is global in scope--you cover events in the Caribbean and in Brazil, which are often left out of other courses.",
    "Great class, definitely take it if you're even remotely interested (which you should be -- seriously). I'm a psych major and had never taken a history class before, and this certainly gave me a great first impression of the history department at Yale. The lectures are very engaging, and I never got bored during them. Professor Rugemer is knowledgeable, likable and very fair in the assessments that he gives. Tests are quite straightforward and don't require a great deal of preparation. Readings can be a bit long (you read basically a short book a week), though if you're used to that kind of thing, you should be totally fine. Besides, it's frankly not necessary to do *all* of the reading, especially if you're running short on time that week - you're not directly tested on the books, so reading just a few important chapters is usually okay for contributing to discussion sections and writing weekly forum posts. You also write a research paper for this class, which is pretty fun because it can be about any slavery-related topic you want, and the guidelines are pretty unrestrictive. If you're even considering this class, at the very least shop it!",
    "Take it! One of my favorite lectures at Yale. It really gave me a better understanding on the history and legacies of white supremacy and anti-blackness. I'd say the most crucial point is learning about the emergence of racial thinking.",
    "Spring 2016: AFAM 160 is a great way to learn about the history of slavery, much more effective than say the retention of the name \"Calhoun College\". This course allows all students to critically engage with that history, not at the emotional expense of students of color forced to bear Calhoun's name. But I digress. Although it spends more time on the United States, its focus is larger in scope as it addresses slavery as it existed across the Atlantic World (from Cuba, Brazil, Jamaica, Haiti, and other places in Americas). Rugemer is a great professor. Incredibly knowledgable on the subject, Rugemer presents each lecture as an engaging story. The assignments are weekly readings with 250 word responses, an \"objective\" midterm and final exam, a take home final, and an 8-10 page research paper. Standard for a history course. Definitely the course to take to learn an incredible amount about the complexities of slavery and its legacy. As I said, a great way to engage with the history.",
    "Take it! It is so interesting and completely changes the way that you understand American slavery and Atlantic slavery more broadly. I learned so much. The lectures are engaging and the readings are good, and it is a great class in general.",
    "Great material. Not great exams.",
    "I would definitely recommend Rise and Fall of Atlantic Slavery to other students. I think this is one of the classes at Yale that ALL students should take before graduating. Take this class to learn more about the roots of slavery and how its influence persists today. I think taking this class is crucial to understanding modern-day race relations. Although this class is very history\/Af-Am major-heavy, I think it's accessible to students of all majors. Professor Rugemer is a fantastic lecturer, and each class passes by extremely quickly. You learn about so many diverse aspects of Atlantic slavery throughout the semester. However, this course does have a bit of a heavier workload. You read a book a week, submit weekly reading responses (200 words), take an objective midterm, write a final research paper, write a take-home final exam essay, and take a sit-down final exam. Although this class intensifies finals period, I can promise that you will learn so many new things and you will not regret taking this class.",
    "The title of the course says it all. It is an excellent course, but to get the most out of the class it is crucial to attend every single lecture. You will not regret it.",
    "First: Rugemer is concerningly racially insensitive for a professor teaching the history of Black slavery, so be aware. But as for the content of the class, you will learn a ton about slavery: its origins, related philosophy, the first wave with the colonization of the Americas, the second wave with the industrial revolution, a range of abolitionist movements, and the chronology of emancipation. The class isnt entirely US-centered, and talks a good deal about the history of the Caribbean islands and Brazil. There is a 12-page long primary source essay, which is highly flexible and I found a good way to dive into the archive in a more individualized way (personally, I explored the history of slavery in my own hometown). The tests were terrible, though they were all objective fill-in-the-blanks that were completely unfair. Furthermore, Rugemer assigned three final assignments between reading period and finals, so that was hell. But hopefully theyll fix these problems, in which case you should absolutely take the class, because the information is SO important. Learn our histories all of them.",
    "I would recommend this course. I think it is very easy for white people to underestimate what slavery actually involved and this course (particularly its syllabus) provided a rich, nuanced picture of the period of Atlantic slavery. I wished lectures had been less broad, but my classmates made section thoughtful and impactful. The assignments are back-heavy - we had a final, research paper and our final exam within a few days of each other."
