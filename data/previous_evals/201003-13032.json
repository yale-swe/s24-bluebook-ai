   "comments": [
    "This is a great course if you really want to improve your conversational French. You read numerous articles and chapters of the book in French, and then you discuss in class. Class discussions were my favorite part of the course, because the topics we discussed were issues that interested me anyways, such as gay marriage, environmental problems, and immigration laws. Beware though - the work load is hefty for a language course. You have to write many responses to readings for each class, have 4 vocab exams, 2 oral exams, 1 audio exam, and a presentation over the course of the semester.",
    "It's a great discussion class. Fran\u00e7oise Schneider is an absolute joy to meet a couple of times a week to discuss cool topics about modern French society (that apply to many other contexts as well). The material assigned is just the right amount of homework.",
    "Great class overall, especially for those who wish to improve their speaking skills. Would definitely recommend.",
    "Basically, French 160 was a class aimed at improving language speaking skills. The students do reading \/ watch a movie and respond in about 200 words for each class and then class time is spent discussing the various topics. The class covers a lot of the problems facing France. There are 4 vocab exams, a listening exam, 2 oral exams, and a bunch of other assignments, but none of them weigh too heavily on your grade, since there are so many grades in the class. I would recommend this to any student who wants to learn about France \/ finds the country interesting, would like to practice their overall language, and likes actively participating in class.",
    "I would recommend French 160, especially if you have a special interest in French culture or intend to go to France soon. You will have to participate substantively and frequently in discussion, and you'll have to complete homework assignments for every class. At first, these obligations will feel like a lot of work, but you get used to it very quickly and in the end you'll appreciate how much you've improved your written and spoken French, and how much you've learned about contemporary France. Prof. Schneider was a lot of fun, very engaging, kind, and helpful, and it was nice to have a native Frenchwoman teaching this class in particular.",
    "Yes, yes, and yes, particularly with Prof. Schneider! She is wonderful. So passionate about France and improving your French--you'll grow to appreciate her quickly. The course as a whole is great too. It covers nearly every aspect of modern French culture. You read newspaper articles, watch clips from French news programs, etc. The workload is not insignificant, but the assignments are mostly minor. A must for anyone wishing to learn about modern France and improve their French at the same time.",
    "I highly, highly recommend this to a student interested in learning about contemporary French culture, especially a student planning to visit France in the near future. I also highly recommend this to a student dedicated to working on his or her speaking skills--this course necessitates a willingness to speak, and pretty much guarantees noticeable improvement.",
    "An excellent class taught by an intelligent, kind, and welcoming woman. She wants her students to succeed. She is very motivated and intensely interested in what she teaches, both knowledgeable and enthusiastic. My skills in speaking, listening, and writing noticeably improved. Fun, thought-provoking class that teaches about French culture and culture in general.",
    "It's a good conversation class. Take it with Schneider if you can."
