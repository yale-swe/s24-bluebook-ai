   "comments": [
    "Besides it being required for Physiology students, I think this is an extremely valuable introduction to the breadth of physiology and to scientific thinking in general, so I would highly recommend this course. In fact, I wish a similar course was offered in the spring to continue this type of training.",
    "This course allows an intimate learning environment for both the students and professors invited to speak. Students are encouraged to think critically about the weekly assigned papers which span a wide range of fields. The way each invited professor leads\/gives discussions\/lectures varies. However, except for a few professors, all the professors are interested in being there and talking about science and intriguing problems with students. This course is rightly a requirement for the first years in the department.",
    "It is very necessary to choose this course to be familiar with current research progress in the Department of Physiology as well as to put what we will learn from Physiological Systems into practice."

   "comments": [
    "This course was extremely valuable, I think, in shaping my future experimental designs and scientific way of thinking. I'm sure the fundamental concepts I learned from this course will prove to be very valuable to my future dissertation and research.",
    "This course not only increases my knowledge about current research topics in my department, but also provides a great chance to tighten the interaction between students and faculties, which is very helpful for deciding which lab to set up the rotation project."
