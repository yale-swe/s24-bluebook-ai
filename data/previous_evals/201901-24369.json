    "Statistical analysis in R, writing a paper in APA format, designing experiments",
    "Administrating of neuropsych portions of interviews as well as general lab protocol and etiquette. I also learned a lot from listening to the grad students during lab meetings every week. I thought it was a huge advantage to hear about their work and their research.",
    "I learned a lot about the beginning stages of designing a study, including doing background research and thinking about study design.",
    "Working in a psych lab during my time at Yale was a huge opportunity for work experience and developing practical skills in psychological research. The CANDLab was such a warm and inviting place to do this.",
    "I learned how to conduct a study in psychology. I learned about conscious and non-conscious perception and learning. I learned about working with a team, problem-solving, and staying calm under pressure. I learned about critiquing and learning from other studies.",
    "Research methods, organizational skills",
    "Hands-on research experience.",
    "I learned what it was like to work in a research lab, and I developed critical thinking skills.",
    "Throughout the semester, I developed both my wet lab and data analysis skills. I also learned a lot about other research in the field, especially through a review that I wrote on existing findings.",
    "Research design and methods, subject recruiting and interaction, fMRI data processing",
    "I learned about how to work with data, how to run participants, and learned new statistical models for interpreting data."

   "comments": [
    "I really liked being able to do a variety of different research tasks, like coding responses and running studies on participants, as well as planning for future studies.",
    "I really enjoyed this course, and it is by far the most useful one I have taken.",
    "Dylan is great she is very good at keeping in touch with people and making sure they are happy in the lab. Strengths are the skills I learned weaknesses are time commitment",
    "The course is great how it is.",
    "The directed research program is what you make of it. The independent study structure works really well when you have a clear project on which you will work. In this course, one can learn skills and knowledge that most other courses offered at Yale don't teach. However, at times, my project did not progress as planned, and so I had to adjust my original vision. This change is not necessarily a bad thing; one just has to understand that research can be unpredictable, and they must be ready to adapt.",
    "My research experiences at the CAN lab are highly reward and intellectually stimulating",
    "I found PSYC 493 to be an incredible opportunity to learn about and engage with psychology research. After this semester, I have a much clearer understanding of my research interests."

   "comments": [
    "If youre willing to put the time in every day all semester by being I lab, the work itself isnt too bad",
    "Great move.",
    "Yes! It was so great to get credit for doing research in my lab.",
    "Yes! Research for credit is a huge live saver.",
    "I would recommend this to students who are seeking research experience.",
    "YES! I thought this was a great chance to learn about real world psychologists and their projects.",
    "Yes great experience but big time commitment",
    "I think a good deal of thought needs to go into how to improve this course. On the one hand, the opportunity to do research is unbelievably valuable and something that I think all students should do at some point. That said, the expectations for the course need to be reconsidered. Turning in 15 pages of writing for a P\/F course doesn't make much sense, especially since a thesis is 20 pages. This amount of writing would be entirely reasonable if you were given lab time to write, but in most cases, you are not. As a result, you end up spending far more than the already significant number of scheduled hours doing additional work. It's fantastic that this course is offered, but it would be a much stronger option if there were clearer expectations as to what students are doing during their scheduled lab hours.",
    "Truly depends on the lab and project you're working on. If it's something that interests you, I think this is one of the best courses you can take because you get real experience working in a lab (especially if you're considering grad school).",
    "If you have a clear project in mind, then yes. Otherwise, really think about what you hope to get out of it. It definitely is not for everyone, as the project and design comes from you, so really consider if it is something that you want and will be able to do.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would absolutely recommend PSYC 493 to another student because it provided me with a unique opportunity to develop a relationship with a graduate student and psychology professor and gave me a better understanding of what I'm interested in pursuing after my undergraduate years."
