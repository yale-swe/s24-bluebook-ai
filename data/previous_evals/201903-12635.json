   "comments": [
    "Statistics Background, OLS, Randomized Experiments.",
    "I had a deeper understanding of basic concepts and useful theories in econometrics, including power calculations, linear regressions, and randomized experiments, etc.",
    "I think this is one of the best courses that I have had the privilege of taking -- all of the classes went into the much needed depth, talking about intellectual history as much as rationale and criticism of widely used econometric methods. I understood RCTs and broadly just developed a good sense of judgement and analytical skills that are not just needed to excel in academics but in life. Highly recommend this course.",
    "Covered estimation and evaluation of estimators. Extensive coverage of hypothesis testing and experimental design. The experimental design aspect is useful for those who will be conducting research of their own. Spent the last week discussing regression.",
    "The why and how behind that statistical analysis that we do.",
    "1) important basic concepts in probability and statistics i.e. expectation, variance, distributions etc. 2) critical evaluation of different approaches to presenting results of statistical analyses i.e. hypothesis tests (and the importance of the alternative hypothesis), p-values, confidence intervalls 3) econometrics of randomized control trials\/social experiments 4) linear regression and OLS estimators and its properties",
    "I learned about basic econometric concepts like estimators, bias, consistency, power and errors. I also learned about the theoretical structure of randomized control trials.",
    "I could understand how the concepts in the course correspond reality.",
    "indepth intuition",
    "econometrics theory, basic statistical knowledge, randomized control trial etc.",
    "Learned a lot on experiments and testing, and the beginning lessons on regression.",
    "Understanding of probability, distribution, RCT, etc.",
    "Nice introduction and reeducation on the foundations of econometrics. Very useful to work through important concepts with pen and paper, and to be challenged on extensions.",
    "I have learned econometrics theories in applied scenarios with examples like RCT.",
    "subject knowledge",
    "I developed a good understanding of Randomised experiments, statistical analysis and empirical work.",
    "I understood the core concepts of graduate-level econometrics.",
    "We went over everything from basic statistics (expectation) to randomized controlled trials and OLS regression. I t was a deep dive into topics most of us have already seen, but really enlightening. We learned about many critical details practitioners often overlook or do not take care of enough.",
    "Application of Econometric knowledge in academia, especially in terms of papers on Randomized Control Trials.",
    "Detailed knowledge of econometric techniques used in economics"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The pace of the course was a little too slow. Content was easy, problem sets manageable - but often examinations were too tough and did not test conceptual understanding\/basics.",
    "The review of probability and statistics might be too long. It took almost half a semester, while some of the concepts could be reviewed on our own.",
    "Strengths: The material, i.e. the notes that really went into the depths of the subject matter, the topics being covered, right from theoretical frameworks to applied ones, a great bridge. Real world examples making this course really \"applied\". Weaknesses: Maybe cover the material in time for the exam (and not cover new stuff the week before exam :))",
    "Spent too much time on estimation to begin the semester, which resulted in only two lectures on regression. Cutting down the early semester lecture content in favor of additional regression coverage would be beneficial. Regression should be given more coverage.",
    "I think the course was well structured, I don't know how it could be improved.",
    "Strengths 1) coherent way of teaching i.e. the sequence of topics is structured so as to build on previously taught knowledge 2) critical evaluation of different approaches to presenting statistical results 3) sensibiliation to \"traps\" in statistical analyses 4) room for great discussions of students' questions 5) great connection of theory to applied examples Weaknesses 1) timing: in my view, a little more time could have been spent on linear regression and a little less time on RCTs",
    "The main strength of the course is that everything is covered in detail, so you have a good understanding of the content that is covered. The notes are also really detailed which ensures that it's really easy to revise after class. Despite being an econometrics course, we did not cover linear regression or OLS until the final couple of weeks of the course such that it was a bit rushed. It would be beneficial to learn this before learning about randomization, since linear regression is the basis of econometrics.",
    "perhaps go a little faster for topics",
    "There is a lot of material, and the lecture notes are very thorough and helpful, as is Professor Boozer. It would be better if there was more structure in the course though, and if we had the dates of exams ahead of time. Also, a lot of the lecture material was dry, and the final exam was a lot harder than any of the HW assignments and midterm. The HW and midterm were fair though.",
    "As a non-IDE student, I found it difficult to catch up with the course. I've heard that IDE students have had math camp during orientation. If the material can be shared with us, it would be great.",
    "Great, engaging lectures. Great coverage of important concepts, incredibly useful to have context on how various tools are used and misused. Lecture notes and problem sets oddly verbose.",
    "I have never learned metrics this deep and clear. I feel that I definitely know the more about power and how it's developed and used than my other friends studying compacted metrics classes.",
    "the teaching was at times slow but at the same time it wasn't rushed for the sake of finishing the portion, the pset and exam were insightful though tough",
    "The course was very informative.",
    "This is a rigorous course but the lecture notes and material make it quite accessible. More problem sets would allow for greater practice.",
    "Strength: Attention to detail, deep dive Weaknesses: Considering that this is a one-year Master's, I wish we could have moved a little faster.",
    "Strength - Very Application-Based, It was interesting to relate it to the already existing work in academia Weakness - The regression part of the course required more time.",
    "No weaknesses Class discussions and detailed explanations by the instructor were strengths"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, essential econometric training.",
    "Yes. Generally it lays a good foundation for understanding and producing econometrics work.",
    "This is a fabulous course for someone looking to learn econometrics for applied work. You will not get a better teacher and method of instruction outside of 558. Highly recommend!",
    "This course is well suited for students conducting research\/experiments in the future. The lack of regression content or applied methods would keep me from recommending this course to most students.",
    "Yes, it's vital to understanding the basic assumptions behind economic analysis.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I think it is a great course to enhance knowledge in econometrics with a particular focus on randomized control trials\/social experiments. It does not assume too much prior knowledge, but the pace of teaching makes the course even valuable to students with prior knowledge in econometrics. I would recommend this course especially because of the critical evaluation of different approaches to presenting\/ obtaining statistical results, which enables students to be able to assess the credibility and validity of any statistical analyses.",
    "Yes",
    "if a student loves building intuition, this is the perfect course",
    "Yes. Good exposure to econometric knowledge.",
    "I would recommend this course if you need it for your degree AND if you have taken previous courses on Econometrics\/Statistical Inference. I think it is a difficult class for people with no prior background.",
    "Yes. but it would be better if students have taken pre-requisite courses.",
    "Yes! Great way to learn foundational material.",
    "Definitely yes.",
    "yes sure",
    "It is highly recommended to students who wish to gather better understanding of the logical reasoning behind econometric analysis.",
    "Yes, this course allows me to understand graduate level econometrics at a fundamental level. I am grateful for this because I feel more secure in my understanding of research papers in economics.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has the feeling that they think they know statistics and regression but at the same time aren't sure how to use these tools practically. It was quite astonishing how much is overlooked in basic statistics courses and just taken for granted. This course talks a lot more about the background and reason for certain typical 'go-to behaviors'.",
    "Yes, for any student having an interest in analytical understanding and aiming to strengthen their econometric foundation, this is the perfect course.",
    "Yes"
