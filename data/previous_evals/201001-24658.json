    "Yes. This is the best class at Yale.",
    "Fun class. You learn a bunch of stuff about yale's history that you wouldn't have guessed otherwise. Assignments are fun to do and Jay Gitlin is about the best person in the world.",
    "This class should be mandatory for every Yale student. Fun and fulfilling, and I appreciate Yale so much more now. Also, Professor Gitlin is the most enthusiastic and engaging Professor I've ever had.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in the history of America through a Yale lens. It's not a class on Yale's history, but more a course that incorporates Yale history and the lives of many important and famous Yalies.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! It will provide you with a history of our institution that makes walking around school all the more special.",
    "Take. This. Class. This is why you come to Yale.",
    "Great class!!",
    "This class was a great class to take as a senior. Not a ton of work (as there's no reason to do most. Don't expect to learn like you would in a lecture, but Gitlin is great.",
    "Great class. Professor Gitlin is incredibly funny and had so many stories to share about the past 30 years at Yale. I felt like the syllabus was a little scatterbrained and that we didn't spend too much time talking about what was actually on it. The class involved minimal work (1 paper, 1 presentation, and 1 term paper), and it was totally unnecessary to do the readings, but we still learned a LOT about the important themes of American history, all of which Yale participated in. An extremely fun class and an interesting way to look at how Yale and America have changed and intersected over the past three centuries. Gitlin is the bomb!",
    "Yale and America is the best! TAKE IT! If the topic isn't the reason, definitely take it for Professor Gitlin--his stories are incredible. You won't even realize you have been in seminar for 2 hours. I loved this class! DO IT!",
    "A course on the role of Yale in America's history and how Yale itself has changed over time",
    "yes, best class at Yale",
    "Amazing course, take it if you can get in!"
