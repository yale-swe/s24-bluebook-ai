This class is a must-take if you're intent on working in the statistics\/data science field for your career or even for an internship. You learn the basis of Machine Learning and models that are actually useful in research and your future career as well. This is a must-take if you're a serious Statistics\/Data Science major, or even as a Computer Science major.",

    "The first half of the class was a great tour in classical and orthodox machine learning technique from the last few decades. Some of this is looking at statistical techniques (such as linear regression) from a machine learning perspective (bias vs.variance tradeoff). The course really shines in giving students skills in this area - both in the theory and the application. The second half of the class focuses on more novel techniques such as neural networks and language models. Much of the material in this section has been produced\/developed with in the last 5-10 years. (The language model pset is based on research published 5 years ago, for example). So, students looking for a class to give them a rigorous undergrad level training in ML are looking in the right place. That being said, the class does not covery everything. For one, we never covered support vector machines. Although, this class gives you the skills necessary to go learn that you own. Second, there is not much time spent on neural networks. There are many reasons for this and they are all justified. This class makes students particularly good statistical thinkers and forces them to scrutinize the various methods we learn and datasets to work with instead of just cramming material - which is far more productive.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The early and late psets helped with understanding the material more thoroughly. The math problems associated helped with understanding in middle psets where most of the work was just using particular packages. The material is very interesting and relevant. Derek clearly cares about the class and his students. Weaknesses: Some of the middle psets which depended more on using packages were easier but didn't contribute to understanding nearly as much. Derek is still working on improving his teaching -- he is good at explaining more conceptual material, but gets bogged down in the technical material. I often found going to the websites where he found the images on his slides much more informative than the lectures (Colah's blog posts do set a high bar).",
    "Grading needs to be more distributed than just being solely based on the midterm (since the averages for the problem sets are really high). Perhaps have 2 midterms, or 1 midterm and a final? Aside from that, I cannot emphasize how important this course is and how much it's taught me this semester. Derek really goes in-depth in many different methods and we delve into the math behind the methods as well, something that I think is absolutely beautiful and very important to learn. So many kids in this major literally just run functions and blindly write code in R without actually understanding what is happening mathematically (and you are doomed to fail if you continue to do so, even in your job - as this separates good from great in the field of data science) , and this course really dives deep. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Strengths: This class is super interesting! The TA's are very responsive, helpful, and nice. Professor Feng is also really great! When we were super confused about something, he took a whole another lecture to go back and re-explain everything to us which was helpful. He also extended a p-set so it wouldn't be due on Halloween which was nice and also funny. I would definitely really recommend this class to S&DS majors or other people that are interested. Weaknesses: sometimes slides would be hard to understand in the moment of lecture, but then when it is time to do p-sets and you're looking over them, they are very clear and good resources.",
    "I think the assignments were good. Tests were a bit difficult because they sometimes seemed to go a bit beyond what we did in lectures, or the kinds of thinking we covered in lecture. The last several weeks of the course spiked pretty hard in difficulty, and I didn't understand what was going on that well, although getting the last p-set to work was rewarding. I think more comprehensive notes than just the powerpoint slides would have helped a lot, like Derek sometimes did.",
    "This course was one of the most unpleasant ones that I have ever taken at Yale. I cannot remember a single other time that I was so constantly stressed about the material of a course. The main drawback must have been the psets. All of them, except one, were extremely long and hard and went way beyond the things that we were taught during class time. Solving a pset took me on average anywhere between 15 to 25 hours, most of this time being dedicated to a \"treasure hunt\" of answers on the internet. The psets themselves would provide minimal guidance on how to solve the problems. The entire solving process would be equivalent to trying to guess what exactly the professor meant with each of the questions. At this point, a curious reader may ask \"why didn't you just ask the professor for help?\" Well, in his effort to not \"give away the answer\" he always responded super ambiguously to our questions with ridiculous answers like \"just do the math.\" Let me give you an analogy that hopefully will make you to better understand this terrible pset situation. Imagine that you are taking a cooking class with a really advanced chef as your instructor. He presents you with some basic cooking techniques during his classes and everything seems to be going well until the assignments start coming in. You are suddenly instructed to cook a \"Beef Wellington,\" a dish that you have never heard the name before and have never been taught how to cook it. When you start reading the assignment the only thing given to you are the ingredients. The recipe is missing. When you turn to the chef to ask him how to pull off this dish he just responds with \"just do the cooking.\" Then you spend frantically the next week trying to find from every conceivable source the recipe for the mysterious \"Beef Wellington.\" You ask your peers and you spend countless hours just guessing about what the correct recipe may be. Now, how exactly does this process benefit learning in any way, shape or form? The only pset that I truly enjoyed doing was pset 6, where the professor for once provided a detailed guide on how to do each step. However, he returned back to the regime of ambiguity with the next pset. The concepts taught were interesting but I just wished the psets were done in a way that facilitated learning and had more of a direct connection to the things that we were taught in class. Additionally, I believe that many of the topics were not taught to an appropriate depth to be put in an exam or a pset. I think that almost anyone can agree that all the material after the second half of the course was not properly taught. Proof of this is how most people just memorized the slides for the last quiz and a part of the midterm. I suggest that in the future the professor decides to cover fewer topics which are going to be covered to a greater extend.",
    "The lectures in the first part of the class seemed intuitive and organized. However, in the second half, they became more haphazard and difficult to follow. Also, the problem sets at times become more implementing R coding tricks than actually learning the concepts of the class. Also, the quizzes\/exams didn't really seem to test knowledge of the material but rather detailed knowledge of things briefly mentioned or not mentioned at all in class, which was frustrating.",
    "the lecture is a bit confusing",
    "The psets really helped me learn the material well. However, I didnt feel like the exam was super fair considering how the course was taught-I think it could be improved if Derek did something like a pollEverywhere quiz question at the beginning of each class.",
    "The material of this course is fascinating, and I learned about a lot of ML methods that will probably come in handy someday. However, this course was seriously inhibited by the staff. Derek's lectures were pretty subpar; a lot of the slides and his explanations made little to no sense. I got more help from the 355 materials than those for this class. In fact, the people who did the best on the midterm were the ones who relied least on the lectures and slides. In addition to its lackluster teaching, S&DS 365 is also fairly disorganized. Its strategy is to rely heavily on the TAs and Piazza, which isn't exactly a great way to lead a class.",
    "We went very in depth into each topic we had. Having both the theory and the coding aspect of this course really elevated my understanding and excitement for the field. We covered a lot of the groundbreaking techniques, especially some pioneered by Yale professors themselves (i.e. topic models by Lafferty). I wish we had been able to get into GANs a bit more. I also wish we had a final project that allowed us to explore our individual interests in the field and also provide another substantial evaluation outside of the midterm. The quizzes were actually great and motivated me to keep on top of the work which made this class honestly made the course actually more enjoyable. I wish the quizzes were worth a bit more or that we had a final evaluation. Professor Feng is great and really cares about his students. He makes time and shares his research and helps you find stuff that you're interested in.",
    "Strengths: - assignments are set up so you learn a fair bit Weaknesses: - lectures and syllabus structure make it a bit unclear what to focus on in learning and thoroughly learn the required mathematical material",
    "Strengths -- relevant and interesting materials, Prof Feng and Colleen the TA are wonderful and care deeply about the students. -- Weaknesses -- Prof Feng's lectures are often convoluted and not particularly clear. He often stumbles over explanations and cannot clearly or concisely answer students questions. He sometimes fails to explain the basic implementation of concepts which leaves students confused. An example of this would be our discussion of word embeddings, where there was oodles of notation and little explanation about what any of the notation or equations meant. Another weak. Another weakness arises due to the nature of this course being 365 instead of 355. Given that we are responsible for much more of the theoretical mathematics and statistics behind the methods we are learning, students sometimes struggled to understand to what extent we will be tested on the theory on quizzes and midterms, and Prof Feng did not always respond clearly. Another weakness is that homework solutions are not posted, so it is difficult to know where we went wrong in implementation. On a similar vein, the assignments are not always worded very clearly.",
    "Strengths: The lectures are well organized as is the class material in general. It was easy to learn in this class due to the syllabus, the quizzes, and the psets. In particular, the PSETs were excellent. No only were they fun to do, the questions were well-posed and provided an apt amount of guidance to help students both learn and accurately display their performance in the class. Time was spent a office hours not figuring out the minutiae of the psets but asking difficult questions focused on the material. On top of all of this, the professor and TAs were there to help students learn and not to punish them. Weaknesses: Not many. The second half of the course seems like it is still under development for the department. If the second half of the course was as structured and well-paced as the first the class would be impeccable.",
    "Strengths - the course material is relevant Weaknesses - the lectures dont really help much with the problem sets",
    "The topics covered were interesting and the psets in forced the material as well as develop skills programming skills in R.",
    "Teaching could be better",
    "Pset solutions or corrections would be nice. Also explaining a little but more of the math behind these topics instead of leaving all of them as proofs to complete based on conceptual aspects learned in lecture.",
    "The course has good content but it could be improved by a more direct form of teaching such as interact programming or the like in class.",
    "The strengths are that you cover a lot of important topics that are helpful for data science and machine learning. The psets help you understand the material (or rather force you to understand the material better) since the lectures are so theoretical and math heavy it's easy to get lost. The lectures are kind of dry and unclear at times and the lectures don't really help you with the psets all that much. The psets also take a very long time to do so make sure to start early. The quizzes and midterm are also pretty hard since the true and false can be on very specific things on the lectures but manageable. Just make sure to understand the main algorithms.",
    "A major weakness was that it was at 9am. I think the lectures were also sometimes a little vague or hard to understand. The quizzes and exams sometimes had very detail-oriented or memorization-oriented questions so it was hard to know what to study. The problem sets often had difficult conceptual questions, but Derek was often reluctant to answer questions related to problem sets for fear of giving students the answer - but I feel he leaned too far in the opposite direction and left students asking for help on their own. A strength was that I do feel that I understand machine learning fundamentals deeply - I am particularly happy that we spent so long on stochastic gradient descent, because it turned out to be so important for neural nets and other techniques later in the course. I wish that some of the problem sets had been in Python so we could have learned both. I also wish that the problem sets had been written more clearly, particularly with regard to which methods we had to implement ourselves and which we were allowed to use built-in libraries for.",
    "The lecture slides were really helpful but the lecture itself could be more engaging.",
    "Strengths: The psets are annoying but they do teach you a lot. The material is also really interesting and I think fairly well structured. Derek's lecture slides imo were good! So good in fact that i (sometimes?) didn't go to class oops Weaknesses: It's at 9am. It's also not the easiest class because there's a lot of prereqs and a decent amount of math involved. Also this year there was also 355 so presumably the curve in 365 was a lot worse :( everyone in it was really smart",
    "I learned via the problem sets. I found the lectures to be difficult to follow at times, getting bogged down in derivations that weren't super important. I think the problem sets are a clear strength, though they can take a long time if you wait until the last night.",
    "I loved this course and thought it reached the right balance between rigor (I feel like I mostly understand what we talked about and why) and accessibility.",
    "Covers a decent range of methods and with each theory and application is explored. However, the methods are very basic and are probably outdated for use in the real world.",
    "Most of my learning came from working out how to complete the homework assignments on my own, rather than from lecture.",
    "Some of the methods used in R are quite complex. The methods are actually complex on their own in theory, and moving them to code can compound confusion. Perhaps the class could use more coding guidance, as well a review of important linear algebra concepts.",
    "The class quite often felt like we gave more time to some ideas and less time to others, while each were equally present in the quizzes, which made it tough on occasion to learn new material. Additionally, I had issues with the way that office hours were scheduled at the same time on various days, because athletic practices quite often prohibited my access to them. It was a class that took a huge portion of my life this semester, and while the material was engaging, it made it difficult for me to also be as highly engaged in other classes at the same time. My biggest issue however, and this is a serious one, is how this class demanded a huge amount of computational processing from student's computers. My computer is old, and I can't afford a new one. As a result, homeworks took me several more hours to complete than some of my peers as I waited for programs to run. I was at a detriment because of the equipment I own, and I know others who were in a similar situation, which inherently feels unfair. I think that restructuring the assignments so that these massive tasks aren't asked of student's computers would level the playing field."

   "comments": [
    "This course has relevant material but it will frustrating to get that material from attending lectures. I would recommend the class if you need it, if you want to figure out the psets and material on your own, and if you have some friends taking the class you can study with and figure out the material with.",
    "Yes, yes, yes. Please take this course if you want a serious class in machine learning. The techniques and math you learn in this class will be so applicable to the work you do, whether that's in data science, statistics, or even quantitative research. If you're set on working in statistics\/computer science, this is a must take. The psets are really fun, and you learn a ton. Plus, a lot of kids complain about how hard it is, but if you really put in the time and GO to lecture where Derek talks about the methods, then you will learn so much. Take this if you're genuinely interested in learning about machine learning and statistics, not because machine learning is \"hyped up\". Also, please just don't credit-D this course, that's really just half-assing it.",
    "Yes for sure! I learned a lot and think that the professor was great.",
    "The course was a solid introduction to ML concepts. I certainly did learn a lot so in that sense, it was a worthwhile experience. It is a fair amount of work and the midterm\/quizzes are rather difficult. I would not take it if your other classes are too onerous.",
    "NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT. STAY AWAY. The course is simply too disorganized and challenging for me to be able to recommend it as an elective course to a data science student. The only reason that I would suggest anyone taking this course would be if they are already really comfortable with the concepts before going to the course and just need an official certification for their knowledge. For anyone who is new to data science the topics are just so ill-taught that you will spend most of your days just googling for the answers in the psets as they were never taught during lecture. If you are deciding between two elective course please choose the other option. You will be saved from countless hours of stress and potential mental deterioration.",
    "The class contents are all crucial to serve as a basis of ML, but the lecture can sometimes be confusing and I often rely on StatQuest youtube videos to understand key concepts",
    "This class is absolutely not for the faint of heart. Be prepared to spend around 20 hours per week on the PSETS at the minimum, and don't expect the office hours to be especially helpful. The class is heavily determined by problem sets and a single midterm exam, so make sure to take that into account as well. I definitely learned a lot and am glad to have taken the course, but the process was a grind. Make sure to check out Professor Feng's Yelp page; it'll help you get through the semester for sure.",
    "Yes-machine learning is a critical skill to have for anybody who wants to work in a stem field in the future",
    "Yes because 1) its content is interesting and 2) they have no better option.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Probably not, the assignments take a long time",
    "I would recommend this course to another only if they need it for their major. While I do not know as much about the other machine learning class 355, I have heard that it is taught very well and that their lectures are clear. Additionally that class is taught in Python, which is more more useful for actual machine learning applications.",
    "Absolutely Yes, especially if the class is taught by Feng. Whether your are applied math, CS, S&DS, or any other quantitative major, take this class. The math is not too difficult nor is the programing. As long as you have the statistical background this class will be nothing but useful for you. Easily in my top 5 classes at Yale. The lighter your schedule, the better the class will be. But it's very reasonable to take in a busy semester if you manage the time well.",
    "I would only recommend it if you need it for your major",
    "yes, if you are interested in practical approach to ML and learning some R.",
    "yes, incredible course",
    "Take this class if you absolutely want to learn machine learning. I do not recommend if you are looking for a average to easy class though.",
    "This course is good for getting a broad overview of various topics on basic machine learning (i.e. we mostly cover the topics in the Intro to Statistical Learning book, which is very good, although there are notable omissions of PCA) and a smattering of more advanced things (i.e. neural networks, a very shallow introduction to RNNs). Lectures could have been improved, but I did find working through the problem sets to be somewhat useful in getting better at R and understanding some of the lecture topics more deeply.",
    "I would recommend if you're interested in working as a data analyst\/scientist or you are an S&DS major. If not, take 355. It's a lot of work and really confusing at times- I mainly learned everything outside of lectures since it was hard to follow. But the psets are interesting and office hours really helps if you're stuck",
    "I would recommend this course to a student with sufficient statistics and coding background (in R), because it teaches very fundamental machine learning concepts and techniques. But if you have a choice (ie. if you're not an S&DS major) I'd recommend taking S&DS 355 instead, which teaches most of the same material but is less theoretical\/mathematical and is taught in Python. I didn't mind working in R too much because I was simultaneously taking another machine learning course in Python, so I learned both, but working in Python is pretty different and important. If you can't get credit for 355 or for some reason want a more theoretical\/mathematical ML course, then this one has a decent syllabus, but be prepared for a good deal of self-teaching, since the lectures are usually not sufficient to gain a full understanding or to tackle the problem sets. We had 3 short (15-min) quizzes worth 10%, one midterm exam (25%), piazza participation (5%), and 7 problem sets (60%). But most people got close to full credit on problem sets so I am concerned that the tests will end up contributing to the grades much more than they should. The problem sets (about one per 1.5 weeks) did take significant effort, and I could not have completed several of the more theory-based questions without regular office hours attendance (we 3 Colleen). I did a few of them in just 2 days, but would not recommend that because they're unpredictable - some bits of code will take a while to run or debug, some of the math is tricky, and some of the questions were poorly-written and required follow-up questions. I did get the sense that the assignments had improved a lot with regard to code runtime - we were allowed to subsample datasets, etc. so that the code never took an egregious amount of time to run (as had occurred in previous semesters).",
    "Yes, would recommend to students who are interested in machine learning. It is a good intro course.",
    "Yes but you MUST have taken at LEAST Stat 242. Don't be that kid who comes in thinking they got this with their AP Stat or Stat 100 or Stat 230 knowledge. As much as it sucks, this is the class where you if you don't know Stat 242, you're going to get blasted. idk about stat 238, it's probably possible, but if you're the person who took stat 238 so you didn't have to got through stat 241\/242, you either better be really good at math or really good at cs, and preferably both. But if you have the prereqs it's a great course! The material is super interesting and engaging, it feels super applicable plus it's definitely on the frontier of research. Derek's also super funny and interesting as a person.",
    "This is a good class if you want to get an introduction to machine learning. After taking this class, I feel well equipped to get an entry-level job in data science.",
    "Yes, great course. Not too mathy-so I wouldnt worry much about that. It also seems to be a very practical course.",
    "Yes, if you are looking for a solid introduction to ML. Theory and applications are pretty basic, though code can be difficult to optimize at times, and runtimes can be long. Psets every other week in R. Would recommend 241\/242 or equiv before this course as there is a decent amount of statistical theory, especially in the first half of the course. Psets took me around 10 hours. Derek may not be the best but the psets are straightforward enough and office hours with the TAs are helpful.",
    "I'd recommend only if they are comfortable with math and willing to spend a lot of time on the course.",
    "Yes because machine learning is so powerful and increasingly important. But it's not a class you'll enjoy all the time.",
    "It is fascinating, but just be prepared to really buckle down if you want to learn. It takes high engagement, focus, and a really good computer to thrive in this class."
