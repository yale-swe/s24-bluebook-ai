   "comments": [
    "This course teaches the principles of strict counterpoint (including the reasoning behind them), skills in Bach-style composition, as well as analysis of fugues.",
    "I learned how to write pretty good solutions to species counterpoint exercises and how to reduce more complicated pieces into their underlines in a framework resembling strict counterpoint. I gained some practice writing pieces in this style. I particularly enjoyed learning about the more \"structural\" elements of pieces in a counterpoint style (e.g. fugues or Bach's inventions), seeing how subjects and countersubjects played together and how composers used transformations of subject material in clever ways.",
    "The course went over the techniques of counterpoint, from cantus firmi, to invertible counterpoint, two-part and three-part writing and beyond.",
    "For me I think I gained a lot of compositional skills, especially in composing multiple voices. I also gained the ability to analyze multiple voices in counterpoint to see if they break any rules. Additionally, I now have a new appreciation for invention and fugues. I can also say that I have composed both.",
    "More generally, I feel much more confident writing melodies, counterpoint, and accompaniment. I have a much better idea of how each part of a piece should function, from the exposition to the development to the conclusion. I also have a deeper appreciation for contrapuntal works, particularly Bach's."

   "comments": [
    "Great class; no ideas for improvement.",
    "I thought the course was very effective in giving practice with every concept discussed and the progression of tasks seemed reasonable - it never felt like we were thrown into anything too difficult without preparation, but new tasks had significant things to learn. The focus on emulating period compositions was effective, since analyzing Bach gave a lot of ideas for possibilities and constraints in our own work. The class might have been even better if we had done more work writing counterpoint with specific techniques - we did a lot of invertible counterpoint, but writing subjects suitable for stretto or melodic inversion would have been interesting. The semester seemed pretty full already, so I'm not sure if adding anything more would be a good idea, but it's an idea.",
    "The assignment instructions could be clearer for some assignments. We could have more interactive activities in class to keep students engaged e.g. I really liked how we could be placed at the piano or at the board in class while doing an analysis. Board work was great, and receiving feedback from that was probably the most useful aspect of the class.",
    "Dr. Harrison does a really good job tailoring the course to the students and their learning. I would have liked a little more work on sequences earlier in the course. Otherwise, I think it was well structured -- at the beginning of the course, I was really nervous about the composition assignments, and it helped to build up slowly by doing smaller counterpoint exercises. I also enjoyed the board time in class -- the immediate feedback during the process of writing was inordinately helpful, and I also gained a sense of where everyone else was. I think the course worked really well with just six students, because I felt like we all got individual time and everyone got to know each other."

    "Definitely take this course if you like Bach. If you don't like Bach or don't want to learn about counterpoint in depth, not for you. If you are a composer and don't like Bach or don't want to learn about counterpoint, rethink your life choices.",
    "Yes! Bach is a genius, and this course shows you why.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you are interested in the subject. You will be spending a lot of time writing counterpoint and analyzing inventions, fugues etc. Don't be fooled because it's quite a lot of work. It can also get frustrating sometimes because there isn't really a right answer and it takes time to figure out some of the assignments. The lectures can sometimes be a little slow but it's always great to be able to listen to beautiful music. My favorite part of the course is probably writing the fugue and invention. It was really fun! And we had a class 'concert'. What I like most about our class is that it is small. There were only 6 of us which meant that we got close over the semester, and the class dynamic was great. TIP: don't take the invention listening quiz lightly. It can really affect your score.",
    "Counterpoint is an amazing theory class. We built up slowly to full composition, beginning with a thorough examination of counterpoint species and rules. By the end of the class, we had each composed a two-part invention and a small three-part fugue. I was worried about the compositions at the beginning but I felt much more confident by the time we hit them. Analysis is built into the class seamlessly, through smaller homework assignments and later through class presentations. The class work consists of 22 homework assignments. Initially these are due each class meeting (twice a week), but as they become more time-intensive they are due once a week. It requires a fair amount of work (with each assignment taking between 2 and 8 hours), but progress is visible and the work is usually fun."
