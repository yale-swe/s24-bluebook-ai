    "Basic research for credit. If you want a chemistry degree you will probably have to take this class, so it doesn't really matter if I recommend it to you or not. Find a professor whose research seems interesting and find a good research mentor and it will be a good experience.",
    "You do research in a lab and report back to your peers, with the added benefit of enjoying and appreciating their research. It's a fun class though can morph into an enormous time commitment.",
    "This semester I had to complete the senior requirement, which involved writing a final paper and giving a poster session. The final paper was really not that bad since I'd already done the research - it wound up being about 20 pages double spaced, without figures, though we had to turn it in formatted like a JACS article. The poster session was only an hour long and pretty chill. Have fun!",
    "Good research class",
    "It's research for credit, so you just go to the lab every week and attend an 1 hour Monday class (that only happens about half the time). If you are already interested in working in a lab, it won't really be extra work. Try to start on your paper early, because writing a paper does take quite a bit of time."
