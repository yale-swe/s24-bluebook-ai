    "I cannot say enough good things about this class. If you have the incredible good fortune to get in, no matter what your major or previous art experience, TAKE IT. This is the best class I have taken at Yale. It is extremely engaging, interesting, and thought-provoking. Plus, the context of learning is one liberated from textbooks, readings, and problem sets and as such the class is extremely rewarding without feeling like an obligation. Brent is the man. He will absolutely challenge you to create something outside of your comfort zone, but still give you all the tools and help you need to build anything. Importantly, though, you will get out what you put in to this class. If you commit to visiting the metalshop outside of class frequently and dedicate yourself to ambitious and challenging projects your efforts will be rewarded.",
    "This is a hidden gem at Yale. I loved being in the studio and working with my hands and creating amazing metal pieces. It is a lot of work, but the time passes so quickly.",
    "Welding and plasma cutting and steel bending, oh my! It is pretty wonderful and a great stress relief."
