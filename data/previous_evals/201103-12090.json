    "Examination of the effects of monotheism vs polytheism on conflict.",
    "YES. I would also recommend ANYTHING Sharma teaches. It is a must take.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. If Prof Sharma teaches anything, take it! He's fabulous. Lots of reading, but totally worth it. You will learn loads, and about things you did not even necessarily know you would. Not just about terrorism, but through a broader historical lens.",
    "the class is much more of a history class than a traditional political science class. you look at a wide selection of the biggest religious conflicts throughout history and discuss them in context. the class is only vaguely related to the present until the last few weeks. those with historical knowledge in this area will have an advantage in class discussion, though I had none and still managed to participate. An immense amount of reading is assigned, though you don't need to read every word to be able to participate meaningfully in class discussion. I feel like I learned a lot more about the history of religious conflict than I thought possible in one semester. Overall, I would recommend it, but as a fifth class. Not likely to be the star of your semester",
    "Great class, try to do as much of the readings as you can because you'll get a lot more out of them as well as out of class discussions. The reading list, though hefty, is very well chosen."
