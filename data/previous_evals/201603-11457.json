   "comments": [
    "I learned how to approach biological problems through the lense of physics and its laws.",
    "As indicated on exit survey, honestly all of those skills under \"thinking like a physicist.\"",
    "I learned how to actually think deeply about physics issues in biology. I felt at some points as if the biological applications were too divorced from the physics to be applicable, but especially while studying for the final exam I began to realize the interesting connections.",
    "Knowledge of biological applications of physics",
    "None",
    "The course was interesting, but I'm not sure how generalizable the concepts would be to situations outside of what we did during the course.",
    "This class gave me a lot of insight on how various aspects of biology work on a physical basis, by simplifying phenomena to simple components. It's basically the underlying principles you'd learn in any introductory course (what is force, what's pressure, how do fluid mechanics work) with some extra interesting topics such as probability, statistical mechanics, boltzmann factor, etc",
    "I learned how to apply basic physics to real-world, scientific and medical situations.",
    "The goal of this course is to teach you how to think like a physicist. I wouldn't say I learned that, but I did learn how to ask more questions and the power of collaboration.",
    "I gained a myriad of skills. One of the goals of this class was to learn how to think like a phycisist and I think that I accomplished this feat. I learned that consistent effort and perseverance really can take you far.",
    "The amount of material covered in PHYS 170 is staggering. It is refreshing to sit in a physics class where the material learned applies directly to your interests, whether your are premed or some form of bio major.",
    "I learned how to reason my way through unfamiliar problems and concepts using baseline techniques I learned in this class.",
    "I think I definitely honed my problem solving skills and my ability to work well with others and collaborate effectively.",
    "I learned how physics principles can be applied to the biosciences.",
    "I became way more confident in my abilities",
    "how to be a physicist",
    "I learned various applications of \"traditional\" equations to biological and chemical settings. I learned how to think in different ways, and just a lot of fun and cool physics-y stuff.",
    "In this course, I learned how to apply mathematical models to biological systems. I also developed my problem-solving skills.",
    "I learned that you have to take advantage of all the resources the class provides in order to do well.",
    "I made steps towards being able to think like a physicist, while learning about topics of physics I didn't even realize were classified in that department.",
    "This was a well taught intro physics course geared towards mostly premed students. It was a challenging course, but the instructors actually cared about your learning and put in a lot of time to make sure you had everything you needed to succeed.",
    "I learned a lot more about analyzing problems like a physicist, as well as connecting physics concepts to a medical perspective.",
    "PHYS 170 provided very interesting insights into the physics behind biological concepts repeatedly covered in biology courses.",
    "Learned how to take complex problems and simplify them in order to find the solution.",
    "Really cool intersection of chem, bio, and physics. Mostly biophysics, lots of crossover with bio 101\/102",
    "Honestly this course is whirlwind, but I finally learned how to think like a physicist.",
    "I learned to think like a physicist.",
    "I learned so much about physical concepts as well as their applications to the biological world",
    "I learned how to better dissect physical situations, and problems to be solved in general, into their component parts for the sake of better arriving at strategies to solve them. I saw how the field of physics underpins all fields of natural science, and particularly biology -- that was a really rewarding understanding to come upon over the course of the semester.",
    "I developed strong problem solving strategies and also developed the skill of analyzing that mistakes I made and learning from them.",
    "I learned basic physics concepts and their biological applications. I also learned how to work as a team on problem sets and learned that seeking help is often necessary and rewarding."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Often the lectures do not prepare students for the difficulty level of the exams and problem sets.",
    "very difficult to follow, teach does not explain anything and the homework takes 10+ hours a week for an intro course",
    "Love the weekly quizzes, they kept me in shape. I think it could be emphasized more that the modules have to be learned solidly BEFORE we do the PSETs, and maybe even before lecture. I assumed that I would be able to do the problem sets solely based on what I learned in lecture, and only realized about halfway through the semester that it wasnt sufficient. The study halls are amazing--collaborative, not depressing, and give an opportunity to talk to our professors\/TAs and get clarification on issues we are having.",
    "The strengths were the instructors. Both Simon and Claudia were great (as well as the peer tutors). The amount of help provided was great and there was a really friendly, family-like atmosphere that made it easy to learn and ask the \"dumb\" questions.",
    "Great study sessions. Maybe have a section for those who have very little to no physics background.",
    "This course is well thought of, well planned, but very poorly organized.",
    "I personally felt that going to lecture was not very helpful, and learned almost everything from going through the module notes at home. However, this was extremely time consuming to do as I had to spend time going to lecture for clicker questions and going through the modules. In general, the strengths of the course were the study hall sessions. I really appreciated that the instructors spent so much time helping us during the study halls.",
    "I really liked how interactive it was! Went a little fast and lectures weren't always clear. But overall good",
    "i appreciated the dedication and time my professors put in. It's so rare for a STEM professor to even know my name but Simon and Claudia both dedicated a lot of time to helping me understand the course. That said, it was more work than my other four courses combined and that was hard to handle.",
    "The professors are so thoughtful, and care a lot about their students' well-being and success. The lectures are a bit dry (because they follow the module notes exactly), but if that's the only weakness of the course, then it's a pretty good course.",
    "This course's strength lies in its \"help each other\" atmosphere. The class promotes group work and has study halls that foster group learning.",
    "I think this course does well in that the tests are very closely related to the homework problems, albeit with small twists to make them challenge you in a new way based on the principles you already know. The homework problems are very difficult to do on your own with just lecture notes, so going to study hall is essential. I wouldn't qualify this as a positive or negative, since the difficulty is largely negative but the study hall is a largely positive experience. I would only recommend that more dimensional analysis would be incorporated to some units (like pressure being equal to N\/m^2, which makes the relationships depicted in module 7 make more sense , for example).",
    "This course is extremely demanding, which is a weakness in that doing very well comes at the expense of spending time doing extra curricular activities and work for other classes but good in that it gives all the tools necessary to do well if the student can just find the time to use them.",
    "The course was well taught, but some of the material did not feel like real physics. In other words, I thought that some of what we were taught did not have a strong physical basis.",
    "This class encourages exploration through collaboration which is a plus for this course.",
    "Great support system but very difficult.",
    "The strengths are the level of support offered to every student in the class. Between TA office hours, professor office hours, study halls, reviews, and peer tutors, there was so much help to be given. Even though the class was difficult, students have all the necessary tools to succeed if they have enough time to put into it.",
    "Strengths: Professors and TAs are all so willing to help their students at all times. Incredibly didactic. Weaknesses: Very hard to grasp the mathematical equations as concepts that are applicable to life in general",
    "This class is highly structured. If you so desire, you could spend 5 days of the week in this class by going to all the study halls and review sessions. There are so many resources to make sure you do well. That is one strength of this course that is blatantly absent in many of the other courses I've taken at Yale. The only drawback to PHYS 170 is the psets can be brutal.",
    "The lectures could be a bit better structured and less disorganized. The lectures also tended to go very fast and it was really hard to follow along (especially in terms of algebra and solving math equations). So I'd recommend going slower and being clearer with concepts during the lectures. The overall vibe was wonderful though, everyone was so helpful and willing to help each other and the professors and TAs were phenomenal. I found that (surprisingly) I actually enjoyed learning about physics, and the application to biological systems made it a better course than a traditional physics course in my opinion.",
    "I think this course had a lot of weekly assignments which were great to help you keep up with the material, but I think it would have been just as effective if the problem sets were a tiny bit shorter. I think these assignments were a bit more time consuming than the needed to be. I liked the pace of this course and having the comprehensive module notes for reference.",
    "It was fine. It was kind of annoying how it was all word problems, so part of the problem is trying to figure out what the question is even asking.",
    "Though I felt engaged in the course, the additional nightly review sessions and study halls made it a very large time commitment.",
    "They truly want you to succeed. The weakness is that it takes a lot of time and effort to succeed.",
    "catching on to the modules, and not reading the modules",
    "The strengths of this course include the numerous opoortunities you can go for help -- including study halls, reviews, office hours and peer tutors. I most enjoyed study halls as you were in a setting where you can both work together with peers and professors. The grading was also extremely fair in that it was evenly distributed between work, participation, and assessments. I particularly liked this because often times during assessments I panic a bit, so it was nice to have other outlets to maintain a good grade. I think a weakness may have been how the material was taught, maybe? I'm not sure, overall I very much enjoyed this course but sometimes I walked away from lecture and felt like I didn't get too much out of it \/ didn't quite understand what was happening.",
    "The greatest strength of this course (for me) was definitely how involved the professors were. Both Simon and Claudia were incredibly helpful and seemed to really want all of their students to succeed in the class. I appreciated that they took the time to attend study halls and answer our questions each week. I really enjoyed the class, so I don't really have a lot of weaknesses. I know some of my friends felt like we didn't do enough \"real physics,\" but I think that's why Yale has both PHYS 170 and 180.",
    "The strengths of the class are how many opportunities they have to help you succeed. The weaknesses of the class is that it is very demanding such that the PSETS are very challenging and take many hours.",
    "Lecture was often too fast-paced, but we were able to catch up in study hall. The psets were very challenging, and I required Simon's assistance, and collaborative work with my classmates, to complete them. The class required MUCH more time than I expected, but results were clearly visible.",
    "The strengths of this class are the many resources available to ensure that students succeed. I went to every study hall provided and tried my hardest in this class. What could be improved is the difficulty of the content. It's kind of too difficult and it makes succeeding in the class a lot harder and almost impossible. We will learn a concept in class and then on the exams the concept is taken to a much higher level than we were doing in class or in the homework problems. I think balancing the level of difficulty between exams and the rest of the course content would be great. I think also making the problems much easier would be better. I know that the class wants to foster collaboration amongst peers, but making the problem set so difficult to do that you can't do it on your own and have to attend study hall is not the greatest idea. Also, when the exams are basically like the homework problems, it doesn't quite make sense, since if we can't do the homework problems on our own, how are we supposed to do well on the exam, if the exam is going to be like the homework problems? This class is wonderful, but there is still some things that need improvement.",
    "A huge strength of PHYS 170 is the way in which it continually engages students in learning. Frequent study halls and review sessions provide a comfortable environment in which students can engage each other, peer tutors, TAs, and professors and ask any questions necessary in better understanding material covered in class.",
    "Lectures mover fairly quickly, and the problem sets are very hard, and take up lots of time. However, the professors nd TAs are always accessible (shoutout to Jared!) to go over the material. Also, Simon and Claudia are some of the nicest professors I've had.",
    "Weaknesses are breadth of material taught, seemed unfocused and random sometimes, but I also really liked being exposed to a lot of new ideas. Strengths are by far and away the nightly study halls and review sessions.",
    "I actually appreciate the fact that this course is offered as opposed to 180, and even though the workload is so much it is definitely worth it.",
    "I am not much of physics person, but I learned that your don't have to be to do well in this class.",
    "I LOVED this class. This was the best intro science class I've taken here at Yale (actually, it's the only good one I've ever taken). The professors and TAs were SO involved and so willing to help. They put in so many hours outside of class for office hours, review sessions, and at study hall and so genuinely cared about us understanding and learning the information. I really liked having the weekly quizzes, study halls, and review sessions. I also really liked how the midterms were very straightforward and based off the psets. The psets were a little too long since they were due every week, and though I enjoyed going to study halls, it was a little frustrating that they were really difficult to do without help.",
    "The individual attention available to each student from the instructor in the TEAL classroom was really incredible. The overall class atmosphere, and the selection of biological examples used to illustrate physical concepts, all were really strong. I really don't have any serious suggestions concerning course weaknesses.",
    "There are so many resources available in this course and it is very easy to seek help.",
    "This course is very difficult and takes a lot of time. There is a lot of material and not all of it is necessary - the instructors could do a better job at indicating what was a proof that was meant to help us understand key equations and what was a mathematical skill we needed to be able to use. I cannot express enough how wonderful, helpful, and committed the course instructors were. They were available to answer questions over Piazza and were at study hall. The TFs for the course were also incredible. You will be supported enough in this course if you have the time to seek help.",
    "I liked how there were two different formats for the course: lecture vs. flipped classroom\/interactive. In regards to the lectures, I would've liked to see more organization, both in presentation and the material itself. At times, the disorganization gave rise to confusion. Thankfully there were study halls, review sessions, and office hours to work through questions, but when I couldn't attend those sessions, it took way more time (than I would've liked) to figure things out on my own."

   "comments": [
    "It overlapped so well with so many other science classes that it was kind of crazy. Simon is wonderful, and will learn your name and be there to help you through every problem. There are weekly psets, but you basically already know what type of person you are in math-ish classes by now and how well you naturally do with this type of thing. The problem sets definitely take some people much longer than others and can be a burden (and for others it is still possible to finish them on your own without having to work in a group) but no matter what there are HOURS of office hours and study halls EVERY DAY to get help. Because Simon cares.",
    "no",
    "Yes because it is not only applicable for the MCAT, but is also extremely interesting!",
    "If you're going to take physics and don't have any experience with it, this is definitely the class. The applications are fascinating and make it so that you're really learning twice as much.",
    "take only if needed",
    "Absolutely not, I actually believe they should restructure\/get rid of this class. The class basically revolved around taking basic laws of physics and applying them rotely to complex systems that were dumbed down extremely to match the level of the course.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you have to take it for premed or major requirements. I personally can't speak to how PHYS 180 was, but I know before going into this class I was debating between 170 and 180. Honestly, the class itself was not very difficult; however, it did take a lot of work outside of class doing psets and going over the module notes (given that lecture isn't really that great). So while I would say that the class is ridiculously time intensive, it wasn't really difficult in terms of grading, etc.",
    "If you are pre-med and have to take physics I would!",
    "Only if you must take physics",
    "Take this course if you're a pre-med who is taking a lot of other pre-med courses in the same semester. The course is nice is that lays out the expectations pretty clearly from the first moment. Claudia is an absolute sweetheart and it is very clear that both instructors really want to see the students succeed.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially if you're premed. This class has some very interesting and cool cross sections with biochemistry and cell biology that are fun to learn about.",
    "I think if you're premed (which is why I assume you're looking at this class around junior or sophomore year), this is an overall more enjoyable course than Phys 180 is meant out to be. Just make sure to go to study hall, review sessions are very helpful if you are prepared with questions, and make sure to look at the overall course as an experience to get to know the other premeds in your year. Simon is the shit and Claudia is pretty cool since she actually writes much of the material, but I am obviously biased.",
    "For a premed student, yes. It focuses on the physics of biological systems which is hugely interesting and helpful for the MCAT",
    "I would only recommend this course that needed to take it for a pre-med requirement.",
    "If you're deciding between PHYS 170 and 180: PHYS 170 is not classical physics. It's physics that is tailored to understanding biological systems e.g. rates of infection, how dialysis works, etc. This course is prepares you better for the new MCAT compared to 180. However, I must stress again: this isn't classical physics. There are several classical physics topics that we didn't cover. As for the workload, I was much less stressed about this course compared to my 180 counterparts, but it was still challenging. If you take this course, sign up with Simon. He's very clear and very helpful.",
    "The course was very time consuming, which is why I would be hesitant to tell another student to take it unless they need it for their major or for pre-med. However, I will say given that the course is very difficult, with the necessary work, dedication and dogged pursuit you can do very well and learn a ton. It is very rewarding and the medical application of the class is very interesting.",
    "Yes - a must have for a premed student.",
    "If you are deciding between PHYS 170 and 180, consider what you're interested in. Don't let the bad reviews of 170 turn you away. If you're MCDB or MBB and are required to take physics, I think it's much more interesting to examine the physics of diffusion or protein ratcheting than the physics of a ball rolling down a hill. It is going to require a lot of your time, the psets are going to be challenging, but in the end, you learn so much.",
    "If you feel like you'd hate physics + have absolutely no experience in physics + overall generally terrified of the subject, TAKE THIS COURSE. 100%. OVER PHYS 180. First off, it's not curved, which sounds terrifying, but honestly, it's such a healthier environment to learn the subject in when your classmates are no longer \"your competition.\" Your grade will be fine because there are test corrections and TONS of opportunities to get help on whatever you need. The teachers, TAs, and peer tutors are lovely and kind and always willing to help. The workload is a lot, though, so be warned, but you do actually end up learning a lot that's actually interesting and not just boring abstract physic concepts. I was terrified when I started taking this course, but it's honestly peaked my interest again in the sciences (lol I'm a history major so that should definitely tell you something) and I've actually really enjoyed being in this class. Take it. The way it's taught with Simon and Claudia is great and the learning environment is one of the best I've had in STEM here at Yale.",
    "I think everyone in this course is taking it because they have to for premed or their major, so with that being said, I think it was one of the better intro premed courses I have taken. I didn't particularly enjoy physics in high school, so was dreading this course but was surprised\/happy to find that it was as engaging as it was.",
    "Yes if you are a premed student looking for a physics course that will apply to your interests in medicine.",
    "only if you have time to invest 12 hours a week and need this course. otherwise id hold off until you have time",
    "yes, its a nice emphasis on biological systems",
    "Yes, definitely different from traditional physics, but very interesting to see the many many applications of physics in biological settings.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Just know what type of class you want when you're deciding between 170 and 180. If, like me, you're interested in learning about how math and physics apply to biological systems, you should 100% take PHYS 170. If you're looking for a more traditional intro physics class, you should take PHYS 180.",
    "As a physics course, yes I would absolutely recommend it. The topics and concepts appear difficult at first but they help you through them. The psets are a pain but you can get them done by going to study hall and office hours.",
    "The course was solid, and Simon was wonderful. Be ready to work really hard, but it was worth it.",
    "This was a well taught intro physics course geared towards mostly premed students. It was a challenging course, but the instructors actually cared about your learning and put in a lot of time to make sure you had everything you needed to succeed.",
    "I would recommend this course to pre-meds. Pre-meds should take this class over PHYS 180. It's more relevant to what you will or have already learned in biology and biochemistry classes, and will certainly help with the MCAT and medical school.",
    "Yes. PHYS 170 is a great course for students on a premed track, interested in learning basic physics concepts as they apply to biological sciences.",
    "If you are taking this, you're probably pre-med or a biology major. But I would recommend this over Physics 180.",
    "I would recommend this course. Even though it is a bit much workload, it is doable.",
    "Take this class! It's so great. I would shop 170 and 180 to see which style you like better, but I LOVED 170 and have zero regrets taking it. There is so much support, and learning physics through such interesting biological applications really made the class enjoyable. I had the worst experience with physics in high school and really was not looking forward to taking it again, but I genuinely really enjoyed this class.",
    "Certainly -- especially for premedical students. This course makes physics meaningful for potential clinical applications.",
    "I think this is a great course for students who have in interest in the medical field as well as physics.",
    "I took this course as a non-pre met non science student and loved the dynamic of problem sets in the course and the opportunity to return to the quantitative reasoning that I had enjoyed in high school. But if you are not taking this as a requirement you may, like me, burn out by the end and stop putting in the necessary hours per week. Keep that in mind.",
    "I definitely recommend this class to other students. It is, without doubt, the best introductory science class I've ever taken at Yale. The professors put so much time into it to make sure students understand. The material does take a lot of time to learn, but is otherwise quite manageable.",
    "It definitely was interesting to study physics in the lens of biological processes, but we did still go over some standard physics concepts. The weekly problem sets were long and hard to do alone, so it was imperative to go to at least one study hall where the professors and TAs are available to answer questions immediately. The topic review sessions were also very helpful (depending on the TA leading it...) in that they organized the information presented in class in a more comprehensive way. Overall, I definitely learned how to think more critically and having some knowledge of physics in biological processes helped when preparing for the MCAT."
