    "In addition to American Economic History, this class taught me how to be an effective reader of academic articles.",
    "Learned about key events in American history and the economic drivers behind them.",
    "I learned much more about American Economic History than I ever thought I could learn. I did not have a good idea as to the economic landscape shaped and influenced the growth of the country. I did not know the same details.",
    "I learned a great deal about the state of the economy in the United States over time. I learned much more about immigration, protectionism, and the Fed.",
    "I found the required papers to have a lot of insights about American history. This course seemed particularly helpful in terms of understanding history, but it wasn't as focused on economics concepts like you'd learn in the introductory econ courses.",
    "I learned a lot about American Economic History, but possibly most helpfully, I learned a lot about writing about history.",
    "I know more about history now than I ever have before. Would take again.",
    "Great resource of knowledge of American Economic History.",
    "This course was a great survey of American Economic History. I really learned to think critically about different statistics, facts, and phenomena in America's storied 200+ years of economic growth.",
    "Writing",
    "Prior to taking the course, I did not know nearly as much about the history of the US economy.",
    "Interesting course, A nice economic perspective to a typical American history class",
    "I gained a valuable insight into the foundations and development of the American economy and financial system. It was an interesting perspective from which to view American history. I also learned how to write a historically motivated policy proposal.",
    "Learnt the interesting details about American History from an economic perspective. Also, learnt how to write papers effectively.",
    "I learned a lot about American History and the way the geography of southern and western states in some ways limited their ability to engage in the economy. As well, I have a better understanding of the financial system and the ways it operates. I can recount banking panics amd expalin how they happemed and the ways the US government and federal reserve responded to each panic.",
    "This was a great opportunity to explore the role of economics in American development.",
    "A broad understanding of economic concepts of the American History.",
    "Analysis of academic articles was a great skill that was acquired in this class.",
    "writing skills knowledge of american history good note taking",
    "Good synthesis and essay writing skills. Critical analysis of academic work and close reading.",
    "I learned crucial information describing the nuances of the economic history of the United States.",
    "Insightful economic analysis with a historical context.",
    "I think I learned how to read efficiently and critically, and how to develop strong arguments out of challenging material.",
    "I've come away with a much deeper appreciation for the historical impact of our economic choices over the last 200 years.",
    "I learned a lot about American Economic History, especially the transformation of banking, public and private, throughout the development of the U.S.",
    "I learned how to write and read economic history papers, something I do not think other classes provide. It was particularly interesting for a non economics major to get to see a different side of historical events.",
    "Barely any. Often times felt like a basic review of American history. Perhaps that was Jaremski's fault, perhaps that is just the nature of economic history. Regardless, it got really dry and was never really inspiring.",
    "I essentially just learned a lot about the U.S. economy from the early colonial period up until the 2008 financial crisis. I think the most interesting topics that we learned about were topics that really related to the present, such as immigration and the Fed.",
    "I learned a great deal about the history banking and especially how the country was formed around the need for more regulations and restrictions on what banks could and could not do. This course was interesting because it described the reforms of the banking system that affect out lives today and provided a rationale for the why the economy of the U.S. is the way it is today.",
    "This course really improved my skills in writing economic papers. It required a close reading of many historical and contemporary articles, which was helpful in learning to think critically about economic arguments today. It also improved my knowledge of American history, which is always appreciated.",
    "Ok course. Lecture was often quite interesting, but I don't feel like I learned anything earth-shattering. Really this felt like an easy writing credit that counts toward the Econ major. A little disappointing.",
    "I learned real applications of economic theory. Prior to this class, all models seemed to be simply modes. However, by taking an economic lens through the American timeline I learned how those models shaped our country's economic policy. I would recommend it to all economic students.",
    "A broader understanding of economics and particular economic events",
    "We learned about why the United States was unique in its growth pattern, and how specific Acts, technological developments, and major events (panics, Wars) affected the economy and institutions."

   "comments": [
    "This course was just about perfect. The reading, while sometimes dense was always relevant and interesting. The lectures were absolutely incredible. The essays we wrote were very interesting a topical.",
    "Very content heavy and exam was hard but can learn a lot from it.",
    "The essay prompt should be much more clearly defined in the future and the synthesis essays should have been much more closely related to each other. The 2nd essay is how all 3 should have been structured. The course was also extremely dense with lectures largely just being full of the professor talking with few breaks for engagement in between.",
    "very comprehensive",
    "This class was unbelievably dry and one of the worst I've ever taken. He essentially read off his slides the entire time. It felt like I was in a boring high school class. The academic rigor was next to none which I guess was good because otherwise I would've dropped this course. Asking how it could be improved is an interesting question because I would like the entire course to be recreated. The assigned readings were loosely related to class but so specific they were essentially useless except for the essays we had to write.",
    "Add more economic analysis, and less review of minor insignificant facts",
    "Weakness - material taught in very dry manner",
    "The lectures could have been much more useful if they had been more specific and less of a general overview of many of the topics. The class often felt like a re-hash of high school APUSH, excluding the required readings and quantitative analysis.",
    "I thought this was a great course. Strengths were the lectures and the essays. Weaknesses were close to none, maybe that I wish we had learned more about 1970-now.",
    "It got boring sometimes. A lot of information. But I think that's how history courses are.",
    "I thought the class was very fair, but it's a bit hard to know how to take notes, especially in the first half of the class because you don't get a great idea what sort of things are tested until the midterm rolls around.",
    "Sometimes you don't know what the exams are specifically looking for",
    "The course had a good curriculum, however, it was taught poorly, and I did not feel as if the tests reflected the material we learned in the class. I felt that the professor also graded very harshly for a course that had a very complex and difficult subject matter.",
    "Strengths was the interesting material. Weakness was the shear quantity of material, and how the first exam had little relation to the broad themes of the course.",
    "I think that the class was an appropriate size, but shouldn't get any larger.",
    "Essay guidelines were kind of unclear, Given that I think the professor\/TFs had a idea of what they wanted you to write.",
    "Good course, but difficult and very specific tests.",
    "The course is taught from an interesting perspective. Incorporating a different media of learning other than power point slides could help break the monotony of a long, dense lecture. It definitely covers a lot of material.",
    "Professor Jaremski is great at teaching, and the material in the course is very interesting. Also, the feedback provided through this course is very helpful.",
    "I think as the semester went on it got better but I found it useful when the slides were consistent with what the professor was saying because it allowed me to engage more fully in the content.",
    "Workload was perfect and section hours were great to review readings.",
    "This course was not well organized and the midterm and final exam questions were not a fair representation of the course material.",
    "Lectures were engaging and detailed. Exams, however, were extremely difficult (really low class average.)",
    "The strengths were the quantity of information covered and the level of analysis of academic articles. The weaknesses were that it might have been too ambitious in its scope and there were too many articles assigned to read per week.",
    "weaknesses - can be quite dry, could be improved by more dynamic lectures (use of multimedia) and making section more engaging.",
    "Good lectures and section was helpful in dissecting the papers. The essays could be more specific in prompt and we could have more guidance. Better to have 2 papers with drafts due than 3 with little chance for feedback before the final draft.",
    "The course has a lot of information to cover; however, the professor understood that and did not make the final cumulative.",
    "From the perspective of an Econ major, the strengths was the application of the theory to historical events.",
    "I think the strength of the course is that the readings challenge the students, particularly when essays must be written on them. I do think, however, that diversity in the sources of the readings (ex. more primary sources) might make it more interesting. I thought the lecture structure and class material was interesting. The tests were a little specific in what they asked for, however.",
    "Good course for developing writing if you have a strong\/committed TA.",
    "Professor Jaremski's enthusiasm is enough to make this course worth taking. It's a lot of information, but well worth it.",
    "The lectures are engaging and the material is interesting. Jaremski was great, and the TAs were helpful. The papers could have used more guidance, but all in all it was very clear what was expected of us and what we were trying to learn.",
    "Strengths: Interesting material, plenty of relevance to modern period. Weaknesses: Assignments were very restrictive. Though the topics were interesting, the lack of prompt\/\/restriction to two sources limited the assignment's potential.",
    "I think there was a lot of interesting information that we learned but very little that we were able to go into depth on. I think that is the nature of the course, but it would still be nice to feel like I had more time to understand some of the concepts before rushing into the next ones.",
    "Lacked a some \"so what?\" at times. I feel like it focused on minutiae and sacrificed the bigger picture.",
    "Felt like a review of American history with a few supply and demand graphs thrown in occasionally. It would be more engaging if the material covered was truly economic history not history with economics. Lectures got really boring when he would go over stuff we all learned during high school. The best part of this class was learning things like, for example, the biases of constitutional convention voters due to economic factors. The economics of the class was really interesting, the history was just a basic review.",
    "I think that material was very interesting at times, and Jaremski really knew a lot about what he was talking about. I also enjoyed some of the readings we did, and writing the essay on immigration because it was very relevant to today. I think the course could've done a bit of a better job trying to connect things to the present so they don't seem irrelevant Firstly, there was a VERY strong disconnect between what the professor was telling us to do and what the TAs expected for assignments. The paper prompts for the three essays were EXTREMELY unclear. TAs graded very differently - there were some that graded easier and some that graded much harder, and a lot of the grading seemed very subjective. I did quite well on the exams, but I will still say that the exams were pretty unfair. You might think it's nice that the professor gives you the essay questions for the exam beforehand, but honestly it's not even worth it when it's 30 long essay questions that you have to prepare. The short answers on the exam were extremely specific. The people I knew in the class are fairly detail-oriented people and went to class everyday, yet for the first exam none of us even had one of the answers to the short answer questions in any of our notes. This seems a bit ridiculous to me, especially since there's so much information to know. I'm also not sure how you don't curve the exams at all, which Jaremski said in class, when the average is in the 70s and a lot of people got below that - a decent amount in the 40s. I would also say it was a bit absurd that people were not allowed to switch sections. I don't think that's a rule you can make, especially with people having other commitments. If you have a commitment, whether for your team or an event that you partake in for community service or a club, you shouldn't lose class participation points if you're willing to make up the section at a different time. Yes, this may have reduced some havoc for the TAs, but really not fair for the students in the class. It was a class that really wasn't tailored to the students at all.",
    "Strengths - The course was provided a very thorough overview of the history of how the American economy developed over time and the factors that led to this growth. The Professor gave all the information that was needed to do well on exams and posted all of his slides online so that they could be viewed more easily. Weaknesses - The readings for the course were often a little dry and could have been more relevant to what we learned directly in class as well. They were hard to read at times and definitely were not the most engaging pieces. I feel as though a textbook for this class with more standardized readings would not be such a bad idea. Also, the essays were difficult because there were never any issued prompts. I feel as though a set of prompts for each essay would be very helpful for future classes.",
    "I thought this course was excellently organized. It ran very smoothly, and lectures were beneficial and enjoyable. Sections were also helpful and well-run, making for a good overall experience.",
    "The professor was engaging in lecture, and we discussed a few really interesting topics.",
    "The strengths are the teacher. Sadly, he is just a guest lecturer, but the enthusiasm and insight he brought to the table are unmatched. I think history is an easy class to just get bored in, but for the whole semester, he was able to keep up engaged. I think a weakness, however, is the rubric for the essays. I feel like the grading rubric overlaps so one mistake like similar sentence structure costs you points in 3 out of the 6 categories. Also, the rubric doesn't lend itself to helpful comments.",
    "Strength is that it's relatively easy for an Econ class, weakness is that it might seem dry to some depending on who is teaching it",
    "The tests and 3 essays were all weighed about the same, so it was possible to come back from a bad grade. The professor also took into consideration whether or not you improved over the semester when assigning the final grade. The biggest problem was that what was expected from the essays did not really match the prompt. I think many people did poorly on the first essay because the prompt seems to ask for a compare and contrast, but that wasn't what the professor wanted. The midterm and final are straightforward. You'll do a little better on them if you go to class, but the lecture slides were all posted online. Ultimately, the class was more work than expected, but it was graded fairly."

    "Yes, while I will admit some topics are more exciting than others in this course, the overall course is very interesting. I feel like it also helps you sharpen your writing up a bit and become better at reading.",
    "Can be interesting but not necessarily easy- choose with caution.",
    "A decent course if you are interested in econ history, or are an econ major looking for a writing credit to be efficient with courses. If you are easily bored by lectures, though, this course will not be for you.",
    "Great class, depends on which professor you get as each year it is a new guest lecturer. I had Jaremski and he was really interesting and a great lecturer but his exams were really tough. They were curved and I assume in the future they will end up being easier. Really learned a lot from the essays though, they were on really relevant issues. Overall great course!",
    "The course was a lot of basic memorization, but you will probably learn a lot. The essays were pretty straightforward. A lot more history than economics.",
    "Just don't do it to yourself. It's not worth it.",
    "It can be kind of dry at times,but did take away some important knowledge from this course. The essays were great",
    "Good econ\/hist combo but not a great course overall",
    "I would recommend it but be prepared for the course to vary a great deal depending on which professor they have leading it each semester.",
    "This is a great course but definitely a lot of work. Great writing credit if you are an econ major.",
    "I would, if they want to really learn a lot of info.",
    "Definitely! It was great from both the history and econ perspective. I especially loved getting to read some American economic history research papers. They were super insightful and thought-provoking. Prof. Jaremski was a great lecturer. I did not get bored and actually looked forward to class.",
    "No. The syllabus looked interesting, however the exams were weighted too heavily on very specific questions that were not relevant to the broad themes of the course.",
    "Yes",
    "No, the syllabus was misleading, as the professor did not teach the material in a well organized or interesting way.",
    "I would recommend the second half of the course while it is more relevant to today's world. The first half however was not as interesting",
    "Yes, I think the overall material was interesting. If you're interested in econ and need a writing credit - this would be a good one to take.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to other students. It is a very challenging class that requires a lot of analysis of American Economic History",
    "I would, because the content at the end of the day is very important.",
    "Great writing credit. Take it.",
    "While you might want to take this for the writing credit, it is definitely a lot of work and very in depth in economics and history. Be sure that you enjoy those topics if you take the course rather than just taking it for the writing credit. If you are interested in it, then putting in the work for a rather heavy workload is not as bad, and I would definitely recommend.",
    "Yes. It's a great course with a great professor, and the feedback provided through the course actually teaches you how to write better papers.",
    "It depends how much you want to engage. It a good course in the sense that you truly get out of it what you put in.",
    "Yes, it was an interesting and thought provoking class.",
    "No.",
    "It is hard to answer this, as the class was taught by a visiting professor and might be different in the future.",
    "Depends on the student. Students not very interested in the material should not take it. If a student is interested, however, I think they will find the course to be worthwhile.",
    "Take for writing credit. Somewhat interesting. Pretty dry. Shop TAs! Attend lecture and take good notes and you should be fine. Recommend if you need WR, enjoy economic history, are taking a heavy load and need an extra elective as Econ major.",
    "Yes, it provided a good overview of how economics factors into the major movements in history and the rise of business and institutions.",
    "Yes, it is important to understand the economic history of the United States.",
    "Good writing credit - far from a rid though.",
    "Yes I would, but with the caveat that the tests can be challenging, but the course material is very interesting and keeps you engaged.",
    "As an African American student the section on slavery was isolating and really hard to sit through. I felt that the professor did not adequately address any of the moral questions\/straight up horrific violence of slavery and of the studies that we looked at (Fogel and Engermen). At best it felt as if he was diminishing slavery's significance: \"there weren't as many slaves as you might think.\" At worst he was diminishing the horror of rape: \"slave women had 10 children on average, but white women had 7 to put that in perspective. One could presume that slave women didn't want to have all those children.\" One slide labeled \"caveat\" is not enough to teach students about the pitfalls of an economic approach to slavery! So if you're African American or Black I would recommend skipping \"slavery day.\"",
    "Absolutely, this course is excellent and so is the professor.",
    "Yes, great intro to Economic History and American history in general. Good way to get a writing credit, and the material is interesting. The weekly readings of papers can be dry, but ironing them out in section (with a good TA) is fun.",
    "I would recommend the course only if you are interested in American Economic History and have taken more than just into micro (even though that is the only requirement). You need a stronger background in economics to really succeed.",
    "No. Felt like a high school course.",
    "Would not recommend this course as it is now. It is good to take for credit but was rather boring and unsatisfying. I feel like this could be really good in the future if it was taught from a different perspective. Take if you want a decently easy writing credit.",
    "I think that material was very interesting at times, and Jaremski really knew a lot about what he was talking about. However, if Jaremski is teaching it again, I would probably not recommend taking it. It was a lot harder than I was expecting, and I know for sure that some of the same TAs are teaching it next year, which isn't a good thing. I think there were a lot of issues with the course that made it a lot harder than it needed to be. Firstly, there was a VERY strong disconnect between what the professor was telling us to do and what the TAs expected for assignments. The paper prompts for the three essays were EXTREMELY unclear. TAs graded very differently - there were some that graded easier and some that graded much harder, and a lot of the grading seemed very subjective.

    "I would recommend this course to another student only if they were interested in learning more about economics and were also very interested in the historical developments of the U.S. economy. This is a very specific group, however, and would therefore only draw a select number of students. If I had friends who were not interested in either of this topics I would probably not recommend the class because it is a very specific course that would only appeal to these types of students.",
    "No unfair exams .",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially for those who are interested in the historical component of economics. It was very unique to have a writing credit that also counts toward the major, and I feel that my ability to read and critique economic arguments has improved. The grading is a little harsh, but as long as you attend lecture and do the readings, it's fair.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class. You memorize a bunch of facts, and that's about it. Not great, but if you need a writing credit that counts toward econ, I guess it isn't a terrible choice.",
    "Yes, as I have said repeatedly this course gives real life applications to the simple economic models we learn.",
    "No",
    "The course was extremely boring. The content was not difficult to understand but the way you were assessed was unfair and simply a test of whether or not you could memorize seemingly random and trivial facts about American Economic History.",
    "Yes, but there is a fair amount of work."
