   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn Mathematica, it's perfect. Otherwise, I'd probably do something else. The math is really interesting, but it's not worth the time. The problem sets take forever, and there's one for every class meeting (two per week), which is absolutely killer.",
    "ENAS 397 is a math class covering the topics of Complex Analysis and Partial Differential Equations. A lot of material is covered in this course. Pretty much all the assignments are completed in Mathematica, which is at first frustrating but becomes quite useful. When I took this class there were only four students in it, so Professor Vaisnys tailored his instruction style to the class. The course is taught from online textbooks and Professor Vaisnys' head, so you won't have to buy any books for this class. You really have to put in a lot of time outside of class in order to digest the material, but if you do, youwill end up with a thorough understanding of the concepts. There is very little formal instructor feedback in this course, so if you want to know how you are doing on the work, you will have to meet with Prof Vaisnys, which is a good thing to do anyway- he cares a lot about his students. I recommend this course to anyone interested in furthering their knowledge of math. This course is great for people majoring in engineering and physical sciences, but if you want a more theoretical background in the material, I would take the version of this course offered in the math department.",
    "Really great class, guaranteed different from anything you've done - the topics covered are complex analysis and PDE's, but in a way totally different from the way you're probably used to learning math. He basically guides you through actually discovering the theorems and methods used to solve the problems, rather than presenting material and giving a rubric for solving a particular type of problem. He wants you to learn it the way the dudes who originally figured it out did, and you come out with a much deeper understanding than you would from just reading someone else's derivation. Granted, it was also incredibly frustrating at times, but always worth it.",
    "This is a terrific course that covers some of the basics in complex analysis and also covers in some depth a number of approaches to PDEs. Professor Vaisnys is remarkably devoted to the class - after an accident, we still had class in the Yale Infirmary! Though the workload can be a bit heavy on occasion, Professor Vaisnys tailors the material to student interests and is very available and helpful. A first-rate course."
