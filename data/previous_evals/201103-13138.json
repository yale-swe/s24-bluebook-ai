   "comments": [
    "Very interesting if you don't know much about the wars in detail. Important to attend lecture, do readings, and participate in section.",
    "Great class covering this time period, not just a history of battles but takes into accounts all aspects of the wars. Be prepared to do a lot of reading and 6 two page reading responses for section.",
    "Professor Winter is an expert in the field and offers interesting lectures. I would recommend taking it Credit D in order to avoid having to do all of the extensive reading.",
    "A very interesting and moving survey course on Europe from 1914-1945. Winter is great and you will learn a lot. There is a lot of reading but it is mostly interesting and you should do as much of it as you can. I really enjoyed this class",
    "Good class, mostly focused on culture rather than war.",
    "Absolutely. Great class, especially if you're interested in this kind of stuff. Winter's a great lecturer.",
    "This class is a great history class. You learn a lot of facts about the period in Europe, and Winter makes an argument in every lecture. The readings are really essential to understanding the class: Winter only makes one historical argument in a lecture, but his arguments are disputed. You only get the other side of the argument in the reading.",
    "Good class.",
    "Fantastic lectures and readings that definitely added perspective and raised questions about my understanding of the twentieth century. Do the readings and make eye contact with Winter as he lectures -- it'll make the experience even better. I came in with no experience with other history classes and found it manageable. Lots of reading, so I'd recommend taking it Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "I would not recommend this class as a way to clear out the Western European history credit.",
    "This was a great class. Professor Winter is a captivating lecturer. His lectures on memory and commemoration are especially poignant; his expertise is especially focused on that subject. There was a ton of reading, but you can get the arguments and knowledge without reading word by word. Six reading responses for the class on top of the ten page paper which requires reading two books was a bit tough still though.",
    "This is a fantastic introduction to this important period in European and world history. The material is incredibly diverse and interesting, both to learn the basic facts of the period and to think about the larger questions they engage with (and Professor Winter does a great job of making the study of history meaningful). I highly recommend this class, with the warning that it is a ton of reading. It's worth it, but it's a real commitment.",
    "Winter is a lecturer who moves fast and there is a ton of material which the course engages in. This being said, the workload (one long paper, a final, and small reading responses) is a good way to test the amount of readings and lectures because they don't require you to remember every little detail. I'd recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course...its fantastic. You'll learn a ton about WWI and WWII and learn many interesting perspectives on the material. Lecture is interesting, and sections are engaging. The workload is beyond managable if you must read every single page, as you simply cannot. But with one midterm paper, a final exam and then 5 2-pg reading repsonses done at your convienience, it's ok otherwise. Take it! You won't regret it.",
    "EVERY Yalie with an interest in modern history or modern warfare should take this class. Professor Winter is brilliant. The reading load he assigns is heavy, but it's worth doing - it's really interesting stuff!",
    "Yes! The reading is interesting, and the midterm -- a ten-page literature comparison -- is fun and reasonable. The exam is similarly reasonable -- you get a list of 12 essay questions, four are on the test, and you answer three. If you have the tiniest interest in the subject, you've got to take this class!",
    "Europe in the Age of Total War was a solid course that intertwined diplomatic, military, and cultural history from the era of 1914-1945. Professor Jay Winter's lectures were powerful, well-organized, and very informative as he included his own research, experiences, and photos. I appreciated Winter's emphasis on war commmerations, especially his focus on Great War and Holocaust litearture. However, the lectures are extremely fast paced, which makes note-taking difficult. Although the readings are thoughtfully chosen to complement the lectures, there is a ridiculously large amount of primary and secondary works assigned (~150 pages per lecture). This might seem standard for a history course, but in most other lectures, a student can successfully pick and choose what assigned readings to complete and still fulfill all section requirements. Unfortunately, in Total War, it is necessary to summarize all of the readings in the 6 required two-page reading responses. Although these reading responses were doable, they made the class unnecessarily difficult as the 10 page midterm paper and essay-based final exam were pretty straightforward. Thus, I strongly recommend picking a TA who assesses the reading responses kindly because a strict TA will make the class and section much less enjoyable.",
    "Take it.One of the best history lectures at Yale.Not very hard.",
    "I would strongly recommend the class. It provides you with a very good knowledge of the time period of the Two World Wars in Europe. It is also interesting and forces you to think and formulate your own opinions and interpretations of events."
