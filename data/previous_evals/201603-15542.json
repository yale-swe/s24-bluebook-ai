   "comments": [
    "This course first and foremost informed my understanding of and skills relating to the interpretation of text. Specifically, our class focused on rabbinic perspectives on gender and sexuality in late antiquity. We also read and processed more theoretical pieces pertaining to the power dynamics of authorship and community leadership, and how these themes can be mapped on to the particular literary collection we were studying. We also thought about how notions of gender and sexuality are formulated and enacted in both intra and inter-communal contexts.",
    "Greater understanding of the structure of Talmudic learning; how to navigate different translations; how to facilitate learning in a group with different interests and levels of experience",
    "This course was incredible in helping me hone my analytical skills, and despite my Jewish background I learned a lot about Talmudic studies!",
    "This course provided me with insight both in to the world of academic talmud, and with a brief window in to the world of gender studies.",
    "In this course, I learned a great deal about academic methods of Talmud study and about work in the field of gender and sexuality within Rabbinics. I gained new understandings of how to analyze Talmud, and more skills for thinking critically about Rabbinic text."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths of this course were the compelling material, the manageable amount of coursework which allowed me to spend more time thinking about the material and understanding it in depth, and the opportunity to familiarize myself with the study of academic Talmud. Something that I found disappointing was that when we were assigned articles about gender and sexuality that were not directly about rabbinics, that material was not well-integrated into our discussion of the passages we engaged with in class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Professor Bickart is a super-engaging discussion leader who inserts a lot of excitement, relatability, and intrigue into his analysis of ancient texts. Despite the antiquity of the materials discussed, Professor Bickart's more theoretical readings really demonstrates how contemporary many of these issues around gender\/sexuality and communal leadership\/interpretation are. The work load is very manageable as well.",
    "Absolutely! I don't think I've ever been in a class I was this excited to go to each week. The structure of traditional Talmudic learning with an academic lens really worked, and I feel like I got a huge amount out of the class. The readings were always interesting and never overwhelming, and we got to go deep into each text we were learning because of it. I honestly wish I could take it again!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this; the course material was fascinating and Professor Bickart is an incredible instructor.",
    "YES- if you are interested in talmud, take this course. Prof bickart is one of the greatest teachers i have ever had, and he makes the subject exciting and intellectually stimulating.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any student who wanted to engage with gender in Judaism or gain a better understanding of Talmud."
