    "Just the next level up from L2. The course starts out very slowly and it's not much different from L2, but you get into more complicated grammar towards the end.",
    "If you gotta take it, you gotta take it. SHOP PROFESSORS!!",
    "Take if you have to, it's less work than L2.",
    "Spanish L3 is easier than L2, but you go more in depth. Professor Seymour is a great teacher and will help you developbetter grammar. There is lots of writing and speaking, which makes the class engaging.",
    "I would recommend this class; it improves writing and reading skills and provides a comprehensive analysis of Spanish culture and literature.",
    "Take it if you need the credit.",
    "It's a usual language class, but Professor Seymour is really nice and helpful, o I would recommend taking it with her",
    "Yes if you want to continue learning spanish or improve your spanish the class is very helpful"
