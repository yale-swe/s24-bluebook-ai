    "FAAAR moe oral speaking than I'm used to and more new material that review like L3 felt.",
    "The class was similar to many other language classes at Yale. There was a fair amount of work and the tests were sometimes tricky, but it does help you learn a lot Spanish in a small time. By the end of the semester you are reading a short novel in spanish and conversing easily.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in improving their Spanish language skills.",
    "It's L4 Spanish, so it's pretty much everything you'd expect. A good class.",
    "It's a continuation of L3, but also helps you become more fluent. There will be a noticeable change in your speaking skills by the end of the semester. Plus you get to read a novel in Spanish, which is kind of cool. It's fast-paced enough that you don't get bored, but slow enough that you still have time to learn and internalize the stuff you're learning. It's not a huge amount of work, but definitely take it with Cividanes.",
    "Yes, I would. This course is great for anyone trying to transition to a higher level of Spanish.",
    "Definitely take this, especially if you need the credit. It's an easy class and a lot of fun.",
    "I would recommend it. see answer to first question. it is also great to have the chance to read a novella. At the end of the course I felt I had come a far way and was much more confident with the language.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student seeking to increase their Spanish proficiency - it's sort of a bridge course. You learn all of the grammar you'll need, and then the class will start to resemble your English or Art History class in that you'll discuss various readings, paintings, and films critically. It's a fair bit of work - homework every day, four quizzes, a couple of tests, in-class essays, two presentations, and the final exam. Worth it, though, if you're committed to the language. Or, I guess, if you need to fulfill the distribution reqs.",
    "While L3 is mostly review, L4 taught me new rules of grammar.",
    "you learn advanced grammar and culture, lots of practice speaking out loud",
    "Ame is a very good professor and makes the class as good as it can be. That said, the Spanish department is highly bureaucratic so expect a mechanized semester in which you'll be tested \/ quizzed \/ graded in some capacity every week. Way too rigid, impersonal, annoying. But Ame herself is great.",
    "Spanish 140 was a good class. Prof. Cividanes is an amazing professor and I would definitely recommend her class. Spanish 140 is a small step us from 130, where expectations increase slightly, but overall difficulty is roughly the same. I believe it helped me to greatly improve my Spanish."
