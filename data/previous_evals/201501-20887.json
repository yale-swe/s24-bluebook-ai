    "This is PhD-level game theory, designed for economics students. Good for undergrads who want to do a PhD; otherwise likely too abstract for most students.",
    "Great class -- necessary for understanding these concepts of Microeconomics.",
    "yes, but be prepared to spend a lot of time on it.",
    "I would summarize Econ 501 as good for Econ students with very good math background willing to engage with complicated models without any direct interest in empirical applications. To these students I would recommend the course wholeheartedly.",
    "I will definitely recommend this course. It is advanced level Game Theory course that would be helpful in both theoretic and applied work.",
    "Great course",
    "Yes, if the person is interested in economic theory in general.",
    "Pretty standard 2nd semester micro course.",
    "Yes, definietly.",
    "Game theory is very interesting especially when you have passionate professors like these two.",
    "Yes if you're interested in game theory. u",
    "Two very good instructors, both charismatic yet different. It is a very comprehensive review of game theory and market design with added commentary and content. Having an MA in Economics (or similar training) will allow you to keep up with the content."

    "Important and very helpful in learning this branch of Microeconomics. It is not too relevant to my research, since I do not plan to specialize in theoretical economics.",
    "provided mathematical theory that will be useful as background - direct application to research harder to find, but i think will be very helpful in preparation for next year seminar courses.",
    "I deepened my understanding of various equilibrium concepts in Game Theory, which is essential in economic research.",
    "Learn game theory",
    "Solidified knowledge in Economics.",
    "While I had seen some of these topics before (particularly from the first quarter), I had not covered them in as much detail, and many of the other topics I had not covered before.",
    "I learned a lot about game theory in this course.",
    "A lot of new concepts learned, mostly in the 4th quarter",
    "The first half rekindled my love for game theory."
