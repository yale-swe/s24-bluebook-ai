   "comments": [
    "Depends on what you're looking for. I also don't know how this subject will change in the future. Overall, a low-intensity class to expand on your stata skills. Some of the stuff like looping is really cool, but a lot of the first part of the class focuses on mostly just the statistical stuff behind doing research products, which are cool to know, but not quite as snazzy as learning all the syntax.",
    "Hopefully the next iteration of the course will be better designed to teach students more effectively about Stata.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are at all interested in the process of conducting quantitative research. Very very good course.",
    "This first semester was a little rough in terms of how the class was structured, but I'm sure it will be smoother next year, and regardless I felt like I learned a lot of valuable information! If you're at all interested in research or understanding statistics, take this class. Statistics and computers are not my forte, so I knew this class would be hard, but even so, JT is really accessible and makes the class manageable.",
    "I would say that GLBL 191 is a class for becoming a master of, or at least proficient in, Stata. It's a program with huge utility for any researcher, including many on the faculty at Yale, so getting to work with it hands-on was a great opportunity. I would recommend it both as a way to cover the Global Affairs Research Design requirement and for the curious student who wants to understand how statistical relationships come to be included in reports, articles and policy. The implications for both the public and private sectors are huge, and I think Justin has knack for exposing some of these finer details.",
    "I would totally recommend this class to other students, assuming that the kinks from this year have been ironed out. I think you learn a lot and most importantly, through the final project have a way to learn about it through your own interests. It's not for people who didn't enjoy Stata in GLBL121, but for anyone who sees themselves doing research or wanting to learn about statistical packages, it's a fantastic course.",
    "Take this course if you want to learn practical skills in Stata. Plus, Professor Thomas is awesome. It's helpful to have a good foundation in statistics, as the basics are not covered as in-depth.",
    "If you want to become a Stata master, take this class. I recommend it for any social science major or anyone interested in data analysis. It assumes some statistical background, and not much statistics is covered (besides refreshers on concepts like regression). Do t take this if you want to learn stats -- take GLBL 121. The course is geared towards social science and it teaches Stata, which is used predominantly in International Relations and Political Science. By the end of the course, you will have enough practical knowledge to credibly put Stata as a skill on your resume, and will have no trouble excelling as a research assistant in the social sciences.you will be at or above the skill level of graduate students. If you like data analysis and want to get better at empirical research, definitely take this class."
