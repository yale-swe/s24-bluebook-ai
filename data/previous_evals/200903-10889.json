   "comments": [
    "It's an overview of the development of the sociology of the arts\/popular media in the 20th century beginning principally with the Frankfurt School right before WWII.I would absolutely recommend it to someone interested in such things, including non-sociologists.",
    "I definitely recommend this course.",
    "This course is highly recommended for anyone interested in the relationship between sociology and the arts, no matter what their disciplinary background. In fact, the greater variation there is in the class makeup, the more interesting, enriched and productive the class becomes. The reading is not arduous but it is absolutely necessary to get through it all in order to be able to keep up in a fast-paced and very stimulating discursive environment!",
    "I would recommended this class to fellow student because it is really a fascinating subject and the readings are very interesting, but I would warn the student to expect some very theoretical readings as well.",
    "Absolutely yes--it's very thought-provoking",
    "Yes I would. I would say that class is an crucial, sample of perspectives on the Sociology of the Arts and should be required of graduate students at the School of Art."

   "comments": [
    "I've looked up comprehensive exam forms online for \"the sociology of culture\" and this class introduced me to more readings that are on those lists than any class I'd previously taken.",
    "I was able to read a number of seminal texts and to synthesize their insights, adding a layer to my own analyses of culture and the arts.",
    "Interdisciplinary experience is vital these days; it is great to get a different perspective on matters of interest and also to feel that one's contribution as a specialist in another area is valued. The free flow of ideas in this class is both stimulating on an intellectual level and excellent wit-sharpening practice for would-be professional academics!",
    "I'm a music major. By no means am I doing a dissertation, but I like to think that this class helped me become a more thoughtful musician.",
    "The class has increased my understanding of my proferssion, and is crucial to the nature of my practice as an artist."
