   "comments": [
    "Interesting topics covered, really makes you think about your own concepts of identity and belonging and how language fits into that. Errington is a very helpful professor (in terms of finding sources for papers, etc.) Good class if you're interested in linguistic anthropology (especially since Yale doesn't offer many linguistic anthro courses)",
    "Really awesome readings if you're into this kind of thing (which I am). Not too much work, either, though the early start time and far-flung locale made for a nice little commute on Tuesday mornings. Prof. Errington is not always the greatest at facilitating conversation, but he's super knowledgeable and always happy to meet to discuss projects or research or what have you. The material is awesome and, especially if some of the motivation comes from you, I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who have already developed an interest in linguistics or linguistic anthropology. It is not a good intro course. Also, given that there are no graded incentives to do the reading, if you choose to take this course you need to be really self-motivated.",
    "I would recommend Ant 364. It is a very strong class, with an in depth understanding of the readings and some of the major anthro issues of todays societies"
