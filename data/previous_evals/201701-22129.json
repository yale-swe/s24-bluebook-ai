I wasn't really sure when it was due; when time is at a premium during paper writing and finals season, you really want to know what to prioritize and when.",
    "I think the student presentations should only be about 30 minutes and then have the professor teach the material.",
    "It could have a little more teacher-led discussion",
    "the instructors did not communicate well between the two of them. The professors relied fully on students to facilitate discussion. More of their expertise needed to be asserted in the course. The course was unnecessarily difficult because ambiguity: the goals of course were unclear and not reinforced throughout the semester. There was in many ways too much latitude without adequate direction."

    "Yes, I would recommend knowing a little about religious spaces and symbolism.",
    "No, I would not recommend the course. I would recommend some of the essays to read, but the course was not a great asset towards engaging the material."
