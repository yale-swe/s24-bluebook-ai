   "comments": [
    "A very interesting and well-taught course. If you are reading this, you probably have to take it at some point, but it is really a great class. Dufresne is a great professor and always really energetic. Even though it is technically a \"lecture\" class, it doesn't feel like it because he really engages the class. The problem sets are really reasonable (the labs are a little annoying) and I feel like I've learned something by the time I finish it. I'm honestly sad that this class is over.",
    "Parts were interesting, but other parts felt like beating a dead horse. I would recommend the class, overall.",
    "This class is a really fun class. While the psets can sometimes be a little much, for the most part a really enjoyed this course, especially with Dufresne as the professor. There is a decent amount of overlap with MENG185, but the course is still worth taking.",
    "If you have to take it you have to take it. If you want to understand why structures can stand the way they do, this is a good class. If you are looking for a gut science credit, this might be your course IF you are very well versed in Newtonian physics (and some psets are 10-15 hr beware).",
    "An overview of the main points: The class is straightforward. The math in the class is not rigorous, so it's not as conceptually taxing as MATH 250, for example. The pset took me anywhere between 3 and 12 hours every week. Take MENG 280 with Prof. Dufresne if you can. He makes the material as exciting\/non-dry) as possible and he's extremely approachable. We had weekly psets and sometimes we had to do little labs in the CEID. These labs, though not graded as rigorously as traditional lab credits, were sometimes quite time-consuming. Overall, the class was a great introduction to the mechanics of materials, and I have left feeling that I've learned some neat stuff.",
    "Straight forward, not difficult but interesting, best part is the bending, not much work.",
    "Actually a very fun course, thanks to Dufresne! He does an excellent job teaching it. The work load is what you would expect from a class like this but the exams aren't very hard if you have followed along. Take it!",
    "MENG 280 is a worthwhile class for any student at Yale. More importantly I think that every engineer should be exposed to the concepts in MENG 280, even if they aren't as in depth as this class provides. As an electrical engineer I am glad that I took it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, especially if it is taught with Prof. Dufresne.",
    "I thought this was a nice intro MechE course - it wasn't an insane amount of work - just average. You will have to join the CEID to take this class, which was a good thing for me because I'd been meaning to do that for a while. Professor Dufresne is very understanding about the homework - once I had two midterms\/midterm projects due the same day as a pset and he gave me an extension when I asked. He also scanned all the problems for us and uploaded them to classesv2 so I didn't have to buy the book for this class. Overall, I really like this class and felt like I learned a lot!",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE. Prof Dufresne is the best thing about Yale Mechanical Engineering. You will leave this course with a pretty holistic knowledge of statics and a really really helpful resource in Professor Dufresne. Coursework is really manageable and classes are super well taught and interesting - so if you pay attention, there should really not be any issues.",
    "MENG 280 is an excellent introduction into Mechanical Engineering here at Yale. Professor Dufresne incorporates experiments in the CEID and ties various real world examples with the material taught in classroom. Even if you are not a MechE major, I would recommend this class for anyone trying to gain insight into the world of mechanics.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course, especially if it is taught by Dufresne. I don't think anyone really takes this course for fun, but it still can be at times. It is interesting and practical and understandable. What more could you ask?",
    "As a non-mechE student, was a good look into basic structural systems. Might recommend Intro to Structures instead if not super math-minded",
    "Strength and Deformation was a really interesting and engaging class. It's essentially the first of the few Mechanical Engineering classes you'll take for the major. Even if you're not taking the class for the major, the material is fascinating, and Dufresne is an amazing professor. Seriously, he's one of the best here at Yale. The problem sets and tests are fair, and in the case of a difficult problem set or exam, Dufresne is always helpful and accommodating. He cares more about you knowing the material than anything else.",
    "You pretty much have to take this to be a MechE; that being said, Dufresne makes statics as exciting as one could reasonably expect.",
    "Covers interesting topics with decent workload",
    "As a mechanical engineering major who was required to take the class, I recommend the class, though with mixed feelings. Class participation is a major part of the grade, so you should be going to every lecture. However, often the lectures couldn't pull me in and left my mind to wander a bit, mindlessly taking notes. Only when reviewing for the exams did I come to really appreciate what we learned and the interesting applications of bending, stress\/strain, and deformation. Problem sets range from 5 to 10 hours, depending on how difficult the material is that week. The labs included in the problem sets can take about 3 hours, though it is not too painful if you pull together some friends. TL;DR Don't think that this class is going to be some gut course. Professor Dufresne may be the highlight of the class. Though he was a bit frantic all semester and sometimes boring during lecture, he is a wonderful person. He is genuinely interested in the class and its students, so if you have a problem, you should feel free to talk to him.",
    "If you need to understand the structural properties of materials, this class will give you a bit of the knowledge to do so.",
    "Would recommend (its mandatory for MENG). Also its a lowkey great SC class. GOod stuff all around. Not too much work, tests arent too hard, class is nice, section and office hours are quality, etc.",
    "Take this class. Even if you're not an engineering student, it's so cool. Structural analysis, the nature of materials--real life."
