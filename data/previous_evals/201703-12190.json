   "comments": [
    "It would be helpful to be given essential vocabulary every unit, since the vocabulary at the end of each unit often included many terms that we were never tested on or used in class. Otherwise, the course was great. Also it would be good to mention earlier in the course some of the resources the book has (vocabulary at end of each unit, grammar analysis, appendices, etc.) and that you should be studying on your own every day. As someone that hasn't really taken a difficult language course before, I was thrown into the deep end and did not know I had to be doing things besides the assigned homework and readings if I wanted to succeed.",
    "The strengths are in the class participation and community.",
    "The course has many strengths. The mixture of quizzes and longer unit tests is a good way of testing knowledge and ensuring constant revision. The teaching by Liubov was fantastic. One thing that could be improved is I would have liked there to be more speaking in class. I wasn't able to make it to the Russian table times, and we did very little work on accent in class. I sometimes feel like I sound Italian when I try to speak Russian!",
    "It was taught very well and straightforward from the textbook curriculum. The professor was also engaging and helped provide cultural context for lessons."

    "This course is awesome! The faculty in the Russian department is excellent, however it is not a gut language by any means. I don't recommend taking this class if you already have a full load because it certainly requires a lot of consistent time and effort. However, you will finish the course with a very good base level knowledge of the Russian language and it's a very interesting and rewarding language to know.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes! Russian is a lot of fun and a great language. The Russian program and teaching is really strong.",
    "Yes because it was very interesting and a great introduction to the Russian language."
