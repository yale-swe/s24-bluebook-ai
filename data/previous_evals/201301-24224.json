    "I really enjoyed this class. i wish there had been more set course objectives to help guide the studying process but i thought it was a great insight into the policy concerning maternal and child health policy. i would recommend this class to anyone interested in the topic.",
    "Good course, but I didn't learn as much about policy and the health care system in the US as it pertains to women and children as I was hoping",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I liked how we were able to cover a wide range of topics related to maternal child health. I would prefer if the class were a little earlier in the day, otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing. I really learned a lot and am glad I took this course.",
    "Great class if you love maternal and child health!",
    "This course is absolutely amazing. The instructor really makes it interesting for the students.",
    "I think the course is a great introduction to the history of MCH and how policies and government programs have developed to address the health of women and children. The topics were pertinent and interesting, and I looked forward to class every week.I know that I didn't do as much of the readings as the semester wore on, so it might be good to include more discussion about reactions to articles or things people found interesting to enrich the discussion.",
    "This was a great course for those interested in Maternal and Child Health or want to know more.",
    "The instructor",
    "I had really high hopes for this course - because it seemed like the more practical version of another course at this school that focuses a lot on research. This course got off to a slow start - the first two (or three, even) lectures could be combined into one.I understand the reason that the professor deems it to be important, but it felt a bit like high school civics at some points.",
    "This course was interesting. The focus on how the health system in the US approaches care for women and children was illuminating. The lectures gave a good overview of a number of important topics in this area. The readings were relevant - however, the readings were not well integrated into the class and therefore came to feel unnecessary. My recommendation is to have fewer readings, but to incorporate them more into the lectures\/discussions."

    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Professor Lee was a wonderful instructor; she was very clear and made the material enjoyable and thought-provoking.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Super nice professor! She is really well versed on policy and advocacy for children. Always willing to help her students and is a FABULOUS lecturer!",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0AWESOME. A++",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Dr. Lee is great. She clearly commands an immense amount of knowledge about MCH and especially policy. She has a unique perspective given her background as a midwife, and her expertise, while undoubtedly informed by academia to some extend, seems to come from her job advocating for the health of women and children.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Professor was great. She cares about what she does and it shows. Great lecturer as well.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Excellent and comprehensive",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0I think she is overall quite good, and certainly knowledgeable about her specific field.While I understand that most of us lean toward one specific side of the political spectrum here at YSPH, I found myself frustrated a few times about her inability to teach without infusing her political opinion into her lectures. There's a strong difference between offering an opinion and teaching from a political standpoint. there was some eye-rolling and thinly guised negative comments that made me question whether we are really being prepared to function as successful public health professionals. This is especially true if we (all) cannot take the time to understand those who disagree with us, and to do so in a way that does not turn them, or their opinions, into a caricature.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Dr. Lee was very knowledgable, with prior experience in midwifery, epidemiology, and policy.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0I really enjoyed Professor Lee. She is very knowledgeable about the state of women and childrens' health care in the US. She appeared enthusiastic and motivated to teach about this area. She is also passionate about this subject. She was approachable and available and very open to students' questions and concerns."
