   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to my fellow students. An excellent course that provides a thorough understanding of the current political landscape of the Middle East. Coming at it from different perspectives including gender, religion, minorities and the evolving nature of the state, it will challenge the perspectives of students with prior knowledge of the region. Fairly heavy on the reading, the course should only be taken by students who have a genuine interest in the Middle East. As it spends one week only on each country, students who seek to understand particular trends (excluding gender, which os covered in great depth) might miss different perspectives or analyses on that particular country or subject.",
    "It is a feminist-anthropologist Middle East book club, covering a large number of countries and topics of the region, from patrimony to infertility treatments and from Morocco to Iraq and Saudi Arabia. I would definitely recommend it to someone, who would like to gain a deeper understanding of Middle Eastern societies.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for graduate students! The class discussions were lively and the variety of opinions and disciplines represented made for thirough conversations. The class is useful for Middle East specialists and non specialists alike."

   "comments": [
    "As a master student, the question is not directly applicable to dissertation \/ research. It did however, motivate me to wanting to do research in the future. Students from other disinclines might not immediately see that an anthropology course is directly applicable to his or her field of research. However, the books covered in the course directly relate to the same questions as other disciplines attempt to answer. By questioning assumed realities that other disciplines work on the basis of, the course actually provides an extremely valuable perspective and complement. This is the academic first course I have taken on the Middle East and it significantly deepened my knowledge of the region.",
    "This course went a long way toward deepening my knowledge of anthropology and middle eastern studies. My research will focus on the content of this course, so it was useful and interesting for me!"
