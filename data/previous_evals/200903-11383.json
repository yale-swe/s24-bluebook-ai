    "This course is essentially a free period for working independently. Having a large studio space was terrific, as was having time to explore materials. Take this class if you would like to figure out your own things and understand how to generate work in a self-directed way. This seems like the \"realest\" engagement with art-making of any painting course I've taken at Yale, which is to say, the practices I developed this semester could easily continue into the rest of my life.",
    "You have to be a self-starter to take this course, there is no real motivation to work unless you care to.",
    "yes",
    "Good for working on your own ideas while still able to get the classroom environment and classmate feed back."
