    "I loved getting to write every week, to get personal feedback from Verlyn, and to discuss my writing during office hours. That was certainly the best part of the course. Class time went well, I liked analyzing sentences and workshopping students' pieces. Like most writing courses I've taken here, the learning really happened out of class, when I was writing and getting comments from the professor.",
    "Clear writing is important to most professions, and this is a great crash course on how to do it. Writing something each week, and reading and dissecting each other's work was very helpful.",
    "The course operated like a writing workshop and the time spent dissecting student pieces was extremely valuable. I would suggest longer required readings each week.",
    "Freedom to write. Great feedback. Good discussion. Revolutionary. I wish everyone had to take this course. The world would be a much clearer place.",

    "As difficult as it is to turn people away, I think this course would benefit from a smaller enrollment.",
    "I could never tell this to Verlyn for some reason. But when you do the \"some sentences' I wish you would pause before going on after each one in case anyone has a question about the advice you gave. On this note, you must not have seemed approachable enough for me to say this in person...but you were pretty approachable. So now I am confused. But maybe I'm just tired. And jet lagged.",

    "If you'd like to work on your writing, definitely take it. You write 2 pages a week, read fantastic writing, and get to work with Verlyn, who is a sharp editor and delightful editor. If you're looking to write longer form pieces this isn't the course for you, as should be obvious. I'd say take it by all means.",
    "Take it! Everyone should take this course. (Although that contradicts what I said about having a smaller enrollment...)",
    "This course is less structure than other writing courses at FES. If students have a clear idea of what they want to focus on writing each week, there is much to be gained. If students are unsure what the want to improve, they may feel lost in the course.",
    "Take it. I guess it can be hard to apply this to say...an MESC thesis, but I wasn't do that, so I didnt care. But this course would be positively useful for everyone. Please take it, your readers will be grateful.",
    "This is an extremely valuable course. I highly recommend it.",
    "You get as much out of the course as you put into it. It's easy to put assignments off and then just scramble to write something quickly - but you won't benefit from that because you're not putting in the effort to improve your writing. Take Verlyn's comments to heart and really practice doing what he suggests. He's very helpful and understanding.",
    "If you want to be forced to write frequently, and have your writing edited by a master craftsman, take this course! The class is designed to turn people accustomed to writing academic prose into creative writers. If you are already a creative writer, the class can still be helpful, but won't necessarily be as challenging or thought-provoking.",
    "Experiment with different areas of your interest when you submit your pieces each week.",
    "Have fun writing.",
    "Don't be nervous about other people reading your writing. Everyone will mirror Professor Klinkenborg's supportive, while still constructively critical, attitude."
