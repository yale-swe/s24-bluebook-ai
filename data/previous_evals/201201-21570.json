    "If you are considering doing research in college, this is a very good class for seeing just what it would be like doing research along with a college professor. If you are not considering scientific research, then this class is probably not for you.",
    "I kind of regret taking PSE. Many of the lectures were not super interesting, even though the professors were really accomplished. The homework is not painless, in fact, it is sometimes miserable. The discussions can be okay or they can be really bad.",
    "If you are shopping this class, you have already taken Science 198, and there is absolutely no reason why you should not continue. This semester is even more fruitful than the last, and will ensure that you are prepared to get as much out of the summer research opportunity as possible. In addition, the simple title of \"Perspectives\" will prove invaluable when trying to find space in labs. All of the labs that I contacted got back to me within a day, none required anything more than a brief synopsis of my background, and half offered me the job after just one, introductory email. So, take the course; it is the best scientific opportunity available to freshmen.",
    "This class meets once a week and alternates between lecture and section. I'm not totally sure if it is worth it, but I met my lab mentor through a lecture he gave. So I definitely can't say it didn't serve a purpose. If you are interested in all aspects of science and research, you will probably love the lecture series. If you are hardcore into one particular realm of science, then the wide variety of topics will probably frustrate\/bore you.",
    "You should do it if you get in. The funding's good, and classes which are in your field of interest will probably fascinate you. I felt out of my depth in some of the classes which weren't aligned with my interests, and in retrospect, I should have spent more time preparing for these lectures. Doing the problem sets with friends is fun, and you do make a lot of friends from this class.",
    "DO. NOT. TAKE.",
    "I was just in it for the money, though some lectures were actually interesting.",
    "Take this class! I learned so much! Writing the paper was rewarding and fun.",
    "If you took 198, this is basically the same except you will spend parts of reading week going hard on your research paper. Remember that spring fling is Tuesday before the Friday that the paper is due. Don't take this if you're not doing research this summer, as you will feel unfulfilled by the class, and by the time you spend writing your paper. A wd for first semester won't look THAT bad.",
    "Sometimes the discussion sections can leave you asking for more. This may be because sciency students either 1. are bad at communicating or 2. have to put in a lot of work in other classes besides PSE so they don't have timeI think that if the participation grade was something like 30%, things would be different. That being said, it is hard for freshmen in college to try to talk intellectually about work being done by labs full of post docs in a variety of fields for an hour and a half. But I would encourage students to try to mix things up in discussion to avoid the conversation dying out or growing stale.",
    "I would hesitate to recommend it to another student. There's a lot of different avenues for funding research at Yale, and so the money at the beginning may seem important, but it really isn't. The lectures are actually really interesting, but the sections can be terrible. If you get a good section leader or good people in it, then it's bearable, but otherwise sometimes it isn't worth it.",
    "SCIE 199 is the second term of Perspectives, if you have liked it so far then take it. Otherwise, if you are on the fence, remember that the grant is the light at the end of the tunnel. Make sure you space out the writing of the final paper, it will make the experience much more enjoyable.",
    "Pretty much same continuation of last semester. Paper is a lot of work as expected, and try not to save it tillthe last minute. I saved the last week for it, and this turned out to be more than fine.",
    "Even thoughI'm not using the summer stipend (which is a huge incentive in itself), I'd still recommend this class. Freshman science classes alone don't really provide a good idea of what going into the field actually entails, and PSE provides really good complementary exposure. I probably wouldn't take this class if you only like physics and hate biology or something, because then you'd hate a good fraction of the lectures, but if you like science and research in general, the lectures are really interesting and provide a good introduction to the scientific community at Yale. Second semester was definitely more work than first semester, mostly because of the 20 page paper.",
    "If you are interested in science in general, this course provides a great sampling of different fields that are available and exactly what Yale professors are doing. Lectures can get boring at times, but if you are engaged, they are really interesting. If you are interested in summer research, this is a really great opportunity to ensure you have the opportunity after freshman summer and have decent funding. Also, because it is such a sampling course, you are able to know exactly what different professors do, which makes it great if you ever want to approach\/develop a relationship with professors in a certain field. Good resource to get to know very respectable research professors, if you take advantage of it!",
    "I think a lot of it depends on the discussion section. I didn't really like PSE last semester because I had a horrible section, but this semester my discussion section was absolutely phenomenal. It really felt like a group of friends and we had amazing conversations about everything from bioethics to glowing kittens. Our discussion leader (Meg Urry) also baked us cookies! I am genuinely going to miss it.The lectures were also quite interesting and the psets a bit annoying but not too bad. Exploration paper was kind of annoying but ultimately a rewarding experience.",
    "Personally, I didn't enjoy PSE. I thought the lectures were too complex and assumed too much prior knowledge. That being said, I do think I've learned a lot from the lectures. The summer research stipend is the only reason I stuck with the class. Other people LOVED it though, so I would say take it if you want but don't be afraid to drop it if you don't like it.",
    "Perspectives is great for the research stipend in the summer. Period. In theory, the class is so interesting, but it's just so poorly executed. You discuss lectures from a range of scientific disciplines that are really interesting but WAY too complex for most students to understand well, and then you write a 17-page paper in April that likely relates to nothing you've covered in class. (By the way, if you do take this class, start that paper ASAP. You'll be glad you did.) Prof. Urry and Dean Segraves are both total sweethearts though.",
    "So, Perspectives was both an incredibly gratifying experience, as well as a bit underwhelming. Let's start with the positive side.1). There is little to no work for Perspectives relative to other classes throughout the semester (except for the final Research Exploration Paper, but I'll get to that later). That's not to say that you can get through the course effortlessly, which would defeat the course's purpose anyway, but I don't think that a student shouldn't take it PSE if they are worried about it overwhelming his workload.2). Like the course description says, PSE students have the opportunity to attend lectures by prominent Yale faculty about their cutting-edge research, with topics ranging from high-energy particle physics and quantum computing to tissue engineering and antibody optimization to the search for another Earth.3). Undeniably, the best part of PSE for me was the Friday discussion section every other week. I can say with complete sincerity that it was an incomparable opportunity to sit down with a group of like-minded people and talk about innovative science. The greatest part of the discussions were always when we got off topic, as that was when you knew people were really enthused about what they were saying. And by off topic I mean \"not exactly the topic of the lecture,\" such as extending a discussion on antibody diversity to the cancerous effects that could arise from mis-coded antibodies; another great discussion included trying to formulate the technological and ethical implications of quantum computing. So, discussion section was definitely the best part of PSE. Also, having enthusiastic faculty discussion leaders was especially helpful, as they were great resources of information and insightful questions to keep the discussionalive.Onto the negatives:1). The quality of the lectures depended almost entirely on who was giving them. Some lecturers were able to give exciting and comprehensible talks on topics that most students had never encountered, while others took pretty common subjects and made them almost inaccesible, as they were too technical and assumed a much greater background than they realistically should have. Just something to consider.2). Looking back, \"Perspectives\" didn't really give me the perspective on being a scientific researcher I thought it would. Many of the lectures were strictly about the science at hand, while some also touched on how to get into academic science and what it was like being a researcher. I had assumed early on that, in addition to discussing the research topics, each lecturer would touch on what it was like to be a researcher in his field, including briefly describing other popular research paths, any open opportunities for undergraduates, and outlook for the future of the field. There was a bit of this, but not nearly as much as I expected.Hope this helps! Let me know if you need anything else.Tom",
    "If you're planning on doing research during the summer after your freshman year, this class relieves much of the stress of fellowship applications etc. Overall, the workload isn\u0092t too bad (except for the final paper) as it's mostly biweekly discussion questions.",
    "Its a heavily Bio\/Chem\/Physics. As an engineer, I felt a little lost at times, but it does introduce you to specific research topics in various labs\/fields for a 1\/2 credit, you have to write a 20 page paper second semester which kinda sucks",
    "I would highly recommend Perspectives to incoming freshman not only for the course content and the funding opportunity but because it introduces students to a community of freshmen with similar interests in science and engineering. This community is a great support system going forward.",
    "This is good for the research they will pay you to do, although the time slot is terrible.",
    "Students have different opinions about Perspectives on Science and Engineering. Some feel it is not for them and drop it in Fall Semester. I was one of those people who really enjoyed Perspectives on Science and Engineering. I have research experience in Nanotechnology and I learnt that in nanotech research, all 3 sciences have to work together. You can't make a development in nanotechnology relying on just physics, you need to have knowledge on physics, chemistry and biology. Perspectives makes you aware and understand advancements that are being made in other fields outside of your interests. I am a physics oriented student but I found it a valuable experience to learn about Lung Regeneration and how our Immune system produces all the antibodies to fend off the millions of intruders to our bodies. It's not directly relevant to my appreciation of Physics, but very relevant to Nanotechnology. Perspectives did exactly what I wanted it to, expose me to a range of cutting edge developments in all fields of science.As I write this evaluation, I'm using my research stipend (they literally just hand you a 4200$ check to cash into your bank account and pay for living expenses) to do experiments with nanoparticles and I'm really enjoying it!Homework questions are fine, it's the end of year \"Exploration Paper\" that is a lot of work.",
    "This class is best for people who are serious about science and want an in depth view of many branches of science.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you are absolutely committed to researching with Yale in the summer. It might even prove to be a burden to your schedule.",
    "Yes, the summer experience is worth it",
    "The continuation of Perspectives' first semester. Because each lecture is given by a different professor, their quality could vary; I found the first semester's more interesting. Writing the research paper involves a lot of work at the end of the semester, so be warned.",
    "Presumably you took this first semester as well. The second semester is essentially the same, but you have to pick a summer project (if you're working over the summer) and write the paper. The paper isn't too difficult, but you need to allocate time to write it.",
    "Perspectives as a whole was a wonderful experience. I really feel like I learned a lot, like my scientific knowledge has been significantly broadened, and I am very grateful for the opportunity this program has given me to do research at Yale this summer.",
    "Lectures are hit or miss, but the stipend money's worth it (and makes planning for summer so much less stressful!). Also overall workload is pretty light - just 4 question long p-sets every other week - and the final paper isn't too bad. Overall I'd say take it if you're interested in doing research over the summer.",
    "Perspectives isn't for everyone. It is challenging because you deal with brand new material that changes every other week. However, it sure is an experience to hear from all the wonderful researches that guest lecture. The answer to the question of whether to take this course or not very much depends on the student.",
    "PSE is a half lecture\/ half discussion based class which is highly dependant on the quality of the lectures presented. Some were extremely interesting and made the course as a whole worthwhile, while others were very incomprehensible. Discussion section could be extremely excellent, as both of my section groups this year were, however what I have heard from other groups tells me that this too depends on who is in your section.",
    "I recommend it for science students, mostly because of the great summer opportunities the course provides."
