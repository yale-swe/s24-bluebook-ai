   "comments": [
    "This class covers a lot of material, but it is not a stressful class. It would be hard to learn all of this material from just reading a book so I would recommend taking it if you want to know representation theory.",
    "Clear, interesting lectures; went a bit fast sometimes. Requires a lot more mathematical maturity than 222, so prerequisite is misleading. Quite dense; problem sets got a little arcane\/tedious.",
    "While the prerequisites only state linear algebra, you probably need at least a bit of group theory to follow the course. It is difficult, and the psets aren't that easy. But if you work hard then you will learn an incredible amount of mathematics.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to other students who are interested in either physics or math. It's a lot of fun, and you definitely pick up the tools you need to think about representation theory in physics and math. The problem sets are interesting, and the exam isn't too bad. Overall, it's a great course.",
    "First of all, I used at least 4 different sources. Etingof was by far the worst. Unfortunately, Prof. Lachowska likes his style of explaining the material, so you would definitely have a hard time understanding it during the lectures. In retrospect, I wish I did not take the class. The material is beautiful but not in the way it is presented by Etingof, and taught by Lachowska. If you are a math major, you can happily thrive without taking this class. If you are a physics major, you would not extract anything useful from the class. Overall, I would advise you to self-learn the material. Make sure you first know abstract algebra well!",
    "A good class, but the bare prerequisites aren't quite enough preparation to get everything out of it. Professor Lachowska is a good lecturer, although she moves quickly at times. Workload is in line with what you would expect from a high-level elective: six long-ish problem sets."
