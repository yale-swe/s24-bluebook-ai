   "comments": [
    "Definitely! If you want to be a good writer. It's so much fun to read and write in this class.",
    "I would recommend this class. There are five essays to write and many short well written pieces to read, but overall it is not that much work. I would recommend it because it will improve your writing greatly.",
    "Essay or draft due every week. Basically, read the New Yorker and discuss it with a group of random underclassmen.",
    "Take this class! And take it from Shirkhani if you can because she is FANTASTIC.",
    "English 120 is not like your standard English course. In this course, you truly do learn how to read and write personal essays and in doing so are able to explore and identify your voice as a writer. I would definitely recommend this course to another student wishing to improve his or her writing abilities and focus on a different style of writing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to every Yale student since it teaches a kind of writing that is useful in both personal and professional realms. It is also very fun, even if it is a lot of work.",
    "English 120 is a course where one learns to really write creative nonfiction. It will help reading a lot of fantastic writers from sources like the New Yorker and applying their techniques to one's own writing. It was amazing seeing my writing grow more involved, interesting, and smoother overall. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.",
    "This is a great class. If you get the chance to take this class with Professor Shirkhani, TAKE IT. She's a fabulous teacher and you will really enjoy it. It certainly has a fair share of work, with 5 page essays to write every two weeks, but the readings for the class are generally short and really fun (usually New Yorker essays and the like) and the papers themselves are nicely spread out so you're never overwhelmed during midterms\/finals like you might be in another class.",
    "This class is okay. I didn't find it to be the transformative experience other students claim it to be, but it was nice to get to write regularly. It's a Yale classic, and Professor Shirkhani is a good professor. Two reasons not to take this class:1) You're a non-creative-writing English major. This class revolves around discussing essays and then attempting to emulate them. I found myself, as a non-creative-writing English major, wishing to analyze them in writing, because I had more ideas than were appropriate to share in class. Your reading of the texts feels somewhat pointless when you know you're not going to get to share your thoughts in an essay.2) You're unorganized. This class has a ton of finicky worksheets and deadlines, and your participation grade will slip if you're not super organized.",
    "ENGL 120 is a course where you will read a lot of essays, write a lot of essays, revise those essays, and then get pointed feedback about what you did right and wrong. Grade is entirely based on your essays. Be prepared to write write and write some more.",
    "I think every student at Yale should take English 120. I looked forward to both the class and the readings each week. It was great to become familiar with so many different essayists throughout the term, and my own writing improved substantially.",
    "English 120 is one of those courses you have to take before graduating! It improves your writing skills, but more than that, it makes writing essays fun. The readings are hilarious and serve as great models for your own writing."
