    "Do NOT take this course unless you absolutely have to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Go to MATH244 or skip this and take CPSC365 instead.Course material is OK, not hard this semester. Lectures are not helpful at all. Homework is problematic\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the median is 99 out of 100 for every pset\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I did not like the textbook in particular.",
    "It is a very hard math class that is worth taking only if you are prepared to study a lot and probably only if you are majoring in computer science. Though to be fair, the math in the second half of the semester (like induction and the pigeonhole principle) is interesting and I'm glad I know it now.",
    "Painful, but I suppose you have to take it if you're looking at this.",
    "It's a pretty unpleasant couse. Some of the material is pretty cool, but Feigenbaum's poor teaching made going to lecture a chore, and the curve combined with ridiculously high medians made grades an ever-present concern. Some of the problem sets had median scores of 100, which means I'm either stupid (quite possible) or there's a lot of cheating. As stated at the beginning of the course, there's not supposed to be any collaboration whatsoever on problem sets, which account for 50% of the overall grade. As far as material goes, we covered a new topic every week; there's very little cohesion to the course. Definitely shop math 244 if you're one of those clever mathy people.",
    "This is a course that I would only recommend if it were required for a student's major, however it was not a bad course overall.",
    "Not a particularly difficult class, you just have to put the work in to get results out. Try and take (or, at least, shop) Math 244 if you're doing this for some kind of major requirement.",
    "Avoid this class with Feigenbaum if you can. Everybody who took the class with Angluin last year seemed to really enjoy it, whereas many people who took it with Feigenbaum agreed that it was poorly taught. Maybe 1\/2 the class went to lecture because they were little more than Feigenbaum presenting proofs, rather than explaining the concepts of the material.Also, in the middle of the final, a student went up to Feigenbaum and told her that there was an error in the final. With 10 minutes left in the exam, she changed the problem because the one she had printed was unsolvable.As far as workload, the weekly PSETs weren't terrible. They only took a couple hours, and for the last 4 or 5 PSETs, the median grades were 99 or 100 on them.I guess the bottom line is, avoid the class with Prof. Feigenbaum. Then again, if you're thinking of taking 202, you probably don't have much choice of when you take the class.",
    "Boring. Don't take it. Seriously. Take a different math class instead. At least you will learn something new. Or take it if you already have 5 classes and want a 6th. You will not even know you have this class in your schedule.",
    "202 is an assortment of mathematical topics that commonly appear in computer science. I would not recommend 202 to a student, unless to take care of the math prerequisite. If you're legitimately interesting in discrete math, I would take Math 244 than this class.",
    "I would not take this class unless you absolutely have to. I was able to grasp the material enough to appreciate that it could have been mildly bearable under a different professor. However, as is, it would literally have been equally productive for me to stare at a blank wall for an hour as it was to listen to the professor teach.",
    "I've heard its quite different with Angluin. With Feigenbaum, its problems out of textbook for 10 weeks.",
    "Take it for your major and try and take it not with Joan. If you don't need it for your major, find a better class. If you need it for CPSC, suck it up and take it.",
    "Do not take itwith Professor Feigenbaum. But you probably have to take it, so just take it another semester with a different professor. Professor Feigenbaum does not teach the material; she just reads out of the textbook. The material is fine, although somewhat all over the place and each subject is barely touched upon before moving on. Just pick a different professor. Take advantage of peer tutors as well; they're incredible resources.",
    "I think it depends on who teaches it, but I would not recommend it with the same professor. Math 244 covers the same material but in a deeper and more proof-based fashion, so if I were to choose again I would definitely have taken 244.",
    "This class isan absolute mess. Do not take it unless you have to (Comp Sci, Applied Math, etc.) It's a very easy A for someone who's done a decent amount of amount math; for those of you doing applied math out there and want to take this instead of 244. In that case, only take it if you just don't care about learning, this course won't give you anything new. The lectures are boring, the psets while they can be \"challenging\"(relative to the material in the course) they are very much useless and artifically made more difficult in an unsuccessful effort to bring the curve down for psets (every body gets 90+ in psets.)On top of all this, they made a huge mistake in the 2nd midterm costing some people tons of their time and then somehow \"solved\" it by giving everyone 10 minutes. Needless to say, the professor was clearly very disorganized (not even going through her exam once before she prints it out??) and it was a very obvious mistake that could be spotted by any undergrad that has done some intro probability thoery course.",
    "If you are considering taking this course it is most likely to fulfill a requirement. Given the option I would choose this course over its counterpart in the Math department every time. Do not take this course with Professor Feigenbaum; it is genuinely worth waiting for another professor to teach the course.",
    "Absolutely do not take this class with Joan Feigenbaum. She was awful - she always tried to explain things in really confusing technical ways, with definitions and proofs, when they were actually perfectly logical and intuitive. With a different professor, though, I'm sure the class could be fine, even fun (like First-Order Logic or contest math), so don't be scared.",
    "This is all you need to know about CPSC 202 as taught by Joan Feigenbaum. The following is an actual email sent to our class on Saturday, September 29, 2012 at 10:52AM.------------------------------------------Dear CPSC 202 students,On Thursday, Sept 27, I gave a very disjointed lecture and, most egregiously, confused the roles of columns and rows and n's and m's at the end. Please accept my apology.In order to be sure that you have the information you need to do HW4, I have posted a cleaned-up version of this lecture on the course website, under the \"Lectures\" tab. I have also attached it here. In addition to using these notes, you may as usual address questions to the TA and to the peer tutors, either face-to-face or in email.Please do not reply to this message.Sincerely,Joan Feigenbaum",
    "Poor course. We were encouraged not to attend class because students who weren't fully engrossed in the lectures were \"distracting\" to the lecturer. The problem sets are supposedly 50% of your grade, but everyone gets 100% on them, so basically the 2 midterms are the only factor into your grade (the instructor only seeks to separate students for grading). For the second midterm, the professor made several typos on a question, making it impossible to solve. She then allowed people to come in later that afternoon after the test was turned in to work for 10 minutes (so I'm sure some people just looked up all the answers), which was unfair considering the fact that the class is only graded by comparison with our peers. The selectionof topics in this course is also questionable -- we spent so much time covering logic, we had a disorganized introduction to linear algebra (that I doubt people who hadn't already taken linear algebra understood), and then we barely covered graph theory.With that said, this is still an easier option than discrete math through the math department, so if you're just looking for the least resistance way to get through the requirement for the CS major, just sign up for this course and read the book (don't bother going to lecture).",
    "Professor Feigenbum (or however you spell it) is the most condescending professor I have ever had and she probably has no idea. She is obviously extremely brilliant and thus spends the whole semester talking about how simple and easy the material is that you are working on. For example, on our midterm there was sort of a trick question that only 5 people in the class got right (out of at least 50). When she was discussing the midterm she said, \"It is amazing that you all got this question wrong since it was so easy.\"Another favorite line of hers, (after doing a proof in class) \"Isn't it cool that we can prove theorems like this using such simple and basic arguments?\" The arguments she is referring to are of course the lessons we learn in class.Anyway, the class itself isn't that bad, there were some tricky problems on the problem sets and the tests but the TA was super helpful.",
    "This is an easier alternative to MATH244. There are 10 problem sets (5% of grade each) and two midterms (25% each). The problem sets are pretty straightforward if you do the reading and understand the material. Each of the weekly problem sets shouldn't take more than 5-6 hrs. This makes the class to have a steep curve. The median score for most of the problem sets was between 98 and 100!Take this class only if it is required for your major because the professor isn't engaging and most people do not show up for the class.",
    "Its a rough class. I would not recommend it to someone who doesn't have to take it. It's not all that difficult but it's unpleasant at every turn and the curve was kinda steep.",
    "Grudgingly, I must admit that I have learned a lot from this course. The course starts off slow and the grading is very arbitrary. This improved throughout the length of the course. If you are extremely mathematically inclined DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE; take the math department version. If you are not so mathematically inclined, this could be a good introduction to formal thinking, and will be good for you moving forward.",
    "CS Majors are required to take this class, but I wouldn't recommend it to another student unless they are really comfortable with proofs and have taken other math classes before. Lots of math majors take this class because it is easier than Math 244, which really affects the grading curve for non-math majors. Also tests were much harder than the problem sets.",
    "For a CS major you have to take it or an equivalent of it. But PLEASE, PLEASE do not take it with Professor Feigenbaum!! Possibly the worst professor I have had at Yale. She teaches straight out of the book and often confuses herself during the lecture. She assumes that we have an incredibly strong background in math or computer science. She should not be teaching an undergraduate course such as this. She assumes we know a lot more than we actually do. She runs through the proofs incredibly quickly, and then acts as if we are stupid for having asked a clarifying question. In addition, her tests were really unfair. They cover rather random parts of the material. She would spend a couple of lectures on linear homogenous recurrence relations and it appeared on a tiny part of the final, not even solving one, just setting one up. The tests barely have relation to the problem sets.",
    "This class was the worst class I have taken at Yale (I'm a Junior). Professor Feigenbaum was frequently unprepared for class and spent much of class time trying to correct her own mistakes (she even made some egregious mistakes on our final). When students made complaints about the class, they were stonewalled by shrugs and inappropriate yelling. The material was completely dry, and the lecture was a messy regurgitation of the textbook. The problem sets, although time-consuming, consisted mostly of specialty problems that were not helpful in learning the basic concepts of the class (it should say something when the problem set average is a 99 but the midterm average is a 70). Whatever you do, do NOT take this class.",
    "202 is discrete math for wimps. It's not awful, but not fun - I'd recommend that people who aren't using it for the CS requirement look hard at some of the logic classes instead.",
    "CS 202 was really annoying with Joan Feigenbaum. Her lectures aren't good, I ended up learning most of the class for myself from the book. You have to do well on the homeworks because everyone gets everything right, because it's not really that hard... So then everything rides on the exams. A few mistakes and you hurt your grade a lot... The material isn't hard, but the way it's presented made me worry about it and dislike it instead of be interested in it when I know I could have been. I'd say, shop the professor and pay close attention to whether or not you enjoy their lectures. If you're well-prepared, definitely consider Math 244 instead.",
    "I would not recommend taking this course unless you're a Computer Science major, but perhaps I just had an experience with a bad professor.",
    "I would NOT recommend this class to another student. Professor Feigenbaum is the worst professor I have had so far at Yale. She glances over key topics and confusing points, claiming that they are \"elementary\" and easy to figure out. She also seems to not know the material, often either confusing the material and offering an incomprehensible explanation that is incorrect, or states that she will look up the answer and email it later. Furthermore, problem sets are fairly difficult, and the tests are like a surprise. If you have no experience with proofs, this class will definitely be more difficult. Since you have to take it to be a comp sci major, make sure to take the class with another professor. Avoid Feigenbaum, she's the worst.",
    "This course wasn't too difficult with Feigenbaum, but the lectures were pretty poor. The textbook helps a lot with the problem sets and for the exams.",
    "The material in this class is very interesting. Highly recommended. However, I would probably also look into MATH 244. The exams are difficult, and the homework can be time consuming, but the material is wonderful. Feigenbaum is sub-par in terms of teaching. She's a really nice person, though, and is incredibly smart in things outside of this class.",
    "I had a terrible experience in this class.",
    "CPCS 202 is an overview of a bunch of different math topics needed for computer science. I would recommend this class to another student. It is well structured and not to much work. Also, Debayan is very helpful if he is your TA.",
    "NO",
    "Mathematical Tools for Computer Science is in essence discrete math for computer science. If you enjoy discrete math or are a prospective computer science major, I would suggest that you take this class. Otherwise, I would not.",
    "Don't take this unless you have to.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class",
    "It's has good information, but it's all in the textbook. It's required for CS, but I don't imagine that many non-CS people take it.",
    "Iwould strongly recommend not taking this course with Professor Feigenbaum. If possible, I would recommend taking this class with Professor Angluin, who I have had for other courses, and would likely be a much better teacher. There were even several times this semester when Feigenbaum pointed us to Angluin's old notes for clarification (and they were much clearer).This class was not enjoyable nor well taught. Classes consisted of proofs detailed in the textbook with minimal example problems. And problem sets often contained the most difficult problems from the section and were usually tedious.",
    "After freshman chemistry I took an oath never to skip another class at Yale (or take one I'd want to skip), but this class made me a hypocrite. Don't take it with Feigenbaum unless its your senior year. The material covered certainly made connections in my other CS classes but I could have taken all the classes that require it as a prereq without it.",
    "Great Course, bad teacher.",
    "Take if you have to. isn't that hard but not a great class."
