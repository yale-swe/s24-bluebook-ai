   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class. You'll learn a lot about the history of healthcare and the history of health insurance. However, it's worth noting that this is not so much a class about the politics behind healthcare (at least national politics, that is--there's lots of discussion about the politics of organized medicine). While there is some discussion of the politics of the issues, I wouldn't call politics the primary focus of the course--the US healthcare system itself is more the focus in my opinion.",
    "As someone who knew pretty much nothing about health care in the US, this class was really helpful in giving me the historical background and a helpful framework to understand debates about health care policy today. Professor Swenson is clearly really interested in the topic and was always really helpful when we met outside of class to talk about the class material, paper topics, etc. The selected readings were all interesting, and while it might be a little hard to stay on top of the reading, it's pretty easy to catch up and they're all pretty readable\/enjoyable. Lectures were also good at synthesizing the material in the reading (sometimes doing the reading after lecture actually made things much easier). Overall I thought it was a really enjoyable class and the exams were straightforward.",
    "No, I would not recommend this class to a fellow student because it was not clear and just created unnecessary stress.",
    "Would recommend the course to others! So critical to understand, especially if you want to understand the politics of health care, insurance, The Affordable Care Act. That said, I took it for credit because the material is fascinating, but the final is worth 50% and final paper is worth 20%, which I think is risky (for the majority of the grade to be in the last two weeks). I realized after that the grading is not super harsh, so definitely possible to do well in the course...",
    "If you're interested in how the American healthcare system works and was created, definitely take this, especially if you're considering this against Health Economics. Really gets into the politics and ethics pulling at the healthcare system that have made it into what it is today. Professor Swenson is not the most engaging lecturer, but very knowledgable and eager to share what he knows. A pretty easy workload as it's easy to skip the readings and just go to lecture, but the readings are definitely worth it. The midterm and finals are really straightforward. If you've paid attention at all, you'll do fine. There's also a 5-7 page final essay on a relevant topic you'd like to explore deeper that can be really rewarding depending on what you write about.",
    "A few words of praise: this class was a superb way to learn about healthcare and its intricacies. The material was presented well, the professor was personable and kind, and the readings were in-depth and informative. Much like anything else, it's what you make of the class. You can skip the readings but the class won't be near as rewarding. One midterm, one 5 page paper, one final are the only assignments. The exams let you choose the topics you feel most comfortable about which is very kind. The paper is also on a topic of your choice. Personally, I think this material should be learned by everyone since everyone is impacted by healthcare, and understanding what led us here (the politics, economics, etc.) and where we are will help us better understand where we are going.",
    "Great topic, but the class lacks structure."
