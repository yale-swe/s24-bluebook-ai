   "comments": [
    "This course allowed me to practice speaking, reading, and writing Hindi a few hours a week. The workload was never too much and the class itself was relaxed and fun.",
    "You get as much out of the class as you put in!",
    "This class basically assumes you can understand a good amount of Hindi, and can read\/write at a basic level. You read all sorts of things from old stories to current news, write about it, and then discuss in class. It's very comprehensive and I learned a lot.",
    "Most definitely. Great way to continue learning the language - work is definitely heavy on the reading\/writing, but even if you're good at that, it definitely helps to increase one's speaking abilities.",
    "YES! Take it if you want to work on your Hindi ability, truly grow, while enjoying yourself thoroughly. The teacher is amazing, the class is immersive, and you can learn and grow just as much as you would like yourself to grow. Highly recommended."
