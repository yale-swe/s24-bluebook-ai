   "comments": [
    "Deeper knowledge both of specific calculus concepts and of math in general",
    "Knowledge of One variable calculus",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of integrals and series.",
    "I was able to gain an understanding of integral calculus and pre-multi variable calculus topics.",
    "N\/A",
    "The mathematical skills as outlined in the syllabus",
    "Standard Calc 2 course: integration, sequences, series, tests for convergence, polar coordinates",
    "I developed the skills to tackle integral calculus, sequences and convergence, and a bit of multivariable calculus. We also saw how this type of Math might be applicable to the real world.",
    "I developed the ability to apply critical thinking to a subject such as math. In past math courses I've taken outside of Yale, math has been largely an opportunity to derive or apply formulas. After taking Math 115, I've gained the ability to think criticallyspecifically, I'd see a problem that I wouldn't know how to do on the surface, use the tools I already had to attempt to solve the problem, and consequently, understand the concepts on a deeper level.",
    "Apart from the math itself, I think the skills of learning how to take a math course in college were invaluable. The transition from a high school math course to a college math course was rough, especially since the last math course I took was two years ago. However, I feel so much better about math next semester now that I have had the experience. The brunt of the material is learned through the practice of physically doing the problems by myself, regardless of how thoroughly I followed along in class. I think this especially rang true when we were learning about series. Familiarity with the problems was necessary to even start using a test to approach the math, but that familiarity was only accessible with practice.",
    "I really learned how to find simpler ways to get through math problems, and look at math at another and deeper angle.",
    "Logical thinking and most importantly Ive learnt how to make use of math tutors",
    "The most valuable lessons I've learned would have to be how to evaluate complex functions as series (to some precise value), integrate polar functions, and integrate tig functions. I had no idea how to do any of them before and I can readily see myself applying these to my future career as an electrical engineer. I learned a myriad of other tools, but these are what will most stick with me. Especially given the depth at which they were taught."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Second half of the semester was definitely harder for everyone on average, maybe spend an extra class or two on some material and emit some stuff from the first half\/teach it quicker.",
    "Overall strength, goes fairly into depth in each topic",
    "I believe lots of time was spent on beginning material which forced more complicated material to be rushed.",
    "If you have taken AP Calc AB or BC, you should be fine. But without this background knowledge itll be very hard to keep up and follow through with the class because its a new and different lesson everyday.",
    "Strengths: manageable assignments and professor\/help is accessible Weaknesses: unclear\/vague information as to what needs to be done to prepare for each class (ie. whether reading needs to be done prior to the Explore quizzes\"",
    "The course had good pacing. However, I felt the quality of the course was below the other courses I took this semester.",
    "Strengths: My professor was amazing and was super helpful during office hours. Peer tutors and review sessions are also helpful. Weaknesses: some professors are clearly better than others",
    "The fundamental flaw of starting Math at a new school (regardless of level) is that among students and professors there are different expectations of what has been learned prior to taking a given class. There is of course a minimum understanding on the material learned in the class preceding the current level but anything learned prior to that is difficult to nail down. My trouble came not from not understanding Calculus AB but from math prior to that. For example, it was new for me to understand that, X^(2)*X^(2n) = X^(2n+2) or that ln(a\/b) = -ln(b\/a). Such simple rules had been neglected in my prior learnings and proved to be a challenge for me to move forward in this class given that sometimes problems hinged on such knowledge. As a result, a lot of time which I spent trying to solve problems was wasted on old concepts rather than taking time to understand the new concepts. I see no practical solution to this but it is a problem to be mindful of nonetheless. This course had little to no emphasis on review in class which isn't necessarily bad it's just new to me and I wish I was made aware of this much earlier on. Also, being made aware of how specific examples in class would be referred to on exams would've been nice.",
    "The main strengths of this course are that it was well organized, and the textbook matched up almost directly with the lectures, making content easy to read in advance and follow the material. However, as a weakness, the class provides limited opportunities for students to show their level of understanding if a student does not test well under timed circumstances. Although problem sets and weekly quizzes give a few opportunities, the two midterms largely determine the final grade, providing great stress for students who score well on problem sets but score poorly on timed tests. Also the peer tutor system was a weakness as well. Specifically, for the first five weeks of the semester, I would go to Angela's office hours to ask questions confirming my understanding of the material and to check my work for the problem sets. However, Angela misguided me in the problem sets because the very questions I thought were correct by Angela's guidance were marked incorrect in the grading process of problem sets. This misinformation muddied by understanding of the course material and impacted my performance in the beginning of the course. I felt misguided that Angela would tell me that my answers were correct when in fact, they were not correct. Once I realized I was being misguided, I stopped attending Angela's office hours. Once I eventually stopped seeking help from Angela, I found that others such as Abby were extremely helpful in engaging with Math 115 students. So, this is not to say that all of the peer tutors were unhelpful but more to say that my experience with certain peer tutors marks a portion of this course's weaknesses.",
    "I think the review sessions could be improved. I understand that each teacher has their own method of teaching, but I think the most successful sessions were the ones where the instructor came in with practice problems that they had the student complete and then review as a group. Also something I greatly enjoyed from professor was a summation and connection of all the material at the end that solidified how everything was connected in terms of what we learned. If that connection could be highlighted at the beginning of the course, I think I would have had an easier time understanding how everything (in terms of the material) was connected to the bigger overall picture of math.",
    "I thought the way the course was set up was very good for me in terms of being able to learn, and each midterm\/final was challenging in their own way which helped me grow more as I thought about the math processes for each test.",
    "Strength: teachers are happy to answer our questions Weakness: class time seems not efficient enough",
    "Strengths are the explorations, and the method of teaching. Avoiding words and proofs in favor of practice problems is incredibly helpful. I also did not really need to read from the textbook, which is great because I struggle to stay focused in that setting. The no-reliance on the textbook style of teaching was very helpful. I feel one way things can be improved would be to have more practice problems. I know that there isn't much time in class, so if the collective 115 class held an optional meeting wherein people went over homework or did some packet based practice problems, I feel understanding would greatly improve and people could go over questions they have from class. Office hours are good, but working in groups or collective office hours would draw greater incentive to visit."

    "If its a requirement, yes",
    "Useful requirement",
    "Yes it was straight forward and the professor was very accessible.",
    "If you are just looking for a credit and do not need this for your major or to be pre-med and you want to continue in math, maybe just take Math 112",
    "Yes. This course was great and definitely manageable.",
    "NO, unless you have to take this course for your major avoid it at all costs",
    "I would not recommend the course if the student did not require it for their major.",
    "If needed for your major, yes. I wouldnt take this for fun.",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student who plans on pursuing a field which requires this level of math. I'd advise against someone looking just to fulfill the credit requirement to take this only because the math here is getting much more niche and more difficult.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, primarily because the professor I had was engaging and receptive to meeting with students and being available to answer all questions to facilitate learning. The professor, Tom Vandenboom, rather than the course work itself, is the main reason why I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes, if the student had a solid calculus introduction and felt confident in their abilities then I think this course is a fair continuation of that introduction.",
    "yes, this course and especially the staff teaching this course was very good and beneficial for learning this material. They focused on the student alot, and make sure you really understand the material in class before being set to try it on your own.",
    "Yes if you wanna take Econ and fulfill ur QR requirement",
    "Yes I would. I would avoid some teachers I think, but I personally enjoyed my own teacher and would recommend the subject matter to anyone interested in applying calculus in their career work."
