   "comments": [
    "Yes. An incredible opportunity to learn from a great scholar who is deeply committed to teaching. Don't feel like you need to have a strong background in poetry to take this class; some people certainly did, but Professor Bloom walks the class through the poems in a way that is accessible and fascinating to students with any level of literary knowledge.",
    "Absolutely. Getting to know Bloom is wonderful; he's a mensch, a genius, and an inspiring teacher. Wallace Stevens is pretty amazing, too. Hart Crane isn't my favorite, but Bloom makes him great.",
    "You should absolutely take this course if you have a chance. Professor Bloom has spent decades thinking about the relationships between Whitman, Dickinson, Melville, Stevens, and Crane, and you will be grateful for the opportunity to peek in.",
    "Yes, do it.",
    "The course is an intensive reading of Wallace Stevens and Hart Crane. Each week you deeply read and deeply discuss the poetry. It was one of the best experiences I've of my life, and among the most difficult, challenging, and rewarding literary experiences of my life."
