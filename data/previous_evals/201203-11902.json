    "Unless you're planning on majoring in linguistics, I wouldn't necessarily take this. I took it to apply to the psych major but it was a lot more work than I was planning on. If you're willing to dedicate a good amount of time each week to the readings and whatnot, then go ahead. But otherwise, it's kind of a lot.",
    "LING 220 is a good introduction to phonetics. Definitely take it if you are serious about linguistics or cognitive science of language. The workload can be high but it is worth it for the improvement in your knowledge of how speech works. Probably don't take it if you are just curious about linguistics\/phonology, or if you need an SO.For ling majors, I would recommend taking 220 before or as a complement to LING 232 (intro phonology) - I took it after a full year of phonology and found that a lot of the material was repetitious. I would also STRONGLY recommend taking the class credit\/d, especially if Jelena is teaching it. She is a good lecturer and has created a good syllabus for the class, but moves fast in lecture and grades VERY hard.",
    "One of the best linguistics courses I have taken at Yale (and as a senior linguistics major I've taken a bunch). Up until this point, my study of linguistics had been confined to the syntax\/semantics\/pragmatics realm; I really hadn't done anything related to sound. I am so glad I took phonetics. The breadth and depth of information covered in this class is astounding. Its kind of a whirlwind, there is so much information, but it is worth it. The problem sets are challenging but not impossible, and are very helpful.Professor Krivokapic is so brilliant and knowledgeable (a little intimidating). The project (complete phonetic description of a language you don't know) is hard but I thought it was a great exercise and I learned a lot from it. I only wish Professor Krivokapic would be willing to post her lecture slides. She talks so fast, its hard to get everything down, and not being able to look back over the slides seems a little unnecessarily harsh. She's also a bit of a harsh grader on exams, and the class itself is pretty hard, but its totally worth it.",
    "I would recommend the class, but also caution that it is a lot of work. The class has two 75 minute lectures and a required weekly section. It also has a lot of required reading. And in addition to learning the concepts of phonetics, you must learn to produce and recognize a great number of speech sounds. Still the class is very interesting and very well taught.",
    "I would recommend General Phonetics to fellow linguistics students with the caveat that this course is very time consuming. Readings, homeworks, transcription\/production practice, and the final project often seemed to overtake a general understanding of course concepts. The class was informative and Prof. Krivokapic was a compelling lecturer that often presented interesting connections to current research. In sum, General Phonetics was a high-workload but worthwhile course."
