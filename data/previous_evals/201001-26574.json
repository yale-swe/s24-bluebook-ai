    "Absolutely. A must have to correspond with BP.",
    "I think it did. It's great to be experiencing such a class so early on as well.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes.",
    "yes",
    "Excellent subject matter and projects, could even be taught earlier in the year (fall semester) or be integrated more into the Vis I and II sequences.",
    "In light of Visualization 1 and 2, this course is in the right place. However, due to the fact that this course requires physically making a lot of objects, which obviously requires more time and machine capacity, it ran into major conflict with studio and other courses. In the future, perhaps some of Visualization 3 could be merged into 2, so that Viz 2 is less 2D, and we would have more time and energy to produce less amount of but more solid work for Viz 3.",
    "Yes",
    "Would be great if this course occurred in the first semester - it would be a wonderful way to get to know the shop right from the beginning, and to start thinking about construction logics in conjunction with first semester studio.",
    "It should occur before Vizualization II (which I wasn't sure was so helpful as a class in general). It got us familiar with the shop machines and all different sorts of fabrication techniques that would have been great to know for the kind of work we were doing in first semester studio. This class should be offered right away.",
    "seemed appropriate. appreciated that we were finally taught how to do things instead of asked to figure them out on our own.",
    "This course was presented in the proper sequence, and it was an excellent opportunity to both build upon the themes of last fall\u0092s visualization course and introduce us to digital fabrication equipment.",
    "The course occurred in the proper sequence.",
    "This program could occur earlier as the nature of building things is critical to the work done in the school. With a focus on the fabrication equipment of this school, this area is not focused on nearly strong enough.",
    "Yes, this placement of this class was very appropriate within the school's curriculum.",
    "I believe that this semester is a good time to learn about fabrication. Since we were getting into great detail with our building project proposals,it was good to learn about materials and fabrication techniques.",
    "I liked learning fabrication techniques this semester, because I probably would not have had the chance to pick them up on my own. I think the course was well-timed in that sense.",
    "This course was offered at a good time within the course sequence.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes.",
    "Should be incorporated into studio.",

   "question_text": "Comment on the body of material presented and the content of the course: sequence, syllabus, and assignments.",
   "comments": [
    "The sequence made perfect sense. The assignments were challenging, fun and rewarding.",
    "Material was great - very appropriate - but there are still many kinks to be worked out as I'm sure the instructors are aware of.The workload at the start of the semester was in short - surreal.It was as though we had two studios to work for in tandem, which eventually resulted in many of the students 'burning out' and finding it difficult to keep up.That said I don't think the content should change, I just think that the timing of each assignment should be coordinated with studio\/other classes a little better.",
    "Good",
    "The assignments were good; the last assignment when we had several weeks was great because we had a chance to have desk crtis duing the design process. The extreme focus on production techniques was o.k., but not in lieu of lessons in design. Often it seemed like a competition to use as many computer programs and machines as possible without considering the design.",
    "An incredibly useful introduction to the techniques of fabricating architecture. Many of the most interesting and beautiful projects made by the first year students this year came out of this class.",
    "Really enjoyed learning the digital fabrication equipment",
    "The assignment deadlines were conflicting with numerous other courses frequently. I also think that the projects, with exception to the last one, were too open ended. It was difficult to gain traction in a project with no real design constraints.",
    "assignments were appropriate, just too many of them. i would have liked more time to reflect and design the projects rather than only focus on pure production.",
    "There was far too much work for a 3 credit course. Doing full scale projects AND drawings every week is a studio 6 credit load. The quality of the work suffered severely in this class and studio because of the unrealistic assignments (this being 1 class of 7!)",
    "The assignments for this course were uniformly excellent, and built logically from one to the next, increasing in complexity. I appreciated the reliance on partner projects, as it allowed us to confront fabrication issues together. Unfortunately, many of the assignments were too short to complete adequately, especially given the semester\u0092s overall workload. Ben and John were very receptive to this issue, however, and their willingness to stretch outassignments over several weeks was very helpful.",
    "The content of material was great. It was good to have assignments that taught us how to use the machines and modeling tools of the school. However, there were too many assignments at the beginning half of the class. The instructors need to realize the limitations of the students in terms of time and availability of machines. It is ridiculous to ask 50 students to complete an intensive assignment within a week when there are 4 machines that will do the needed task.There should be an equal balance of assignments and desk crits. Having 4 week-long assignments in a row is too much and takes away too much time from studio.",
    "Due to the fabrication element of this course, it ended up taking away a lot of time that would have been otherwise devoted to studio. I know that there was some attempt at coordination with other classes, but it did not go far enough. Although I enjoyed fabrication, it seemed like it was too much when combined with our other classes this semester.",
    "assignments are a bit strong for the time frame presented, at least in terms of the building project semester. Their sequence is on target and the syllabus was accurate to the flow of the course.",
    "The assignments where very well thought out and built on one another over the course of the semester. The workshops and tutorials were also spaced appropriately and were apropos to the given assignments. I would have liked to see a little more emphasis on Grasshopper instead of Revit. The former is more applicable to school projects while the latter is just too complicated and hard to productively implement in any worthwhile capacity.I also appreciated the attempt to tie in this class with studio\/building project. While this did not work with most project, I think this could be very productive. It just requires a little more tweaking of the schedule and some better coordination between the classes.",
    "It was incredibly untimely to have three weekly assignments when we were having three weekly assignments for studio. The fact that all assignments require fabrication machinery makes it ridiculous that all assignments were given to all students such that the sheer number of people trying to get on machines makes it impossible not only for us to do our job well but for others to get on the machine. Also, the fact that the class met on Wednesdays greatly impacted our ability to produce for this class as well as as studio.",
    "As has been mentioned before throughout the semester, the workload for this course was MUCH greater than Ben and John anticipated, and it was extremely difficult for all members of the class to work with the same machine or technique in a one or two week span, never mind that we completely monopolized the resources for the rest of the school. Therefore the syllabus as originally planned was unrealistic.",
    "The assignents in no way reflected the reasonable time requirements of 1\/6 of the semester courseload. This course was on par with studio in how much energy and experimentation it required.",
    "This is a really great class and my only real complaint with it was that we just did not have enough time to do it justice. Our schedules this past semester were RIDICULOUS and, inevitably, I found myself scrambling to finish up assignments at the last minute. I realize that this is endemic of architecture school in general, but I was really sad that I couldn't devote as much time to this course as I'd have liked to. I think it's a very valuable class in terms of familiarizing students with the fabrication facilities at school, and also in terms of general design skills and furthering the work we did during the fall semester.",
    "The assignments could have benefited from having more specific guidelines as to what the goal with them was.",
    "Even thought all the assignments were very valuable, I thought that the overall organization of the course was quite poor. The final reviews many times collided with our studio pin-ups or reviews, which greatly affected the quality of the student work. Also, I found the tutorials to be less valuable than I thought they would be. Perhaps it was the size of the class that prevented a more one-on-one interaction with the teaching assistants \/ instructors during the tutorial sessions.",
    "The course provides a very good introduction to the school's fabrication labs.",
    "good"

    "Didn't know what I was in for. But I can honestly say that this is by far the greatest class I have ever taken. I have never had so much fun and learned so much in a class.",
    "I expected to learn about fabrications methods and be able to apply them - and I think that I was able to do that in the end.",
    "I expected to gain exposure to technologies and more importantly, ways of assembling components. The first was certainly met, but again, the extreme focus on technology often shadowed the design and thought processes of fabrication.",

    "This was great.",
    "This course was the best Viz course we have had. It was great because the assignments were given and then we were free to work. There were too many assignments in general, but each one introduced us to a new machine, which was helpful.",
    "I expected a course focused on fabrication and assembly and that is exactly what it was.",
    "My expectations were to become more familiar with different software packages and the school's fabrication facilities. Beyond accomplishing this, I also created some very interesting objects\/ideas, that I hope to continue to develop over the next couple of years.",
    "This class was exactly what I expected. Despite the scheduling problems, the projects were exciting, and they served the purpose of familiarizing us with fabrication methods.",
    "I didn\u0092t know what to expect, since this was a new course. As soon as I read the syllabus, however, I knew it would be extremely time-consuming, which it was.",

    "The single greatest class I have ever taken,by far! I learned so much about fabrication whether it was new technology (laser cutter, CNC mill, etc.) as well as when it is better to go Old School and do it by hand. Please, for the sake of all those architecture students who follow me, don't change a thing. If I knew about this class and what it was going to be like I never would have considered going to another school. John and Ben, I know you two changed up the class a bit for our year and all I can say is that you nailed it on the head. Thank you so much for this class. You both are amazing professors and perfect for this class. I really can't put into words how much this class has meant to me. I also can't express my gratitude for everything you guys have done with this class. Absolutely amazing. Thank you both so much.",
    "I think that this course was very valuable and would be even more valuable had their been less conflicts with the assignments at the start of the semester.",
    "very valuable",
    "Medium. I think given enough studio time I would gain the same amont of exposure to the shop tools and programs without this course.",
    "I feel this course is of very high value, scheduling needs to be better",
    "This course is a move in the right direction because it begins to open us up to new software and technology, and methods of fabrication. I learned a lot from this class, but could have learned even more, had it been slightly more organized.I did not gain as much as I felt I should have from the weekly tutorials because it was easy to fall out of step with the exercises and not be able to catch up. Some of the information felt glossed over, but I appreciate that the information from these sessions was made available on the server for future reference.The expectations of the instructors for the student fabrication was simply not realistic, and I think this was acknowledged by some modification in the schedule during the course. Although it may have seemed that there was sufficient time given to the students to produce, there needs to be greater consideration given to work load and deadlines from other classes, equipment availability, and the actual time needed to fabricate (including running into problems).",
    "Very very valuable.",
    "the first half of the course i didn't produce any work that i was in any way invested in, and therefore i feel like i missed an opportunity to really explore issues of designing full-scale objects. the focus should be much more on the concepts behind the design and how those are executed than solely on whether or not we managed to produce the thing.",
    "This course allowed me to explore many techniques which I had not used before, including casting, milling, and using the shop in general. It was also valuable to work on drawings related to these techniques, exploring how drawings can illustrate construction processes, techniques, etc. At times, however, it felt like the design work for the course was somewhat arbitrary, as there was no real jumping off point in many of the assignment prompts. Design decisions often became about arbitrary form-making, which was not always the most helpful approach.",
    "Very valuable. We will be able to apply these skills to models for the rest of our time at Yale. Valuable more for the skills gained than design intent, but valuable nonetheless.",
    "I think the courses value lay in the fact that we were encouraged to use many different types of fabrication techniques, not just ones that we were already comfortable with. I think that the understanding of these different techniques and processes will serve my well going forward.",
    "high value as these are tools for creation of further work, whether it be at school or in the future field work.",
    "This class gave me much more confidence in my abilities to have an idea and then translate it into some presentable realization, whether digital or, better yet, physical.",
    "Great way to gain working experience and to familiarize students with the fabrication equipment",
    "I enjoyed this course quite a lot. I expected an introduction to fabrication tools and methods, and I was able to explore these methods through the projects given.",
    "Even though this course sometimes felt like the bane of my existence for how much work it took, I really appreciated learning fabrication techniques and some new software this semester. I wish that I had had more time to spend on it.",
    "It was wonderful to have a course geared towards experimenting with digital technology. This class helped the first year class become comfotable with the CNC machines in the fablab and overcome any reservations for employing this technology to fabricate projects in the semesters to come.",
    "Very valuable! I learned quite a bit about representation and enjoyed all of the assignments.",
    "It was good to be forced to expose ourselves to the digital fabrication techniques available to us.",
    "In terms oflearning about material properties, how to use the shop equipment, or various techniques for material manipulation, I found this class to be very valuable."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely amazing. John and Ben are perfect for this course. They are knowledgeable, encouraging, and fun. The class was perfect and part of that was because of John and Ben as instructors for this course. The TAs were all really eager to help. They are a great resource to have for this course.",
    "TA's were helpful when around or giving us demos and presentations - in particular during the first half of the semester.Instructors were very engaging and taught the course matter well - encouraging exploration, giving well informed presentations regarding the assignments and very valuable in-progress critiques.",
    "The instructors knew very little about the subject matter beyond a basic elementary grasp onthe concepts and were very hands off in terms of the technical side of things. TAs gave tutorials, but again, presented very elementary information and often were not able to help or were available when it came down to the execution of projects.",
    "The assignments were very well constructed, and allowed the students to gain valuable experience with various equipment and techniques while completing them.Most of the learning took place outside of class, while attempting to complete the assignments.",
    "The TAs are really valuable to this course. We have a big class, so the shop demonstration wasn't as effective as they should have been. The class of 2013 is going to be bigger. They should seriously consider dividing shop demos into groups of no more than 10 so everyone gets a chance to learn how to operate the equipments.",
    "TA's were great.",
    "The TAs were willing to help whenever we needed them.",
    "ta's were fantastic. especially Julie. they were very generous with their time and extremely helpful.",
    "Both Ben and John were effective instructors. The assignments and expectations were always clear and well-thought out, which was a large improvement over last semester\u0092s visualization course. Their feedback on our work was for the most part helpful, especially during the desk crit sessions, which there should have been more of.",
    "Ben and John were good instructors. They had good ideas and always pushed a theory further. However, they don\u0092t always understand the limitations of a material or a machine, and definitely don\u0092t understand the limitations of time. There were too many assignments, each of which took too long. Everyone enjoyed the assignments so if they were spaced out a bit more it would be helpful.The only thing that was slightly off-putting is the monetary requirement for this class. When using machines that mill wood and cut metal, it requires that you buy those materials and often buy quite a bit of them. For a student who is already struggling with finances, this can be harmful. Projects can always be pushed farther, have more stuff added to it, or have been made from another, more expensive material, but these are not always helpful suggestions to a student on a budget\u0097especially a student that has worked very hard to produce a project that completes the assignment already. In a fabrication class such as this, the instructors should be able to give suggestions on how to improve a project without simply proposing the addition of an expensive material. Ben and John should really try to work within the student\u0092s budgets and should be aware of those restraints and be able to push a project further within those limits.",
    "I thought that the instructors were effective, but the class depended much more on taking your own initiative.",
    "The duo was a bit strange, but nice since students had a route to either the technical or the aesthetic directly as a critic rather than as a methodology.",
    "Both Ben and John are extremely knowledgeable on these subjects and were always open to exploration and taking chances even if there was the possibility of failure, so long as it was productive failure.All of the TA, were also very helpful in the labs and during crits. They provided a good, unfiltered transmission of knowledge to students.",
    "The TAs were helpful and necessary to the process. Their expertise in the various methods of fabrication, in some ways, was way more helpful than the actual instructors of the course. They have been incredibly helpful in solving machinery malfunctions and fabrication issues at any point in the night.",
    "Ben and John were good teachers and definitely encouraged exploration. I got the sense from them that it was more important to learn a technique and explore an idea than to make something specific, which I appreciated.",
    "Ben's enthusiasm was invaluable in carrying our class through the ups and downs of the semester. John's contributions were more administrative than pedagodical.",
    "It generally seemed that John was a bit more engaged in the course than Ben. He was more available and I, personally, found his comments and feedback quite valuable. He also gives really great software tutorials, which may seem like a small matter but for those of us who are new to this stuff it's really important.",
    "The TAs were all very available and ready to help - thoroughly enjoyable.",
    "As I mentioned previously, the tutorial sessions were not very effective. I think it was the size of the groups (approximately 22 students) with various knowledge of the software, which made it difficult to follow and apply the information to our own projects. Also, due to the large quantity and the material nature of each project, every assignment turned into a struggle to gain equipment access and it was very difficult to coordinate and plan in advance.",
    "The TAs did nothing."

    "Your kidding right? No. Keep it just the way it is.",
    "1. Timing with studio.2. Thinking about how many people are in the class vs. fabrication machines - maybe switching up the assignments for the two halves of the class. So that in one week not everyone has to jump on the mills at once or cast at once - which will make things more manageable and wont put a lot of strain on the students or machines which the remaining students need to use.",
    "Coordinate better with other classes!",
    "More emphasis on design and less on technology lessons.",
    "Better coordination of course materials and due dates with studio work would be great. On some projects, fabrication time is more than anticipated. This was generally not factored into the schedule. I do appreciate the instructors adjusting the schedule multiple times to meet realistic fabrication demands. However, not enough time is usually allowed for exploration or mistakes, which makes the process less productive. Some long and more intense projects could do better than many small, short ones.",
    "Get instructors who know what they are doing.",
    "Focusing on particular fabrication techniques (laser cutting, milling, casting, etc.) was a very useful way to structure the course, and should be continued into the later stages of the semester.The critical connection project and final prosthetic project could have benefited from the professors specifying at least one particular fabrication technique for each student or group of students to employ.",
    "The shop MUST BE more accommodating than it is now to receive Visualization 3. We are students and under a lot of pressure, we make mistakes. When mistakes happen, the shop monitors and coordinators must be able to FIRST COMMUNICATE with the class as a whole, BEFORE CHARGING us anything. If we made a mess, we would rather take the responsibility and clean it up than being charged. This is a very serious issue. Charging without warning is unfair, and definitely isn't going to help us learn.",
    "Coordinate with studio better. Perhaps one less project or give adequate time\/weeks to fabricate.",
    "Given that shop resources are relatively limited, there could potentially be better coordination between this course and other studios.",
    "This course is a necessary one for the fact that it exposes 1st years to the body of equipment we have. However, the fact that in many ways, work type, load, time...it is much more a studio course than viz class. As such, it is a problematic in its scheduling against studio. Is there a way to have this class, but structured less like 3 projects and more disparate?",
    "Less open-ended projects.",
    "The assignments for this course were excellent but extremely time consuming, especially because they often involved become familiar with equipment and techniques that were new to us. They should be revised to be in accordance with the time necessary to complete them, especially in the context of the overall schedule, design studio work, etc. It would be helpful if there was at least one desk crit session per assignment, as these allowed us to consider our work more carefully and makerevisions, thus allowing for a more natural and developed design process to be established for each assignment. Additionally, the critical connection assignment should be reconsidered in its relation to the design studio. There was no concern for how the detail actually related to our studio projects, and I was pushed to change it for the sake of making it more interesting. It might be better to base this assignment on a past studio project or none at all in order to make it fit better with the assignment\u0092s aims.",
    "This class was successful and helpful not because of the theory or design that we learned, but more because of the skills we acquired through it. It was trying too hard to be a design studio in itself, which is not what it needs to do. This course should be seen more of a technical course, with a small amount of design added to it. It should be more integral to studio and our studio projects, thus making the studio design the main design element within the course.By trying to be a design course within itself, Viz III ended up taking away valuable time for studio as well as harming itself since we did not have adequate time to complete the projects. If it was more incorporated into studio\u0097truly incorporated, not just on the surface the way it was this semester\u0097it would benefit both classes, rather than take away from both. Deadlines HAVE to be coordinated better! This is absolutely a must for a class as intense as this. Ben and John need to realize that this is not Studio and should not require as much work as Studio. They need to be willing to accept this and need to be able to change their expectations from studio critics to fabrication professors.Ben and John also need to coordinate their class better with the Shop guys. There were many times this semester where the Shop did not know 50 of us were about to descend to use the 3 working mills in the course of 5 days, or didn\u0092t know all 50 of us would be casting the night before a deadline. This just boils down to poor communication within the school. Many times our class was caught in the middle of a larger power struggle between the Shop and Ben\/John. It was not a good position to be in and resulted in our class being penalized for things beyond our control. The Shop needs toknow of our projects in advance, needs to be aware of our deadlines and needs to know what materials we will need and what machines we are using. Not having this coordination is unacceptable and childish. It hurts the students and hurts the quality of the work.",
    "I think the only thing that could be done to improve the course would be to lighten the load a little bit. At times I was not able to spend as much time as I would have wanted to complete a project, and the project was hurt by it.",
    "Trying to improve coordination with studio and building project would be nice. I know that this was attempted, but I think this is just one of those perpetual issues that take a few years to resolve (if ever).",
    "I suggest a complete reevaluation of the scheduling, which I believe is the largest problem. More coordination with studio projects is necessary. It would also have been good to have staggered shifts on projects such that people are using different fabrication machinery at different times.",
    "If the assignments could be spaced out more, there may be more chance for students to actually complete everything without ruining the shop and not sleeping. I would also recommend staggering the techniques for different parts of the class so that not everyone is doing the same thing every week. Perhaps there could be four sections that rotate through four fabrication techniques one at a time, or with one section working on rendering. Or maybe class time could be partially devoted to starting work on a project.",
    "Make the schedule work better!",
    "Coordinate with studio and other required courses for when major assignments are due - this semester there were several major collisions of deadlines.",
    "Perhaps it would be more helpful to divide students into two groups and alternate the assignments among these two groups, so it is easier to plan ahead and schedule equipment. For example, if one half of the class is working on the casting assignment one week, the other half of the class could be working on the \u0093detail\u0094 assignment and then they would switch. So there is not an extreme demand of only one kind of equipment (the mill for example) among all the students. Also, the tutorial groups could be broken up into smaller sections (10 to 12 students) in order to increase their effectiveness.",
    "The workload this semester was way too high. The instructors should not treat this course as a second design studio.",
    "I greatly enjoyed this course. I appreciate the flexibility which Ben and John allowed to accommodate our schedules. The 'exploratory' nature of the work was very beneficial, and I would welcome any changes which expand upon that. I did not think the 'full scale detail' project was very useful, but the class allowed for alternative projects, which was great. The only change I would make is to eliminate the drawing component, or at least only require it when necessary."
