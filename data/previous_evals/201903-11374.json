   "comments": [
    "I gained a really in-depth understanding of how ideas of pitch and time build into scales, keys, chord progressions and ultimately, musical pieces and genres. I feel like I can explain really fundamental ideas about music theory to others, and have built a strong sense of music theory that I can take to other musical settings.",
    "I learned how to better understand harmonic progression and melody, and learned to identify seventh chords, structure in both classical music and pop music. The class also focused on European common practice, which helped me better understand the classical music I play today. I developed skills in composing through compositional assignments. One unique aspect of this class was the soundscapes project, in which I observed sound in such a way I normally wouldn't. I observed the sonic entities of my surroundings that I normally would not give consideration to, and this was certainly one of the most profound projects of the class.",
    "Even though I've been studying music for years, I actually got a lot out of this course! Will realized that our whole class was basically a cappella kids\/pianists so he adjusted the pace accordingly. As a result, I learned a lot about the different types of 7th chords and how they can be thrown into pop music. I also learned more about chords progressions and practiced (literally) notating short excerpts that I heard.",
    "The basics of music theory: reading music, harmonization, score analysis, listening analysis, Roman numerals, composition. Also, in 3 classes dedicated to \"special topics,\" we learned about film scoring, medieval love songs, and jazz harmonies.",
    "I learned how to read music, scales, key signatures, evaluate harmonies, etc",
    "I developed great skills of music theory and composition, harmony and listening skills, and a richer appreciation for various music traditions.",
    "I feel as though I grew tremendously as a musician and was given a vast vocabulary to describe what I could not before. I can now discuss music theory freely, understand how songs work structurally, and start composing music of my own.",
    "I learned about rhythm, notes, chords, harmony, progressions, etc.",
    "This course helped me develop some basic Music Theory skills in order to view music through a new perspective. It gave me a lot of insight into basic knowledge regarding the theory of music. This knowledge was applicable to the analysis as well as creation of music. We practiced both of these skills extensively so that now even out of class I take pleasure in engaging with these skills.",
    "Before this course I had no knowledge of music theory at all. Now I know plenty of music theory that I never thought I would know."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There are many strengths of this course. Education was very in-depth, we received a lot of opportunities to practice through assignments and projects. Projects were designed really well to apply concepts and ideas while also encouraging our own creativity. Will explains concepts very clearly and also is happy to answer any and all questions, and also meet with students to help them with work. The only weakness of this course might be that it was a bit too challenging for an introductory class. The assignments might have been a little bit too long, and the quizzes\/tests might have been too long\/intense for the time period we were given to complete them. I also think listening examples were a bit too difficult to figure out. Had the difficulty been adjusted a bit, this course would have been a fair bit more accessible and conducive to success for students. In general, I do not entirely think this was a choice or fault of the instructor. I think this is a larger issue that the Music Department at Yale employs in its pedagogy. The gap between introductory and higher-level music theory classes is incredibly intense. The \"placement\" test that is offered for students at the beginning of the semester dictates that, if you know what maybe two or three notes are, that you should go to MUSI 210, which makes you identify inverted roman numeral chords off the top of your head in the first week. A gap like that leaves students who have some sense of what is going on, but not enough, stuck. If there were a full or half-credit course offered to basically teach the more difficult parts of MUSI 110, I think that would greatly benefit students and help them figure out where they fit educationally. Right now, MUSI 110 is crammed with so much material that it makes the course unnecessarily difficult as an intro.",
    "The class is certainly predisposed to people who have a background in music, of any kind, despite it being a \"intro\" class. Nonetheless, i thought the class was still very accessible to everyone who took it. It required a lot of practice outside of the classroom, but the professor was very accommodating and very willing to meet with students outside of class. The class involved a lot of singing which I found a great activity in improving understanding of music. The hardest aspect of the class was likely the exams and quizzes, as I felt often times that there were too many questions on assessments for students to reasonably finish in a timely manner. Overall, however, I felt this was a great course for people seeking a fundamental understanding of music theory.",
    "Because of Will, the pacing for this class was perfect. It covered a wide variety of topics such as rhythm, harmony, structure. No weaknesses IMO",
    "The course was thorough and rigorous. It's difficult to design a course for students with musical experience ranging from none whatsoever to just under what's required for MUSI 210, but Professor Watson managed to do so. The course contained many hands-on activities and a nice diversity of assignments. No weaknesses that I can think of.",
    "Strengths: great homework assignments that were clear and targeted concepts, fair quizzes and exams, and instruction that catered to our particular interests as a class. Weaknesses: sometimes not enough time in class to review before assessments.",
    "I feel as though this course did a very good job of understanding concepts especially through the visualization of sheet music. I feel as though assignments could have involved more aural elements.",
    "strengths: I learned a lot more than i had expected, and I got to do a lot of things I couldn't have imagined myself doing before this course (like writing a song) weaknesses: I could understand the course materials fine, but certain skills need time to develop and as someone who had no musical background coming into this class, I simply could not fully develop those skills in a semester's time (like identifying things by ear). Those skills, however, were also tested on quizzes and exams and I did poorly on those because usually I would run out of time because I was not familiar with them enough.",
    "The weakness of such a course is that there is a lot of ambiguity in the field regarding what is considered \"basic\" music theory. Choosing to concentrate on some material rather than other leaves things out to be learned. However, this shortcoming is solved in the long run as the student continues in higher level courses and learns what is missing. That being said, what is taught is already very helpful in understanding music theory. Having known essentially no theory prior to this class I already understand music on a different level and I think this is a huge strength of this class. You quickly understand music differently at an exponential rate.",
    "Well, as someone who just started music theory, this course was pretty challenging. Not having enough time for tests and exams was my biggest issue. I just learned the material, so I was not able to swiftly do the material. This course was supposed to be an introduction, but after a few weeks, it was starting to get a tiny bit out of hand for me. I feel like there should even be a class before this intro class because you need to know some things before you take the class to be able to keep up."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. I thoroughly enjoyed being taught by Will and will look back on this class fondly, and really enjoyed the ways it challenged me intellectually. I think this is a great class for any student at Yale to take.",
    "As long as they have some exposure to music of any kind, and have a basic ability to read music, I would definitely recommend this class to another students. The class was comprised of students in all years, and certainly was very engaging.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any Yale student (musician or not) that wants to gain a better understanding for music theory. I would urge students on the fence between 110 and 210 to at least shop the first 2 days of this course.",
    "Yes I would. This course taught not only music theory but also music appreciation and even some music history. It is essential for anyone who loves listening to and engaging with music - not just those who want to make music.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in music, take this course!",
    "I would highly recommend this course! If you feel as though you want to become a better musician, either for composing, performing, and simply being able to hold conversations about music, this course is extremely helpful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student interested in understanding the basics of music theory. I would recommend this course if a student's interests ranged from simply wanting to appreciate music more or wanting to learn the skills to create basic music through a theoretical approach. Anybody curious to understand music through an analytical perspective would surely benefit from this class."
