   "comments": [
    "Yup! Lots of people take itjus because they like econ.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class if you don't have to take it. The problem sets take a REALLY long time to do (they're unnecessarily hard at the beginning of the semester but get a little easier as the semester progresses) and it's just not a particularly interesting class.",
    "Yes! Yes! Great for an econ major, and even good for a non-econ major.",
    "Bergemann is an often entertaining professor, and he covers the material in class with a good degree of clarity. He considers students' questions carefully and sincerely, and will do his best to help you understand the material. The problem sets featured complicated questions that often didn't follow directly from the material at hand, but a good TA was instrumental in clarifyingthe work. Luckily, the midterm was far more straightforward than the psets would have suggested. But what does it matter? You're taking this class because it's required for your major, aren't you?",
    "It's a good class and probably the least painful way to get through intermediate micro. Dirk is a really interesting and engaging professor.",
    "A necessary course for the econ major. Nothing too exciting. Teaches some good basic skills, and is good if you're interested in economics after taking Intro Micro. Most will take it to fill the requirement, but if you're ambitious about expanding your intellectual horizons, by all means give it a shot (but make sure you get a good professor and section leader)",
    "Only take this class if you're interested in the major!",
    "Challenging material, but the class moved at a slow pace. You will get a deeper understanding of math behind microeconomics. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on the problem sets.",
    "It's hard for me to comment because I'm not really an econ person and still don't really understand the point of intermediate. to me, the subject material is exactly intro but with harder math...so why bother? If it's for your major or something you're going to take it. If you are one of the few doing this for a QR or something that is a dumb idea.Prof Bergemann is pretty great, he tries to keep the class interesting and his personality shows through in lectures. it was unclear to me that we really got through everything we were supposed to, sometimes things were rather rushed at the end of lecture. but as far as trying to make the class relevant, including activities, etc. he was pretty goodIf you aren't really good at math, you should not take this course. If you already know the subject, dont' be one of the jerks who took the class anyway",
    "I would recommend it. I loved the professor and thought it was a very interesting class. The problem sets are very challenging and time consuming but other than that it was an awesome class.",
    "Great class if you like economics and don't hate math. There is a decent amount of math focused on optimization problems. All of what you learn seems broadly applicable. The supplementary material is also very enjoyable.I recommend this class, especially to econ majors (who need to take it). Take it with Bergemann, he's really funny, doesn't give excessive work, and is a pretty solid teacher.",
    "This was a more mathematical rehashing of most of what you learned in Intro microecon. The problem sets were frequently challenging (sometimes unduly so), but sections are a must if you want to do well on homework. Themidterm was strikingly easier than the problem sets, but the final was definitely difficult. Not sure yet how much of a curve there is.",
    "Econ 121 with Bergemann is probably the best course for intermediate microecon. He's a good lecturer and provides helpful online lecture notes. Since his expertise is in game theory, he will cover it more heavily towards the end of the course.",
    "Take it with Bergemann, he's great. Final was BRUTAL compared to the relatively easy midterm. Problem sets were pretty tough but most of the TAs were helpful I'm told, though mine was not. Game theory section was very cool.",
    "I really liked this course; Professor Bergemann is really funny and clear in his explanations, and the material is pretty interesting. It basically is a more mathematical investigation of the ECON 115 material, with several expansions that have important consequences. It's very much a math course, but then again econ is inherently mathematical so that should be expected.I especially like the examples Professor Bergemann used in the course - they really helped solidify a lot of the theories.P-Sets weren't too bad (a few were a little tricky), but the tests were really hard (especially the final). Still, I think the curveis pretty nice.Definitely take ECON121 with Bergemann if you can!",
    "You have to take it and you learn some new things from intro, but not very much. It does contain more math than intro micro.",
    "Recommended. Only one midterm, plus weekly problem sets.",
    "Take this with Bergemann if you can! He's ACTUALLY a good professor and this class is ACTUALLY interesting. There's only a problem set a week instead of 2 and the work is manageable. The game theory at the end is cool. The class is mathy but he explains things incredibly well and is very helpful during office hours. Also he's German. WIN.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who liked Intro Micro. You learn a lot of cool concepts that expand on your intro micro class.",
    "Econ 121 is a great course for anyone who is interested in understanding the world from its most fundamental concepts. Many of the things that we may not consider on a day-to-day basis (such as prices of tickets at Disneyland) can really be explained very clearly by economic phenomena. Although the course looks like it requires a lot of mathematics, it is really not too difficult to handle, and Dr. Bergemann is very helpful with explaining it and helping students to digest it.",
    "Absolutely recommended.",
    "You probably already know if you have to take this course. If you are good at math it should be a breeze. If not maybe not so much. You will learn econ, but not the concepts so much as the math. If you need to learn concepts take intro.",
    "Yes definitely take this class, and if you can, take it Bergemann. He is the man. He will really teach you how to think about Economics in a mathematical way. Make sure you keep up with the material, go to section and so on. Book was OK. Problems sets were kind of difficult, midterm was easy and everyone failed the final, so beware of that.",
    "It's interesting, but it's also extremely challenging. You shouldn't take it unless you are an Econ major.",
    "You'd probably only take it if you were an econ major, and in that case you have to.",
    "Professor Bergemann was engaging, informative and very funny. However, the final was so hard.",
    "Do not take this course unless you are an econ or epe major. Then again, if you are reading this response you are probably an econ or epe major. In that case, enjoy doing the same boring calculus problem over and over again in a million different situations. Also, enjoy spending an absurd amount on a useless textbook. In any event, you will not feel as if you understand economics any better when you are done. At least professor Bergemann is the best prof you can get for this course. He will make the course enjoyable and survivable.",
    "I'd recommend it if you want to learn how to maximize utility and\/or profit, and learn a little about game theory.",
    "No one takes Intermediate Micro because they want to.. they take it because they have to.",
    "This class is required for econ majors, so you have no choice if you are one of them, but over all I would say that you learn a lot of stuff that is never actually tested. Ask anyone in this class how they felt about this final exam and they will probably just cry.",
    "Good class, well taught, material is important to know. Take with Bergemann, he's excellent.",
    "It's hard and abstract. I would not take this unless it is required for your major",
    "Take the class only if you're a confirmed econ major--not worth just the QR",
    "Take it only if you have to. Its basically just a math class, building very little on the conceptual framework of intro micro.",
    "I would recommend taking it Bergemann.",
    "Yes I would, if you're an econ major. The class isn't very difficult or time consuming.",
    "Don't take the class w\/o a reason to. I think the course is by definition tedious, very math-heavy, but still, there is definitely room for improvement. On the one hand, Professor Bergemann was always enthusiastic, funny, and well-prepared. However, I felt like a lot of times, he focused way too much time on the tedious minutiae of deriving formulas and equations but didn't give us a good sense of the \"big picture\" behind what we were doing. I feel like I learned how to do a lot of complicated math problems, but I don't feel like I really gained a deeper understanding of important microeconomic concepts.",
    "Yes, but take it with this professor.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE UNLESS YOU ARE 100% CERTAIN THAT YOU WANT TO BE AN ECON MAJOR FOR TWO REASONS: (1) it will make you question your decision to be an econ major; (2) there are plenty of other fantastic courses to take rather than waste your time on this...",
    "Only take it if you are intending to be an econ or related major. The scope does not go much beyond the intro couse, which is much better taught. It just has more math.",
    "take it if you have to. and try to take it with dirk. he's the best option.",
    "It's an interesting class, but it's really hard. Be sure you want to take it.",
    "ECON121 with Bergemann was a great class - it was both very entertaining and educational. It effectively taught the quantitative tools for microeconomic analysis, and the material was presented and organized in a very logical, understandable manner.",
    "I would recommend this class, specifically with Dirk. You will learn a lot.",
    "Yes, it is a pretty interesting class. More so than past econ classes that I have taken (intro micro\/macro)",
    "YES. Professor Bergemann's Microeconomics class is very manageable, generally well-taught and interesting. The topics covered are relevant and cool, the lecture notes he provides are very helpful in studying, the workload was reasonable, problem sets are designed to edify and to guide and help the students through the process of problem-solving (and not too difficult or too time-consuming), and overall an enjoyable class.",
    "Never, ever take this class. Never. Don't be an econ major. Just don't do it. This class is worthless. Forget waterboarding terrorists; we should ship them to LC and make them sit through Intermediate Micro. I would rather have been waterboarded. Too much math, extremely impossible p-sets, and a final that was not like psets or the midterm. You've been warned, and I'm sure all of the other reviews are the same. If you're a fool like I am at least make sure you take it with Dirk.",
    "I recommend taking the class with Professor Bergemann! He was enthusiastic about teaching, very funny, and explained the material well. The class was difficult at times but always manageable, and it definitely got easier over the course of the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class - it was probably my favorite class this semester. Dirk is great, and if you liked intro micro then you'll probably like this too.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "This is as good of an Intermediate Microecon class as it can get. Take it with Dirk!",
    "I would recommend this course if it's taught by Prof. Bergemann, because it's as clear and fun as intermediate micro can be!",
    "A good but difficult class. Very math heavy.",
    "really dry, do not take it if you don't have to. it doesn't add much to intro micro but it's a lot harder",
    "This was by the far the hardest and most intimidating class I have taken at Yale so far. If you don't have a STRONG background in math, then you WILL struggle. I learned some math, but very little in terms of economic concepts... Dirk was a good, entertaining lecturer, but his problem sets and exams were unnecessarily difficult. Only take this course if you need it for your major or love math.",
    "Intermediate Economics calls you to use the math you already know to describe the economics you already know, which would have been tedious except that there was hardly any work. Towards the end of the semester we explored some fun new economic topics, like auctions and vertical contracts. Overall I'm glad I took the course, so be patient with the slow pace of the first third of the semester.",
    "great and funny professor, but extensive problem sets and very difficult final",
    "intermediate econ--learn how to do a lot of useless math that doesn't apply to the real world all that much. Most interesting parts were insurance and trading at the beginning. I wouldn't ever take it for fun but that's me (took it for my major).",
    "DO IT! I mean, you probably have to as you're an economics major.",
    "very good, yes. very usful",
    "If you are an Econ major, you already know you have to take this eventually. Make sure to take this with Dirk.",
    "If you want to take intermediate economics, take it with Professor Bergemann, you won't regret it.",
    "Yes, but not for fun. Take this class with Dirk if at all.",
    "Intermediate Micro is notorious for being difficult but Professor Bergemman does an amazing job at setting a pace that is perfect for the class to keep up with. He quickly reviews the past class material before diving into new territory each lecture. The grading is fair and the problem sets are tricky and take a lot of time but are fair as well. The only issue with some of the problem sets was that we learned the material they covered in subsequent classes, after they were due. I'm not sure if we just fell slightly behind in class or if he wanted us to try it out before learning it properly but correcting for this may have made the class slightly more manageable. Professor Bergemman is by far the best professor to take this class with. He is energetic, interesting, and extremely likable.",
    "Great class even for people who have put math to the wayside for the past three years. You have to have a mathematical mind, but this class teaches you how to apply complex equations to the world at large.",
    "Econ 121 continues major concepts from intro to microeconomics and carries these concepts to a new level. The course content is very relevant to economics and very interesting. However, problem sets are not easy and one needs to put some effort into this class in order to understand the material.",
    "Excellent course. Just mathy enough for the principles not to seem like \"black magic\" but not mathy enough to become tedious. For example, an emphasis of the course is the big picture connection of individual maximization to larger supply\/demand concepts like competitive equilibrium, edgeworth allocation, monopoly\/duopoly, and game theory topics. Thus, we got a very good idea of how the concepts of intermediate microeconomics could all be connected by a few relatively straightforward mathematical principles. On the otherhand, we didn't spend an excessive amount of time on the tedious aspects of the math like proofs, concavity tests, or unnecessary edge-case testing. A better name for this course, in fact, would be \"constrained optimization with applications.\"",
    "If interested in economics, it should certainly be taken.",
    "you have to take it if you are an econ major, but take it with dirk.",
    "A bad course worth taking because Econ is an otherwise very good major, and Intermediate Micro is a required course for the major. It truly is getting over the hump, but well worth it.",
    "The class is essentially introductory microeconomics using mathematics that logically applies (multivariable calculus) rather than relying on embarrassingly archaic algebra which every student who could possibly gain admission to Yale learned in their freshman year of high school. Consequently, the difficulty in the class lies not in understanding what is going on, but in understanding how to use multivariable calculus to explain economic concepts. Lectures focus on the latter aspect, and thus are mostly exercises in complicated, abstract notation and problem solving, with slight review of the ideas everyone learned in introductory microeconomics. This emphasis on the mathematical elements makes the lectures rather boring, although seeing concepts such as marginal utility or elasticity covered with math befitting a class at one of America\u0092s top universities can be intellectually stimulating. The professor is good at teaching, though his handwriting lacks quality, and gives mostly useful problem sets. The tests were both fair, which was nice. He expects you to know the entirety of the material he teaches, but will not pull any tricks or pose overly complicated inquiries on the exams. I left the classes satisfied with his teaching ability, and left both tests respecting his attempts to assess our competence. The TAs were fair and receptive to questions and grading concerns, which is always a nice touch. If you are an economics major, you\u0092re going to have to take the course, and I\u0092d recommend it with Bergemann. If not, though, I doubt you\u0092ll find the course engaging enough to stay in for an entire semester.",
    "Take with Dirk Bergemann and go to his office hours. He is one of the most approachable and he will help you with any problems, even those on the pset.",
    "You should take it in the spring if you are an econ major. it is better than in the fall.",
    "I would summarize Economics 121 as a rewarding survey of economics and the mathematical modeling of economic theory. I would recommend this class to another student interested in economics on any level; however, the class is somewhat mathematical and so anyone who is strongly averse to math should think twice about the course. On the other hand, the math is relatively easy and any student here at Yale could do well in this class."
