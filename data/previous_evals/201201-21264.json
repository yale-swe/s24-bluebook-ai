   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are interested in art and philosophizing about it even while sober, then this is the class to take! JG is knowledgeable enthusiastic and alert, and he provides solid discourses on the topics as well as overview of the readings, so you can kind of get away with not doing all of them all the time...",
    "An introduction to various questions surrounding the philosophy of art. The readings are difficult, and very philosophical, but Prof. Gilmore helps apply them to real artistic debates. While it was difficult, I think this class helped me think more deeply about art, so it is definitely worth taking.",
    "A thorough and challenging overview of the major issues and viewpoints in Philosophy of Art. There is something in this course to interest and engage everyone on a personal or academic level, whether your background is in art history, philosophy, or many other fields. The assigned readings range from easily manageableto philosophically challenging, but the in-class discussions always help clarify the readings, as well as giving students new challenges and ideas to consider. The course emphasizes in-class discussion and the weekly reading responses, and there was no final assigned paper.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. The workload is extremely light (no exams or final paper), but the weekly response ensure that you do at least some of the reading, so you come in each week to a really informed discussion of a generally interesting idea in philosophy of art. Prof. Gilmore is basically lecturing the whole time, with occasional interruptions from students, so definitely don't expect a dialogue. Indeed, Prof. Gilmore has this somewhat disappointing way of answering every question himself, as opposed to opening it up into broader discussion. That said, i really got a lot out of his comments.",
    "This was a solid class. The readings are fascinating, even for someone without a passion for aesthetics in philosophy. It was very possible to keep up given a philosophy background, though some people who came at it from an art history\/literature background may have struggled a bit in the class.Don't expect too much lively conversation between students: most class participation involved a question and answer with Gilmore rather than discussion and debate. But he is a great lecturer and you probably won't be bored in class as you might with other professors who ran a non-discussion-heavy seminar."
