   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "From listening to various interpretations of the same piece, I developed by ability to listen acutely to nuances in timing and sound production of performances. I gained a greater appreciation for the composers we covered in class (Bach, Beethoven, Brahms) as well as various performers of their music.",
    "Appreciation for music",
    "I learned how to be a more active listener in order to appreciate the effort a performer puts into a musical performance. This class taught me the difference between literalism and authenticity in music.",
    "After taking this course, listening to music has gained an entirely new meaning. Before, It was more of a background to other activities. Now I consider listening to music an active pursuit. I gained the ability to clearly articulate how a variety of very subtle artistic decisions change the emotion communicated by a given piece.",
    "MUSI 002 introduced me to beautiful pieces by Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms that I would not have been able to discover on my own. This course sharpened my listening skills and my understanding of music as something that is shaped by the performer's interpretation or desire to be authentic to the composer.",
    "I definitely developed a better appreciation for the three composers covered; Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms. I also gained a lot of new knowledge on music history, historical instruments, and style by time period. I was introduced to the concept of historically informed playing, and gained new perspectives on how to analyze musical performances."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course examined material (the interpretative choices of performers) ordinarily not considered in academic music courses. The workload of the course was moderate and enjoyable.",
    "Too narrow musical selectiions",
    "This course allows for kids from a variety of musical backgrounds to learn about a new topic that most people do not think about. The musical selections allow us to appreciate works from Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms. When we come into class, it can be a little bit difficult to have something to add regarding the music to which we listened.",
    "Overall, this is a very strong course. I found the quizzes to be quite challenging, but they allowed me to use my ears and brain in a way that I was totally unfamiliar with. I really enjoyed writing the papers because I had time to listen to the various performances and really analyze them in a way that was personally significant.",
    "Strengths: MUSI 002 introduced me to less well-known pieces by Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms that increased my understanding of the composers and changed my perspective of them. Also, Professor Friedmann was very knowledgable and helped us analyze the different performances that we listened to. The class itself was very fun and enjoyable because of the beautiful music that we studied. We also attended a concert and had a live performer visit our class. Weaknesses: a few times, the class discussion could have been more engaging.",
    "The course is very discussion-based, which I loved. There was an appropriate mix of lecture and discussion, which heightened student engagement. The course is also centered around music, with most work being listening to various recordings of a selected piece, with the occasional reading\/essay enhancing understanding of concepts instead of detracting from the musical experience. For improvements, I think some more consistency on the timeline would be helpful. There was nothing unmanageable, but there were big differences in the amount of time students had to listen to every piece, i.e long assignments given over the weekend versus long assignments given between Tuesday and Thursday."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to student who might not be as familiar with classical music. However, perhaps to a student who is pursuing a degree in music, the course may seem comparatively elementary.",
    "Yep if you like music",
    "Yes. This course is fantastic in that it provides for freshmen to meet other freshmen in a setting that provides for an appreciation of music. It is a class that anybody could find interesting and thought-provoking.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who, like me, grew up playing a classical instrument in relaxed way, and wants to refine their understanding of the possibilities when it comes to performance. Additionally, anyone that enjoys listening to classical music should take this course.",
    "Take MUSI 002 if you enjoy listening to classical music and are able to read music\/follow a score. The class is fun and rewarding because it introduces you to so many great pieces. The workload is very manageable as well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in music; it offers really interesting perspectives on how conductors\/performers interpret a piece, which is often lost when listening like we usually do - inactively. You don't need a theory background or anything, just the ability to read, so it's really accessible. The workload also isn't huge, and the selected recordings are very fun to listen to."
