   "comments": [
    "As someone who has never taken a business course before, I learned a lot of new concepts. Really enjoyed hearing about industrial symbiosis, change management, and a bit of skepticism on CSR.",
    "The course gave a good comprehensive overview of topics surrounding corporate sustainability practices",
    "Lots of theories, systems, mechanisms for improving corporate environmental performance.",
    "Key insights I have taken away from this class are mainly related to the different case studies that were part of the curriculum. Highlighting different business models that incorporate sustainability factors or are aimed at a circular economy, examining the trade offs between sustainability and profits or rapid growth, and discussing the soft skills and interpersonal dynamics that are required to manage change are some of the issues I found most intriguing.",
    "Learned so much about how to approach environmental issues from a business angle. I have more of the environmental background, so this class offered a great intro into how to think from a perspective outside of the scientific environment.",
    "Corporate strategies in sustainable development and broadened my horizon in this field.",
    "environmental management strategy for corporations."

    "I was expecting to learn more tangible things about business and how businesses incorporate environmental management into their strategies but I really didn't get that knowledge. I'd say the only time where we really covered that was when we talked about Lean and Six Sigma.",
    "They generally exceeded my expectations.",
    "Well",
    "Very well it was more of less what I expected.",
    "Although I wish we had, at times, gone more into detail, the course content aligned exactly with what I was expecting from the course.",
    "The topics covered aligned similarly, while the perspective taken regarding each topic was a little different. Not necessarily bad just different.",
    "I believe this class covered more materials in this field than I expected and they all very important.",
    "The contents touch broad variety but all in little depth.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths of the course is the breadth of subjects that are covered. The assignments were really fair and interesting, and I always enjoy when the professor offers a bit of flexibility on completing, in this instance, 5\/6 of the assignments or all 6 and dropping the lowest grade. The final project allows for some depth in the subject area. The weaknesses of the course is the sometimes disjointed nature of the lectures. It was difficult to see how all the pieces fit together at points, especially considering from the business's point of view when they would employ these concepts and where we might fit them in later in our careers.",
    "Strengths- good variety of topics, fair amount of work, very interesting final project assignments Weaknesses- slide shows have an excessive amount of information and there is not enough time in class to get through them",
    "Strengths: broad, sufficient coverage. Fieldtrip was great, would love to have more. Weaknesses: Marian is too kind to not punish us for not doing readings. Maybe more class discussion will pressure us into doing readings.",
    "The main strength is the variety of topics covered in the curriculum. The greatest weakness, in my opinion, is that too often the content remains very superficial.",
    "As accomplished and established as Professor Chertow is, her presentation doesn't speak to it. Her slides don't do her knowledge justice (she could make them a lot better) and sometimes she seemed to say something that seemed to counter the infographic she chose, so just presentation of the lectures could be improved.",
    "This class covered a wide range of materials, which I believe are all very important. However, I feel like it might be better to go deeper in each topic to deepen our understanding in it.",
    "strength: broad and general context weakness: no in-depth subject study"

   "comments": [
    "Professor Chertow is a really engaging lecturer and offers a lot of humor.",
    "Start assignments early, put effort into the final project",
    "Stay openminded.",
    "The course is a cross-course between SOM and F&ES. That being said, many of the business principles will seem overly simple and repetitive for SOM students. If you have taken prior courses in sustainability or environmental science, this course may be a little too basic for your liking.",
    "Take this if you have any interest in business, environment, or both. We covered a lot of cool topics and this class will be very beneficial to take.",
    "It is very important to find a project that you're interested in because you will definitely spend a large amount of time on it and it is a great chance for you to deepen your understanding in that field.",
    "take it!"
