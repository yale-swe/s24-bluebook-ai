   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wishes to continue his or her study of Spanish--it is the natural next step after Spanish III. Strengths of this course include focus on grammar and reading texts. More emphasis on oral communication and writing would be nice.",
    "I would take this class if you are really interested in Spanish and an advanced speaker. The class moves at a fast pace.",
    "Spanish 140 is a great class for someone who is very comfortable with the Spanish Language but wants to master and refine his or her skills.",
    "I enjoyed the class because it focused on speaking but also reviewed and expanded on writing skills too. I would therefore reccommend this class for any student who enoys the language.",
    "I would recommend it because even though it has a decent amount of work, it is a helpful and enjoyable course. Also, the course is structured so that the work and bigger assignments are evenly spread out, interwoven with interesting readings and videos.",
    "Spanish 140 is very similar to a typical high school Spanish class: it contains grammar review, short stories, compositions, and a novel at the end. For those trying to fulfill a language requirement or simply maintain their level of spanish, I would recommend this course. However, for those really trying to improve their Spanish, I would suggest trying to place into a higher level that does less grammar review.The workload of this class is consistent (it is every day), but the work is generally easy and most assignments are not collected for a grade. The essays are graded fairly and the tests are slightly more difficult, but overall it is not a difficult class. The best part is reading the novel and the short stories, some of which are really excellent pieces of literature.In general, I think this class is a great way to practice spanish and can be really good with a good teacher, but it is not particularly exciting.",
    "Olivier-Reid is a great, engaging instructor. The course itself, sadly is neither focused nor engaging. Don't take unless you have too."
