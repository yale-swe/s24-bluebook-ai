    "This is one of the best courses at Yale and definitely worth taking. It is unusual, multi-medial, and challenging without being a burden. It was a joy to take this course and Ill never forget it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "TAKE it! A great course! The reading list is absolutely amazing! While there are a lot of readings, I never had trouble finishing them (it was difficult to put the books down!). The reading responses are lengthy (4 pages per week), but really allowed everyone to reflect on the readings. Class discussion was engaging and never lacking! Regardless of how you feel about science fiction, do try to take a class with Prof Carby. She is easy to reach out to and a great seminar leader!",
    "Yes! Amazing history of African American culture and gender studies."
