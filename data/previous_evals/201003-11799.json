    "This course will make you think about the history of technology in surprising new ways. Parisian sewers, Indonesian roads, nuclear weapons, women photographers, killer robots, the process of invention, and grisly murders on trains: if any of those sound interesting to you, take this course!",
    "I would absolutely recommend it--you read great books and classroom discussion focuses on interesting and controversial topics",
    "Summarizing this course is hard due to its breadth- but, you will be studying the history of technology and how it has effected history and conversely how history has effected the development and use of technology. It will probably be unlike other ways you have studied history and it is a good course to take if you plan to be a history major. This is a new field of study (in comparison to many other areas of history) and could lead to good senior paper topics- plus you have to do original research so this would be a perfect course to prepare for your senior essay.",
    "- History of Technology with a focus on its dichotomy with society- Great class that will certainly cause you to reevaluate the way that you examine technology as well as 'things' in general"
