    "12. The class is likely more useful to those with backgrounds in (or interest in) international development and conservation, but i found it interesting and a challenge, even with my more \"domestic policy\" background.",
    "Professor Carpenter was generous with her time and available to students. Conversation was lively and two-sided, which was very nice (as opposed to being talked at). Sometimes Professor Carpenter's explanations of concepts was difficult to follow; occasionally personal interpretations were presented as The One Answer (e.g. explanations of Foucault's concepts).Overall course content was helpful: this was my first encounter with many of these ideas, and I feel that I've been exposed to a totally new perspective and set of concerns that never would have been on my radar screen otherwise."

    "Lectures, readings.",
    "This class definitely made me question the motives and achievements of government\/development programs. While it can be depressing material to cover, it is crucial that anyone who wants to work in government be exposed to this way of thinking. I was able to look at a program I thought I knew very well from an entirely different perspective and see major flaws in its implementation. Though I am not pursuing this discipline academically, this class will definitely be useful in future professional work.",
    "Thesis sentence requirement was cumbersome because it made it impossible to not do readings during busy weeks, yet this activity drove home concepts for me more than any other.In-class discussion was my favorite part of the course. Professor Carpenter fostered a lively back-and-forth that allowed room for expertise beyond her own (several classmates had implementation experience that put readings into other contexts) in a way that was both humble and increased the potential for student learning. It was the mark of a secure, learning-before-ego professor (a really nice change from others!).Teaching Fellow Erin Beasley was very available and helpful. She was a great TF who very much supported learning outside of class, especially in informal conversations. I very much enjoyed talking through readings with her."

However, I gained an understanding of development--how it works, what challenges it faces, etc. This course definitely exposed me to the challenges, pitfalls, and red flags. Should I go into development, or should I find myself one day fortunate enough to be philanthropically giving to organizations implementing programs, I feel like I now have a much better toolkit for engagement that I would have if left to my own devices."

I was hoping for recommended courses of action that I could put into my playbook: ways to determine appropriate targets for communication about a program, methods of communication that have worked to increase participation in a program vs. those that have acted to decrease participation, etc."

This class taught me to question so much more, including the very existence of the programs I expected to analyze. This class exceeded expectations.",
    "Yes, but in a far different direction that I'd expected at the outset. I was originally been looking for tools, or plays that I could include in my playbook (see answer to question 18). I was really thinking the course would be more pragmatic than it was. Instead of getting a list of \"these are the good things to do,\" what I got from the course was a list of, \"these are the things to look out for, and here's a companion list of things not to do.\" It was far more theoretical than pragmatic, which is helpful... albeit in a far different way than expected. Nevertheless, I learned a lot and am glad to have had the exposure to ideas I never would have sought out on my own otherwise."

    "For students working in developing nations or studying anthropology, this class will be directly applicable to you. For those with a background in management or politics, it will force you to take a critical look at your own work. However, if you have never taken an anthropology course before, maybe consider taking Carol's other, larger class.",
    "Consider this class the theoretical framework that can inform your action. This is not a pragmatic class wherein you will get a set of tools for implementation. Instead, prepare yourself to think about bigger underlying questions of development project implementation. Knowledge gained in this class may be useful in developing your own playbook later, especially insofar as it may help you recognize gaps in your planning or approach, and may prove helpful in identifying reasons for project failure such that a program's trajectory can be fruitfully adjusted mid-course.I recommend this class for anyone who will be working in international aid\/development programs. It may be less useful for those interested in implementing programs within already developed economies."
