    "I became acquainted with the greatest works of 19th century Russian literature. I learned a little bit about Russian history. I became a better reader of literature, mostly with respect to analyzing themes and comparing different works of literature.",
    "I learned a lot about the evolution of Russian writing and thinking, and a bit about Russian history.",
    "I now have a thorough understanding of the arc, messages, and beauty of 19th century Russian lit.",
    "By taking this course, I had the opportunity to read some of the most foundational works of Russian literature. I also gained awareness of the cultural\/historical context of 19th century Russia in which they were produced."

   "comments": [
    "More Dostoevsky. But please, please don't get rid of Anna Karenina ever. A Hero of our Time was a little odd ... and I couldn't quite fit it into the sequence. But generally I loved the course.",
    "The readings are all fantastic. I learned so much about Russia, but I also learned what kinds of questions one must ask as one attempts to live a meaningful life. The pace of the course was excellent.",
    "Great lectures, and good discussion with lots of input from students. Professor Fink runs out of time in class, but that's just because there's so many insights she want to cover, so I'm not sure it's really a problem.",
    "A fun introduction to Russian literature for any level of previous exposure.",
    "Strengths: reading list class size discussion based format grading criteria weaknesses: the two essays are so open-ended and long, that they were quite a beast to tackle for me, as this class was my first literature class at Yale. Honestly, I'm not sure if section is completely necessary given how small the class is, but I suppose it was done pretty well, so I'm not complaining.",
    "Professor Fink was fabulous and made the beauty of the texts apparent. Section was fun. We never has long enough to discuss the novels though; I think longer lecture time could be good. The people in the class were also not always very talkative, I'm not sure how to change that though. Also, I feel like for a WR credit, I could have used more writing assignments."

   "comments": [
    "Do you like Russian Literature? If you're not familiar with Russian literature, then do you like crazy people? If your answer was yes to either question, take this course.",
    "This course is great for anybody looking for a writing credit or for people looking to read some of the greatest works of 19th century literature. It is not super difficult, but you will learn so much!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You read some great books, and Professor Fink fills in the gaps in your Russian intellectual history to help you get everything out of it. Russian literature has so much to teach about life, and she really helps you get that out of it.",
    "I really wanted to take a literature class at Yale, and this class did not disappoint. Obviously, the reading list is great, and Prof. Fink did a great job of showing us how all of these works are connected. The grading scale is pretty great, as it is something like: 40% participation\/section, and 60% for two essays. The class size is actually pretty small (18) which is great. There is also a Russian language section, which I assume would be cool for Russian speakers. The professor and TA provide great insight on meanings of Russian words, that otherwise would be lost on English speakers.",
    "I would recommend this course! The reading list alone makes it worth it. When else are you going to read Anna Karenina? The reading load was very manageable. Prof Fink made the texts beautiful and interesting. Section with Jacob was chill and fun. Overall a great experience!",
    "This was my favorite class this semester by far. Professor Fink was clear from day one that this course was to be discussion based rather than lecture based, and she stayed true to that. She would give amazing insights and context but would then let the class discuss. The selections themselves were also absolutely fantastic, and I learned a lot just by reading them. Honestly I went in only thinking that I was going to get my WR credit out of the way, but I left with new perspectives on the human psyche and life in general."
