    "This class is a much-deserved break from the rigors of Econ\/Math. and even better, it's required. One presentation and attendance make up the whole of the responsibilities, and the choice of what topic to present on has the potential to make this class fulfilling. If you're interested in hearing lectures on a wide range of Econ\/Math topics, with no requirements to take notes, take tests, or do homework, this is the class for you. Thank you, Econ&Math Department, for giving us a break after an extremely taxing prior series of courses.",
    "You won't get much out of this course. You read one paper and give a 50-minute presentation on it to the class. Then you listen (read: you don't listen) to everyone else's presentations. That's it. The proofs in the presentations are usually complex enough so that no one understands them except the presenter. This year the topic was game theory. In other years it might be financial calculus.",
    "It is in general a relaxing class. The presentation is good opportunity to learn about a topic that you like. To your amazement, with the help of professors, you are capable of learning and reproducing the proofs of some of the most elegant math questions.",
    "Yeah, workload manageable. Just need to give a lecture. That's it.",
    "If you are at all interested in math and game theory, take this class. The workload is negligible. I don't think it is possible to do badly in this class. And by that I mean impossible to NOT do perfectly. Just take it.",
    "If you are an econ&math major, take the econ-focused seminar because it will be more understandable and interesting to you. This year, most of the seminar focused on game theory topics, but there were also some financial math topics. You're responsible for presenting your topic - usually a theorem and proof with an application.",
    "Great class. Students have to give one presentation, and the rest of the time, you get to watch others' lectures. It's a great way to finish off the econ\/math major."
