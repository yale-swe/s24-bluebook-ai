   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot more about how the food industry works in the US and globally. I learned about specific policies that shape the current global food system. I also began to think about what a just system of food access looks like.",
    "Great class about the interconnectedness of food, race, and migration. We read and watched a variety of different sources and had extremely interesting class discussions.",
    "I learned so much about how to view food systems in new ways. This course covers many intriguing topics, including authenticity, culture, race, history, advertising, production, and business all through the lens of food. After taking this course, I will continue to study the food system in terms of the people who are affected by it.",
    "This course touches on a wide range of food issues -- from workers rights in food system jobs to cultural authenticity. I learned a lot about how these issues can be bridged and the lens of migration was really helpful in understanding a nuance of the food system that one doesn't always consider.",
    "Although we covered a variety of topics in this class, I think the ones which stuck with me the most are the discussions of authenticity, as well as the readings on food justice. I feel like both of these topics are ones that I now feel better equipped to bring into my general conversations with people (especially authenticity) and that I want to continue learning about."

   "comments": [
    "The readings in this class are really good, as are the documentaries that we watch. They are informative and thought provoking. Sometimes seminar discussion can seem a little bit stale or quiet.",
    "The strength of this course is its wide breadth of topics studied. Professor Tran chose such wonderful readings from a variety of authors and subjects that truly made this class enjoyable. Class discussions also proved to be extremely thought-provoking and productive. The only weakness I can think of would be that the final project was somewhat disorganized, but this is mainly due to the fact that this semester was the first time this course was taught.",
    "Interesting reading list, poor assignments (group project was low impact, first assignment was basically just summary, etc.).",
    "The material of this class is its strength. There is so much interesting information to cover. I especially felt this way towards the end of the term while we learned about food justice and related topics. In this realm, however, I wish that we had spent less time at the beginning focusing on the histories of food and more time focusing on food justice. There were times when I felt like there was just too much reading for me to deeply engage with for one week. Another weakness of the class was the in-class discussion. While I believe that everyone in the class had wonderful opinions and thoughts to offer, I don't think these were uncovered to their full extent because there was no real structure to discussion. Professor Tran never really seemed to have a plan on leading the discussion, and instead would ask very broad, open-ended questions about the readings that just led to everyone sharing their personal musings on the topics. I would have appreciated a more structured discussion with defined discussion points and questions that guided discussion in a way that drew people into discussion with one another in deeper ways. In addition, we spent a lot of class time watching documentaries and movies, which was fun, but since this is a class that meets only once a week, and there was always so much material to discuss, I would have preferred better discussions and less screen time."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, take this class if you are interested in food systems and food justice",
    "Definitely. Great class, great professor and interesting topic that everybody should learn more about.",
    "Definitely take this course! Professor Tran is an absolute joy in class, and the readings and discussions are extremely interesting and thought-provoking. I will never be able to take part in food systems the same way again. This course is also a wonderful example of how you can do work in the classroom and put that learning into effect in the real world.",
    "I would recommend this class if you haven't really been exposed to food issues before. It's basically a survey course - talk a little bit about ag labor, a little bit about kitchen labor, a little bit about migration of farm workers, racist food advertisements, authenticity, etc. The discussions were pretty circular and not the most invigorating, but the readings were usually enjoyable. This might be better as a lecture course?",
    "The reading list is thought-provoking, especially if you're new to food studies. But most of the discussions were really simplistic and didn't dive much into the texts - their methodology, etc. - which was a shame.",
    "Whether you've never studied food or consider yourself a food scholar, the arc of this course covers a breadth of food issues necessary for anyone who wishes to learn about food systems and justice. The class starts with historical prospectives on food trade and labor and ends with readings on the potential for food system transformation. It's a great overview if you're new to the subject.",
    "The strengths of this class are the readings and the material. The intersection of food, race, and migration is a super interesting one, and there's so much there to learn about and explore. My experience with this class was that I would get really enjoy the readings and come to class ready to discuss and learn from other people, and then the discussions would be continually disappointing. There really was no structure to discussion and class usually ended up just being people sharing their own musings and occasionally engaging with one another. With better structure, this class could have been so much better, so hopefully in future years that will be improved. That being said, this class is great - not too much work with the option for a non-essay final project, and really interesting material."
