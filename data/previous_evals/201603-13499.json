   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I find that I developed very little knowledge or skills, though I did consider more strongly the role of sleep in my life in a very stressful semester. One skill-set I did learn was Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia, in a guest lecture. I'm really disappointed that I wasn't pushed to learn more science in this course.",
    "I learned about the chemical, physical, and emotional effects sleep and lack of sleep have on an individual. I learned the history of sleep as a science and its portrayal in art. I learned how some of the biggest disasters of the late 20th century and many car accidents of today are caused by a lack of sleep or a sleep disorder. I became much more aware of how important sleep is on a daily basis, which has really inspired me to get as much sleep as I can.",
    "I now have a much more in-depth understanding of sleep, sleep cycles, circadian rhythm, neurobiology of sleep, how sleep operates both on an individual level and on a societal level. But more importantly, this class affected the way I choose to sleep, the way I view its importance, how much I love it! It is one of those classes that are not just in the abstract but have real implications on our lives.",
    "This course equipped me with practical skills that improved my sleep health.",
    "This class taught me a lot about different sleep habits and the benefits of better sleep hygiene. It had a great interdisciplinary approach.",
    "This class was a great interdisciplinary take on the importance of sleep on our everyday lives. Given Yale's stressful environment, it was useful to finally take a course that pushed us to consider why we should not take sleep for granted--esp while we are students here at Yale.",
    "I personally learned a ton about sleep practices, patterns, physiology. I can't emphasize how much I enjoyed this course - it was so much fun and Dr. Kryger is incredibly knowledgeable in this field!",
    "Importance, mechanics, and historical view of sleep",
    "I learned that my sleep schedule was messed up and that I wasn't sleeping properly. I learned why I need sleep. This is the most relevant-to-my-life course that I've ever taken here at Yale.",
    "This class taught me all about sleep across many different disciplines. We studied sleep from the perspective of art, history, psychology and biology, and the professor tried to keep the class accessible to students of all backgrounds. The format of the class was designed to let students explore their interests, yet make sure everyone had a basic understanding of the underlying principles. This is an interesting class that isn't too time consuming, and I would also recommend it as a 5th or 6th class if you are on the fence.",
    "This was an incredibly interesting class about the value of sleep. We studied sleep from a variety of different angles - we studied the science, the cultural impact, and the intersection between sleep and humanities. I definitely learned how sleep affects the body both physically and mentally, and am determined to get more of it!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Some strengths of the course were that it fulfilled my science credit, made me think about my sleep habits, made me think about the relationship of sleep to every possible discipline, and wasn't stressful. Some weaknesses were that I didn't learn much, the tests didn't correspond well to the material we were lectured on, and the essays were graded completely arbitrarily. Also, many lectures simply repeated slides from the day before. There were some slides that were in 4-5 lectures and were presented as new each time, which was really a drag. I also found it very frustrating that even if I tried to put work into the class, I got nothing out of it. Even if I wanted to get scientific info out of the slides, it wasn't really possible to get from studying the slides or the readings.",
    "A strength of the course is that the lectures were interesting and the discussions we had about the lectures gave me more insight about sleep and its relation to all of our lives. The course could be improved by making the students learn more details of the science behind sleep. We were given a lot of overview because the professor knew most of us were not science majors, but I would have liked to learn more of the science. Also, some of the lectures were a bit repetitive.",
    "Strengths - fascinating, full of fun facts and activities, engaging and rewarding. Weaknesses - not to the fault of the professor - due to the variation of prior scientific knowledge in the class it was hard to get into the hardcore science parts, which I think could be incorporated after a brief but thorough explanation of the relevant neurobiological systems",
    "The course provides a low-stakes environment in which to learn some very interesting and relevant science. I think it could be improved by increasing the rigor, just slightly, with which the neuroscience involved is explored.",
    "Professor Kryger is the #1 strength of this course. He really cares about his students and continued to tailor the content throughout the semester as he learned more about individual interests.",
    "In general, the material was engaging and classes were interactive and interesting. We always had interesting discussions to talk about anything related to sleep.",
    "Catered to a wide range of students; sometimes the information seemed repetitive",
    "The course could have used more structure regarding the reading, but other than that, it was wonderful!",
    "There was hardly any work in the class, which was amazing - just two papers and two short tests. It made the class much more enjoyable! All the reading was optional - we just go to read what interested us. The lectures were interesting and engaging, and I always looked forward to coming to class. The only weakness is that I felt we could be pushed a little harder, and held more accountable for some of the information, especially the science."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I was extremely, extremely disappointed by this course. I thought that I might learn something useful, either about science or about my own sleep patterns or how sleep related to the humanities in a substantive way. Or, I thought it would be engaging enough that I would at least have fun in the course. It wasn't, and I didn't come away any of that. But I guess I would recommend this course to another student to fulfill a science credit by doing almost no work and learning no science -- it's 2 pretty easy multiple-choice tests (30 min) and 2 essays that don't have to be about science (though a bit arbitrarily graded). Also, any work that you put in isn't really rewarded. I personally think it's a bit of a waste, but I'm happy I got a science credit out of it. There just must be a better science credit out there that gives you at least some scientific information.",
    "This is a great course for students who are interested in science behind sleep, but are non science majors. Professor Kryger does a great job of making a science course accessible and interesting to his students. He intertwined history, art, politics, current events, and science to touch upon many of his students' interests. Professor Kryger is such a nice and understanding professor, I would definitely recommend taking his course!",
    "Absolutely - fun, insightful, and a must for any college student to embark on a healthy life.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Dr. Kryger is incredibly passionate about teaching undergrads and has structured a helpful course. Although you pick up a lot of science as it relates to sleep, the course is totally accessible for non-science majors. No matter what, you'll leave the course with knowledge to help improve your sleeping habits.",
    "Definitely recommend! Dr. Kryger is wonderfully kind and a great instructor",
    "Yes, absolutely. If you are a non-science major, this course is interesting and accommodates those interested in the humanities and social sciences.",
    "Absolutely! It's a great class, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The workload is manageable (2 papers and 2 tests), discussions are fun, and content is interesting and applicable.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes. 100%. So applicable to real life, especially here at Yale where sometimes we pride ourselves on sleep deprivation. Chill workload, great reward.",
    "I would recommend this course to students from any background looking to spend part of their semester thinking and learning about sleep. The material is accessible and digestible, the assignments are designed to engage the students' interests, and the professor is friendly and draws on decades of clinical practice. Combined with the relatively low workload, I would recommend this sleep to any student with a schedule of every degree of difficulty.",
    "Absolutely! The easiest class I've ever taken at Yale, but also one of the most interesting and most valuable. The culture on campus is very much geared towards sacrificing sleep, which is so unhealthy. Everyone should take this class! I've slept more this semester than I have since middle school and it makes a huge difference. TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT!",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE."
