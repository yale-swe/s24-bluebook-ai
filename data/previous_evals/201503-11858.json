    "It is a good class to learn the skills of writing but will take of a lot of time with the extra readings and longer essays. Good writing credit for beginners if you feel that you would have the time for it.",
    "Focus on modern day warfare philosophy, tactics, concepts of the new era of warfare. Very applicable to everyone today, especially those who want to go into foreign policy. I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "If you intend to be a serious academic scholar, this should be a course that you take.",
    "A writing class with interesting readings related to modern warfare and the societal costs.",
    "I would say it's a great class about American foreign policy and warfare in general. It explores the different political, philosophical, tactical, etc implications of both. It falls short in teaching how to write an essay, but the comments made by the instructor on first drafts are often very helpful.",
    "This course was not an introductory English course. I would not recommend this course as a course to teach someone how to write. To do well in this course, you already needed to be able to write well."
