    "I would not recommend this class to another student. It is a ton of obnoxious busy work you will not want to do ever. The amount of unnecessary homework they give is pointless and not to mention boring. The Spanish department has failed in how they laid out this class, and their other L5 class offerings. Get it together!!! Don't take this class unless you actually have to, are taking it Credit\/D, want to waste a credit, or have nothing better to do.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You should expect to carve out a significant amount of time to complete homework assignments, but the class is not difficult if this is done. I found that I came out of this class more confident in my ability to write in Spanish.",
    "I would recommend starting it Credit\/D\/fail then changing it if you feel you want to continue putting in all the work. Definitely improves your grammar but not your speaking skills.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class to anyone looking to build confidence with grammar before moving on to other advanced level courses. I would not recommend the course to students specifically looking to improve speaking fluency."
