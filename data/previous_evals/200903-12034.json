   "comments": [
    "If you're interestedin the class material at all, take the class. If you think you might be interested, take the class. If you're not really interested (I wasn't at first) take the class. Professor MacKay is enthusiastic and knowledgeable and does a great job presenting the material. Not much of a political focus and the later years of Russian history are given a cursory mention basically, but the culture part of the class is very well taught. I ended up really enjoying the class despite having no interest in learning about Russian culture (or knowing anything about it) going into the first class.",
    "Take it.",
    "Good class for an introduction to Russia from Peter the Great to the present day. Lectures could get disorganized and confusing, but the TF was great about clarifying the topics covered. Workload was reasonable and readings were generally interesting.",
    "It is a class that studies the full overview of Russian cultural themes in the \"modern age.\" it's really interesting, and you feel like you understand parts of the culture that have secretly been apart of american culture for decades (like method acting). Take the class.",
    "I would recommend this class with reservations, in its current form. The material is interesting, the readings are good, and both Professor MacKay and our teaching assistant were wonderfully enthusiastic and knowledgeable; however,the organization of the course was such that it could become frustrating. We never had time to address all of the reading in class (and there was a LOT of reading), the lectures always ran over and still couldn't fit everything in, and readings were posted to classesv2 several days after the syllabus indicated we should have read them. If you are truly passionate about Russian culture, I would still recommend this class most heartily, but for the dabbler, there might be better ways to spend your time.",
    "I would recommend the course for any student interested in how Russian history and culture are connected. Potential students should be aware that the course is very reading-heavy.",
    "Yes!!! It's a great class that doesn't have too much work. You really do learn a lot, and the grade is midterm, section, and either a paper or an exam. Legit interesting and less work for comparable history-type classes. MacKay is so genuinely enthusiastic about his material, and he's really helpful and approachable. The TA this semester (Kerry Philben) was great, too. The class looks at culture, politics, and history of the modern era, so starting mostly with Peter the Great in the 1700s (but some stuff before that). You end up with Soviet Union and current day, but the Soviet and current material are both covered quickly."
