    "This course provided a perfect foundation and overview of Latin American politics and diplomacy. I learned how to analyze past and current bilateral relations between the United States and countries throughout the region. My historical knowledge and insight was also greatly enhanced, especially learning what aspects of history are particularly important in diplomatic relations. Lastly, I also learned important human rights tools and how to employ them.",
    "I learned a ton about approaches to Latin American foreign affairs from a seasoned practitioner",
    "I got a great overview of 20th century Latin America history, a really interesting inside look into the state department, the chance to talk to experts on the region, and an amazing opportunity to study with a really kind, experienced, and intelligent professor.",
    "In-depth knowledge of Latin American history, key issues confronting the hemisphere, and US diplomacy in the region.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of a lot of different Latin American countries and how those histories inform US diplomacy. We had a lot of guest speakers so you hear the first person accounts of what went down in each country."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths were Professor Palmieri--who was fantastic, engaging, and very knowledgeable--along with the amazing guest speakers he invited. The discussions were outstanding and the readings were manageable and insightful. There were no weaknesses.",
    "This course was relaxed, which made it really enjoyable. Paco is great-- brought in AMAZING guest speakers and told us a lot about practicing in the field. I wouldn't call this the most rigorous academic class; you could definitely get away with lightly skimming the readings.",
    "Strengths-- awesome professor, great guests, good discussions. weaknesses-- the readings were sometimes difficult to access, and often we would read something but we wouldn't get to discuss it in class.",
    "Paco was a great instructor and put a ton of time into making the course a great experience for everyone. He succeeded in every aspect, from selecting great readings to offering invaluable insights to leading great discussions to planning awesome guest speakers and a class trip. There were no weaknesses.",
    "This was my favorite course this semester. It was engaging and the subject matter was pertinent and interesting. Professor Palmieri uses his real world experience to enrich the class, and its just a great class all around."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, without a doubt. If you are interested in diplomacy and international human rights, this the perfect course. Latin America is often a forgotten region and this course provides a fantastic overview.",
    "YES! Take a class with Paco while he's still here! You'll learn a ton and it'll be very laid back!",
    "Yes! Paco is awesome. Take it!",
    "Absolutely. For anyone even remotely interested in Latin America or US foreign policy, this course is as good as it gets. Prof. Palmieri is an excellent teacher and takes the time to mentor all of his students one-on-one. Highly, highly recommend.",
    "Definitely! If youre at all interested in foreign affairs, how US diplomacy works or the modern political\/human rights history of Latin America, this class is perfect for you"
