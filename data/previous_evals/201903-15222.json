    "I'm used to approaching evolution and adaptation from a deep-time perspective. So, the scope of this class - to evaluate and discuss the human influence on the evolution of numerous organisms in the recent - was a brand-new field to me. I learned so much from this course, from large-scale macroevolutionary discussions to minutia of various subfields that were entirely foreign to me. Never have I experienced a class of this caliber, and I'm so thankful I did!",
    "How Anthropogenic change is influencing evolution and community dynamics. SO eye-opening. I felt like this class really developed my critical skills for analyzing papers and also my confidence in discussing them."

   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses: Having no experience with some of the fields our papers covered, a brief intro (~5-10 minutes) into the subject matter the week before would have been appreciated. That being said, the papers selected for the course were rarely too difficult or foreign to me to engage with at least at a lower level. Strengths: Not only were the papers discussed interesting, but the environment in which those papers were discussed was extremely welcoming. I rarely felt insecure about asking questions to Dr. Munoz or any of the other students who may have had experience with some of the research discussed. Mr. Munoz is continually encouraging, and creates a warm, inviting, and intellectual classroom.",
    "I loved this course!",
    "I had a great experience with this class. Martha creates a seminar environment that really encourages discussion, I learned a lot from my fellow classmates. The papers we focused on each week were expertly picked and definitely a strength of the course. Martha's feedback on our own writing was also very helpful."
