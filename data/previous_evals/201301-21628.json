    "Definitely take it. The language is great, and the professors make it even better with their energy and humor.",
    "If you are willing to put a lot of time into it, take it. However, if you don't want to be super committed and still want to get a good grade, don't take it. The amount of work you have to do to get an A is only worth if you are really into it.",
    "Very tough, but rewarding if you put in the time. LOTS of work - 2 hours a night, roughly. Could really be worth 2 credits. Class is hands-on learning, with frequent dialogues and constant check-ups. Harder than Japanese 1, but I feel better about my ability to communicate now.",
    "JAPN 120 is the continuation of JAPN 110--you learn just as much Japanese with just as awesome teaching from the previous semester."
