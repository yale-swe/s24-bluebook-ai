    "I would definitely recommend this class, Irasema directly applies real world situations to the field of macroeconomics, and you learn a lot about how everything ties in together.",
    "I would recommend",
    "A basic overview of key Macroeconomic concepts, which I would recommend to others.",
    "This is a required course. It would be quite helpful if you never learned macro before. Materials are somewhat easy for people with econ background.",
    "I would recommend the class to a fellow student, telling them that it strikes a good balance between introducing challenging material, and doing so at a moderately slow pace.",
    "As a good resource to apply and analize the current financial crisis",
    "Econ 546 is very informative and essential for a deeper understanding in macroeconomics. It is highly recommended for economists and policy makers although it would have been better if the course provides a more applicative aspect.",
    "yea.",
    "I would recommend Econ 546 to other students as a useful Masters level course in macroeconomics. Where students had majored in economics with a high level of technical coverage, they might find some aspects of the course a little basic but were actually probably still challenged in the problem sets.I would summarize it as a solid Masters level macro course, providing a well-structured presentation of long- and short-run theories of economic growth and business cycles, as well as tackling issues such as unemployment and investment. I would say that the course balances well the need for technical understanding, delivered through solving problems, as well as having a thorough understanding of all concepts, ensured through the short answer parts of the final."

   "comments": [
    "This course has certainly made me more interested in studying Economics, and I am excited to learn more next semester. I really enjoyed learning about the Financial Crisis and how different monetary policies tied into the crisis.",
    "Through providing a good outline of the concepts involved in Macroeconomics.",
    "Get a better understanding of macroeconomics, more than what is taught for undergrad.",
    "It is a core requirement for the IDE program, and as such, it added to my foundational understanding of macroeconomics.",
    "The course is very well-paced and certainly provided a deeper understanding in macroeconomics, especially the current economic crisis, which should be useful in my future career.",
    "My macro background before this course was intermediate macroeconomics but had been more concept-based, without a technical, more mathematical, approach. As such the course has furthered my technical knowledge of the areaas well as widening it through introducing me to new theories and models of the economy.Being on a masters course without a dissertation\/research requirement, the latter part of the question is not applicable to me."
