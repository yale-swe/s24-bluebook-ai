    "Dr. Vandebroek is one of the best professors I've had. She is really a leader in her field, but totallyinterested in her students, no matter their level (I was a total beginner). She was always open to questions and always challenged us in our learning. The readings are very good, but the class is extremely practical instead of just theoretical.",
    "I liked the lectures on plant identification. I think they were very useful, especially when we got to practice what we learned and ID plants. I also liked the lectures on plant collecting and the exercise on plant collecting. I found that the final project was a lot of fun and really learned a lot from it.",
    "Lecture and discussion topics were really interesting. Ina's insights from the field. Reading selections were great.",
    "The readings were excellent and just the right amount (about 1\/2 to 3\/4 day of reading). Also, almost every paper was very interesting and directly relevant to what we covered in class.The teacher's supportiveness and accessibility was exceptional. She was always available before class and was quick to respond to emails. She gave lots of support on our final projects and had fascinating experiences to share with the class regarding her own work as an ethnobotanist.The instructor's presentations were well designed and presented. I especially enjoyed hearing about her own work. Also, the in-class assignment on quantitative ethnobotany worked well and was interesting.All topics were well done.This was a great class, my best this semester."

    "The final project--at the end of the course, I had a much better sense of how to approach a project, but our final projects were due November 19, so I could not use most of the knowledge I gained through the class in my final project, and I was unhappy with the final product I turned in.",
    "I thought the lectures were dry and wished for more exercises on plant identification.",
    "More attention to the actual body of ethnobotanical knowledge. I would have liked at least 4-5 weeks on plant families and visits to the Marsh Botanical Garden, for example. 3 hours is a long time to sit and discuss from a power point and readings.",
    "The seminar portion of the class was a struggle at first. I had trouble finding the right ways to comment on readings and to draw out meaningful conclusions to discuss. This improved with time though. I would say more clear directions regarding the readings and discussions could help. Also, maybe assigning one reading to each student to lead the discussion would help. Even having each student write a short paragraph about one reading to discuss.Discussion facilitation seemed to improve throughout the term."

Now, I see some awareness and understanding of the human relationship to plants as essential for work as a botanist. I wish there were more advanced follow up courses related to plants and people.I would say this course is foundational and integral to my program."

    "Take it! A great course, and the readings were excellent. Many of my friends in other classes asked for certain readings after I discussed them outside of class. The topics are universally accessible (you don't have to be a botanist) and after the course you will feel like you know what researchers do. The instructor has done fascinating and meaningful work and is a very socially-minded scientist. She utilizes many opportunities to share this exciting work with her students. She is approachable and very responsive to student inquiries. I always looked forward to this class."
