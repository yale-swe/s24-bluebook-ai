   "comments": [
    "The course is a very straightforward introduction to the Portuguese language and Brazilian culture, especially if you know Spanish. Selma Vital is the most friendly and optimistic person I know. She was very enthusiastic about the material and about the portuguese department, you will fall in love with the language and your classmates. I'm convinced this course is the most fun course at Yale. Great way to start the morning and a great way to meet people from all grades. The textbook is a little uninspired though it's Yale's so they have to use it.",
    "Perfect fifth class. It's fun, very easy if you speak Spanish, and the teacher is really enthusiastic about teaching us her language and culture.",
    "Class meets everyday like most language classes do. There are five exams and the lowest score gets dropped. There are also in class compositions which students can take home and edit. Students also turn in one weekly homework assignment on the weekend. There is one oral exam and one oral presentation about your life. This class covers basic grammar and vocabulary. Selma is a lot of fun and she is super approachable. The grading is pretty relaxed. She is more focused on helping you improve and learn than on your grades. If you are someone who needs alot of repetition and grunt work to learn vocabulary and grammar, you will need give yourself more work since she does not give that much grunt work.",
    "Good class, definitely a lot lower stress than Spanish or Italian here. If you speak spanish that helps a lot, but I don't and it was still fine.",
    "I would recommend Selma because she made class fun. It is what you expect from an L1 language, perhaps easier than most, and moves at an appropriate pace.",
    "I recommend portuguese to everyone! Lots of fun and becoming more and more useful in today's world.",
    "This course is frustrating at times, because of the horribly-written textbook and slow pace of the class. But Selma is a wonderful professor -- she puts all of herself into teaching and really cares about her students. Since it was her first semester she was sometimes a little insecure or unsure, but I think with time she'll become more confident. It's a very relaxed way to begin each day with a pretty light workload. If you want to take 110 definitely take it with Selma!",
    "Definitely take it, so much fun, but you learn a lot",
    "The workload is very small compared to other Romance languages taught at Yale. Unfortunately, that means you learn much less than you might want to each term.",
    "Take the class with Selma, you won't regret it. It's not hard, but you learn a lot! I'm going to take L2 and I want it with her. Copy and pasting from previous answers:Strengths: extremely kind, caring, and fun. She was very good at making Portuguese a very enjoyable language to learn. She's Brazilian so learning about the culture, slang, economy was very interesting and part of everyday class.Weaknesses: not any I can think of. She wasn't very strict, but I don't find that an issue. She was awesome.Great course. In fact, fantastic. I really enjoyed the course. I looked forward to it everyday I went to it. I had to be late 3 times a week because I hadtwo classes in Science Hill with Portuguese smack in between them. My professor, Selma Vital, was okay with it---which I found awesome because being late is certainly not okay in such a small class -- around 20-30 students. Other than being an amazing, warm and caring person, Selma's teaching allowed me to start speaking portuguese well faster than I had imagined. I do have an unfair advantage in that I speak spanish---but with her advice and suggestions I started improving quickly.",
    "No.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student if they are actually passionate about learning portuguese, not just filling a easy distribution requirement because they already know Spanish. The students themselves have to make a huge effort to speak portuguese and auto-correct some of our errors that come from Spanish and so it is inspiring to have classmates that are passionate about learning the language and come to class dedicated."
