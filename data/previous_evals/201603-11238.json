    "I learned multivariable calculus.",
    "It provided a great basis for multivariable calculus.",
    "I learned a lot of information from this course that was completely unfamiliar to me before. I also learned that it is okay and important to seek help through peer tutors, office hours, etc.",
    "I became proficient in 3D vector geometry, and I learned how to use calculus on functions with more than one variable. I also learned how to perform special integrals and integrating on a line or a surface rather than just over the x-axis.",
    "I gained a greater understanding of calculus and learned to generalize single variable calculus into more than one variable. These skills will be helpful in future math classes, and have already been helping me in physics.",
    "I learned how to independently learn math skills better and how to work better with my teacher to learn thoroughly.",
    "Learned a lot about multi variable calculus",
    "I learned about multivariable calculus.",
    "A good foundation in multivariable calculus.",
    "I expanded my math knowledge and learned a variety of multi variable calc topics, like triple integral a, FTLI, Greens theorem, and more.",
    "Difficult 3D problems are not as hard now.",
    "A working knowledge of vector calculus was the primary skill developed in this course. Math 120 provides a pretty good understanding of the material; although the theory isn't covered, it's a comprehensive treatment of the skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class was well-organized, and the overall structure was well-designed. It feels hard to critique because it's math, and as long as you get taught the theorems clearly in class, I'm not sure how it can be bad.",
    "Things are often taught differently between instructors, made collaboration and questions sometimes confusing. Would be nice if there was a set way decided as the best to teach or they at least knew all the different methods that were being taught. Overall though, taught everything clearly and were clearly very experienced.",
    "The strength of this course is that they provide many outside resources for you to turn to for help. The problem sets help you learn the material and the tests are hard but not unreasonable. The weakness is that the class moves very very fast and some of the graduate students are weaker instructors than others.",
    "The practice exams are not represented of the actual tests. The problem done in class were also not very reflective of the material we were tested on.",
    "I think the material progresses in a good way and was explained well, However, I think it would have been more helpful for teachers to point out when the earlier material comes up again in a more complicated way rather than letting us figure it out. Also I believe it would have been helpful to explain the use of line and surface integrals in physics so we understand conceptually and know why we're doing it.",
    "The course progresses logically and teaches all necessary components of multivariable calculus. However, it is very skill based (not at all proof based). This is alright when applying the skills, but leaves a knowledge gap if you hope to understand why formulas work. It can also be confusing to someone seeing the material for the first time. It would be nice if the class could go more into the why's, and not just the what's.",
    "I think it really pushes students to explore math on their own. Since the teachers are graduate students, it promotes a collaboration between student and teacher.",
    "Strengths include being incredibly well organized as a class, especially since so many students take it. Weaknesses include having a very arbitrary grading rubric on tests.",
    "It focuses far too much on test grades, valuing the psets more would lead to more student engagement.",
    "The instructors are wonderful grad students, and the review sessions are great. I think the course is structured very well; all instructors have office hours, and there are student tutors. it's just up to the students to make the effort to study and take advantage of all that's offered.",
    "Due to the large number of people in the class, there is a slight emphasis on efficiency. Otherwise, good course.",
    "The class was good at covering the field in general and my instructor's teaching was excellent. It would have been nice to do at least some proof-based coverage of the material or to discuss the applications more, since the relevance of some of the course material isn't immediately obvious."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "So basically, if you have to take Math 120 there are no two ways about it. Few people really relish the class (the concepts are very hard to visualize), but at least it's well-organized and taught, and you can succeed if you try.",
    "If you plan to do anything math related, you need this course. Overall it isn't that bad, put in the hours studying, the psets are quick, and you'll do fine. Go to the review sessions too.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student looking for a challenge and willing to put in the effort to do well. Do not take this class if you are not planning on really applying yourself to learning the material.",
    "I would only recommend it if it was necessary to their major. Other than that, I would say to avoid this headache. I liked math and thought I was decent at it before taking this course but the way it was implemented made me have second doubts.",
    "I was scared to take this class with no previous experience in multivariable. I ended up deciding to take 120 instead of 115 because I didn't think another year of BC calculus would prepare me any more. This turned out to be a good decision. None of the concepts in 120 are that confusing, it's just easy to make mathematical errors. I would recommend taking this class if you are somewhat interested in math. Don't be scared by this class.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want a decent base of knowledge for other classes, or are interested in broadening your knowledge of calculus. However, your section really influences your experience, and be wary if you have never been exposed to this material before - you might have to work harder than some of your classmates.",
    "Yes, but only if the student has a genuine interest in mathematics and is willing to put in the effort to clarify the content taught in class for themselves.",
    "Yes, if you study you will do well. Just be careful on tests in making small arithmetic errors.",
    "I would recommend it to another student only if they need it for their major. Otherwise, I would not recommend it because of the high level of difficulty and low amount of practical knowledge gained.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who have taken Calc BC. There is a large support system if you are struggling in the course.",
    "Yes. See other answers for reasons.",
    "Just a regular class. It's not mind blowing, but it will give you a basis in 3D calculus.",
    "If it's required for your major or if you just need to take some kind of math and have taken the preceding calculus courses, Math 120 is fine. Make sure that you get a good instructor -- I was lucky to have one -- and take the final exam seriously. Even though you don't discuss the theory behind it, some of the math that's covered is interesting. Don't just take it for fun, but if you're required to take it, you'll get something out of it."
