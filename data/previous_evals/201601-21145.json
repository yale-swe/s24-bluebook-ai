    "A challenging seminar for students with a political theory background. If you are interested in migration issues, this is a very worthwhile course. The assessment is on the heavy side, with two essays (2500\/ 5000 wds) and one exam.",
    "A very solid seminar. Covered a lot of topics in migration theory, looking at it from a variety of theoretical perspectives. Somewhat more theoretical than I initially expected, but I got a lot out of the course and learned a lot. Would definitely recommend for PLSC or people interested in migration issues.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anybody looking for an understanding of how academic discourse or legal philosophy are applied. It does a great job of placing you in the world of argument and helps you find your way through it to develop your own opinion and learn how to best articulate it. It also provides an opportunity to present your work like an academic-- through academic papers and an academic-style presentation. The professor also arranges and invites students to events that supplement the material and help show the real-world aspects of the work we do in class. This class is really great for anybody looking to get a sense of what it feels like to be an academic, a legal philosopher (where it's actually relevant and not just discussing ideas of old, dead western men), or an informed activist. It also has a very reasonable work load."
