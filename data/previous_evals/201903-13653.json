    "Some industry knowledge about the US credits (carbon, wetland)",
    "I put a lot of work into the assignments but I didn't come away feeling that I had learned much.",
    "More insights on how eco system services can be used as an investment product to harness value for investors, while at the same time adding value to the eco sphere.",
    "Exposure to alternative financial instruments",
    "Present Value analysis",
    "I was able to learn how to structure an investment deal that considers ecosystem services. I was able to understand risk modelling and decision making in ecosystem finance. I was exposed to new markets such as sustainable agriculture, easements and wetland banks.",
    "Ecosystem finance",
    "Some knowledge about the ecosystem marketplace that we have been discussion while working in my previous organization.",
    "Finance concept and application",
    "I learned how natural resources are thought of in the finance sector. I gained a broad appreciation for the techniques used in the finance sector to conserve or use natural resources. I also learned how \"niche\" this approach is.",
    "Developed a better method of scenario management for environmental finance. Good introduction to the concept of credit banking",
    "I am honestly not quite sure. The class was about 6.5 weeks in reality and had two assignments - a one-page paper we were given with little guidance - and a very comprehensive evaluation that involved applying skills that were taught in Forest Finance, primarily. The lectures were extremely dry and hard to follow. They also did not give any insight that was helpful for the assignments. If I didn't take Forest Finance, I would have been totally lost. I would have preferred 15 weeks of Forest Finance.",
    "A general understanding of the markets related to financing conservation, mitigation and restoration projects.",
    "Understanding of wetland credits primarily, but a myriad of other financial incentives as well.",
    "Knowledge on ecosystem service and financial modeling. The syllabus does an excellent job describing the content of the course, and the lectures deliver the content in a clear and cohesive manner."

   "comments": [
    "achieve my min expectations",
    "i was expecting more from this class",
    "I did not know a lot about this topic going into the class. I found it strange that the instructors refused to engage in any discussion around ethics and the impact of investment projects on local communities .",
    "Very well.",
    "Far below expectations",
    "very poorly; felt like a unintentional sales pitch of current concepts and instruments in finance rather than the details of their processes, institutions, strategies, etc.",
    "It really met my expectations. When I joined Yale, one of the take aways i expected was related to Ecosystem Finance. The course was able to point me toward this direction.",
    "Yes",
    "To some extent as I already took forest finance.",
    "Average",
    "Somewhat. I think the course went too broad at times even though I generally appreciated the content.",
    "Forest Finance was much better than Ecosystem Finance - perhaps because the instructors were on more sure footing? Or perhaps because the subject matter itself is more fully fleshed out. Aside from wetland banking, I didn't learn about many other ecosystem service financing options. I think we could have focused more on the possible programs coming down the pipeline rather than the limited data we have from existing pilot programs.",
    "They did not, unfortunately. I think Forest Finance was a decent course because Deborah Spalding's highly effective lectures. I do not feel bad saying this - because I know Dominick is a very successful person - but he has no business instructing students at Yale. He took over in the second class and the quality of the course diminished. He is disengaged, quite boring, and the lectures were not well structured.",
    "OK, but I could have used more applied work and case studies because sometimes it feels very superficial.",
    "Yes!",
    "very consistent with expectations!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths: it can be hlepful for people to understand how US government build a system and use the power of market to protect the enviroment weaknesses: lack of detailed financial modelling. if the prof can teach hand by hand about financial modelling that would be better.",
    "the course design was very abstract",
    "The lectures didn't help with the assignments. I felt like I was just teaching myself. The guest speakers were the strongest aspect of the class.",
    "The course as broad and well taught. The instructors did provide sufficient additional notes for us to review incase we wanted to. The course can be improved by adopting the SOM policy of no laptops in class. This is something the management of the school of forestry needs to look into. The sound of typing from laptops is distracting.",
    "More assignments with clear quantitative elements would be helpful as practice prior to the final project.",
    "The material was poorly presented and there was little depth to what we were learning. There was seemingly a poor understanding of the underlying science behind much of what was being presented in class. We were not given the skills to actually judge these markets independently.",
    "We never received our first assignment grade, so I fell it was hard to triangulate our work product.",
    "very poorly organized\/prepared slides and ineffective, uncaptivating lectures; rather shallow material and unclear of what level of engagement is expected from students",
    "I think the course would benefit from how actual valuation can be done. What tools and techniques exist. How do they quantify ES and how do these these end up being used in the financing aspect. There was so much focus on US markets and less of international market environments. A balance of these perspectives would be useful in future classes.",
    "More structured",
    "I guess a bit more exercise on valuation or calculation is a must when it comes to finance and marketplace.",
    "Need more conceptual alignment",
    "Strengths: Interesting topic and professors with practical skill sets Weaknesses: The class was too broad and cursory. I would prefer to go a bit more specific into a few techniques. There was not enough support on the techniques for finishing the final project and I would have liked more class time devoted to that.",
    "No feedback on feedback on assigned work. Practitioners were great - they could have been briefed a little bit about what the class had already covered.",
    "The strength of this class was the spreadsheet skills taught in Forest Finance. Ecosystem Finance was honestly the worst class I've taken in junior college, university, post-grad and grad school. Very few actual skills were taught and Dominick seems to have a hard time conveying concepts that were learnable from the readings. There was no connection to the readings though, or accountability to the material, so this is moot. The only assignments were the one-page paper we were given with very little actual instruction on how to \"assess deals\" and the comprehensive evaluation which would have been almost impossible for anyone who didn't take Forest Finance. The class basically ended for me after Forest Finance because nothing new was taught that could be applied to the assignments in a meaningful way. I honestly needed these skills for my career aspirations and find myself now wondering if I need to take another finance course at another institution after graduation. I just honestly don't think Dominick should be instructing the class. He is intensely boring and disengaged. I wondered more than once if he wanted to be there or if his presence just bolstered his resume in a way that would benefit his private business.",
    "Strengths: interesting content, instructors' real work experience is a value-add. Weaknesses: the midterm assignment didn't really provide anything. Maybe it would be better to replace it with mini-assignments related to the guest speakers' cases. Generally the contest seems very distant from real cases.",
    "Lecture material dry, could have used with balance of calculations for those who didnt take forest finance",
    "Not Applicable. Course was great! Maybe consider reintegrating the two courses (forest and ecosystem finance). I can imagine the second half was not fun for folks that didnt take the first half."

    "if you are interested at impact investing, it will be quite helpful",

    "The lectures didn't really help me to understand the assignments. The workload was not excessive, but we were ill-prepared for the assignments and never given any real direction. Also, we didn't get any feedback on our work during the course, so it was impossible to know if we were on the right track or needed to improve in some areas. I did not feel that the instructors were investing in our learning. I would not recommend this course.",

    "course mostly based on guest lectures and presentations. it is more of a presentation series than a course, which is unsettling for those trying to come up with a comprehensive view of ecosystem finance",
