If instruction was more participatory (moving away from a lecture format into more discussion) or interactive (recordings of shows or bringing artists in to perform) the class would be more engaging and successful. This is not a critique on the teacher at all who I believe to be a kind, intelligent, competent and wonderful human and educator. The format of the class was the difficulty.",

I know that most of the details of dates and names will leave my memory in the next month, but I will still retain the patterns and the longer narrative of how theatre has changed over time. Not remembering the names and dates doesn't bother me because I know I can always look it up online, which is the norm nowadays. That being said, because we live in a society that can get information from searching it online, having to memorize a lot of dates and names felt frustrating and not the most helpful use of my time. I say this knowing that I can because my department doesn't ask me to know all these information by heart. I think an open notes final would help alleviate stress to memorize by rote. People would be able to focus more on trends and patterns and have critical discussion about the history of theatre."

    "Things that work: - Paul creates really interesting, organized, in-depth lectures. I am grateful that I saved most of the PowerPoints so I always can return to this material in future. - I appreciate the gargantuan effort and intellect it requires to teach the immense volume of information covered in the course. Things that could be improved upon: - The format and expectations of the class are difficult for non-academic theatre students who best thrive by putting things into practice (rather than memorizing volumes of information for tests.) - Dropping one of the tests in favor of an interactive project - like actors performing a melodrama, or playwrights writing in a particular genre, design students designing for a specific era would be a better use of our skills. And then we would at least retrain in-depth knowledge on at least one area of study. - Rethinking what this course can and should accomplish for students. - Opening up the canon to consider more women artists, artists of color."
