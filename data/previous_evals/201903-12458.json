   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Applied work on human rights-related issues and insights from peers pursuing innovative projects.",
    "This class allowed me to explore a topic of personal interest and develop my own research methodology for studying it.",
    "The intellectual rigour and competence of this class was crucially disappointing and remedial. Many students felt entirely comfortable to not do any of the readings and still pose in spouting critical or presented-as-controversial opinions that were really just centrist regurgitation\/appraisal of authority. I felt my time incredibly wasted and I would not recommend the program or the class to a peer I consider intelligent. Jim and Paul are absolute sweethearts but Im afraid felt a little out of touch.",
    "Many more reflections on performance, agency, representation, journalism, protest, national identity, sovereignty, and migration. Sharpened my discussion and critique skills. Gained the most knowledge and insight from my peers' capstone projects.",
    "I learned how to discuss human rights at an advanced level.",
    "This is the capstone course for MAPHR. Every year's class and cohort must have a different experience, but this year we focused a lot on how to connect the personal and political, in my opinion; how to agitate for change in defense of human rights with humility and respect as well as fire and unabashed honesty. In a sense, in finishing the semester I feel that we are at the beginning of learning a set of skills necessary to navigate the world, not encapsulated by a syllabus or any assignment we did. To Jim and Paul I am so grateful for always facilitating conversation that challenged and supported us simultaneously, and to classmates for inspiring us to hope.",
    "A current events course for seniors in the program.",
    "This course taught me about how to design, plan, and carry out a large research project related to Human Rights. It also taught me a lot about peer review and how to engage in productive group conversation."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: -open-ended project and capacity for innovative academic work -learned a lot from peers' projects Weaknesses: -First part of the semester could have been more engaging. I understand that the course must include a formal academic component, but instead of discussing hypothetical case studies and readings, I would have prefered to learn about actual cases, to hear about Paul's research, and insights from Jim's years of clinical work. -Despite the peer review process and advising, I feel the capstone structure pushes students towards written assignments and reflection, rather than a focus on providing resources for actionable projects. -I don't think the seminar ran on time once the entire semester",
    "Strengths: the freedom to look at any topic that you are interested in Weaknesses: I think the reviews of other people's work could be better structured",
    "I think the course material that is covered in the first half is engaging and interesting. However, I wish we had narrowed our discussion more because we tried to cover too many questions in any given class and then we would get slightly off-topic or students would no longer engage which could be frustrating. In the second half of the class, I received good feedback that I later incorporated into my capstone. Both the professors and the students gave me a lot of guidance. Also, people's projects are just so cool so I enjoyed discussing them. Quite honestly, I think it can be overwhelming to have 16 people telling a student about their capstone in only 40 minutes. People gave rich feedback, but I felt like we didn't delve as deep as I would have liked. People's critiques were almost always respectful, but I think the class would have benefitted from a different format. For example, instead of 40-minute chunks for each project, another format could be: three students are assigned to one class (let's say presenter a, b, and c) but instead of each presenter only getting 40 minutes, presenter a, b, and c get the entire class period. The rest of the students would then be divided into groups of 5 or so and rotate among each presenter for 40 minutes at a time. So therefore, the discussions are smaller and more engaging, and each presenter gets two hours to discuss their project instead of 40 minutes. (Just one suggestion, but I think smaller groups would generally be more beneficial.)",
    "The real strength of this course comes in the second half of the semester when we go over each other's capstone projects and have the chance to see what everyone has been working on (since until then you really only know everyone's projects in passing). It's a great opportunity to learn about what human rights means to everyone individually and to learn about human rights issues you wouldn't have even dreamed about otherwise. The course could be improved by appealing to more than just the poli sci\/global affairs majors in the room. The whole point of the program is to enroll students across disciplines and interests and during the first half of the course when we're going over different human rights issues each week, it felt like class was largely a space where those in the room who knew political theory and terminology took up the majority of the space and those who didn't took a backseat. In a human rights program, it didn't make sense to me how during the week the president of the United States, who is at present white, called the opposition to his presidency a lynching that we did not discuss that at all. So much of our discussion was Eurocentric and American focused and I didn't feel like we reached the full breadth and depth of human rights in other areas of the world. The class could benefit more from focusing less on theory and opening up to new ideas and non-traditional non-global affairs centered perspectives.",
    "The format of the seminar was very unproductive and many students were quite bratty about the fact that the class was in the evening. Repetitive comments about how annoying the class time was or how burdensome it was for students were an eerie representation of how earnestly committed or dedicated these human rights students really are to the cause.",
    "Strengths: the peer review system, allowing everyone's project draft an equal amount of time and a chance to be reviewed by every scholar in the cohort. Allowing freedom for students to do creative capstones like plays, longform journalism, fictional stories, etc. Weaknesses: I hope in future years the course encourages psychological safety by establishing a culture of positive communication in the first class. We come from so many different backgrounds and discuss so many tough issues in this class, it's not easy to create a productive classroom. I feel that especially the first 3 weeks of discussion could have been designed and executed more effectively to prevent distress and drama. Breaking up into small groups was a good change. It's also very tough to have classes so long and late at night.",
    "I learned how to plan my senior independent research project and execute it.",
    "Less texts for a higher and more indepth level of engagement and conversation. Reviewing HMR NGO fact-finding methods would have been more helpful prior to senior year. Most students who needed those methods already acquired them from other courses.",
    "The strength of this course is that it allows seniors in the MAPHR program to spend a whole semester working on an independent project. It also brings the MAPHR class together one final time, and the course asks us to thoughtfully criticize and workshop one another's work throughout the course of the semester. This peer workshopping experience is helpful, and I believe done too infrequently in most Yale classrooms. One weakness of this course is that different students put in different amounts of time, energy, and respect into the classroom. At times, this seemed to inhibit developing a positive classroom environment."

    "It's a required component of the human rights program, so yeah, take it.",
    "Yes",
    "N\/A -- this course is a requirement for those in the MAPHR",
    "This course is required for students in the Human Rights Program and only open to them. You'll enjoy the second half of the course no matter what since you get to learn about each other's capstone projects. If you're really into political theory and discussions, then you'll love the first half of the course. If not, it will be a struggle to get through, especially if you're concerned about topics or groups that are on the fringe of human rights. It can be a struggle to get your opinion heard and respected in class if it doesn't fit into the traditional norm. I personally did not enjoy class as much as I thought I would which was a disappointment because I was really looking forward to this point in the program. Hopefully future versions of the class will evolve and become a space where everyone feels validated.",
    "Nope. Take an ER&M class instead.",
    "Yes, the human rights program has been pivotal to my experience at Yale.",
    "If you are in the program, the capstone is a great way to end the program.",
    "I would strongly recommend the MAPHR program to another student, and this course is an important and necessary part of that experience. I would advise students to put a lot of time into developing a project idea that they are excited about and eager to discuss with others."
