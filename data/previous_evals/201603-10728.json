   "comments": [
    "It was the best thing I've ever done for my writing.",
    "I developed strong literary analysis skills and learned about the modern essay. I became a stronger writer and am able to construct complex and detailed arguments much better than before.",
    "The English 120 curriculum emphasizes close reading of example texts in order to learn the strategies appropriate for crafting a personal essay. Throughout the course of the semester, I gained a toolset for this type of creative nonfiction writing by directly studying the masters of the genre. Thus, I have done more than improve my basic writing skills. I have gained skills which are specific to the personal essay genre. For instance, I am better equipped to \"do my thinking on the page\" or present multiple perspectives on a single subject, to transition between seemingly unrelated ideas, and to introduce other voices besides my own to my essay. Each of these skills was relatively new to me upon entering the class.",
    "This course taught me to use the voice inside myself to achieve great writing. Through readings, workshops, and feedback from my professor, I watched my writing improve. I even found myself enjoying the process of essay construction, and now I feel much more capable using the essay as a medium of expression.",
    "My writing was incredibly pushed by this course. I really found my own voice and how to effectively employ it.",
    "Insight on analyzing and crafting my own creative nonfiction essays. Practice peer reviewing and using professional examples to improve my essays. Good introduction to seminar-style learning.",
    "I believe I've grown as a writer and reader, and gained valuable insights into the writing process.",
    "- improved writing clarity, ease of writing - feel overall more articulate and verbally adept"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I liked the structure of the class with the course readings and discussions preceding the essay. More work shopping would be nice.",
    "The structure of this course gave me incredible opportunities to improve my writing that I have never received elsewhere. Namely, I loved that students were able to learn by reading the works of the masters of the personal essay genre, and then apply their learning by attempting to imitate this style. In the case of writing especially, I am the type of person who likes to learn by doing, so this class was perfect for me. I truly do not feel that the structure of this course could be improved; I enjoyed every step of the process, including reading the example texts, writing drafts, workshopping and peer editing, meeting with my professor to get feedback, and writing the final draft. I feel that each of these steps was entirely necessary to the success I had in the course. I feel that the timing of essay assignments was optimal as well.",
    "Strengths: the readings are wonderful and interesting to explore; helpful feedback from professor; great seminar environment with your peers; papers may help you overcome struggles\/unexamined feelings Weaknesses: ??? really can't find any -- course was done extremely well",
    "I think this class could be a little smaller to enable more intense discussion. But overall this class is very well run and I loved going line by line through the different texts and thinking through different writers' strategies. Shifra Sharlin was very generous with her time in office hours and developing my essays. I think the grading is very harsh sometimes but I also understand why it is set up like that.",
    "Strengths: used class time well, example essays wisely chosen, ample opportunity for questions and clarification, great feedback, communal learning experience but still received specialized care and attention.",
    "One strength is that this course forces aspiring writers to come to terms with their writing flaws, and essentially reconstruct their entire writing technique. I support this, but would recommend that it be made clearer to students in the beginning that initial essays and grades are expected to be, perhaps, less than ideal, and that students WILL improve over time in the course.",
    "- structured well, workload spaced out sensibly",
    "Strengths: frequent writing and revisions. Great reading list. Ample feedback, especially during workshops. Weaknesses: sometimes I felt the discussion was led a little too much by the students. I understand the desire for organic conversation, but at times it felt that everyone was making different points and not listening to each other. A bit of more concentrated guidance on the part of the instructor would have helped alleviate this"

   "comments": [
    "Take English 120. It will make you a better writer, and the readings are all short and excellent.",
    "ENGL120 is a classic Yale course and for good reason. It makes your writing way better and it's the kind of writing that will help you in your life. The grading is tough and you're doing a lot of writing (5 essays, with a draft and a final) but it isn't too terrible. The reading is interesting. Shifra is amazing. She is so caring and gives so much to her students. I spent hours with her and she was always so attentive and helpful.",
    "Yes. This is a great course for students that don't have time for long readings and who want to be able to write about whatever they want as long as it's loosely contained within the unit theme.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student, but especially if they were particularly interested in developing a more creative nonfiction writing style as opposed to the style in which academic and research papers are generally written. As a lover of literature, this was a dream class for me, especially because I was able to create my own pieces of writing as opposed to writing analyses of pieces by other authors.",
    "Every student should take ENGL 120! I found it enlightening as a student and as a human. The creativity allowed in papers means the class is what you make of itand you can make it extremely fun and constructive. I know my writing improved over the semester, and I also know that I feel more in-touch with myself, after constructing such personal, introspective essays.",
    "Yes- engaging reading material, manageable workload, helpful feedback on essays. Hard to get an A though, if that is a concern.",
    "Absolutely. It will change how you think about expressing your thoughts, particularly with regards to structure and voice. I looked forward to doing the readings each week. Take the course!",
    "Yes! My roommate is taking this course next semester because she saw how much I loved this course.",
    "Yes, great introduction to English at Yale. Definitely a lot of work, but visible improvement in writing is a great reward. Interesting alternative to more literature analysis type English courses. Very unique and rewarding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone aspiring to be a serious writer, and unafraid of challenging their own preconceptions of writing to do so.",
    "Absolutely. If you enjoy writing to any extent, this class will be what you make of it.",
    "English 120 makes you a better writer, mostly by forcing you to write frequently and revise often. It brought some of the joy of writing back for me and is a real relief from constant dry analytical essays. Don't be afraid to take it if you're not a freshman!"
