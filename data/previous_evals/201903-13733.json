   "comments": [
    "Learned about the energy situation in developing countries, how development can be measured, and possible solutions",
    "Deeper knowledge of the theory behind energy development, better idea of applications of indices and models",
    "I learned a lot about various perspectives of energy and development and how to critically think about these issues by reading scientific articles.",
    "I learned of the different topics at the intersection between energy and development, the technical and social challenges that current initiatives have faced and how to better measure questions of energy access in the context of development",
    "Sustainable development, Poverty and its definitions, energy access",
    "I learned about the philosophical underpinnings of human rights and development, and the health and climate impacts of energy and development.",
    "Learned about what poverty is, how we define and measure it, and the ways in which energy plays into poverty and human development. This class also taught me how to read different kinds of papers, whether they be philosophical, policy-based, or scientific. The class taught me how multi-dimensional and inter-disciplinary the question of energy and human development is, as well as the different ways we can begin to address it.",
    "Deepened my understanding of the issues associated with energy and development globally, especially in emerging economies.",
    "Understand how to think of poverty and its relationship with energy. Analysis of several development indicators, their pros and cons, and how access to energy can enhance them. Qualitative (and some quantitative, but very superficial) analysis of the climate-development conflict.",
    "This class was amazing. It really provided a comprehensive look at current literature and gave great background on development and where energy fits into measuring poverty and quality of life.",
    "As the course description says, this is a really useful course to think about the relationships between energy and development. It starts with first principles, thinking about what is development and what is poverty before going on to look at how energy is thought to relate to both. There is also extensive discussion about the relationship between energy, development and climate change, particularly in the area of clean cooking fuel. This course helped me to think through the somewhat counterintuitive relationship between clean cooking fuels and climate change, as well as the relationship between amount of energy used and level of development."

   "comments": [
    "Very well",
    "Leaned more theoretical than I expected but not overly so",
    "It aligned very well with my expectations.",
    "There was a lot of things I didn't expect to learn but that have been very useful, but I would have liked to learn more of implementation of energy access projects and not only of the underlying principles",
    "Extremely well",
    "This class definitely exceeded my expectations. I learned a lot about the topic and was able to engage in interesting and relevant in class discussions.",
    "I believe the material covered in this class goes much deeper in some certain topics than I expected. However, it does not cover as broad as I expected.",
    "It was very aligned to what I expected.",
    "Very well, and even better than expected.",
    "This course is as it was described - it aligned well with my expectations. Professor Rao sets clear learning objectives and makes sure to reiterate the main points from the last class at the beginning of the next."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths- very interesting topics, plenty of time for discussion, fair amount of work, good guest lectures. Weaknesses- expectations were not communicated clearly at all, time not managed well sometimes, did not have any grades at all until December",
    "Again more academically based than I was expecting, maybe balance more with guest speakers\/in the field perspectives in the future",
    "I really enjoyed the seminar style of the class, it made me critically think about our topics and have a discussion with my peers and the professor. However, I do think that some of the deadlines and expectations for the projects\/class were not very clear. I wish the instructions for our problem set and final project were better.",
    "The readings were sometimes hard to access, but in the lectures usually the technical questions were clarified",
    "More guest lectures",
    "Class discussions were very interesting and it was helpful that Prof. Rao was an expert on the subject of the course. The problem set was very technical, and was difficult to complete by myself.",
    "Strengths the layout of the class is very interactive. It is set up like a seminar, so we are all encouraged to share our thoughts. The class setting is very inclusive and the professor does a good job at provoking us in our ways of thinking. Weaknesses I think that the course covers a lot of material, and sometimes we had to brush over some material far too quickly. Maybe focusing on several of the topics instead of trying to do all of it could be beneficial.",
    "I believe this course can cover more and broader range of topics but I also believe it is important for them to go as deep as possible.",
    "Strengths - Very interactive Weakness - too many readings",
    "It feels like a graduate level course in the complex nature of the problem analyzed and the reflective exercises done in each class meeting. Perhaps change the nature of the weekly readings and reflection to a more targeted analysis of the specific issues and concepts discussed.",
    "The content for this course is excellent and Professor Rao clearly cares about students understanding the content. One comment on the problem set - it would be really helpful to know how to use R before taking this course or to have a bit more guidance for absolute beginners."

   "comments": [
    "Ask lots of questions about because instructions are not at all clear, attend every lecture, complete the readings prior to class",
    "Keep an open mind and do all the readings.",
    "Come with questions that can be worked out during the course and that can guide the work in assignments and the final paper",
    "Great for students with a keen focus on developing countries",
    "It would be helpful to take a class on R or data analysis before this course.",
    "The readings covered in this class are very interesting and helpful. I definitely learned a lot from them.",
    "Read every week!",
    "It requires a lot of time and workload to fully engage in this class. It covers some really interesting topics and opens your mind to analysis of energy poverty issues on many fronts, so it is advisable that you prepare to work a lot to really profit from the class and from Prof. Rao's knowledge.",
    "This is an excellent class - I would thoroughly recommend it if you have an interest in development and climate change. You will learn both content and skills through this course. If you haven't used R much, I would recommend taking an intro workshop if one is available through CSSSI so as to make the problem set more straightforward."
