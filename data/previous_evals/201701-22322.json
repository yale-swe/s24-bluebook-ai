   "comments": [
    "Strengths: This class had an ideal workload for graduate students: one film to watch and two or three essays to read per week; one 5-10-minute presentation on an assigned text; and one final paper. I felt like I had enough time to do a good job on each of these requirements. The films were great, the readings were excellent, and Brigitte and Regina are fabulous lecturers and discussion leaders. Weaknesses\/Suggestions for Improvement: I wish we would have spent more time discussing the readings because they were often very good, and rather challenging. It would have been more useful for the graduate students to present on the readings and pose discussion questions about them, rather than presenting on readings that the rest of the class didn't do. I love European and Asian film, but it would have been nice to have a Hollywood film or two, something that deviates from what we typically think of as \"art cinema.\" Brigitte kept saying that she wanted the undergraduates to talk more--perhaps she could have called on them individually, or asked them to read some of the responses they posted to Canvas.",
    "Readings are very helpful."

    "Of course I would recommend this class. Many of the FMS admits sat in on a course section, and they all accepted their offers. And Brigitte and Regina talked to them each individually after class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student."
