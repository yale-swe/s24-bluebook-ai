    "This is a machine shop class. There are no outside assignments or readings and the workload just requires you to show up to the shop every week to work on building your little model steam engine. The class teaches you how to use milling equipment, lathes, and a CNC machine, as well as other tools around the shop. You may think that building the steam engine is just playing around or building a toy, but the value in the class is learning how to operate the equipment safely and to machine parts to tight tolerances. I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about machining or tinkering in general.",
    "Take it.",
    "Absolutely, best kept secret at Yale. Wished I found out about it earlier in my college career.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn how to build things. Also take it if you want to understand how things are made. Also take it if you like hanging out for four hours once a week with great people and a great teacher."

   "comments": [
    "The course is not related to my discipline. I was interested in learning about machining and took it as sort of an extracurricular experience.",
    "Yes, proficiency in machining is key to instrument design and will contribute to research.",
    "As a mechanical engineer, learning about shop technique and the tools of the trade was indispensable. Even if I never use these tools again, I will have a much better understanding of how parts get made and how to design manufacturer friendly parts.",
    "Great knowledge gain."
