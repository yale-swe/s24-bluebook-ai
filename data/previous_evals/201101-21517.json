    "This is a course where you read a lot of papers about South Africa and then go there to see the stuff in person. Though some of the student lectures were a bit dry, I would recommend this course to G&G majors.",
    "Deciding to take this class or not is an easy decision. If you are a G&G major available to go on the field trip, you should take this class. No matter the destination, the field trip will be amazing! I would be hesitant to recommend this class to a student who will not be attending the field trip.",
    "G&G 370 is a must-take for upper level geology majors. The course covers different topics in Earth history\/geology through the lens of the destination of the department field trip \u0096 in 2011, to South Africa. The tripwill certainly be amazing, but I also really enjoyed the class. Dave gave great overview lectures on different South African geological features that reveal some important event in Earth history (for example, origin of plate tectonics, origin of life, Snowball Earth, Ediacaran explosion, etc). We then read 2-3 articles on which we were quizzed weekly (study because this year your performance determined your $$ contribution), and then the grad students gave presentations. If you\u0092re willing to put in the work and want to go someplace amazing with the geology department, take this class!",
    "went through various geological features of South Africa. I would recommend it to anyone interested in Geology. It is a good chance to see many of the students and various aspects of geology."
