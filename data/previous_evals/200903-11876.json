    "Do it if you know next to nothing in French. It's only a bit harder than L1. And it's an L2 credit!",
    "The class is a decent amount of work because it meets everyday, but with Madame Boyce it's easily doable. The grading system in this class also favors the student if you just put effort into your work and go to class.",
    "Yes I would because it is good to have the class everday and you really connect with your professor. It was a fun class and I learned alot.",
    "It's definitely a good class to take, especially since you have to fulfill a language requirement, but even just to learn French, I'd say it's very helpful.",
    "If you are taking this course, it is most likely for your language requirement."
