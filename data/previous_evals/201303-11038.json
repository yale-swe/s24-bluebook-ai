   "comments": [
    "Of all MCDB labs, this is not bad at all.",
    "ABSOLUTELY take this lab! You will learn so much, and do the coolest hands on neurobio experiments!",
    "The labs tend to run on the long side, but I thought that most of the activities were interesting. The methodology used gets kind of repetitive, but if you'll get very comfortable with electrophysiology. The grading is straightforward and it's not too much time commitment other than the fact the labs often run until 6:00pm. It was one of the more fun labs I've taken at Yale, and it supplemented the lectures nicely.",
    "A wonderful supplement to the lecture! The workload isn't bad, but make sure that you understand what is expected of you for the lab reports ahead of time. They aren't difficult, but be sure to hit all the points they want you to hit.",
    "You are probably taking this class because you are taking the lecture and need a bio lab... Regardless, I think it is a good choice. I liked it and I don't usually like lab classes, especially at Yale. It is a good lab even independent of the lecture.",
    "While it's good as far as bio labs at Yale go, these labs were excruciatingly long. There was so much time devoted to pre-lab lecture and watching the professors demonstrate lab set ups before we even got a chance to get started on our own experimentation (I'd say 1.5 to 2 hours of waiting, on average). There aren't lab reports every week, but be awarethat you don't want to do four weeks' worth of lab write ups in the night before they're due. Also, I hope you know how to use an oscilloscope because this lab is basically electrophysiology, not neurobiology."
