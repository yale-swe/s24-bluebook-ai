   "comments": [
    "Spanish 140 is a very useful course. Its structure is similar to Spanish 130. It really helped me improve and there was an emphasis on grammar. I would recommend this class.",
    "A comprehensive Spanish course covering grammar and form of The Spanish language. A very challenging look at the Spanish language. I would recommend it to anyone looking to pursue the language.",
    "Span 140 is, not surprisingly, a pretty basic continuation of 130. Your grammar becomes fine-tuned, your speaking skills improve vastly, and you don't have to write nearly as much. Honestly, this was my favorite class. Juan Pablo is an incredibly wonderful professor, and if you have the opportunity to take any class with him, do it!",
    "I doubt anyone would take Spanish 140 if they didn't have to but you learn a lot of grammar which is fine.",
    "I thought SPAN 140 would be a killer class (partially because I'm not great with languages) but I found this course to be balanced enough to make succeeding possible. DEFINITELY take it with Juan Pablo if he teaches it again - he's fun, charming, and really patient with the class.",
    "I would recommend Span 140 to another student. The class is very interactive and a fun way to learn spanish. There is definitely a strong emphasis on grammar and vocabulary but the reading and movies make it enjoyable."
