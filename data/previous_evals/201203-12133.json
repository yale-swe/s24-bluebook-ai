   "comments": [
    "Don't take this class unless you have to.",
    "Long lectures, short problem sets, and then a 20 page paper and a final that seem to come out of nowhere.",
    "I would not recommend this class as an elective or as a general interest class. The class did not have a heavy workout, but was not extremely insightful into methods of air pollution control. If you are merely interested in the subject, this class will teach you about air pollution control but you would also be able to learn on your own. The addition of a design project would help remedy this.",
    "Great class.",
    "You probably have to take this class if you are reading this so you don't have much of a choice but Professor Khalil is a really nice guy and if you put time into the problem sets and understanding the material you will do well. Lectures can be a bit dull but you will learn a lot about controlling air pollutants.",
    "Take it. You will have a working knowledge of how air pollution is managed without too much work.",
    "Take it if you have to or as an elective, but if its not relevant to your major its probably a waste of time",
    "The class provides an overview of the different technologies used to eliminate different kinds of air pollution. Class only met once a week for two hours, which was nice, and the workload just consisted of weekly psets, a midterm, a final, and a 20-page paper. Having both a paper and a final kinda sucked, but the psets were pretty straightforward and the midterm was multiple choice, which was nice. Overall a relatively easy engineering course with interesting subject material if you have any interest in environmental stuff.",
    "I dont know what to think about this major anymore at yale. Terrible.",
    "The class was an interesting look at air pollution, and not especially heavy on the chemistry (nothing beyond basic stoichiometry). The problem sets are taken directly from the book and not especially difficult, though they will prove tedious if you dislike doing unit conversions. The lectures are well done and interesting, though entirely unnecessary for the problem sets. You are allowed a page of notes on both the midterm and final, which served to make them both fair and marginal in difficulty. Note that the class has both a final and a final paper, and the professor is not especially clear as to his expectations for it. If you are an engineering student, you will find this a welcome respite from more quantitatively demanding courses; and if not, the math should not prove an insurmountable obstacle. I recommend taking this regardless of background, particularly if you have an interest in the environment and related issues."
