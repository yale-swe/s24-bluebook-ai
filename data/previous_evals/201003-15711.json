    "Take it.",
    "A lot of fun, a little challenging toward the end. Helps A LOT if you can already read music, and don't think it will be too easy. Rewarding class.",
    "It is a good introduction to the fundamentals of music. Some of the students have experience playing instruments, but not much knowledge of theory. It starts simple but eventually, you get to some nontrivial things. I enjoyed it.",
    "It's a really good class. Even if you have a musical background, you'll learn a LOT -- I already knew the basics of major and minor scales and even triads, but I came out with lots of new skills. Learning to harmonize is one of the coolest things I got out of this class, and the performances teach you that you can sing even if you never thought you could! One warning though: I intended this to be my fun and relaxing fifth class, which it mostly was, except that there was a TON of homework. I spent at least four to six hours per week doing worksheets. I think it was worth it in the end, since it really strengthened my skills, but at the time it was definitely a pain.",
    "Yes, but only if you've had some sort of music background - otherwise, it can be a challenging course for someone with absolutely zero background.",
    "Yes, take it if you're interested in learning more about the theory in the class.",
    "This class is probably most rewarding if you have studied an instrument before, but lack understanding of the basic forms and rules that make up music. Topics and intensity apparently vary by professor, so shop around and see who seems the most engaging\/to be pushing the hardest, otherwise, the work and classes can be a bit tedious. Still, very effective for teaching the sense behind music.",
    "This course is the most basic music theory class that Yale offers, intended for those with no experience in music. There's a consistent amount of work for this class, and you basically have an assignment due at every lecture, but it's effective in giving you a good foundation in music theory, and if you've never been instructed in theory before, it's definitely worthwhile to check out this class.",
    "Definitely. Not too much work and you learn a lot if you haven't taken formal music theory before."
