   "comments": [
    "If you get into this class, you should take it. You might find it disconcerting that the final is worth 50% of your grade, and that you don't actually get grades on your papers during the semester. But it is an amazing class. It is what a history seminar should be. People engage in the readings and can discuss them in an informed manner. Donald Kagan is wonderful, and I can not recommend enough that you go to his office hours. I feel like I learned so much.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. The classics\/philosophy stuff was kind of difficult coming from a straight history background but it was so interesting and fun from a military history standpoint. Plus, Kagan is great. take this class!",
    "Yes! Yes! Yes! A hundred times yes! Prof. Kagan is the best professor at Yale - his knowledge of the material and the way he brings it alive is unparalleled. People wonder why to study history (in particular Ancient Greek history), but spend one day with Kagan and you'll understand. This is simply not a class to be missed. But only take it if you're going to do the work - the class only succeeds if everyone participates and brings their ideas to the table.",
    "This is Kagan's premiere class. It is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. The subject matter is cool, fun, and more relevant to today's world than any political science class. Kagan is simply fantastic - he is funny, loves his students, and draws parallels from the Peloponnesian War to modern times. He is also simply brilliant, and this manifests itself not only in class but in his books.Although there is a ton of reading, it is very enjoyable. This is a class to make room for the reading. Thucydides, Plutarch, and Kagan's books are all good reads (much better than reading in other history classes).",
    "Professor Kagan is the best professor I have had at Yale and I would highly recommend any class with him. His ability as a historian is well known, but he compliments this with a remarkable ability to lead a discussion and a seemingly genuine interest in both what his students have to say and in his students as individuals. Working with him has been a privilege and has justified my decision to come to Yale.Furthermore, Thucydides is an extremely important work of history, and I would argue that you do not understand Thucydides until you've read Kagan's commentary on it. The one thing that I would add (and only hesitantly, since everything else about this class more than makes up for it) is that some of the students in the class seemed slightly less engaged than last semester (in Spartan Hegemony). I suspect that because this class is the best known out of Kagan's seminars, there tends to be more students who are there because of the reputation rather than out of a particular interest in Greek history. Even so, I'd argue that the reason it's the best known is because the reading (primary and secondary) for this class is so interesting and because the Peloponnesian War is what Kagan knows best.In short, take it!",
    "Yes. A seminar with Professor Kagan is worth the price of a semester's tuition. And Thucydides will teach you lessons that will be \"a possession for all time.\"",
    "Life-changing? Maybe not. One of the most rewarding intellectual experiences you could ever have at Yale? Probably. Kagan lives up to all the hype, really making the subject come alive. My only gripe is that the IDs on the final were overly obscure, but, compared to all the benefits this class offers to someone who truly wants to learn to think like a historian, that's relatively trifling.",
    "This was a very good seminar. I would not go so far as claiming that it was life-changing, as others might say, but then again, thats a lot to expect from a class. It was useful in providing a different perspective on analyzing history. Kagan's teaching is legendary and I am very grateful to have had a chance to learn from him. The ideological slant of his presentation is different from your other courses, and was refreshing although I certainly disagreed with him on some of his analysis.",
    "Hands down, best class this semester.",
    "You will become familiar with perhaps the best reported and most relevant 30 years of ancient history. There is no better way in the world to learn about history and politics than from Donald Kagan's Thucydides course.",
    "The class is great and the professor is awesome. The only drawback is that the kind of kids who are drawn to a class like that tend to be odd ones.",
    "If you are willing to work, this class is immensely rewarding. Each week a couple of students are assigned topics to present on. Students write papers on their individual topics and turn them in to the whole class one week prior to their presentation. The class reads their papers and prepares questions. Professor Kagan also prepares questions, and the presentation is really more of an interview in which Kagan drills the student with questions. It's a unique and challenging format for a seminar."
