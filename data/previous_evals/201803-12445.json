    "American Progressivism was a great graduate-level looking into Professor Skowronek's field, American Political Development. I got a thorough look into political theory debates over the legacy of Progressivism, which Professor Skowronek led well. I also completed a research paper over the course of the semester, which we were able to work with Skowronek in developing.",
    "I gained an immense new understanding of the development of the modern American state and how the vision of the ~1900-1920 Progressive Movement has influenced state-building for the next several decades. I learned about the complexities of the conservative counter-movement, and the tense moment we currently live in."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The readings were insightful, although I wished there were more emphasis on contemporary defenses of Progressivism, since it is easy to side with the critics. Class debate was usually helpful (aided by great graduate students) although Professor Skowronek often did spark the debate. He did an excellent job summarizing the readings, but he would sometimes finish an argument and look around at the room, waiting for someone else to comment. The best class debates occurred when he had prepared questions to ask. The course assignments were thoughtful and Professor Skowronek seemed genuinely interested in our perspectives, though he was honest with his critiques.",
    "Glaring weakness: every week we did ~70 pages of reading and when we got to class, the professor summarized all of the readings and essentially asked what we thought of the summary. It was not conducive to me learning anything and I was disappointed overall with the course as a result.",
    "Strengths: very high level of discussion from a mix of undergrads and grad students, well-facilitated by Professor Skowronek who would start each session with a very helpful framing. Strong syllabus Weaknesses: at times too much reading assigned to reasonably give each piece the attention it deserves. Somewhat too much emphasis on the \"critics\" side, especially early on as we were just beginning to really understand the core of Progressivism."

    "Yes! This course provided an entirely new outlook on American intellectual history. It changed the way I think about politics and the way that I think about American history.",
    "No",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class to another student interested in the material--don't mistake \"progressive\" for its simple 21st century meaning! It is a reading list dominated by the white male intellectual elite of the past century, without (in my opinion) sufficient outside critiques to recognize their positionality. However, it is an excellent course for thinking about the challenges and prospects of \"radical reform\" and statebuilding in the interest of a common good in America."
