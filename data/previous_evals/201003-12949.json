    "Awesome class, Maria is wonderful as always. Had a great time every class, and would definitely recommend it to anyone considering taking L5",
    "Yes, definitely! I would reccomend this course because you can learn and practice Greek in an enjoyable and cultured environment.",
    "Greek Oral Literature is the perfect L5 language course. My writing in Greek improved drastically over the course of the semester and it was nice to be able to write my essays on a broad range of topics. The professor gives lots of personal attention to each student. And don't be afraid if the subject matter does not seem to be your personal favorite. Greek mythology is a great way to learn the language since the material is challenging, but not overly difficult. Also, the interviews we conducted with local Greek people were unique experiences. Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.The workload is manageable, Maria is wonderful, the classroom environment is pleasant, and you do take your abilities to read, write, and speak Modern Greek to the next level.",
    "This is a great class, especially if you're not interested in the usual poetry\/literature heavy courses that L5 usually offers. If you've made it to L5, you also know how great Maria is - take it!"
