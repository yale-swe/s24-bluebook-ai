    "EENG 310 was a lot less stressful than I expected it to be. I learned a lot and was given the opportunity to apply what I learned to a topic that I was interested in for the final project. The professor is really understanding, which I found extremely important. A professor can make or break a course. Overall, I enjoyed EENG 310 and would recommend it.",
    "EENG 310 is an incredible course that I would recommend to anyone, not just those in engineering fields. The topics covered in class can be applied to nearly any discipline, and a broad understanding of many areas of signals and systems is developed throughout the course. I would definitely recommend meeting with Professor Narendra early and often, as he is very interested in getting to know students and is willing to tailor the examples covered in lectures to students' areas of interest.",
    "You'll enjoy this class. It expands on a lot of the math you learned in 202 and ties it all together clearly. It's not as scary as you think it'll be. 310 is an excellent course on convolution, laplace transforms, Z transforms, fourier synthesis, and fourier transforms.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to any student interested in signals and systems."
