   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Renewable Energy for anyone interested in energy and the environment. The course does a great job of teaching you the basics of energy supply and use and is very accessible to non-science majors.",
    "As someone who wants to go into the renewable energy industry, I felt that this was a fantastic course. I really liked how we got a solid scientific background on a variety of renewable energy technologies, backed up by details about policy, placement, and public perception issues. My two main complaints are: 1. The pset solutions were never posted and points deducted on psets were not explained, so studying for exams was difficult. 2. We never discussed nuclear energy (and neither does G&G 274).",
    "A warning off the top: there is a lot of physics here. You'll basically do a semester's worth of electricity and magnetism in a day, a semester of thermodynamics in another day, etc. Larry moves really fast though some of these things, so be prepared to have to take some extra time to get your mind around the concepts. You aren't tested on any of the challenging quantitative stuff though, the exams are doable for sure. Psets a little tougher but not bad. I'm a physics major, so that side of it wasn't hard, but the Ron Smith geography trivia we were tested on were kind of annoying. At the same time, I've learned a lot about weather patterns and resource management for energy. It has it's faults, but as the one class on energy I took at Yale I feel much more informed on solar, wind, geothermal, natural gas, hydropower, and fossil fuel energy sources.",
    "I definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about current energy trends and the viability of renewables. I do recommend it with the one caveat that it's helpful to have a decent background in physics and math.",
    "Great overview of different renewable technologies from a technical perspective. The very beginning covers some physics, but after that is much more simple calculations.",
    "This is a very basic QR course.",
    "Solid class; not too challenging at all but still very interesting. This class is a great compliment to G&G 274.",
    "Good generic overview of many different types of renewables. Problem sets not impossible but definitely very tricky. When in doubt just try to get the units to cancel.",
    "It's a good overview of renewables, but was not as technical as I had hoped.",
    "Yes, it is a great overview on energy and its impact on society. You learn a lot and you will be able to confidently talk about it afterwards.",
    "You learn about the basics of renewable energy. They teach a lot of physics and the psets from Larry are very psychics-based. But they didn't really test this on the exams.",
    "Definitely a worthwhile course. It is a challenging course to organize, but I think that we were able to study each technology in fairly good detail. I like that the course considered economic factors and public opinion when discussing each renewable energy option. Prof Smith's lectures on wind energy were definitely my favorite.",
    "Renewable energy is awesome! So relevant to know about and I feel like this class taught me a lot. I would recommend it, and don't me intimidated by all the electricity\/physics that is thrown at you - most of it you don't have to know. The psets are fair and straightforward (weekly).",
    "Professor Smiths lectures were well given and prepared us well for our problem sets and tests. Larrys lectures were often confusing and he often was less than friendly when answering questions causing an intimidating environment. His lectures also poorly prepared us for the problem sets and tests. The class would be better if only taught by Smith. The class was a bit disappointing to be honest, but will give you a basic understanding of clean energy and some of the science behind it.",
    "Good course if you're a stem major. Might be difficult if you're not and don't have a strong physics background. If you're looking for an easier class try G&G 274 - the other half to this class Very interesting 12 psets, 1 midterm, 1 final Exams are harder than expected",
    "You should take this course, especially if you're curious about how energy works in general and what may be in store for the future! Great course.",
    "A very interesting course, if you like the energy field you should definitely take it! Just be aware: there are students with strong and students with no background on physics who take this course, so it might be a little hard for some students while being kinda trivial for others; anyhow it is certain that you will be able to take it without struggling a lot. Weekly problem sets, but relatively easy (around 2 hours each at most)."
