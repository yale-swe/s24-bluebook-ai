    "This class was not your normal chemistry class, and if you want to succeed in the class you must go to every lecture. Professor Benoit's way of teaching was to do different example problems in class before really laying out the concepts, which at first makes the material seem confusing but after looking back over your notes after class it gets easier. I would definitely recommend the class if you want a new approach to chemistry. The midterm was easy but the final was almost impossible. Weekly problem sets just like every other science\/math class but not terrible.",
    "Only if you need it for your major.",
    "Math heavy and geared specifically toward engineering programs.",
    "Professor Benoit is a teacher that will always give you his time for you to understand the material. His weakness is that he knows the material so well that he often moves from one point to another without showing us how they connect --> he would skip some steps. While the class is excellent at teaching you how to solve problems, it's not as good at teaching you why you're solving the problems. It would be great if some of the problems were put into context more often, e.g. why are we trying to find the pe of this solution?",
    "This is a solid class and Gabe is a terrific professor with whom you want to take a class if at all possible before you graduate.",
    "Thoroughly ordinary course. Take it if you have a reason to take it. If you take it, do your problem sets, preferably with other people, and during lectures help the professor to teach you (ask him for repetition, clarification, explanation) because on his own he is just okay at teaching you."
