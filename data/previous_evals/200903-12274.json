    "Take it.",
    "Definitely take this course if you're at all interested in a French literature or African history - the class is really enjoyable and different than any other French class at Yale.",
    "Highly recommend it. Great way to learn and appreciate a fantastically interesting\/beautiful literary tradition from francophone African and the Caribbean. If you are interested in the sociological interaction of colonial\/neocolonial history or of Africa, the Caribbean or France in general, the literature studied in this course really gives you a new and interesting perspective that is hard to come across otherwise.",
    "French 230 covers many important works and concepts from colonial and post-colonial francophone areas outside of France. These works and concepts are crucial to understanding the French historical legacy, as well as interesting and compelling in their own right. This year, this course was a five-person seminar, with strong, informative, mutually helpful discussions every week. I would certainly recommend the course to anyone with a very strong background in French speaking and composition who cares about France, global cultures, post-colonialism, French as a global language, etc. etc. I'm glad I took it."
