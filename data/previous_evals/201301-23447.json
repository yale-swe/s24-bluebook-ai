   "comments": [
    "I hadn't taken an upper level cog sci seminar before, so this was a great class to take! I really liked Professor Guglielmo-he is extremely nice and caring, and you can talk to him about any doubts that you may have.",
    "Absolutely take this class. Seminar is always pleasurable to attend, the topics are extremely interesting, and the work is not overwhelming and always worthwhile. If you're a Cognitive Science major, you'd be missing one of the best classes in your major by not taking this class. If you're not a Cog Sci major but you have interest in the topic, there are few better classes than this one to take as a wide-ranging but advanced look into cognitive science topics. The issue with a class like this in Cognitive Science is that CogSci represents a wide range of topics that could naturally make any class without a specific topical focus seem like a survey class--however, Professor Guglielmo does an excellent job of giving students in the class the opportunity to investigate the topics at a deep and fulfilling level.",
    "This is a very good class, but if you are just going to take one, take the foundational findings version taught during the fall semester, it is a better overview of cognitive science topics.",
    "Honestly, I think there are better seminars with more interesting assigned reading out there that I would recommend before this class. Take it if you need a wild card in your 4-3-2-1",
    "There are only a handful of classes in which the budding cognitive scientist is challenged to unite knowledge stemming from the various branches of cogsci in answering thought-provoking questions such as: Do we have free will? What is the evolutionary role of mental time travel? or What is consciousness?The class is largely discussion based, so how much you get out of the class is largely dependent on the instructor and the other students. I was lucky in such respects, and enjoyed this class immensely. You're only asked to lead a discussion, provide weekly reading responses, write a final paper, and make a presentation, so the focus really is on exposing yourself to the various questions that cognitive scientists probe every day.",
    "Current Topics is a great survey of lots of very interesting veins of research in cognitive science. Whatever your specific interests are, you'll definitely have the chance to discuss them in this class -- and the final paper gives you a chance to explore them in significantly more depth. On the whole, this was a really good class that I would definitely recommend for CogSci majors in the future!",
    "It's a great class for learning about cognitive science. Discussions are never dull. The reading and grading is very reasonable. Each week you read a paper and all the scholarly responses to it. By reading the responses, you really learn about how scientists debate and where some of the major contentious points in cog sci lie. Can't recommend it enough.",
    "I would recommend it if you are looking for a great discussion with not too much stressful work.",
    "Basically you just have to do about 50 pages of reading a week then do a reading response before class. Each class is just a discussion of the readings led by two of the students. The readings and discussions tended to be pretty interesting",
    "Take it!",
    "Great class, I would highly recommend any classes with Professor Guglielmo (unfortunately he won't be here after this year). This class basically involved reading various synthesis papers on specific current topics in cognitive science. If you aren't familiar with a lot of primary research throughout the history of psychology, some of the concepts may be a little bit difficult to grasp since they are built on some underpinnings that aren't covered in the class. That being said, this is a nice overview (yet high-level) class on some interesting subjects."
