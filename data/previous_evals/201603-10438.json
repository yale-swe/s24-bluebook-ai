    "The insight I received was that I really hate my life",
    "For me this course functioned as a kind of quantative, in depth look at processes I had learned about qualitatively in other classes. It is very wide ranging -- from planetary dynamics to radiation\/matter interactions, and I learned a lot.",
    "We learnt a lot about astronomy and the class covers a lot of ground.",
    "I learned a lot about the physics of astrophysics, specifically about where important equations come from (their derivations). I gained knowledge about radiative processes, fluid dynamics, and a little about gravity and thermodynamics as well. I also learned how general dynamics plays a role in space specifically. I developed skills for writing scientific research papers as well by writing my first one ever.",
    "It was a decent review of multivariable calculus and taught me more about astronomy (as a non-astronomy major, I had nothing to begin with). I also got a taste for how simulations in astrophysics might work (the equations they're based on), and how fluids behave.",
    "We rigorously learned a lot of fluid dynamics (continuity, momentum, energy, Navier-Stokes, Euler, Bernoulli's, vorticity, and circulation equations, for starters), both quantitatively and qualitatively, as well as more general astronomy concepts (mainly radiation processes) qualitatively. As the basis of all of this we learned multiple (unnecessarily difficult) mathematical notations, including Eulerian versus Lagrangian forms of equations, and indexing versus vector forms of equations (which were unfamiliar for probably everyone in the class and made everything more difficult from the get-go). We also wrote a long term paper that lead to a greater depth of knowledge in a topic of our choosing."

   "comments": [
    "Where to start? There were only FOUR problem sets. While that may sound nice, they were RIDICULOUSLY DIFFICULT and did nothing to further our understanding. No midterm so we had legitimately no true gauge on our progress and our understanding of the class. Until the final weeks. Then we get a paper with very little instruction on what he wants from it. Then we get a final that is nothing like anything we have done before and have no idea on what to expect. We are told to simply just read the book for our exam. That's all we need. If we only need to read the book THEN WHAT IS THE POINT OF GOING TO CLASS?! Class is just literally an hour of just derivations and we are constantly told that we dont need this ever again. THEN WHAT IS THE POINT?! Maybe we should, oh...I dont know..., actually talk about the principles behind everything that we discuss and do examples to show how these work in an astrophysical sense, in order to understand how stuff works instead of RIDICULOUS, COMPLEX, AND POINTLESS derivations.",
    "Lectures covered a lot of information very quickly, so while they were really interesting it was also easy to get lost. It would also have been helpful to have more psets, as with only four I wasn't always sure I understood everything as well as I should. With so few assignments it was tough to test your understanding of the material before the final exam.",
    "The course covers an enormous number of topics -- which means thats you learn quite a lot, but it can also make it challenging to remember how different topics covered fit together amd to pick out what the main takeaways should be.",
    "STRENGTHS Great teaching Great lecture notes Low Workload WEAKNESSES Great lecture notes make going to lectures very UNnecessary (mainly at 9am) Few Problem Sets = almost no practice on the material Term Paper + Final Exam = not ideal (though not exhausting)",
    "The instruction and expectation for the term paper could be a little bit more clear.",
    "One strength is definitely the format, the problem sets, paper, and final did a good job of balancing out with what we learned in lecture. One weakness is that there was no TA to get help from, and another weakness is that the problem sets were a big leap from lecture since we didnt talk about applications in lecture, even if they did end up using information from class.",
    "The structure of the course really needs to be changed. There were only four problem sets, very few example problems, no midterm, and a final. The problem sets were all pretty much derivations, so by the end of the course it was unclear exactly how to implement the concepts. The lack of a midterm meant that nobody knew what to expect with the final, and I realized I lacked basic understanding of earlier material. Straightforward example questions, psets with extra questions to verify understanding, and a midterm would let students get a lot more out of it. With that said, Professor Van Den Bosch was great at explaining things, clearly an expert in the field, and had a nice set of lecture notes for us.",
    "Overall, I was quite frustrated with this class. I thought that the class covered too much material too quickly; I would have preferred to dive in deeper to fewer concepts and feel more confident with them. I would have appreciated the ability to really sit with and understand the novel and exciting concepts we were learning in fluid dynamics. On a similar note, as crazy as it sounds, I would have preferred to have more than 4 problem sets over the course of the semester; problem sets allow us to actually become familiar with the concepts we struggle with in class, and having more would have left me feeling better prepared for the final exam. Additionally, I didn't think that writing a 15-page term paper was an appropriate assignment for an astronomy course like this one; it was a disproportionate amount of reading and work getting up to speed in an essentially random field within astronomy, and was only tangentially related to the fluid dynamics content of the class. Especially for any underclassmen in the class, such an assignment is a huge effort for very little payoff if you arent actively working on a thesis or research that can be tied in. Furthermore, the assignment was so vague that many of us felt lost as to the depth\/breadth with which we should be writing, and were blindsided by the tough grading. I think I speak for most of the class when I say a midterm exam would have been preferable. Finally, I believe the final exam was also inappropriate, as the questions it posed were simple enough, yet the topics of the question were extremely specific in nature and surprised much of the class by asking about many things we hadnt thought were important enough to study for. In addition, the information we got from Prof. van den Bosch was misleading: he told us all that it would include multiple choice when there was not a single multiple choice question on the exam; and he told one student was told that we didnt need to memorize any equations, while multiple questions required memorization of equations that were far from obvious to memorize. It would have been useful to either have a more straightforward exam or provide a better idea of what we needed to know."

    "Friends don't let friends take this class. If you're not an astronomy major then run far far away.",
    "Very mixed feelings about this course--on the one hand, it is nice as a low-workload option during the semester. 4-5 problem sets spaced out over the semester, a final term paper, and a final exam (either oral or written depending on the size of your class). The professor gives you very detailed and well organized lecture notes that serve as the foundation for the class--so during lecture you can mostly just focus on trying to understand the material. All that said, the expectations for the final term paper and final exam were very poorly communicated. For students without experience writing physics\/astronomy papers, it was difficult to know what to aim for in writing the term paper. The flexibility that the professor expressed verbally when students asked him questions about the paper did not seem to be reflected in the grading. Similar feelings on the exam--although it might seem nice that there is no midterm for the class, I ended up wishing that we'd had other exams so that I'd have been better prepared for the final. Especially since there are so few problem sets, you don't have many ways to practice. We were given very little information about the exam ahead of time and it ended up being far more focused on memorization\/reproduction of equations and terms than I expected after experiences in other physics classes, where equation sheets are often provided and emphasis is primarily on problem solving. More generally, although the professor explains things pretty well in class, he doesn't hold regular office hours and it is not all that easy to find ways to get outside help.",
    "I would reccomend this course to anyone interested in fluid dynamics and astrophysics, but not as an introduction to physics\/astrophysics (as it relies on a fairly strong physics and math background). Its a really well organized and well taught course and you can get a lot out of it with not too much work by just keeping up with the material--but if you don't keep up and aren't self motivated then you can get a little lost.",
    "If you're a major, you gotta do it. If you love Astrophysics and are taking it because you want to learn it, here's the deal: the lecture notes are literally all you need. Honestly, you might take the course, since there are few easy psets, one term paper you can do in a week and a final you study for by reading the lecture notes. But if I were not required to take it, reading the lecture notes would have been equally valuable.",
    "Yes! Take it!",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who already knows they enjoy astrophysics and would like a closer look at how physics in space works- specifically fluid dynamics since this class focuses mainly on that. It is not a good course to find out if you like astrophysics because it is very intensely based in the physics and the astro part is secondary (until later on in the course). It is also hard to know how well you are doing in the class because there is relatively little work. The class dynamic was awesome though, and we all worked together to understand what was going on in class which was great. Frank is a cool guy but lectures can be boring and derivation-based. The paper is long but interesting although I wish I had gotten more guidance on it.",
    "I took this course as a non-astro major. I would caution other people against doing this, because I lacked a lot of the qualitative context that would have helped the interpretation of the equations make more sense. I also might not recommend it because of the problems with the structure I mentioned; if you do take it, you'll need to force yourself to do more work than the course requires of you to get a lot out of it. But the topics covered were very interesting, and if you like math or derivation, there certainly was a fair amount of that.",
    "This course was too much stress for what it was worth. Yes, you cover really interesting topics in fluid dynamics and radiative processes, but the structure of the class (only 4 p-sets, no midterm exam, a 15-page final paper and a confusing final exam) made it very hard to actually understand those topics. Of course, if you are an astronomy major this class is required; if you are thinking of taking it for fun, I recommend credit\/d to spare yourself the worry."
