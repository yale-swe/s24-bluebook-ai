   "comments": [
    "Theories about pop culture and music on very very abstract levels. Sometimes extremely hard to follow.",
    "Interesting class, but more based on theory than I had originally expected. Unfortunately, grad students tended to over power the undergrads, which was an unfortunate dynamic. Weekly 1 page reading responses for undergrads and then a final 10 page paper on whatever you want.",
    "Great into to many theorists, not too much reading, cool paper at end",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to learn about the main sociologists of the 20th century and apply their theories to contemporary scenarios. However, if you don't enjoy reading theory do not take the course for it involves a substantial amount of weekly readings.",
    "This course has an interesting selection of material, and Professor Eyerman is thoughtful, friendly, and helpful. The other people in this course will make or break it in terms of discussion, however. Professor Eymerman doesn't like to shut people up or make any active effort to make the discussion more balanced (i.e. making a conscious choice to call on women even though the men were more aggressive and talked without raising their hands would have been nice). Not a bad course. Shop it.",
    "A wonderful overview of theory in cultural sociology -- covering Adorno, Benjamin, Lukacs, Habermas, MacDonald, Bordieu and others. Eyerman does a great job of directing the seminar discussion, which was always lively and engaging. Highly recommended!"
