    "Alas, Jafari has left Yale! I would recommend this class only if it were taught by Jafari, but he isn't here, and it behooves Yale to take this as a lesson that you cannot be so stymied by reactionary politics that you lose such precious leaders like Jafari. SO THERE."

    "Taking this course coincided with my effort to write daily. This felicitous confluence of events allowed me to view Jafari's class more as a workshop\/atelier of conversation, than as a course one begrudgingly attends. I was able to workshop my dissertation chapter, and received wonderfully helpful feedback from my colleagues and Jafari. The sensitivity of Jafari's readings of my work as well as his choice of readings in the syllabus drove me to question my stance as the \"expert\"-voice of my dissertation. I am still questioning whether or not I should re-orient my dissertation as an auto-ethnography; although not completely resolved, I do not really care, as Jafari has ratcheted up the stakes of my dissertation as not only a piece of scholarly work, but also a personal statement. I LOVE YOU JAFARI!!! I LOVE YOU JAFARI!!! I LOVE YOU JAFARI!!! I LOVE YOU JAFARI!!! I LOVE YOU JAFARI!!!"
