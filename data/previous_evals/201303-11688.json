    "If you want to learn about the origins and challenges to the concept of sovereignty through history, take this class. Professor March is great.",
    "It is just an overview of the classical texts of political philosophy that deal with the topic of sovereignty. First it starts with Justinian's Codex and church\/state relations in Middle Ages. Then it discusses modern political writings on the state and government (Bodin, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel). We also read Lincoln and contemporary thinkers (Foucault). Overall it gives a good overview of the significance of sovereignty as a concept in political philosophy.But what made it really great was Professor March. His sense of humor, creative and original comments and generally a really positive and a little bit chaotic attitude to the class made me excited about it every week. So I would recommend it a lot to everyone interested in political philosophy and theory.",
    "Yes, at least to political science majors"
