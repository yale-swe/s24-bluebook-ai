   "comments": [
    "You pretty much know if you are going to take this class, but it is definitely worth taking. The problem sets and exams are very challenging and involved, so if you are up for the work, you should take the class. Before this year, I was contemplating whether or not to take this or 401, and I definitely do not regret the decision to take this course. I probably learned more in this class than I have in any other course I have taken thus far.",
    "You are taking this class because you are thinking of becoming an intensive physics major. By the time the semester is over, you will know for certain. Professor Stone is a knowledgeable lecturer, answers questions clearly, and is overall a kind person, but his problems sets and exams will test the constitution of your very soul (and your knowledge of physics as well). I spent an average of 10 hours every week on the homework and never finished the tests in the allotted time. Of course, I'm not as mathematically adept as other people, so 10 hours on the homework is probably an upper limit.Still, don't fret too much. Think of yourself as a physics pilgrim. Before the pilgrim can reach Enlightenment, he must first experience the death of his ego nature. The class will be difficult and you will feel like an idiot for four months, but once it's over, you will have learned a lot and it will all have been worth it (maybe).",
    "Physics 410 is for intensive physics majors. This class will definitely challenge you. The class is incredibly fast-paced. We covered almost the entirety of Classical Dynamics by Marion and Thornton, which is roughly 600 pages of dense physics. This class is definitely one of the hardest I have taken at Yale. Stone's exams are always well though-out and have interesting problems, but in my opinion he tries to stuff far too much material into a three hour test.Anyway, physics 410 will let you know if you're destined to become an intensive physics major. It may be too difficult for some, but I imagine it would be easy to drop down to 401 if you can't keep up.",
    "Take it for the intensive major, it's a right of passage, and Doug Stone is tolerable, if not all he's cracked up to be (for a variety of reasons).",
    "Very rigorous course in classical mechanics, less physics'sy, way more mathy and arbitrary feeling than most physics students are used to.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! you will feel pain and you will get screwed on the exams, and the HWS are as hard as, f....well, you know.but what an amazing learning experience this is. Dougy Stone is da man. try to take it with him.there should also be an option of much much much greater in the workload of this course for the next question, cuz that describes this class.",
    "A good course which teaches you the basics and practice of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, and uses the techniques developed there to treat celestial mechanics, harmonic and coupled oscillations, rigid body motion, moments of intertia. Prof. Stone places a lot of emphasis on intuitive understanding, and when 'chaos' will or won't occur in classical systems.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is fascinating but hard.",
    "Physics 410 covers almost all of the topics in Classical Mechanics. The material is challenging but very rewarding. The problem sets are challenging and time consuming, but they help in understanding the material. The class is definately worth taking as long as you are willing to put a sufficient amount of time into it.",
    "I would definitely recommend Phys 410 to another student. (But they probably already know whether they'll take it)",
    "This course is exactly what you think it is, solving more complicated mechanics problems than you have seen before. In reality it is essentially an applied math course, as much of what you do is learn how to solve certain types of differential equations (you of course also learn the physics to set up the equations, but most of your time will be spent doing math not physics). As for my recommendation. . . you already know if you are taking this course or not, and will of course ignore whatever recommendation I make (we physics majors are like that, believe me I know).",
    "This class is very very difficult. If you are taking this class, however, you most likely know that already and are set on taking it regardless. Good luck to you. If you have even the slightest doubt about being able to handle it, however, do not take this class."
