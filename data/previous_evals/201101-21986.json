   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course, especially as a first WGSS course. If you have already taken a WGSS course or know a lot about WGSS, parts of this course might be a little repetitive (since it does not assume any prior knowledge of WGSS), but there is definitely still enough new material to hold your attention.",
    "A text-heavy discussion of primarily deviant forms of sexuality from the victorian ages up until modern times.",
    "Study of the progression of American thought on sexuality. I'd take it if you want a lighter-load WR credit. But for other classmate's sake, only take it if you find the material interesting.",
    "Yes! Take this class if you can. It's not a lot of work and it's really interesting",
    "I highly recommend this course for every student. It's more than just about sex- lessons cover philosophy, medicine, moral construct, etc. Professor Trumpler is engaging and so is the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's a fun and interesting course, and it's not too difficult or stressful of a course load.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student looking for a great Freshman Seminar to take, that can also give you a writing credit. The papers are very interesting, and so are all the readings and discussions.",
    "Take it without thinking about it!! No need for that. You won't regret!",
    "I definitely recommend this course to another students. It's always in high demand, but it's definitely worth it. Try something new.",
    "It is a great class that will expose you to a variety of classes that puts sexuality in the context of society and its evolution. I would recommend it to those interested in the topic.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "Definitely a very good freshman seminar to take, I would highly recommend it, especially because of the diversity of the texts you would otherwise never read, and because of the \"archives paper\" where you get a chance to explore handwritten journals, and other amazing archives which is just such and amazing opportunity.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, it's a great course. It's interesting but not horribly difficult, and I actually had fun writing the papers. Readings were for the most part pretty interesting and discussions good as long as you kept up with the reading. Overall not to much of a work load, and the archives project at the end is pretty cool.",
    "History of Sexuality is a great introduction to the study of gender and sexuality. It leaves you with a better understanding of why we are so obsessed with sex and the difficulties we face in trying to quantify sex. If you have not had much experience with scientific journals and writing, this class will make you a lot more familiar with them. I would highly recommend this class, because it will teach you to truly delve into an author's intent and authority and how this affects your reading of their work."
