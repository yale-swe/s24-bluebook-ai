    "Take this class! If you're looking for a great language learning experience, this is it! Highly recommended. The class is not difficult nor is it a lot of work. It's just great fun and really makes your Korean improve. You won't regret it!",
    "Yesyesyes take it! Even if youre not a native speaker you will have so much fun learning!",
    "If you are a Korean heritage speaker and want to improve your Korean skills, this is the way to go. You will have so much fun and learn so much. Professor Lee-Smith is the kindest, most caring, most supportive, most wonderful professor ever. She became likeeveryone's second mother, in the best way possible. She comes up with a variety of both in-class activities and homework assignments, and I also think she is great at explaining the grammar and vocabulary. Another great thing about this course is that there is no textbook. Instead, Professor Lee-Smith has her own self-designed curriculum which she adjusts to needs and interests of the students in the class.Just as a note, if you're worried that you won't fit in because one of your language skills is much weaker than the others (e.g. you speak very well but can't really read or write, or vice versa) - stop worrying. The level of the students in this class definitely varied quite a bit; I was by far the weakest speaker, for example, but I never felt out of place (I'm actually not even a heritage speaker, but I spent the summer in Korea after taking L1\/L2 last year). What else can I say? If you're even thinking about it, take this class!!!",
    "If you're not a native korean speaker, then this class is going to be hard. However, it's also by far the best class to take if you're serious about getting better at Korean.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student who would like to improve a more linguistic understanding of the Korean language."
