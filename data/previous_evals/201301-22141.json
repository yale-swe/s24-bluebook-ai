    "This class was awesome; you'll get course credit for reading The Hunger Games and talking about Twilight, and what could be better than that? Lofton is absolutely brilliant, and it was wonderful to get to hang out with her for 2 hours a week. DEFINITELY take this class if you get in, but be aware that Lofton's teaching style takes a while to get used to, as she kind of jumps all over the place, and that people get so excited about class that participating in discussion requires that you get pretty aggressive. Also, Lofton did take WAY TOO LONG to get back our assignments, and I felt like her grading on them was maybe too harsh. (Actually, I really, really wish I had taken this Credit\/D.) Still, hands-down one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Definitely. If you can get it, it's certainly worth it. The course is just plain fun, and you really get a chance to sharpen your critical capacities. Lofton is amazing, take it just so you get a chance to interact with her.",
    "I would definitely recommend Religion and Popular Culture to anyone interested in the subject matter. We think critically about things very few people think twice about. Taylor Swift, in this scenario, is just as important as political figures. You have to take this class if you get in. Everyone should take this class!",
    "Yes. It's a great way to apply a critical academic lens to things you just take for granted. Makes you a better consumer, critic, and religious person, I think.",
    "Religion and Popular Culture is an amazing whirlwind seminar through theorizing and criticizing popular culture, with heavy doses of religion in some lessons, and no apparent religion at other times. Lofton is an absolute rockstar of a professor; this class is so worth taking, if you can get in. Be prepared to challenge yourself in studying things you think you know well. Just because we read the Hunger Games and watch Miley Cyrus videos doesn't mean there isn't serious academic work to be done. The workload is very manageable and Lofton is a powerful person who will push your writing and make you think again about what it means to consume popular culture. One of my favorite seminar experiences at Yale.",
    "Yes! take it! Im a math major adn was really glad I took it credit\/fail because she expects alot in the writing.",
    "Good seminar. Interesting discussion about many diverse objects of popular culture--maybe not as much emphasis on \"religion\" as \"pop culture\" as the semester goes on, but all of it's fascinating. Prof. Lofton is brilliant, and being in a seminar setting with her is great. Discussions sometimes got a little off-track, or we spent a lot of time doing little writing exercises and sharing--which maybe isn't the most interesting exercise, but overall I enjoyed coming to class each week, and all of the papers were actually quite fun to write. I definitely had friends who were jealous that I was writing papers about Louis C.K. and the Hunger Games, and even though these assignments were really fun I still felt like I was improving my critical thinking and learning more about how to analyze pop culture.",
    "I'm not sure if I learned much about religion or popular culture. The most interesting ideas would be gone in half a class and we'd never return to them. I didn't feel like the class built on the syllabus as it went on. The most valuable part were the papers. By writing so much (5 papers) I had a lot of opportunities to work onto writing and my interpretative and analytical skills. But I'm not sure if I worked on anything I gained in the class or syllabus itself.",
    "Take this class if you can get in! This class taught me a new way of looking at the world. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give me a concrete set of knowledge; it gave me a skill. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad for that. I think college is a great time to learn skills. There will be time in life to read books about any subject, but learning a skill requires more support. You need a conversation partner (aka a seminar) and ample time to think through your process. I left every single seminar feeling more enlightened and excited. What a class! By the way, the application process definitely favors American Studies \/ Anthro majors (Lofton is looking for cultural criticism in the responses). If you are unfamiliar with those fields, then ask a friend what that term means. It will help you a lot! You have to show up on the first day to apply, so be there!",
    "Religion and Pop Culture is unlike any class that I have taken before. You get the chance to learn about the world around you and improve your analytical skills. I think much more about culture and its appeal than I did before and feel like a more educated citizen.In the first portion of the course you try to define religion by reading a few scholars' definitions and discussing the concept as a class. Then you proceed to analyze many texts, examples of popular culture, often times dedicated smaller groups, and relate their passion to aspects garnered from traditional religions. Each day has a title associated with it, but we only loosely followed the title. 2-3 readings are assigned for each class. We rarely discussed the readings themselves, but use their message to deepen our analysis of new cultural texts presented in class. The workload is definitely manageable: 5 1,000 word papers, an in-class presentation, and take-home final.I'd definitely take the class if you are able to. Its the most applicable class I have taken to my daily life. Additionally, my peers collectively were the most fascinating group that I have encountered on campus. Even this final aspect would have made the course worthwhile.",
    "This class is good. Past years have found it life-changing. I found it less so. It does teach you to ask a new set of questions that you may not be used to from other cultural criticism classes or other humanities classes. Questions of why something is popular and how religious forms might explain that, and what that means for culture. However, the answers that the class gives to those questions were not always satisfying. Lofton is an exceptionally energetic, caring, and brilliant professor. But she chose to lead this class fairly loosely; class discussion sort of just went from point to point. Each person had their own little method of reading, which was good for them but didn't make for cohesion. Don't take the class expecting a lot of new knowledge or specific skills, but do take it to change your way of thinking about religion and about questions of mass popularity.",
    "Religion and Popular Culture gives you an invaluable lens through which to evaluate and make sense of our schizophrenic cultural matrix. How does the same nation produce Oprah and Killer Karaoke? What rituals underly and give meaning to our secular lives\u00e2\u0080\u0094what is our investment in the Super Bowl? Not to mention the fact that Lofton is a brilliant thinker and teacher. This class equipped me with an entirely new dimension of critical thinking; this is why we study the liberal arts."
