   "comments": [
    "Its a strong survey of architectural history. Though at first it may seem that the lectures are dry, it gets better as the class heads into the modern era. The guest lecturers are good and Eeva Lisa puts in a lot of effort to meet with the students. I would recommend it to all who may be interested in the subject, the course will not disappoint.",
    "Heavy workload occasionally but interesting material in the course and good instruction. I would recommend the course to another student.",
    "Be prepared for a very different class than ARCH 260. There is 5 times the amount of work for this class, although the material is much more engaging than 260. Eeva-Liisa requires several \"synthetic essays,\" which are not particularly arduous, but often come at inconvenient times with respect to studio. The class basically operates as an art history class; for exams, you are required to memorize slide ID's with names and dates, etc. If you are an architecture major, you probably already know a good amount of the material just from having taken Analytic Model and from looking at precedents. I am really glad I now know the material from this class, but it is a fairly tough one to get through in your junior year. Eeva-Liisa is incredibly sweet and excited about what she studies, so I would strongly recommend meeting with her outside the class.",
    "Good course, go to lectures, Eeva-Liisa is amazing.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in modern architecture. It's a very good overview of architecture over the last few centuries, and gives a very interesting focus on modern architecture. The readings, while high in volume, are generally very comprehensive and the sections are a good way to discuss the lecture materials. Overall, a good course with a not overwhelming amount of work."
