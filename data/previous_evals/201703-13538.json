    "An in-depth understanding of wetlands as a critical ecosystem type.",
    "What features are characteristic of wetlands, how wetlands are affected by various human influences, abiotic and biotic interactions, etc.",
    "I learned quite a lot about wetlands -- the class provided a very complete view of wetlands issues, though the focus was slightly more on biology than on chemical\/geological issues.",
    "I developed my ability to read and understand scientific papers and deepen my understanding of academic scientific research. I now have a greater understanding of the ecological processes that shape wetlands and their global and regional importance, as well as a basic understanding of specific conservation threats to wetland ecosystems and some of the challenges of wetlands management and restoration."

    "Exceeded expectations. Small, interactive class with a sharp focus on the science of wetlands. Course attracted students from a variety of backgrounds which made discussions rich.",
    "There was more focus on definitions and granular pieces of the science than I had been expecting, with less focus on management.",
    "I think it aligned almost exactly with expectations -- which is a very good thing.",
    "I expected a more even split between the \"ecology, conservation, and management\" sections of the course--based on the title and course description, I expected that more of the course would be spent on specific wetlands conservation and management strategies."

   "comments": [
    "Kealoha Freidenberg brings a quiet brilliance to the study of wetlands. Nice to learn in an academic setting from a field scientist. A strong reading-based course that might benefit by a few more field trips. Required written feedback on the reading was challenging to submit before each class, but kept everyone on track.",
    "The first half of the semester started off really strong, but after the second midterm it went downhill. The course turned into a cycle of doing the assigned reading, and then the professor asking us our thoughts on the assigned reading. There wasn't any instruction or lecture material to supplement the readings as there was in the beginning of the semester and the professor brought no real value-add to the readings. I can read articles and a text book on my own, but I need a professor to instruct me on and solidify the material, not facilitate a class discussion.",
    "Kealoha's enthusiasm was a strength, as was the diversity of the topics covered. A weakness was the required questions on the readings, when class material often covered other readings and there wasn't time to address our questions (in other words, it seemed that oftentimes I would spend a lot of time reading and coming up with questions on an article, and then we wouldn't talk about it at all in class).",
    "Kealoha is very knowledgeable, personable, and committed to teaching. I think that classes generally run well, with helpful slide decks and interesting examples. I'm not sure if the system of submitting questions works all that well, and I sometimes felt like I was struggling to find interesting questions to ask.",
    "As a discussion based literature review class, the small class size facilitated interesting discussions in which students were able to bring their own expertise and background to the table. I learned a great deal about the ecology of wetlands, and would have liked more opportunities to apply that knowledge to real-world conservation problems. For example, the applied management questions on the final exam were very interesting; I would have loved case studies or discussions like that during the class to develop more understandings of best practices for wetlands management and restoration. The field trips were fun and informative. For this course, at least one required field trip may help contextualize the research studies we read and gain a deeper understanding of the ecological principles we discussed in depth. Visiting a wetland to see first-hand how wetlands research is conducted would have been great!"

   "comments": [
    "Lacking a science background, I felt that learning in depth about wetlands gave me a good frame of reference for understanding ecosystem science in general. Critical material for conservation and land use practice.",
    "There is a lot of reading involved. Do not save it for the day before.",
    "If you like wetlands and water systems, this is a great class to take. It is based around discussions of the peer-reviewed literature and spends most of the semester focused on wetlands ecology (rather than applied management strategies.) Expect to read 3-4 academic papers and to submit 5 discussion questions by the afternoon before each class, which can be quite time-consuming."
