   "comments": [
    "A great way to look at history through a different lens. Take this class, you will not regret it!",
    "Absolutely recommend it! It was a great class.",
    "Overview of the best cases of the century with an analysis of media coverage and trial details",
    "I would summarize it as the best class you will ever take.",
    "This course is typically very popular and Jack cut it off to upperclassman this year (mostly seniors, handful of juniors). It's a seminar that covers one famous \"trial of the century\" a week, and it is very much a discussion-based class. The work isn't overwhelming (perfect for senior spring), with readings and one or two one-hour documentaries\/videos about the trial to watch, and then sending in two brief questions you have about the material for discussion the next day. Midterm, and a final paper. And Jack is a great professor, very approachable, and loves talking about the trials and his experiences at Yale and in the law! Definitely take if you are interested in the topic.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS (if you're lucky enough to get in). You get to learn about awesome trials and there's very little work. Instead of readings you just watch a 90 minute video every week, which is awesome. There's a REALLY short midterm assignment (like 4 pages) and a very reasonable final paper (15-20), and other than that, nothing. Class is fun--it's pretty much just story time w\/ J. Ford, which is definitely worth listening in on. Really glad I took it--perfect for senior spring.",
    "\"Trials of the Century\" is an excellent college seminar. Professor Ford is one of the best professors I have met at Yale. He ensures that everyone speak in class, yet he wants students' comments to cohere. Discussion flows well and easily. Professor Ford's method of laying out hypothetical scenarios particularly help you frame the issues and understand the downstream consequences of each option. Above all, Professor Ford is an entertaining storyteller. I enthusiastically recommend this course to students interested in law, history, and politics.",
    "Great class. Enrollment is usually very limited, so try your best on the college seminar application! Must take if you get in! Light readings, fun videos, and good discussion.",
    "Best class.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class, it was a lot of fun to take and I left feeling like I had a better understanding of each of the cases. it was wonderful!",
    "An incredible class, especially if you're interested in law. Even if you're not, you'll love reading some of the most interesting American court cases of all time.",
    "This class is awesome! You get to learn about fascinating trials. The instructor is incredibly engaging and good at storytelling, which is no surprise since he is a TV commentator. He has a lot of great first-person anecdotes from trials and individuals covered in the course. The class was relaxed and really interesting, so I definitely recommend it.",
    "If you have any interest in law, history, culture, anything really -- you will get something out of this course."
