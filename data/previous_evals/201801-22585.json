    "Basic techniques for behavioral experiments in invertebrates, cellular mechanisms of action potentials, and",
    "Behavioral Neuroscience provided a lot of material on how nerves work, particularly the electrical activity\/currents that are shuttled through axons, and how ion flow across their cell membranes leads to an action potential. We learned a lot about the nervous system in different animals, as well as humans, and learned how to identify different parts of the brain and what their functions are. A great course for someone interested in neuroscience or med school.",
    "You learn the fundamentals of behavioral neuroscience.",
    "Incredible hands-on experience with neuroscience lab work",
    "Great understanding of the brain at a detailed anatomical level, and a deep insight into how neurons functioning can shape behavior",
    "Good general knowledge of measurements in neuroscience, and good basis in neuroanatomy."

    "This class is great largely across the board. It's relatively low workload while still being engaging, the material is interesting, and Professor Donegan does a good job explaining most of it. The one notably shallow area is his explanations of action potentials. His explanation is good, clear, and concise once you have a basic grasp of cellular transport mechanisms, but he assumes that knowledge which could be confusing for someone who has not seen that material before.",
    "The strengths of this class is that there were a lot of hands-on labs, and interactive resources to use. The professor was great at explaining concepts, and the TA made sure we had a grasp of the material. There are no weaknesses for this class. It was wonderful.",
    "This class is not always the most engaging during lecture but the material is super fascinating and the invertebrate labs and brain dissections were awesome!",
    "The final project could be better organized. We didn't have enough time to discuss it in class. It would be more interesting if we had the chance to develop our own ideas and do our own measurements for the final paper."

    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially to someone who wants to fulfill their research methods requirement for psychology. This class is good for any psych student, anyone who likes neuroscience, and especially good for pre-meds. What you learn in this class will definitely be tested on in med school. The professor is also one of the sweetest ones you will meet, and is GREAT at teaching!",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes, as a psych major, this class is great to get real hands-on experience and just do fun labs!",
    "Absolutely takethe first half will get you to really be familiar with the brain in a way other courses here dont, and the second half will teach you all about the action potential and how that works in various animals",
    "This is a very practical course with measurements in live systems. If you are looking for an opportunity to study neuroanatomy or physiological recordings in real animals, this is a great course."
