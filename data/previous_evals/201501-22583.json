   "comments": [
    "Yes. Little work",
    "Standard poli sci survey \"gut\" course - not much work at all. Definitely write the paper and go to section.",
    "Yes, take this class.",
    "If you are interested in history at all and want to get a humanities requirement out of the way, take this class.",
    "I would not recommend this course to other students since I feel like most of the material could be researched fairly easily outside of the classroom.",
    "PLSC 166 starts with WWI, WWII, and the foundation of the European Coal and Steel Community. You then move on to the progression from the European Community to the current European Union. In the second half of the course you tackle current events - the debt crisis, the situation in Ukraine, and Italy's struggles with the migrants. The second half of the course is by far the more interesting portion. There is one midterm exam and one final exam...definitely not too much work. It is a great fifth class or class to take CR\/D. There is also an optional section and an optional paper if you want less weight placed on the exams.",
    "awesome class that i would recommend because we all need to know about the history of europe and how it got to this point.",
    "The New Europe is a relatively low workload course that has some interesting material. The lectures can be a bit boring, but if you read the slides you can parse through the details and learn a lot about Europe.",
    "Definitely a gut, but challenging in that it's easy to fall behind and learn nothing if you don't go to lecture and keep up with the reading.",
    "Midterm\/final. No one goes to class, just study the power points before both tests. The material is extremely dense but manageable.",
    "Great survey of modern European history and the issues facing the EU today. Professor Cameron is smart, funny, and great one on one. Lectures were dry at times, but section was great, and I learned a lot from the course overall.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Great introduction to Europe from 1900-present day.",
    "Cameron is a ce ry passionate teacher, it's obvious how much he enjoys the material. Unfortunatly his lecture voice is a bit soft and monotone, but it wasn't as big of an issue as I thought it would be. he made the slides very informative, and that was very helpful Great class. Learned a lot about europe, was able to be engaged because the subject matter was so fascinating. Very much a class that explains what's going on in Europe today. Definitely recommend",
    "Sure. Not too hard and informative. Just know that how much you get out of it is how much you put in, as its easy to slide by without doing much work.",
    "This class is a gem - all of the notes are on Cameron's slides so you don't have to go to class, and the optional section and paper are just icing on the cake. Take this class.",
    "It is a good polisci course without too great a workload and gives you a good understanding of an important topic.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is detail oriented and interested by the EU! A bit dry at times and hard to stay engaged with.",
    "Good class to get background of European Union and how it established. Not too work-intensive, but do the readings. Fun class.",
    "Good class, but keep it mind that it's more about history than current events in the \"New Europe\".",
    "There is not a lot of work for this class, but be warned, the grading is not easy. However, I did learn a lot about the EU and Europe which I think is pretty useful. First half of the course is a slightly more detailed review of basic European history (WW1, WW2, Rise of Hitler, etc.). However, the second half of the course covers some pretty interesting topics (Ukraine, EU Debt Crisis, Fall of the USSR, etc.). If you're from Europe or have a strong background in European history, this is a great fifth class for you. Otherwise, only take it if you actually want to learn about the EU. Although I didn't particularly enjoy the class, I did learn a lot.",
    "A great place to meet the hockey team. Professor Cameron is not the most engaging lecturer, but it's not a bad course if you're interested in the EU, Russia since 1985, and current issues Europe faces.",
    "Easy poly sci credit..lecture is not very exciting and poorly attended",
    "Not a gut",
    "A very interesting class that allows you to learn everything about the history of Europe.",
    "Take this course if you want to understand how and why Europe has changed significantly in the past, especially the last two centuries. Understanding how specific events and systems led to major events in European history is important for understanding present-day events. There is a significant emphasis on topics such as formation of the European Union, the fall of the Soviet Union, and ongoing issues, such as the Eurozone and Ukraine crises.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any student interested in the history and the present of the European Union. The material in the lecture and in sections was well structured. You will take a lot out of this class.",
    "Overview of the eu and the challenges it faces. Class isn't super exciting or great but material is. Not a lot of reading necessary to do well but it is interesting",
    "A well organized and thorough class that covers the history of the EU and the current crises rather thematically.",
    "Incredibly easy class. If you put in minimal effort (such as going to the optional section), you should be able to get an A. If you are taking this class, please at least try and learn something. The class is so easy that you can just show up for each test with a few hours of studying and be just fine, but within a couple hours of the class ending you will realize you have learned absolutely nothing. As a senior (now alum-insert sad face), time at Yale is precious, and so is the amount of classes you cant take, so don't waste them by not trying."
