    "Great way to learn how to speak Chinese. I would recommend this course, as long as you are interested in learning Chinese.",
    "I would recommend this to other students because I think that it is a class that is taught very well. My class only had 8 students, so there was more individual attention. The teachers are personable and funny, and are strict. I really liked all of them.",
    "If you are interested in learning Chinese, this is the best way to do it. The course is demanding and challenging but if you are willing to commit to the learning process, you will get a lot out of the course."
