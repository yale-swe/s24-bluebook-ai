   "comments": [
    "Don't expect too much of a discussion with your students. The participation and discussion in this class is just responding to Eddy's questions. Some students offer strong opinions, but Eddy drives the conversation for the most part. If you are looking for a class that is student driven, this isn't the class for that. Other than that, the class is an interesting overview of many genres of film. Eddy is an expertise in the industry, and his experiences come through in every class. The workload is not bad - weekly reading responses and 3 papers. The classes, besides the discussion, are pretty fun. He shows a lot of film clips to illustrate themes and motifs. Take it if you're interested in a survey of some really excellent 20th century (and some 21st century) film and lit! (But seriously I don't think we watched any movies this semester that went below 80% on rotten tomatoes -- and a lot of the assigned movies won Best Picture for their year)",
    "Wonderful class. The subject matter of the course is super interesting you get to watch many classic American films and analyze them in context and with other works of their time. The final 15-page paper is long, but rewarding, and you can write it on any related topic that is of interest to you. Professor Friedfeld is one of the most approachable, understanding, and knowledgable professors in his field. He brought in candy for us for each class and purposely scheduled our 3 papers during less busy times of the semester. He clearly put a lot of work into planning out each class, and really cared about his students, even taking us out to lunch at the Friars Club in New York at the end of the semester!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student! The course material is so much fun, and you get out of it exactly what you put in. If you have a busy week, you can pick your favorite movie clips to watch, but if you have a light week you can experience the repertoire. Either way, it's homework you will want to do. The papers are also not bad at all and Eddy is very flexible about deadlines if you have a good reason!",
    "Absolutely recommended. Great class where you learn about all sorts of films. The writing assignments are fun to do and appropriately spaced. I will say that if you did all the work you would be overwhelmed. Each week there would be 2-3 films and books\/articles. HOWEVER, you really should only watch the movies and do readings you find interesting, since you probably won't go over all of them and the movies are the crux of the class. You watch a lot of great films, write fun papers, and learn from a nice professor. Hard to lose.",
    "A seminar in which you get to watch, read, and then discuss classic detective, cop, and spy films and novels. The reading and viewing for this class was something I looked forward to every week.",
    "If you like stories, and thinking about what *really* motivates people to act honorably or otherwise, this is the class for you.",
    "This course is really great if you're interested in film. It covers a pretty broad group of movies and you get to see and discuss a lot of classics. There's only 3 papers (one short, one medium, and one long) and a short reading\/viewing response due for each class. I'd definitely recommend it!",
    "Pros: 1) Very fun survey course of film classics. 2) Effusive, warm, very knowledgeable insider professor who has hobnobbed with the Hollywood elite. 3) Easy grading on paper topics you get to choose. Cons: 1) Overwhelming amount of homework, *but* the homework is just watching great films \/ reading great books, and there is no penalty for not doing the work.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone who is interested in film and literature in the detective and gangster genre and wants to learn from an experienced and knowledgeable instructor."
