    "I would recommend it. Once again, it is much more heavy on grammar than Port 110 was.",
    "An interesting class if you are looking to learn a new language.",
    "As I said before, it's a tough class if you don't already know Spanish or another romance language. Class discussion may be boring, but you do learn a lot of Portuguese if you put in the work."
