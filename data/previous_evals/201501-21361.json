   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student, and I would summarize it as a series of case studies of apocalyptic movements.",
    "I recommend this course to fellow students who are curious about religious studies broadly, but also anthropology, sociology, and psychology. If you are adverse to reading entire books for class you might steer clear - however, the writing assignments are a great test of comprehension and mastery of terms\/examples. Dr. Wilson is completely open to whatever students want to write about in their final papers, which is always attractive.",
    "It may be one of the few courses you have a chance to take that offers a truly multicultural perspective on a very interesting subject: the apocalypse. Prof. Wilson is very intentional about making the material digestible to a diversity of students and the readings are very interesting. I would recommend the class to another student as a course that is able to give that cross-cultural perspective, but that is focused on a very particular subject of apocalypticism. It makes for a fantastic elective course that is not overwhelming, but has enough material to really engage the subject.",
    "It is good overview for any student interested in the rise, perpetuation and response of apocalyptic religions from biblical times to modern times. I would recommend it for any interested, as it serves as a good background to understanding the rise of religious terror in today's world.",
    "Yes, I would. I think it helps clear up a lot of misconceptions about apocalyptic movements as well as the people who are attracted to them."
