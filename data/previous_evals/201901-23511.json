    "The course examined representional strategies in three genres\/media: novel, film, and history\/historiography. The course provided a survey of some of the most important works of francophone African literature and cinema and read them in tandem with historical accounts. An underlying goal, I think, was to attend to the particuliarities of each genre\/media and to try to understand what spaces and avenues of inquiry are opened up by aesthetic works such as literature and film in contrast to more 'official' historical records\/narratives."
