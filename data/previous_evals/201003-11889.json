   "comments": [
    "Required class for the math major. Beautiful material. Margulis isn't the best instructor ever, but sticks close to his notes and the text, so it's easy to study.",
    "Take it!! If you are a math major, looking to satisfy your 'advanced math class' requirements, this subject is easier than real analysis and abstract algebra. and its a beautiful subject",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend it to a math major. I mean 301, 310 and 350 are highly recommended anyway. Not super hard, but you still learn a lot.",
    "This is a thorough introduction to Complex Analysis. The work is very manageable and test are straightforward. Professor Margulis' lectures are very clear and precise. In general a solid course for anyone in Math, Physics, Compsci, etc. Should definitely be taken after 301.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 310 to any math major. The class introduces you to the beautiful field of complex analysis, and you get to see some truly strange results, e.g. using complex integration to find the sum of an infinite series. Margulis is great also. He has a tendency to sometimes write results on the board and then sort of point at them and mumble, but if you ask him for clarification he'll always provide it. His tests are also easy (by math department standards), so it's not particularly stressful.",
    "This is a very straightforward class. The professor is incredibly clear and the material is not particularly challenging. To succeed in this class, you just have to memorize the theorems by name, how to prove them, and how to solve a pretty small set of formulaic problems. Marguls is a good lecturer and very nice, and he will help you if you need it.",
    "I highly recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this class. The material is fascinating and essential for a Math major. Professor Margulis was great, and I really enjoyed this class.",
    "This is a good course.",
    "This was a basic introduction to the ideas of Complex Analysis. It's really interesting, pretty stuff; if you have some background in proof-writing, and some general knowledge of point-set topology and real analysis, the material should be, for the most part, completely accessible. If not, be prepared to do some extra reading if you want to understand this stuff fully. I highly recommend this class for those with the appropriate prerequisites, both for its aesthetic appeal, and as a sort of reward for suffering through the pathologies of real analysis. If Prof. Margulis is teaching this again, definitely shop it, at the very least. The beginning may be a bit slow, but once the course picks up speed, his lectures will be very interesting.",
    "This is a really interesting class in the math major. The material is really fascinating and enjoyable. Margulis is a pretty good teacher, although not always a super exciting lecturer. The class is not too hard and not too much work.",
    "This class is one of the essential topics in mathematics, and contains some of the most beautiful and quasi-miraculous results in all of mathematics. Everyone should take this class!"
