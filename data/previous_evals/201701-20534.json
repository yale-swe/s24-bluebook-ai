    "I got to apply some of the digital signal processing concepts that I had learned in eeng 450 - applied digital signal processing. I actually learned a lot about programming DSP in C, which I wish I had done more of in the previous class. It was great to use a real DSP chip and learn about the troubleshooting and practical issues that go into that. I feel much more comfortable with pole-zero plots, frequency response, and phase response.",
