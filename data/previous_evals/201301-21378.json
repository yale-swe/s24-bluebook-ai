   "comments": [
    "Exams can be difficult, homework is usually fair but can be math intensive, and a variety of (usually) relevant and interesting topics are covered. It is relevant to almost any physics student due to the fundamental nature of the problems studied. I would recommend it to all.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It is one of the few departmental requirements in which I've felt I've actually learned a lot of new physics.",
    "Phys608 was a very good course, but I did not get as much out of it as the other core physics graduate courses (500, 502, 512, 508, 506).",
    "Great course. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Highly recommended to other students.",
    "I would recommend this class to other physics students. It presents different perspectives on quantum mechanics (second quantization, relativistic quantum mechanics) than are typically taught in earlier courses. It also covers very useful material like perturbation theory.",
    "Quantum II focuses on practical approaches to solving QM problems via many approximation methods and their applications to physical problems, as well as including common QM problems to be solved applicable to many research areas. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would recommend this course to all physics students, since it is a very useful introduction to slightly advanced quantum mechanics, which is extremely important in almost all areas of physics today.",
    "Phys 608 is a very well taught class. There is a lot of interesting and important information in it.",
    "I would recommend it. Even though I struggled with the course, I feel I now have a better understanding of quantum mechanics. That was largely due to professor."

   "comments": [
    "It is critical to my field, but I wish that some of the fundamentals had been more quickly covered in the first semester course so that we could have explored more advanced topics this semester.",
    "Scattering, perturbation theory, and the beginning of many-body quantum mechanics will be extremely useful to my research.",
    "This course provided a strong foundation for basic and practical skills for solving problemsin QM, and contributed to my own ability to understand how current issues are worked through as well as how they apply to NMR, my own research field.",
    "The more quantum mechanics I study, the more fluent in its language I become (naturally). I've noticed that this has already helped me greatly with picking up unfamiliar topics. So in that sense, it's been a great help!"
