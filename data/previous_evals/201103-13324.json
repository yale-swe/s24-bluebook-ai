   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student. In comparison to other sections of 114, I think my section on monsters was pretty interesting. Having a good topic for 114 is very important as writing about something you don't like or find boring can be really hard. Also I enjoyed writing my 2 research papers in this class.",
    "I wouldn't recommend 114, but that is just me personally. It could be very useful for some. It isn't too content intensive, which is nice for those who aren't particularly focused in English.",
    "I would recommend it to others. It was an interesting topic because you start out talking about what your idea of a \"monster\" is. But, by the end, you've covered so much discussion that has you looking at monsters from all kinds of different viewpoints and perspectives. So by the end, your perception of a monster has changed significantly from a more physical description to a more emotional or conceptual description. It was interesting.",
    "Not the most exciting class ever, but the readings are usually pretty interesting and it's not too much work.",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to be in an engaging and unique subject. This class is anything but boring, and the reading is both understandable and engaging. Papers are really not painful partially because the majority of them are about a topic you choose, and there is plenty of time to do a draft, discuss any issues with the instructor, and edit into a final draft. All in all, this was my favorite class of the semester, and I am currently debating whether I should take another English class the next semester partially because I will be constantly comparing it with this one.",
    "I loved it because of the topic and the freedom. So if you are interested in monsters, you should definitely take this class!",
    "Basic writing class with about 5 essays over the semester. I would recommend it because of its workload."
