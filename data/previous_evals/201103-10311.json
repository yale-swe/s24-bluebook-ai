    "It's a great class that provides a lot of hands-on experience with geophysical survey if you can make all the field trips, but still worth it if you can only make lecture and lab. Tim's a visiting professor but hopefully they'll offer it again. A rare class that offers real-world experience along with theory.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in using remote sensing techniques in an archaeological setting. By far the best and most comprehensive training I've had on this topic."

    "Remote sensing is becoming more and more common in archaeological research, so understanding the techniques used, and knowing how to use them myself are critical to being an archaeologist. Additionally, since I plan to work extensively with remote sensing techniques during my dissertation research, this course was perfect for preparing me for that."
