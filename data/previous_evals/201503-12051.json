    "Yes, I would recommend this class! It's a good amount of work that you do have to get done, but it is rewarding and it's fun to be in.",
    "You do the L4 French thing. Oohh the texts you read for this class are really amazing! Of course it's a bit of work, but that's language. Soumia Koundi is my favorite instructor at Yale. She's really great 3",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if the student is looking to improve his or her spoken and written French. The class is a lot of work, but if you put in the time, it is definitely worthwhile.",
    "I would definitely recommend! You'll learn a lot and read some interesting stories and books. However, it was about 1 1\/2-2 hours of homework each night. So that's a lot. Plus the tests every other week. But I think overall, it's worth it and it's a different type of work than psets and essays. Which can be really nice!",
    "Class with a high workload but very, very interesting especially if you want to learn about the parts of the world France has engaged with (often through colonialism or war). From the DRC, to Haiti and Vietnam this class offers a truly global perspective through the selection of readings and discussions you go through in the class."
