    "This course is perhaps the most informative course that I have taken at YSPH. It really makes you look at what public health really does and is taught by someone who's full time job is just that. Dr. Durante is funny, smart, and engaging (a great set of qualities for a class that went from 5pm to 7:30pm).I loved this class and I definitely feel that this class prepared me for a job in public health surveillance.",
    "i felt this course was complete in terms fot he information it provided but it was incredibly boring. i took this class as it was required but wish it had not been required as i would not have taken it otherwise. it seemed as though there were a few students who loved the class and the rest were as bored as i was.",
    "strengths:interesting topics and interactive lectures.weakness: the papers chosen for reading were dull",
    "I was initially very excited about taking this course, but that quickly turned. the class is offered so late in the afternoon that t is hard to pay attention. Surveillance is an interesting topic but does not need to be taught as a semester long course.",
    "better explanation on what to expect for the midterm and final project",
    "This has been one of my favorite classes at Yale. It is actually applicable to the real world and will give me a skill in the work place. So often Yale seems to forget that an MPH is a terminal degree and many of us will go on to work. This class was obviously made to help you in your future job. Thank you for that!",
    "Great course taught by Dr. Durante who is an expert in the field.",
    "I loved this course - it was a great introduction to the practical experience of conducting a surveillance assessment, as well as gave interesting examples of how to apply our skills to real situations. The class itself had a good mix of lecture and class discussion, and I really felt as though I came away with knowledge that I did not have going into the course.",
    "I think that this course could be improved by bringing in guest speakers to discuss the various surveillance systems that Professor Durante may not be as familiar with through her own work. I believe this year's class was larger than past years, and so group discussion was difficult, but I think the discussion of the assigned articles is useful in understanding and critiquing public health surveillance methods.",
    "The course is well-taught with an emphasis on both the present knowledge and future direction of public health surveillance. The only (small) drawback is that the class meets only once a week in the evening.",
    "Great class--gets a bit repetitive at the end. Would be nice to have guest speakers come in.",
    "Excellent course for those interested in surveillance. Nice mix of lecture and participation.",
    "This was a very excellent course. A great introduction to actual public health practice and disease surveillance. The only weakness would be the time that the course is offered - it was late and over dinner time, which was difficult at times.",
    "I thought this was an excellent class and I really enjoyed the semester. Unfortunately, because of the weather at the start of the semester it we missed out on a few classes. I liked that we were learning something with practical applications.",
    "I wish we had more assignments in the class.",
    "Strengths: Broad overview of the US Public Health Surveillance System. Infectious Disease is represented very well.Weaknesses: Individual surveillance systems are not covered in detail. Group projects.",
    "The class was basically an overview class of surveillance methods and systems. It covered basic concepts and rational for existing systems. It could have gone a little more in depth with system examples and how they operate.",
    "Class size is too large. Needs a TA.",
    "Good. But wish I was able to get more out of it. What I learned is basically what I can read from powerpoint slides and text book.",
    "Great"

    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0Dr. Durante's style is part instructor\/part cool co-worker. She teaches the class not in a way that is dry or mundane, but in a way that is engaging and grounded in experience.Dr. Durante is current the epidemiologist for New Haven and thus relies on a wealth of experience. It's fascinating to hear her insights on what needs to be done and what has been done with respect to public health surveillance. I have never learned so much from one course at YSPH as I have in this class.My advise to other students, take it!",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0i felt that the majority of what the professor did was read off the slides. sometimes it took her days to response to questions via email and sometimes she did not respond at all or her response were short, sometimes borderline rude, or not helpful. seems that she is quite busy with her day job and teaching clearly feel way behind that. we did not get out midterm exams back until the last day of class, never received comments from our group projects, and therefore dont know how she is really going to grade our final projects.",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0strength: great ability to lead discussion with students.the class would have been much smoother with the aid of a TA.",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0Instructor attempted to make the subject matter interesting. Provided many examples via readings.",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0schedule was sometimes unclear, instructor can be more organized.Instructor should add a small break, instead of 2 hours straight teaching.",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0She is fantastic. Dr. Durante is absolutely down-to-earth and knowledgeable yet not pretentious. She gave a perspective that was so helpful. Instead of being academic and saying how it should be she said how it actually was. I wish that more professors here would take this route. Plus, she was really approachable and willing to talk to students. Dr. Durante is my favorite instructor at Yale so far.",

    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0Amanda Durante has a lot of great real world experience here in the US and the UK which helps her bring a wider range of examples of surveillance systems to the table. She is a very energetic and knowledgeable professor who very good at engaging her class in discussion.",

   "comments": [
    "Definitely take the class. I had my doubts when I signed up, but not since Epi I have I learned so much from one professor.",
    "overall, this course provided a good overview of surveillance for public health. however, i found the actual lectures and reading boring. unless you have an intense interest in public heath surveillance, skip it.",
    "great course. i would recommend it to any student who would like a background in program evaluation and surveillance.",
    "Overview of what surviellance is and how to use it",
    "I would only recommend it if you are going to work in public health surveillance",
    "Take it if you want to gain a skill that will help you in the workforce.I had a job interview and they focused on very specific epidemiology data questions; this class helped me more than any other class when answering their questions.",
    "Starts off slow because most of the assignment are due later in the semester. Otherwise, I thought it was a great introduction to surveillance. Dr. Durante uses many real life experiences due to her role as the Epidemiologist of New Haven.",
    "While this course is very useful to anyone looking to pursue an internship\/career in local\/state public health departments, due to its narrow focus I would only encourage students who are specifically interested in public health surveillance methods to take this course. There is one midterm exam, one group presentation, and one final group paper\/presentation. The course is very straightforward and assigned readings are necessary but short and easy to complete.",
    "The course is relevant to those interested in epidemiology and public health surveillance. I would recommend it to another student as it is relevant for a career in public health.",
    "Good course--WAY too many students.",
    "If you are interested in surveillance, definitely take it. You'll learn a lot and, if you're willing to participate, class will go by quickly. If not, I'd skip it.",
    "This course is an introduction to surveillance methodology. You are taught about the different types of surveillance systems, where and how they might be used, and also learn about applying it in different settings - disaster, limited resources, etc.",
    "This class is a step-by-step walk through of public health surveillance, particularly of infectious disease but covering other topics as well. Grades are based off of a small presentation, midterm, participation, and a final project and presentation.",
    "Great public health course with a real world perspective. Can be a bit repetitive at times but you will learn a lot in this class, from Dr, Durante and your peers.",
    "The class is ideal as an introduction to public health surveillance and epidemiology. I would recommend it for first year students wanting to explore the field of public health surveillance.",
    "Great",
    "Yes,it is useful for a MPH student. Surveillance is very important."
