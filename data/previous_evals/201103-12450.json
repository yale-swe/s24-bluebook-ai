    "I did not find this class to be particularly well-taught. I did come away from this class with a stronger grasp of Latin than when I came in, and the readings were interesting (if not a bit repetitive). However, I am not sure if that can be directly attributed to Prof. Solodow. Much of that came from painstakingly reading the commentary. The work load I found to be unpredictable and widely varying: the number of lines we were supposed to translate varied from 30 to 90 every Monday and Wednesday. Consider that it is held at 9:00 a.m. every morning. It is a very impersonal setting. Prof. Solodow comes off as very cool and oftentimes unapproachable, even if he is very knowledgeable about the topic. I did not find the papers to be helpful, as they were only supposed to be three and a half pages, which I found to be too short to say anything interesting. It was sometimes slightly uncomfortable to discuss body parts or sex positions in class, as they related to the text. I probably would have been better off taking another upper-division Latin course offered this semester."
