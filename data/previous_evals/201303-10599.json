    "Not particularly exciting, but it isn't horrible. I would say that I enjoyed it for the most part.",
    "French 130 is basically a review and extension of 110 and 120. It's not a very riveting course, but the books and films that we watch and discuss are way more interesting that Mireille and Robert of 110\/120.",
    "Yes, French 130 is one of the more challenging language classes that I've taken, relative to L1\/L2 but you also gain so much from it. It's challenging, but definitely manageable and you'll walk away from it being able to read real French literature!",
    "I would describe it as intense yet extremely fulfilling.Yes I would, because it focuses on the building blocks of the language that we often take for granted.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was a really important and in-depth review of key grammar concepts that I needed. We also read some cool books.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who's taken French in high school but would like to make sure they've got the language basics down.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! You learn so much about French, especially if your French teachers in high school only covered the basics.",
    "One learns a multitude of verb tenses and expands\/emphasizes on previously learned grammar and verb tenses.",
    "A CLASS WHERE I READ CAMUS AND OTHER FRENCH OUVRES.I ALSO TRIED TO MASTER GRAMMAR SKILLS."
