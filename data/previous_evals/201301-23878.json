   "comments": [
    "It's a fantastic course where you learn about everything cutting edge there is to know about neuroscience. I highly highly recommend this course.",
    "The course covers an interesting range of topics, but if you have only a very basic background in neuroscience, chances are you will have a very difficult time understanding much of the material. The invited speakers seem to assume that all the students are neuroscience students, which makes asking questions when you do not understand something daunting for fear of soundingunintelligent. This class is good to take if you want just a very basic survey of the types of neurological diseases that are under active research, but if you are expecting a deeper engagement with this sort of material, look elsewhere.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student. We learned so much about neurological disorders and were able to identify several themes.",
    "Yes. I thought it provided a nice overview of neurological disease from both a clinical and basic science perspective.",
    "This class goes through a lot of stuff you'll already know, and you'll be bored a lot because of that. Some of the stuff is interesting and new, but mostly not. We'll put it this way: I wouldn't not recommend it, but I wouldn't run around telling everyone they needed to take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Chandra is excellent. She is very relaxed, and at the same time, incredibly knowledgeable. The set up of the class is also excellent, because you get to learned about various neurological conditions from experts in the field.",
    "I would recommend the course. It would be a great course to get to know many neurological diseases and trying to link your own interest to some of them. It is always good to know some of your own work can help some group of people.And this course also opens up some possibilities; you get an overall ideaabout some diseases and you can invest more if you want to.",
    "This class is so unique compared to the other courses I've taken in MCDB. It's perfect for someone doing the neurobiology concentration in MCDB, and it's extremely relevant to premed students. I really enjoyed hearing from the lecturers we had each week, as the majority of them were researchers at the top of their field or experienced doctors. Even better, most of them were very good lecturers, and Professor Chandra chose them well. I really enjoyed coming to class. Professor Chandra herself is also a nice professor and engaging lecturer.You basically learn about fascinating material (from HIV infection of the CNS to ALS) from Yale researchers\/doctors who are extremely experienced, and the class covers a new topic each session so you get a great background in neurological diseases. The workload is not too heavy, and the presentations and assignments we had were meaningful and not just cramming for exams (we had a 30 min presentation and abrief final paper along with class participation). I felt like I learned so much from this class compared to another science course I took in MCDB with different lecturers every session that had only two exams and was disorganized.",
    "I think this course should almost be a required course for MD-PhD neuroscience students. It's an opportunity to continue to think about the intersection between clinical work and basic research.This course is also great for advanced undergraduates as they get a chance to interact with graduate students and forced to think about the science rather than to regurgitate the facts (who really remembers all the steps of the Kreb's cycle?)."

   "comments": [
    "I will take what I learned from this course with me through the rest of my career. It was great to learn about the neuroscience fields out there and to be introduced to the papers.",
    "I took this course based purely on personal interest and a desire to advance my basic background in neuroscience. However, I felt that the course was poorly matched with my incoming level of background already, and as a result, I do not feel like I learned much. Ultimately, however, the content of this course has no bearing on my own research area, since I am not in the neuroscience department.",
    "I learned more about neurological disease outside of my field of interest.",
    "To my research, very little. To my knowledge, I have found myself in the last few weeks talking about various diseases and saying things like, \"oh in the class I took, we talked about this...\", so I must have learned something!",
    "I'm an undergraduate, so I won't be writing a dissertation. However, I felt that this course greatly deepened my knowledge of neuroscience and neurological disease.",
    "As a graduate student, this course is a good introduction to many neurological diseases. It is hardly anything entirely new but definitely good to keep in mind a clinical relevance.",
    "This class is so unique compared to the other courses I've taken in MCDB. It's perfect for someone doing the neurobiology concentration in MCDB, and it's extremely relevant to premed students. I really enjoyed hearing from the lecturers we had each week, as the majority of them were researchers at the top of their field or experienced doctors. Even better, most of them were very good lecturers, and Professor Chandra chose them well. I really enjoyed coming to class. Professor Chandra herself is also a nice professor and engaging lecturer.This course was also relevant to me because of the research I do in lab as part of my senior thesis, which was discussed in the lectures as well. I know I will use so much of what I learned in class in medical school.",
    "To be quite honest I had not thought about neuroradiology as a viable craeer option prior to this course but during the MS radiology lecture the lecturer gave a good background of the technology and and overview of how some of the technologies are used for research purposes. I've chosen contact some of the neuroradiologist to get more clinical exposure to see if this a field that might be a good fit for me."
