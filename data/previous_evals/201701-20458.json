    "I built a robot! And then used it to learn about humans!",
    "Exposure to a wide variety of research topics and papers! Programming skills for robots in a research setting.",
    "I learnt about the bleeding edge of robotics, learnt how to craft a research study (and run it) and learnt a hell of a lot on my own about how to design robotic systems. Amazing course.",
    "How to work with ROS to program a robot, an overview of a state-of-the-art in robotics research, how to work in a team to develop and address a research problem.",
    "I learned how to program in ROS and how to run a research study from start to finish.",
    "This course trained me in critical thinking, planning and teamwork. The major part of the course is centered around a team-wide project, so the skills learned may vary depending on which kind of project is chosen, but in my team's case it taught us valuable skills in ROS (Robot Operating System) and Python."

   "comments": [
    "This course is unstructured, on purpose. At times this felt scary, but it forced my research group to figure stuff out and be agile. I think that was the point of it.",
    "Pros: papers and topics are exciting and current! Cons: Quality of class will be contingent on the quality of the people who sign up + the amount of energy they invest in their assigned topics. This is usually not a problem but not everyone put the same amount of time into preparing.",
    "Could be a bit more hands on in terms of Scaz's involvement but that was the point of the course (to get students to sort of self motivate and self run it). Otherwise it was great but there were some parts of the final products (essay and study) that we could really have used help on that was just not provided or provided too late.",
    "Reading and presenting recent scientific papers was a great way to learn about the state of robotics. I do wish more of it had been about related developments in AI and machine learning, but that may be because of personal preference.",
    "Very hands-on project oriented course with interesting in-class discussions about current topics in robotics. The only improvement I would suggest is starting the projects a week earlier, with perhaps more aggressive check-ins to keep everyone on schedule.",
    "The course's greatest strength is its central project, which was engaging and drove students to learn skills through novel, unpredictable situations. I think the course's main weakness was the lecture presentations: during lectures, the best moments come from the discussions, which are always cut short, and the prior presentations often mostly recap reading material we were assigned for the session. Assuming everyone read the material and having students lead discussions immediately with questions, and additional knowledge on demand, would likely enable a better understanding of the topics."

   "comments": [
    "If you are a CS major, don't graduate Yale without taking this class! Whether or not you plan to do research in the future, this class teaches you how to come up with a research question, design an experiment, and analyze results. Note: can be very work-heavy towards the mid\/end of the semester, but other than that is very chill. Each class one person presents on a topic and if you aren't presenting you just have to read a quick paper. You will have a fun time playing with the robots too!",
    "A super chill class until your final project is due, and then you mad scramble to finish. But overall, Scaz is great and it's a super fun class to sit around and talk about robotics issues.",
    "Take this course if you have the chance- truly unique opportunity to work with specialized lab hardware + learn from peers who are excited and motivated about robotics with one of the greats in the field!",
    "As someone interested in tech and robotics I would HIGHLY recommend the course.",
    "If you've never done CS-related research at Yale, or anything related to robotics, and want somewhere to start, this is where you should. A great way to embark upon (potentially very interesting) research project that may eventually form the basis of a senior project. You're provided with access to ScazLab with its array of robots, and all the expertise and resources that lab has to offer. The one thing I would caution is you have to be self-motivated - what you get out of this course depends on how much you put in. Your research will only be interesting and novel if you put lots of work into it, and you'll only learn as much as you can from the papers if you actually read them rather than just listening to the presentations in class.",
    "Yes, if you're into robotics and you took 472, take it! Scaz knows what he's doing and the lab is fun to work in. The end product of your project is something you can put on your resume.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, though I'd recommend it specifically to students interested in DIY projects. As this course requires extensive coordination with teammates and has an unpredictable, though usually high workload, I'd recommend a student take this course only take it if they feel they can dedicate the time for it, otherwise they might risk holding their team back. However, the course itself is tremendously useful, and often even thrilling. The course puts its students on the cutting edge of robotics, and we all worked on projects we created ourselves that had never been attempted before in the field. No other course I have taken has given me the same sense of agency, and through it I learned many skills I would never have planned for in a typical classroom setting. I'd even go as far as to say that this course is essential to anyone willing to work in the field of robotics, as it gives more practical know-how than any course, and genuine insight on how team research projects operate."
