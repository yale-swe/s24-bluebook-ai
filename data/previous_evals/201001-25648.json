    "Unbelievable. Best course I've ever taken. Try to do as much of the readings as possible. If you don't you won't get as much out of it.",
    "Best History Seminar at YaleAbove all it's a class on the foundations of the international system. Except instead of all the crap from IR theory, you experience it first hand through actual historical occurrences. Because WWI is so central in historical narratives, you have to project backwards to explain why we got there and project forward to explain why WWII came and how the international system shifted going forward. So i generally feel like even though the course is a very narrow window, I got an appreciation for the scope of european\/international history from Bismarck to Bin Laden.Take it",
    "I would recommend this course to students with extensive background in European history, although this might be less relevant if there are many students in the course with less background. Professor Tooze is an excellent professor and a valuable mentor, and has what seems to be an encyclopedic knowledge of the source materials and scholarly debate on the period in question. You have the rare chance to feel like your opinion is actually valued by the professor on an academic level. The flip side of this is that you can't expect to just breeze through a discussion, because he will press you to back up your points. Overall a sometimes frustrating but ultimately valuable experience.",
    "YES! Democracy and Peacemaking is very likely the most innovative course I have ever taken, and will take, in my time at Yale. If you have even the slightest interest in either Great War or American international history, this course is essential to completing your study. What amazed me most is that from start to finish, this course can be taught in one way in one semester and a completely different way in a different semester. Professor Tooze assigns readings and discussion topics organically, so as to build off of each previous discussion. He is a master of the seminar room, crafting a perfect balance of lecture and discussion time. Although expectations are high here (one 10 page historiography paper, one 25 page final research paper), you will become a much deeper thinker by semester's end by putting in the effort. Professor Tooze truly challenges his students, but as a testament to his classroom method, he uses our discussions as a means of shaping his own evolving vision of this formative era.Although it may seem daunting, with hard work and an open mind, you will get more out of this course than perhaps any other of the junior seminar brand at Yale."
