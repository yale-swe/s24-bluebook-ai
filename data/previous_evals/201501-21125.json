    "This class wasn't very applicable to my major (MB&B), but it did offer a lot more that I hope to use in the future, because I think I'd like to go into pharmacology. The end goal of my research is to isolate active compounds from natural products, but as I'm not there yet, this class doesn't help much with my research right now, but it should help if I get a bit farther."
