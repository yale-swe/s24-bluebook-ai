   "comments": [
    "Music 110 is for people who are just starting out in music, its a basic theory class, and music theory isn't always fun or interesting, but its applications can be appreciated. I would recommend it.",
    "Introductory music theory is a good class for someone who has a little or no music background, or someone who wants to learn to read music. It was great to think about musical concepts that seemed abstract before this class in a much more structured manner.",
    "Wonderful class. Learned a lot. Definitely a gem worth taking",
    "This class served as a great intro course for people who want to learn music theory and understanding how to read music. I had a class that ranged from people with absolutely no experience with music to fellow students who've sang and played instruments their entire lives by ear, and all of us were challenged in the class. Also, the class is small enough that it feels comfortable asking your professor questions. I certainly came out of the class having noticiably improved my knowledge and understanding of sheet music, as well as being able to pinpoint intervals and harmonies while listening to songs. I will say though that it requires you to put in a large deal of work to keep up and actually get the understanding out of it, especially with homeworks; don't expect it to be light work.",
    "It is a great course with no prior knowledge needed. The basics are covered right away and I felt like I learned a lot throughout the semester.",
    "I'd highly recommend this class for anyone with even a passing interest in music. I do not intend to be a music major, but as a member of the YPMB and just as somebody who loves the idea of music, this class has opened up so many doors in terms of appreciation of music and music theory.",
    "If you are looking for an introduction to music, this is your course! It teaches you the fundamentals of music theory so that you feel comfortable with the vocab. By the end of the course, you will be able to read music. Depending on the section, you might also have ear training to recognize intervals and pitches. Keyboard practice may be included. As with most intro course, there is a decent amount of homework to help drill in the basics (they do a good job of doing so). However, the workload is manageable, especially if you keep up with it and don't put it off.",
    "Great class as taught by Rebecca Perry. Not that much work but definitely gives a very solid foundation in music theory."
