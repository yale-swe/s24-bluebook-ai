   "comments": [
    "I think that this was a course that planned to address many interesting ideas about influence and the seduction of a culture or place, and failed to deliver. I felt that the theme of \"After Cavafy\" essentially fell apart very quickly, and did not seem to really be a consistent strand in the course. The question of why Brits and Americans were interested in Greece and Cavafy was never addressed sufficiently. Much of the course work seemed extraneous and uninteresting and not good. For whatever reason, much of this was work by Greek authors.",
    "It's a grab-bag seminar about the literature of the Eastern Mediterranean, with a focus on gender and erotics. Professors Hammer and Syrimis make an hilarious pair, the former thoughtfully helping us learn, the latter rubbing his belly and sweating and giggling. It's a little too eclectic, and the way the different readings connect isn't made clear enough to the students to make us understand why we should be doing all this reading. Discussions are nice, though.",
    "Take this course! Class is always engaging and entertaining. You get to read awesome poetry (Cavafy, Merrill, Sappho, for example) and learn about the Eastern Mediterranean world. Also, convince George to hold a class party at his house.",
    "Yes, definitely. Cavafy is amazing.",
    "If you ever have a chance to take a class with either Professor Hammer or Syrimis -- but especially if they are teaching together -- do so. No questions asked. Professor Hammer has a beautifully subtle mind, and I both enjoyed and gained much from listening to his comments during class. Unlike some teachers -- the brilliance of whom can become difficult to hold onto as it zips by on their fast-paced far-reaching mental railways -- Professor Hammer frames each of his comments carefully, in such a way that they always culminate in something one can grasp and take home as food for thought.",
    "It was my Credit\/D class, so I would recommend it for something like that. It's somewhat too loosely designed to be able to count on things being the same or ensuring a particular grade, so if you were considering taking it for a grade, I probably wouldn't.",
    "Langdon Hammer and George Syrimis are hilarious together. Nearly every class devolved at once point into wild laughter at something one of them had said. The workload is more than manageable (in fact, I think in the future the course would benefit from having more work and more structure). You also have complete freedom on both the midterm and final papers, so the focus of the class is what you make of it - which can be both frustrating and rewarding."
