   "comments": [
    "a terrific class! the professor is really nice and really takes the time to prepare good lectures. definitely enjoyable.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class for any history major. It's a great history class with a great professor.",
    "If you're interested in British history and how the Empire affected Britain, take this class. It's really entertaining, and it's fascinating to see the beginnings of globalization from a British lens. I would strongly recommend Britain's Empire.",
    "Semmel is a great lecturer and really engaging. He doesn't really grade promptly, but I loved him in lecture. Take it if you usually hate lecture courses because they make you fall asleep: Semmel won't make you fall asleep.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in Imperialism and attaining a different perspective as to how Imperialism functioned in the British Empire. It is an incredibly interesting course.",
    "Why not - super easy in terms of workload. Midterm, Paper, Final. The final was hard, but that might just be a fluke this year. Good fifth class.",
    "Interesting class that is worth taking. Professor Semmel is one of the best professors at Yale. Although this class was meant to be kind of a combo lecture\/discussion, there was very little discussion--though people who wanted to say something were certainly given the opportunity. The reading is really reasonable and mostly pretty interesting.",
    "This was such a great course. Semmel always had interesting lectures, and even the readings were enjoyable. The workload was fair and manageable, just don't save all the readings for the week before the midterm\/final! We also had to write one 9-12 page paper, which was also somewhat fun to write. All in all, Semmel is a fair grader and keeps the lectures interesting. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested.",
    "A survey of British imperial history from around the time of the colonies to today. Note that you will get lots of exposure to primary and secondary sources. Shop the lecture to see if you like it (some felt it was disorganized and\/or dry). Most importantly, this class covers topics like the Raj, India, and Africa, not Disraeli or Thatcher. However, its something everyone should learn at least once.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the material",
    "Take it for sure if you want to get a well rounded knowledge base on the British Empire. Stuart Semmel has an easy to follow lecture style and soothing (sometimes sleep-inducing, but not in the boring way) voice. Unless you are a history buff who knows everything about the British Empire and the social history of it, take it.",
    "Professor Semmel organized the course well and managed to cover a lot of ground. He's also quite funny; if you're interested in the subject you'll definitely enjoy it.",
    "History 239 is an indepth look at the British Empire and its consequences. It really covers every aspect of the empire--social, political, geographical, cultural. I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for an interesting history class or a good class on Britain. The Empire had influences all over the world, so it is a good history class no matter what area of the world you're interested in.",
    "This was a very good class, and I feel like I learned a lot about places that I had never studied closely before, especially India and Australasia. Disclaimer- this class is about the empire, not Britain. Lectures were interesting but not inspirational and the discussion aspect didn't work very well. It was difficult to study for the midterm and final in that it was hard to know what would come up and what terms mattered more than others. A combo of lecture and Dalziel notes worked best.",
    "Good overview of the British empire. Vague at times, but pretty easy to follow. Exams not particularly difficult, and Semmel is a good lecturer.",
    "Great class. Very broad topic, but the subject is really interesting. Not too much work either.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are at all interested in British history."
