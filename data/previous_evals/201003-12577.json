    "Take this class if you want to improve your speaking and writing skills in Portuguese. It was a great way to keep practicing and the topics (Brazilian politics, literature, history, as well as some current events) are very interesting. Just know that there's not much structure to the class--but it's worth it if you really want to keep up your Portuguese.",
    "Awesome class, manageable workload, and you learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend taking this course for anyone who enjoys speaking the language and wants to continue doing so.",
    "If you're at L5, you already know what it's like to take Portuguese at Yale. Paulo is talkative but fun and class is very laid-back. It's basically sitting around a table and discussing various topics about Brazil. Low work-load."
