   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "The material is difficult, and the class is fast-paced, but you end up learning a lot! I would certainly recommend this class and professor to another student.",
    "Yes - but it's a lot of work (pretty time consuming).",
    "Fantastic class",
    "You have to take it or pass out of it. Standard course.",
    "It is a great course not only to understand E&M, but also understand a lot of ideas in field theory and physics in general. If you would pounder more on the materials, it would really help you to grasp the beauty of electromagnetism.",
    "I would recommend physics 502 to another student because I learned a lot from it and had a good time taking it. It is a course that complements and extends on what I learned in undergrad even though an upper level undergrad EM course wasn't a prerequisite. The lectures were great, the homework taught you a lot and gave you a lot of practice with practical\/quals type problems.",
    "yes, it covers all of basic electrostatics and electrodynamics. It covers the theory and teaches how to solve problems from first principles.",
    "This is a hard class, but I learned a huge amount. It was by far the best class I took this semester.",
    "This is a good course not only to learn about EM but also to know some mathematical techniques that we can apply to other fields of physics.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student because the topics covered are useful in many fields of physics. Additionally the methods that prof. goldberger taught us in this course are pretty useful across the board. the course covered both deeper concepts and problem-solving well. It also put the subject and the methods used in perspective",
    "Yes, it will be helpful.",
    "Yes. It's a good class, and it helps you to gain understanding of fields, waves, and special relativity.",
    "Yes I would. I would say the course is mathematically demanding, but very beneficial to the fellow students especially who will do some theoretical research.",
    "it is a good graduate e&m course. i would recommend goldberger's class to a fellow classmate"

   "comments": [
    "This class is obviously crucial to grad students in physics, and I did learn something which I feel is valuable.",
    "Electrodynamics is an important branch of physics and I feel like I learned it.",
    "Good stuff.",
    "It is very important",
    "I am currently working in an applied physics lab where EM is very important. It wasn't a subject I had any great love for before taking 502, but now I understand it at a deeper level and like it a lot better. Some of the topics we covered like waveguides I had seen before, but is very important to the type of work I'm doing.",
    "It strengthened my knowledge of E&M",
    "Now, I am more confortable about tensor notations and boundary value problem. I wish that we could learn about Green's funstion more systematically.",
    "This course certainly widened my knowledge of the field and my appreciation for the subject.",
    "I think that it will definitely be helpful later.",
    "It doesn't relate to my research but is still a good fundamental course to have.",
    "Thiscourse hones my mathematical ability. Or, at least, it exposes some of my weakness in maths in physics. I think it will be extremely beneficial to look back on the teacher's notes again.",
    "the course makes me want to study the relativistic side of e&m more."
