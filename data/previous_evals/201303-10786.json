    "If they want to learn Chinese - they must.",
    "yes I would. Chinese is an amazing language and even though it is quite difficult, I believe that everyone should take it. It really opens you up to new worlds",
    "L5....It still meets 5 days a week. Huge time commitment. You do one chapter a week, and each chapter has 75-80 characters each. The teachers are great (Wang and Chan laoshi). 3 quizzes a week, one Monday, one Tuesday, and one Wednesday. You have online homework due Thursday, and book exercises due Friday. And an essay each weekend due on Monday. Tests are pretty tough, but the oral tests are graded pretty leniently.",
    "Yes, if you are prepared to work!",
    "Yes. But be wary that it is a difficult class. I took this class as someone who took a year off of Chinese and that made it hard to get back into a rhythm. It was a lot of work (more so that L1\/L2 in my opinion) but you learn a ton of Chinese and the teachers do a great job of making sure you keep up with your work.",
    "A lot more work than the lower level classes; you will need to devote some time in memorizing characters.",
    "It's a good way to keep practicing every day and learn more vocabulary and grammar, especially if you studied in China over the summer and want to solidify what you learned. However, I thought the class really lacked an emphasis on speaking skills - there was a lot of speaking along with the teacher or reciting the text that we were assigned for homework. There were some class discussions (and once a week most of the class time is devoted to discussing the material from the readings), but I wish there had been more structured speaking practice\/oral grammar drills. It's worth it to keep up your listening skills and learn some more vocabulary, though.",
    "It is an intense course. take it if you take chinese seriously",
    "I came into this class having taken L1\/L2 Chinese last year and having spent the summer in China on a Light Fellowship. Purely in terms of daily workload, this class was definitely easier than the summer classes those who have had Light Fellowship experience were exposed to. However, in combination with four other classes, the nightly homework came to be somewhat of a burden, with 1-2 hours nightly of studying characters\/vocabulary and a 600-character essay (draft or final) due each Monday. That being said, my Chinese definitely improved over the semester, and I would recommend the class to anyone who wants to continue effectively building on the past two years of Chinese study."
