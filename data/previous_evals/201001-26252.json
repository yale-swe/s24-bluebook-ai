   "comments": [
    "Strengths:- Interactive- Interesting topics and readingsWeakness:- Midterm and final projects for oral and written were too similar (4 of the same assignments!).- Did not tie ALL public health classes together. It would have been nice to use biostatistics, methods, psychosocial, epi, etc. work into the case studies.- Oral presentations: Questions should be more public health focused.",
    "(+): Role play for presentation almost imitates a real environment of consulting field(-): Theoretically weak. Over-dependency on cases which are not too differentiated with other management school courses.",
    "This course provides an excellent framework for problem solving. I have already used it in a number of my other presentations\/projects. It feels like the subject matter is somewhat soft, and doesn't provide any casework to help us gain perspective.",
    "great to bring in outside speakers. great enthusiasm. great overall feel and flow to the course.",
    "The cases are great exercises, and I got very good presentation skills out of the class. The readings get a little jargon heavy.",
    "Great course to finish the HMP curriculum. It was informative, challenging, and skill building.",
    "I was really looking forward to this course--especially taking a course taught by Betsy. Although the course started out interesting with learning the problem solving paradigm, I felt like more relevant, real-life information should have been taught. A few weeks on problem solving paradigm is more than enough, and the remaining weeks should have covered other material. Overall, the reading was slightly boring and dense. But the articles by Berwick where the most interesting and relevant. That being said, I would recommend for next year that class be revamped. The course should keep focused on being the capstone to the HMP program. It should in fact tie together the material learned in our other required courses, while arming us with knowledge, tactics etc that we can use and actually apply to our HMP related endeavors following graduation.",
    "Very good class, good overview of the concepts of management. Valuable.",
    "I think the course was great for improving people's communication and presentation skills, as well as general critical thinking and crafting organized written strategy reports."

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Professor Betsy Bradley did a great job of engaging all students to participate in class. Her lectures were interactive and engaging. For the oral presentations, she invited senior management for the audience -- this allowed for a more professional, management setting.Her feedback on the oral and written exams were too general and did not provide suggestions on improvement.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0(+): Very passionate about teaching. Very responsive to students' needs(-): Looks like the instructors are confused with professionalism with rudeness. Needs to narrow down more rather than talking about general management issues.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Dr. Bradley is a great speaker and a captivating professor. She connects well when you're with her face to face but is not very accessible given her many other engagements.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0excellent. no improvements necessary! :)",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Bets is a great, I would prefer if she had more lectures grounded in applying the problem solving framework and less on explaining it.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Dr. Bradley is fantastic. She gives great feedback, is a wonderful lecturer and really cares that her students learn.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Betsy absolutely knows her information, and is an amazing professor. However, I don't think that was really portrayed in this course. The material thought was a bit dry and nottoo much innovative information or topics were discussed. I wish I had other opportunities to take courses with her.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Very good, a bit tough.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Betsy provides great feedback and is very approachable. It would be nice if she were tougher with her presentation criticisms...sometimes she was too nice! Overall, a dynamic leader of the class and a great lecturer."

   "comments": [
    "The course gives students the opportunity to work in groups and apply different skills and knowledge.I would recommend the topics to cover more public health issues -- not just hospital administration\/operations and insurance. This could be done by giving students the option to do any case for written exams (for midterm and final).",
    "Yes.",
    "This course gives a great framework for problem solving and the understanding behind a number of executive level decisions and parties.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. You get to learn how to present, write reports, analyze situations critically, and problem solve.",
    "Meant to be a culminating experience for HMP students. Although the problem solving paradigm is interesting and I can see its usefulness, I was not too excited about the other elements of the course and felt that additional information and topics should have been covered that were more relevant to the working world that went beyond going through the problem solving steps.",
    "This course is a good introduction to management concepts. While it is valuable for all sorts of students, with different backgrounds, I would say it is easier for those with a management background. I would recommend it to others as well, but they should be aware that it will be a challenge if they do not have a finance\/management background. Overall highly recommended.",
    "Overall, this course is a good learning experience. It helps students to articulate and present ideas better both verbally and in writing. Very worthwhile for people interested in strategy and effective leadership."
