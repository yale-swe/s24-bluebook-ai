    "Gained an understanding of the scientific fundamentals and history of electrification and power generation, Yale and energy, e-cars, solar power, GPS\/spectroscopy\/medical imaging, etc. Synthesized a lot of journal articles for the student presentation and final paper.",
    "I developed greater listening skills and learned how to learn from lectures. I also worked through the problems sets in a new way.",
    "I learned many useful things about electrification and the generation of different type of energy.",
    "I developed a better understanding of both the fundamental principles behind various examples of modern technology and their possible implications for the future. This course helped me learn how to view technology comprehensively- at once thinking of the economic, historical, social, and environmental ramifications of some of the most important and ubiquitous technologies today. In fact, there were many technologies that I make use of every day which I had never properly appreciated before this course. From magnetic levitation train technology to desalination techniques, this course gave a nice overview of up and coming tech as well.",
    "I learned a lot more about electricity and fundamental technologies. I also had more insight on Yale's actual workings.",
    "I learned how various technologies of our world work that I otherwise would not have known."

   "comments": [
    "Interesting material, but the class would have benefited from having an interactive component during the longer lectures. More structure, like an overview of each lecture's main points at the start of class, would really have helped my learning.",
    "Some lectures sound a bit repetitive and boring, I think they could be replaced by more exciting new technologies. The strengths were that everything was stuff I'd never seen before and Professor Prober was extremely knowledgeable about everything",
    "This was an incredible course. I loved it.",
    "At time, the expectations of the class are hard to gauge. Details on assignments might be a bit spotty at times. Further clarification would be helpful, and the instructor was certainly willing to give clarification if asked specifically. Additionally it might be helpful for the concepts behind some of the math-based p-set questions to be addressed more directly in class. In general, this was a varied and worthwhile course. An introduction to the science fundamentals of things we often take for granted without getting so technical as to be impossible for non-science majors.",
    "I liked how intimate the classroom but wish there were more opportunity for direct engagement on a day to day basis, and also for more coverage of modern technology.",
    "Overall the course was very good. I especially enjoyed the mini field trips we took around various Yale facilities. One way it can be improved is if we practice more problems similar to those on the problem sets during class."

   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you're specifically interested in energy-related technologies and their historical development. This class has a pretty light workload and you'll definitely learn a lot when making your presentation and writing your final paper, but what you get out depends on what you put in--and to do well academically, you don't really have to put in all that much. The lectures are a bit dry but also cover very interesting material (think scientific facts and historical tidbits), and Prof. Prober is extremely nice and smart; his passion for the topics will probably make you excited as well. This class also features a lot of cool science demos (liquid nitrogen, optical fibers, heat engines, solar toys) and field trips to the Yale power plant, Kroon hall, and the nanotech lab.",
    "Yes. I had a great time. I learned about stuff I'd always known about but never knew how they worked. So I thought it was a relevant and exciting class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to both science and non-science majors. It is an intriguing class that is both relevant to today's society and scientific.",
    "Yes, I would, particularly to students who have an interest in science but are not planning on majoring in the sciences. This is the kind of course that reminds one of the amazing potential of science and helps one to appreciate its significance in our society. It thus gives a good perspective to students who might not otherwise engage with science intellectually at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this to students looking for a Science credit that's approachable."
