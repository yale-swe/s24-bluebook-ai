    "The course was extremely helpful in the critical analysis of humanitarian action and the ethics involved in it.",
    "Through working with the Slim textbook, I felt as though I gained a solid survey of fundamental humanitarian principles. From the case studies, I was able to practically apply many of the principles and theories we had learned to specific situations.",
    "I learned to think about humanitarian action and the decisions involved in carrying out operations in a very critical way. The moral and ethical questions posed by humanitarian intervention are extremely nuanced and this class provided a good framework to analyze these topics.",
    "I learned to think more critically about the humanitarian aid and it's nuances, its not just good or bad rather its effectiveness and necessity depends on the circumstance."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Moral Ethical Dilemmas in Humanitarian Action is a course that stress the importance of taking into account cultural differences and human dignity. It is a great class because it sensitizes Yale students about those issues while avoiding to promote a white savior complex",
    "The course is structured as a seminar and the small group size enabled a lot of conversation and gave us the opportunity to discuss ideas openly",
    "This was an incredibly interesting course but I found the model of having students present every week to detract from the learning environment. I would much rather have Unni and the incredible guests speak more. I am there to learn from them.",
    "I found it an incredible asset to be able to speak to various experts over skype each week. The main weakness may be that students relied heavily on PowerPoint presentations, but then again there was a lot of information to compress into 45 min!",
    "Unni brings a wealth of experience to this course, but unfortunately, I think we didn't get to discuss this as much because much of every class was taken up by long student presentations. This class would benefit from fewer and shorter presentations and more insight provided by the course instructor and the guest speakers.",
    "The class had interesting speakers and introduced concepts that need to be thought about in the humanitarian field."

    "Yes, I would recommend this course to students interested in global health, international relations and students seeking to work in NGOs and humanitarian organizations.",

    "Give the opportunity to engage the course with Dr. Karunakara, I would highly recommend this to other students (and already have)!",
    "I would recommend with reservations. The topic was interesting, but the way the course was taught left much to be desired."
