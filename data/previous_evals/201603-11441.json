   "comments": [
    "the fundamental of politics",
    "Incredible introduction into philosophy; I learned a lot of basics",
    "This year we read famous books of known political philosophers (ranging from Plato to Rawls). We did the readings on our own and Professor Pogge talked about the important \/ interesting points of the books we read. Besides, he highlighted main arguments of each author and mentioned about the valid criticisms and how their arguments could be improved. This study method helped me build more philosophical insight: creating stronger arguments, learning how to study\/read philosophy books more efficiently and how to see the weaknesses of an argument no matter how well constructed it is.",
    "I developed an understanding of the historical progression of ideas of political philosophy and of the main lines of thought that were present at the time. This course also served as a good reminder of how philosophy papers should be structured and how arguments can be crafted well.",
    "In taking this course, I believe I developed skills in critical thinking and writing. I also feel I have gained a great deal of basic knowledge in Western political philosophy and its history."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It was a great class.",
    "The strength of this course really lies in the lectures Pogge gives. There is a lot of reading, which is to be expected, but there could also be a little bit more guidance when it comes to the final.",
    "Strengths: Small class, ask your questions easily Prof. Pogge answers your questions kindly and passionately Interesting philosophers and well selected books Class dinners Helpful paper feedbacks Weaknesses: Books are not always easy to finish Hard to cover all the books in the lecture, analysis can be slightly superficial. But this is because of the intro level nature of this course and the same thing is true for other intro political philosophy courses. How it could be better: I would be super excited to read Prof. Pogge's personal reading notes. These could be distributed in the form of lecture handouts This way we could learn more about the parts we could not cover in the classroom (because of time constraint).",
    "This course is very well structured and the readings\/authors are extremely interesting. The only drawback is that the lectures lack in a sustained direction and will often meander in less relevant directions. This creates a lack of a firm grasp of the material and makes students feel like they are not learning much. The essays could also have been longer to allow better development.",
    "I feel the course was excellent as a whole. Something I appreciated that could perhaps be taken further was the recommendation of vital chapters in any given work to be read. Given the high volume of reading required for the course, it was helpful to have a more targeted object for serious study. Since these recommendations weren't made for every work, however, it might be helpful to add them for the remaining books for future classes.",
    "I wish we had more of a concrete roadmap of what we were supposed to be learning, but having guided readings with each philosopher was helpful!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely.",
    "I highly recommend this course. If you're not going to show up to lecture or make an attempt to read, you might want to take it Credit\/D. However, if you at least show up to lecture every day, you could probably get away with only reading a little bit and still do well. There are 3 papers and a final, which is completely manageable, and Prof. Pogge is willing to look at drafts (his turnover is rather quick) and talk to you in office hours. Prof. Pogge is an incredible lecturer with a good style of German humor. He helps you engage with thee rather thick texts, and his style of explaining is wonderful. He can come up with an example to match any text, and he can answer the most convoluted questions. He hosted two dinners which were also fascinating, and I went in to office hours on multiple occasions to talk about my papers and ended up staying to discuss general philosophy. This was my first time in a philosophy class, and while it was difficult at times, I think I got a lot out of it. The class is incredibly fair, and I promise that you will actually be intellectually stimulated. The exam was also a bit tough, but fair in total. The class is what you make of it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. If you are between \"Intro to poli philo\" of the poli-sci department and this class, take this one. Before moving on to comparisons a note about Prof. Pogge: If you have been hearing about the recent claims about Pogge, and discouraged to take the class, give it a second thought. I would totally understand the decision of not taking it if you do not feel like it. But during the class, everything was fully professional. The lectures, paper feedbacks, and the class dinners were academically enriching. Please see the comments below for more information. Again, everybody has a different views, if you do not feel it, it totally makes sense, you will be fine in the lecture version of it. But if you are making a purely academic decision, there are good reasons to choose this class. Please read comments below. Here are some comparisons: -This is small class environement. Professor Pogge does not call on anyone, you are free to talk, comment or ask questions but never forced to. Other class is a huge lecture and so hard to interact with the professor. You should wait until section to participate, but it is not the same thing with talking to the professor. -Fair grading. Prof. Pogge knows that this is an intro class and he is not harsh. He accepts drafts for essays and points out your weaknesses in that draft. If you address his criticisms you will very probably get a good grade. -No idea about the grading of the other class. -Readings are challenging and can be slightly more than that of the other class. But if you have a well-planned reading schedule, you can handle it. Also you definitely don't lose too much if you cannot finish all. I could not finish the end of some books but it turned out to be fine. Mostly focus on understanding the stance of the philosopher rather than trying to memorize every page of the book. -Readings are slightly less challenging in poli-sci department, but the difference is actually small enough to not matter in decision making. -Final exam, very feasible. There were short questions and two slightly short essay. Questions were mentioned in class, no trick. If you take notes, you should be fine. -Don't know the final exam of the poli-sci version. But probably equally challenging. -Class dinners are amazing. Prof. Pogge freely explains any philosophical concept. We even asked him his response to trolley problem, and some other moral philosophies. He can be very funny while explaining very serious ideas.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you enjoy Pogge's lecturing style\/find it conducive to your learning. The material in this course is extremely interesting and the professor presents it in an interesting way but often will not talk about important stuff and spend too much time on less relevant details.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are seriously interested in political philosophy. It would definitely be easier to follow if you have previous experience with the authors covered. I would also recommend that you expect to do a lot of reading in this course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to any student looking to undertake a survey of Western political philosophy."
