   "comments": [
    "It is a basic introduction to Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus. You don't really need any background in the course other than basic calculus, but I wouldn't suggest taking this course unless you need it.",
    "If you really want to get a firm basis in linear algebra and multivariable calculus, you would probably want to take a full semester of each. Because 118 is a one semester course, you only have the chance to scratch the surface of multi-variable calculus. There are also two p-sets per week.",
    "Math 118 is a very hard course to rate. On one hand the material is interesting and Professor Hall is excellent. On the other hand, it is an overwhelming amount of work. I've heard the professor is planning on reducing it for other classes, but you do 2 psets a week that are generally much more challenging than the material in class or on the exams. I spent so much time doing psets that I never felt I had time to review and learn some of the material.",
    "Overall a very good course: exactly what you would expect. This is a course for social science students who don't want to take math after, but it seems like we were able to do a lot of linear algebra and multivariable calc. It's fine if you don't remember high school calc. Professor Hall is great: friendly, fair, and willing to work with students to improve. He's new to Yale so the class will only get better. Psets due every class, 2 midterms and a final--you cannot get behind in this class.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially to those interested in economics but a little shaky on the math side. It will be a lot of work, but what you come out being able to do is absolutely worth it. It gives you an introduction to some of the most important topics in both linear algebra and multivariable calculus without spending a lot of extra time on some of the things that 120 and 225 might include but you may never need if you are not considering pursuing math as a major. Getting the essence of 2 courses is really a good way to make the most of what you're taking. The pace is fast, but the professor is amazing and won't let anyone fall behind.",
    "Math 118 is for students prepared to study math outside of calculus and with rigorous work and attention every week.",
    "Its a good course but is a lot of work. If you really like math, take it.",
    "If 120 seems too difficult or you only need math for Econ and don't want to spend two semesters on Multivariable and Linear Algebra, this is a really great class. Two problem sets a week are a lot of work, and there is no curve, but Professor Hall is an incredible teacher and he always makes the material really comfortable and easy to understand. He is forgiving about missing class and will find time to see students individually for help if they need it. Grading is about as fair as can be, and Professor Hall gives a lot of review materials to work with. Fantastic class for what it is. Definitely recommend.",
    "I would not recommend MATH 118 to another student. The course covers topics in both Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus. I would have rather tarn two separate courses."
