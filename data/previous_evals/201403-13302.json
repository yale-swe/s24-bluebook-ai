   "comments": [
    "This class is fascinating for people from all majors. If you can get into this class, you should definitely take it. You learn all about how people viewed mental illness in the past and how it changed over time.",
    "Would 100% recommend the course. Challenging and thought provoking material without being daunting.",
    "A history seminar with consistent primary readings and secondary readings on some aspect of mental illness. I would take a look at the syllabus to make sure you're really interested in subject material.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. The articles (both primary and secondary) were fascinating and I found that I was able to use them for a wide variety of courses I took this semester. I decided to save them all on my computer because they were that fascinating.",
    "A really wonderful and fascinating class for anyone who's interested in mental illness, its treatment and perceptions in society, how healthcare is used to oppress those who deviate from norms, and even what constitutes \"normalcy\" or \"illness.\" If you want to study race, gender and sexuality and their intersection with mental health, take it for sure. I have absolutely no complaints--the two hour class flew by. There is a good amount of reading but it's interesting and therefore very doable, and two papers (7 pages and 15 pages) and 5 reading responses total is not bad at all.",
    "Absolutely amazing course. Every unit was incredibly interesting and thought provoking, and the readings were incredible. Professor Vider was absolutely incredible in the seminar setting, and brought the discussion to a new level. If you can get into this course, absolutely absolutely take it -- you will not regret it, and it will make you view history in a new light. Best course I have had the opportunity to take at Yale. This course is not just about mental illnesses, but also about conceptions of mental illnesses, and how the diagnosis of mental illness has been used, throughout time, as a way of controlling those deemed \"inferior.\"",
    "This is a seminar you will not want to miss. You will learn SO much more than what you could imagine. Definitely take it!",
    "Professor Vider's course was perhaps the best-organized of any history seminar I've taken (this is my fifth). He was also extensively prepared, which was rather refreshing given that many seminar leaders seem to believe that they can simply appear, display their knowledge, and teach effectively. Professor Vider also placed a lot more focus on history as a discipline and how to read historical argument than most professors, which was helpful even to a senior history major like me. His breadth of knowledge over the subject -- given that it extends through three centuries -- was also formidable. Overall, an excellent course taught by an excellent professor. I hope he sticks around.",
    "Great class! I would absolutely recommend taking it if you're interested in psychology\/mental health\/history.",
    "HIGHLY recommend this class. HIST 143J will take you through all the major historical events regarding mental illness in American culture, and gives you new lenses and perspectives on how we have progressed in the past few centuries. Work load isn't too bad - 5 critical exercises (aka reading responses), 1 midterm paper (5-7 pages), 1 primary source presentation, and 1 final paper (15 pages). The readings are kind of long and sometimes it isn't clear how they all tie together, but the class discussions are effectively guided by Professor Vider so that we make all the connections. This is a really worthwhile course, so take it if you can!",
    "This class was one of the most challenging that I've taken at Yale. Not with regard to workload: although there was plenty of work to be had, it was no more than any other history seminar I've had. Rather, this class is challenging inasmuch as it caused me to question my understanding of history more than any other class that I've taken during my time at Yale. If you're interested in digging into the psychology of history--and not just into the history of psychology, although that's part of it--I would recommend this class."
