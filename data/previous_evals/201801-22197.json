    "The Film Archive course introduced me to a broad range of issues related to the history and theory of archiving audiovisual materials, especially analog films. I also learned how to take a 16mm through the entire archival process of acquisition, inspection, research, and exhibition. I really enjoyed the course and value the skills I acquired through it.",
    "This is one of the best courses I expect to ever take at Yale. I gained insight into a crucial area of the film world that I knew nothing about. I not only learned the history, theory, and activities of film archives, but also had the opportunity to work hands-on inspecting, repairing, and cataloguing a print. The discussions we had surrounding the ethics of film preservation and the effects of digitization on archival practices were especially fascinating. Most importantly, I was able to gain experience in film programming -- something that I hope to make a career of.",

    "I learned to inspect and repair 16mm films, the technical and theoretical aspects of film restoration, and the history and current state of film archives around the world.",
    "I learned a lot about film preservation, archiving, programming, and about the technical side of film history and filmmaking in general. The major insight, however, was that it helped me personally understand what I want to do in the future.",
    "Understanding of the importance and limits of the work of a film archive. Basic knowledge concerning the restoration of film materials."

    "The greatest strengths were the one-on-one inspection and repair sessions with Professor Meacham and the guest speakers.",
    "The course's greatest strengths were the one-on-one inspection and repair sessions and the guest speakers.",
    "The hands-on aspect of the course was very helpful. The opportunity to physically handle film was rare and valuable. Perhaps the hands-on component could be expanded, while the amount of readings lessened. The semester end screening with student intros was a highlight of the course.",
    "This was the best course among those I took during my two years at Yale. We had amazing guest speakers, readings and films were great, and working with Professor Meacham was a pleasure, both academically and personally.",
    "Interesting introduction in the work of a film archive with some hands-on experience that helps to understand what film archives actually deal with. Guests allowed an individual insight into different fields related to the film archive. Readings and assignments were fitting to the subject and interesting since they tackled a broad variety of issues related to the work of a film archive. However, sometimes there was no actual feedback on certain assignments or feedback came weeks after an assignment was submitted which limits the opportunities to improve the quality of one's own work."

    "Yes, this course is unique is providing practical knowledge of film archiving, programming, and restoration.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in film.",
    "The course was alright, but I would only recommend it to other students if they have enough time left on their working schedule since the class requires another hour of inspection work and has quite a few assignments to submit throughout the term in addition to the regular readings. Furthermore, it requires quite some research depending on the film you chose for inspection."
