    "Terrible class. Year after year the SEAS sees the reviews of Professor Pfefferle and how awful this class is, and yet they don't do anything. This is a core course in chemical engineering but the material goes to waste because of the bad teacher. It's a shame.",
    "It's required, otherwise I'd use my time for something else. On the bright side though the assignments aren't terrible and the grading on the exams is very nice.",
    "Absolutely, by far, the most incompetent proffesor I've had. Thats 2 years and a summer in a row I'v thought I've had the worst prof. at Yale and then the next year was even worse. I will explain the issues below: the professor specifically states that she does not have a syllabus so she can adjust the grades as she see's fit. This has previously allowed her to count the final as over 50%, which is strictly against Yale's academic policies. Grades aren't out yet this year so I don't know if she has done it again. She is perpetually late: someone started keeping track the second or third week of the start times and a grand total of just over 1 hour and 36 minutes were lost to late starts. She has packets which are: 1) single sided for the most part, 2) written in sharpey or some other marker and have very little information per page, 3) have been copied os many times its hard to read\/see 1\/2 the pages. She would frequently start sentences and then stop, pause as if considering what to say next, and then drop the sentence and start with a new thought. Equations or explanations would be written on the board while she stood directly in front of them... and then erased without her moving. She started assigning homework 2 chapters ahead of where we were in class. She never set up her classesV2 site. The class is required for ChemE's. If you have any say in it whatsoever, petition for a different professor. She should NOT be teaching classes. Period.",
    "A class that, in subject matter, is very interesting and worth taking. In practice, however, it is disorganized and hard to follow. Since the reason that you are looking at this class is probably because you have to take it, my advice is to ask a lot of questions so that you always understand the notation. When Pfefferle is actually explaining something, she is very good at making you understand: so make sure you ask her enough questions to give her the opportunity to explain what you are struggling with.",
    "Probably have to take it. Just go to the test review classes and you will be fine for the exams. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student because the content is important to the chemical engineering major and the workload is manageable, but the class could use some improvement. The lectures and accompanying lecture notes can be disorganized and difficult to follow and, while the textbook does a decent job of explaining the material, it can also be confusing.",
    "Professor Pfefferle should never be allowed to teach another class. This class should be very useful to any budding engineer; instead, I learned very little, and spent 150 minutes each week in a useless lecture.",
    "The material is really quite interesting if you are into this sort of thing. However, it is hard to learn from the confusing lectures and disorganized packets. If you want, you can do the bare minimum with few repercussions. On the other hand, if you take the initiative to learn the material on your own, you will probably find it worthwhile. My recommendation is to allocate however much time you can reasonably spare with the knowledge that you will get out of it what you put in."
