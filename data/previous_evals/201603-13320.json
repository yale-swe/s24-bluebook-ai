   "comments": [
    "Question 14: This was quite possibly the best-taught math-related course I've ever taken, and also ranks up in the top courses that I've ever taken of any subject. Question 13: It's almost unbelievable how Professor Reuning-Scherer can take almost any topic and make it perfectly clear and accessible to students. He is an exceptional teacher.",
    "The professor makes himself available for questions on multiple platforms (office hours, group question hours, cell phone, skype, email) in order to meet students where they feel most comfortable. He is very responsive, patient, and enthusiastic. To accomodate different learning styles, he offers two different class structures, written notes, class recordings, educational videos, optional quizzes, and free online references. I felt that if I didn't do well, it was for lack of effort on my part because Jonathan wants everyone to succeed so badly.",
    "I thought this was a really fantastic course. I really appreciated the professor's realistic views on the best way for us to learn statistics. Understanding that it is unlikely we will be completing statistic analysis in the future without any resources, he allowed us to use notes on all our assignments and receive assistance from the TAs and from him when necessary. This helped transition the focus from memorizing formulas to gaining a deeper understanding of the topic and how to apply it. I was very appreciative of this approach and I learned a ton! The professor is funny, kind and very available!",
    "The Instructor made the class very interactive with graphic illustrations.",
    "Though statistics has always been a difficult subject area for me to grasp, I thought the course did a good job reinforcing concepts that I had learned in the past, and teaching me new ones. Jonathan made it accessible and interesting, though it moved quite fast at times.",
    "Jonathan is the best. Not only did he really make stats come alive with his quirky jonathanisms, but he was incredibly enthusiastic about the material.",
    "I think this course is a little more challenging for those who don't have ready applications for the material covered. Coming up with a final project was especially difficult...I had no idea where to start. About halfway through the semester, the material got very hard to follow in class, and I spent a lot of time reviewing videos outside of class. Maybe the pace could be slowed a bit.",
    "JDRS is an amazing professor! He made statistics interesting, nteractive and relevant. I greatly appreciate his humor and learning pneumonics. My classmates and I were always very impressed by his responsiveness to questions (even during the election - and about statistics not related to class) and depth of knowledge. I did not purchase any statistic text books, but i may have if I knew that there were additional problems that would help me understand the material beyond the homework.",
    "The class was too fast paced. The lectures went too fast and it was difficult to follow.",
    "I felt like the pace of this course was too quick to really understand deeply the complex material. I also felt like the teaching style, while fun, was not always conducive to actual learning. By using phrases like \"what does buzz lightyear say\" it prompts the students to say infinity but they don't actually know that the answer is infinity, or why it is infinity, and they wouldn't have been able to come up with that answer without the prompt.",
    "I would have preferred if we had learned slightly less material but done a deeper dive of each concept so we had a firmer grasp of the material. Also I thought the second midterm and project was a bit heavy and maybe could have been spaced out better or adjusted.",
    "I will answer as followings",
    "I took the course to refamiliarize myself with basic statistical concepts I'd previously learned but forgotten in my undergraduate studies. This course was helpful in achieving this.",
    "To question 1, I didn't spend time to read the optional textbooks. The PowerPoint slides were good enough."

Professor Reuning-Scherer's engagement with us, be it through jokes or through countless hours of availability, was much appreciated.",

Even when (mostly due to necessary class size) the student participation was slow, which must be terribly discouraging. However, I know from a lot of classmates that they never had as much fun doing stats before.",

    "I thought we could have spent a bit more time on the final project. It would have been helpful to have a bit more guidance selecting data. Our group chose challenging data and it made the project less fun\/interesting. Walking us through the expectations for the final project for a portion of a class would have been helpful. Also -- I think four people in a group might be too many. Perhaps you should limit groups to three.",
    "1. TF's with better communication skills and clear grading protocols. 2. Removal of the reference made to Francis Dalton & Eugenics (regression notes) could be helpful for students made uncomfortable by reference to the latter.",
    "The pace was very fast, but I guess that's to be expected or an intro course in graduate school.",
    "another TA with more convenient office hours would be helpful",
    "I think the pace in the second half of the semester could be slowed a bit.",
    "The pace in lecture cold be improved upon, at times Jonathan talks a little too fast during lecture and it's hard to follow along in the lecture slides.",
    "I understand how the course builds on itself throughout the semester, but I wish there had been a bit more time spent on ANOVAs and multiple regressions (I know, there is another class on it, but still!!)",
    "This isn't necessarily a negative, but I will say that for this class you get out what you put into it. It can be easy to coast in a class like this, but in doing so you won't absorb or learn the material.",
    "The lecture style",
    "I enjoyed the interactive parts of the class (with the clickers) but they often did not work. Those sessions helped me identify what I did and did not understand, and helped me focus on what to study further. I think this part of the course needs improvement, and ideally could be incorporated into every class meeting.",

    "At times the lecture slides moved quite fast (although having them online was very helpful).",

    "Attend all the lectures! A lot gets covered and its hard to catch up if you miss them.",
    "Take the flipped version, I wish I had taken the flipped course because you have the freedom to pause, rewind, and re-watch the videos when Jonathan moves too fast... you don't have that luxury in the lecture.",
    "Take it! Especially if you have never taken stats before!!",
    "This subject is vital to whatever field you choose to pursue- definitely take, even if you're an undergraduate!",
    "If you haven't taken a statistics course - or its been a few years - this is a great refresher that really builds on the knowledge you learn in other courses.",
    "This course teaches a fundamental skill that everyone should understand, and so I would recommend taking it to get that skill. However, the class requires a lot of self teaching and some of the instructor's teaching practices help you get the right answer but do not always help you understand why that is the right answer.",
    "take it",
    "Go to office hours as often as possible!",
    "Keep up with the coursework so you don't fall behind.",
    "Take advantage of office horus",
    "It will be good to study if you really need to use this skill in the future.",
    "This course is as entertaining and informative as a stats course can posssibly be. Take it.",
    "It's a good course to introduce or reintroduce you to statistical concepts. If you feel like your background in the topic is strong though, there are others that might be more valuable.",
    "Keep up the pace. Set a few hours to review course materials every weekend. Don't fall behind. Don't procrastinate."
