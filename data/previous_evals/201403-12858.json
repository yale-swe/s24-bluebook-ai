   "comments": [
    "A study of French literary works from medieval to contemporary times. Enough time allocated for a quite thorough analysis of the class. The small number of students also made it more enjoyable.",
    "Madame Pinzka offers a wonderful French 170 class--she structures it beautifully, makes sure that each student has a deep understanding of the texts, and poses inspiring questions and essay prompts. There is a significant amount of work, but it is all enjoyable, which is a testament to Madame Pinzka's great teaching. If you do take this class, take it with her. (She is also a lovely person!)",
    "It's a decent class; you read around a book a week (usually a very short book, or a play, or a few poems - the reading is fairly limited since it's in a foreign language), and write three short essays. Same as most intro literature classes. It's never going to be quite as much fun talking about books in a language that you don't speak as it is talking about books in a language that you do speak; I placed into this class and had good enough french to get by, but I didn't ever really feel like it was as interesting as an english class, just because the level of discussion was always a bit lower. That said, it's a surprisingly good class, especially with Prof. Pinzka. If your french is decent and you need a language credit, you should take it; it's fun and not too much work, plus you read some great books! I just think it's stupid to take more than a few classes on books in a foreign language if you're not doing it as a major; it can be frustrating at times.",
    "FREN 170 is a great class. If you really put in the time and effort, you're French will continue to improve and you'll learn about some of the classics in French literature.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who wanted a lot of practice reading and writing French. The reading is both demanding and rewarding. There was less emphasis on speaking than I thought there would be, even though we met twice a week."
