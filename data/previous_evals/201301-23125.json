   "comments": [
    "A LOT od work but you learn the basics of drawing",
    "This class is a lot of work but you will get as much out of it as you put in.",
    "Although I've taken technical art classes before, this class was a very good way for me to refocus my artistic technique. The professor seemed to really care about my development as an artist, and she pushed me to improve my work. I thought she did a very good job of integrating creative projects into the classwork (which is fairly uncommon in a from-observation basic drawing course).",
    "Great intro drawing class. Fun and not a lot of work.",
    "You learn the basics of drawing, but also with some interesting collage projects. Good if you want to have fun with the basics of visual arts, and not bad as an art prereq, but it can be a bit time-consuming if you're not used to this kind of work.",
    "I have never taken a formal drawing class but I recommend this class to anyone who hasn't.",
    "I would recommend basic drawing to a student who has had little to no previous experience in the visual arts because of the accessibility of the course to students who are new at art, and because I believe it is healthy to go out and spend some time in the type of studio environment the class creates.",
    "A great basic drawing class that focuses exclusively on working from observation. The class starts with the basics so students have a strong foundation to work from. Natalie is an amazing teacher. Take this class! Just be sure to actually draw in your sketchbook throughout the semester.",
    "Lots of the students had a lot of experience in drawing so it was a little frustrating as a beginner",
    "Art 114 is a class that requires a good deal of time, patience, and practice. Like any talent in sports, music, or scientific study, Art 114 is a class that requires practice. The more you practice, the better you will become.",
    "I would definitely recommend Basic Drawing to a fellow student, especially one that is looking for a humanities credit. The class isn't too much work, but is still extremely refreshing and beneficial. The two hour class time is easily manageable, and tends to fly by pretty quickly. If you're looking for a humanities credit, definitely take this course.",
    "A great first drawing class if you have little\/no formal experience; there were also much more advanced drawers in the class and they seemed to get a lot out of it too. I would recommend it, but it's more work than you'd think for something that's often thought of as a \"gut class.\"",
    "Take basic drawing if you've never drawn much and want to learn the basicsTake it if you've drawn, but think you need to relearn core principles if you want to get betterdon't take it (atleast this section) if you're really into art and drawing and want something that will get you thinking and creating originally"
