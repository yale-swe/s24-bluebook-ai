    "Field trip. Readings.",

    "The field trip was amazing! It was so much more helpful to learn about buildings by walking through them. Peter introduced us to some very interesting people and concepts. I fully support another field trip next year, and possibly a second (though not another weekend). True to his word, Peter provides a strong overview of green building. It's a shame that there's not more time to go deeper into topics, but, this is FES, not an architecture or structural engineering program. It's the appropriate amount for policymakers, business managers, etc.",
    "The way the major assignments are structured and open for integration. This allows the student to approach a topic of interest from multiple perspectives (literary review, career path, practical applications).",
    "The field trip and the visiting lecturers were very helpful and added to the great basic information discussed during the lecture classes."

   "comments": [
    "Would have liked a more rigorous lecture style, where we covered more material.",
    "The online quizzes felt like busy work. A better way of assessing the students' reading comprehension would have been to have more class discussions about it. A building science intensive would be very valuable to students without much background in buildings\/construction.",
    "Peter is great, but his lectures are just too scattered. He goes on tangents, spends 20 minutes in the beginning of class telling us his plan, doesn't stick to it, etc. Peter also repeatedly said throughout the semester that he wasn't concerned with when we turned in assignments, only that we turn them all in before the end of the semester. Then, all of sudden, he started enforcing due dates and taking points off for turning in assignments late. It was unexpected and unfair. Either stick to due dates, or stick to your word that we can turn them in on our own schedule, so long as they're all done by the end of the course. Either option is fine, but don't try to do both, which detracts from student learning rather than enhances it. One thing I would like to see is a tie-in with the LEED GA exam. I figure it wouldn't take too much extra studying for a student who's taken this course to pass that exam. if FES were to pay for or subsidize the exam, that might be a nice bonus accreditation for students interested in green building to have on their resumes.",
    "More connections between the reading material and the in-class discussion. Bringing guest speakers was valuable but they cut the progression of materials being covered.",
    "Like we discussed in class, it would be helpful to address all the basic building science material early so that everyone is on the same page. Then a more in depth discussion of the advanced concepts is possible."

    "Mostly. It would be helpful to talk about the material a bit more in class so that we can solidify that knowledge. If I've read something once without discussing it, I'll be much more likely to forget it. Also, Peter assigns a few too many readings, which makes it difficult to focus on any one of them. Skimming 5 readings is not as helpful as reading 3."
