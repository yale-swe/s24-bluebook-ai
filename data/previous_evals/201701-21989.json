   "comments": [
    "A good understanding of the multiplicities of modern art in ME. It was so broad yet fairly high level.",
    "I learned some interesting information on various different topics related to artistic practices in the modern middle east.",
    "This is easily one of the best courses I have taken in my time at Yale. Every single discussion was engaging, thoughtful, and intellectually challenging beyond belief - in a way that I felt myself always working to contribute my best as I was growing immeasurably from every other person in the class.",
    "I learned a lot about art of the Middle East, something that I had not had really any exposure to before this course. Most of my art historical education has focused on Europe and the US, so it was important for me to decenter many of the Western-centric narratives that have dominated my experience with the major.",
    "This class was more political science than art history. The main question that came up every class was-\"Can artists be truly activist?\"",
    "The focus of this course is very discussion-based, which is not my strong suit, and I gained a lot from being effectively forced to communicate in a manner in which I am not generally super comfortable.",
    "Close reading of art historical texts, visual analysis and critique, historiography",
    "Learned a lot of history, lot about modern Middle East",
    "This was my first art history seminar so it was beneficial for me to learn how to discuss art and its wider context in this type of environment - specifically because it was such a political topic as well.",
    "This class taught me how to look at and contextualize modern art from the Middle East. It also greatly improved my art historical writing.",
    "I thought critically about what it means for something to be art, and why we study the kind of art we study in art history. I learned to see art as a deeply political tool. The class has made me very nuanced and careful with my language and writing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Because people were coming from different parts of campus, sometimes diametrically opposed parts, the critical nature of the discussions stifled actual discussion. There is often undertones in discussions that we had to work with.",
    "I didn't find the presentations that two students did before each class particularly engaging or helpful. I think it would have been better if students presented on specific topics that they had explored in depth, rather than just summarizing the readings that everyone in class was supposed to have done already.",
    "The breadth of the course was really great the range of topics and viewpoints felt comprehensive, and I'm glad that we were able to explore the diversity of creative production from the Middle East. In terms of improvements, I think the seminar could have been a bit smaller the number of people in the class sometimes limited discussion, although it was great to have so many people with so many different experiences in the class. I think sometimes the discussion ended up being more of people talking to Professor Rizvi, rather than engaging with one another.",
    "This course had so much potential, but it ended up being disappointing. It was less of an art history than a political science course. We barely analyzed or looked at art in class. It was mostly about the political climate at the time and the intentions of the artist, which is not necessarily bad. However, the professor was also scattered and would not release the prompt for short papers until three days before they were due, which creates unnecessary time pressure. The professor was also a poor moderator, stepping in to interject comments that confused rather than clarified when she should have let the conversation take its course. Meanwhile, when the discussion would have benefited from some structure, she let it meander into irrelevance. The idea for the class is great, and some of the readings in the first few weeks were good, but it got a little repetitive, and it did not focus enough on art.",
    "I thought this was a great course. It's a broad and not very well studied subject, but we bit off different little chunks each week. The readings were sometimes kind of dense and not always very engaging, but the discussion in class was really good.",
    "Great class. Professor Rizvi does a great job of keeping the conversation alive - there were very few silent moments in the 2 hour seminar. Also, unlike many classes at Yale, I felt the conversation was actually a discussion or a debate, and not just individuals throwing in their 2 cents so that they could check off participation for the week. There is a lot of reading, but doing it pays off, because its actually super engaging (once you wrap your head around it) and very relevant stuff.",
    "The course was very well thought out in its schedule and material.",
    "The readings weren't the best but the class was great. Liked the structure a lot and the assignments. Great to have a TF and a professor. The writing sessions were really helpful",
    "The readings and conversations in this course were very interesting. I only wish we talked a little more about formal artistic qualities of the works.",
    "The class has excellent readings, an excellent professor to lead discussion, and helpful writing workshops. The few improvements would be clearer communication about the readings on the syllabus (i.e. which chapter of an entire book to read, where to find them if not online)."

   "comments": [
    "The discussions are often so abstracted that it was hard to have constructive debate. Nonetheless, it was a good survey of modern art from the Middle East. Prof. Rizvi is phenomenal and so caring. Readings are not the clearest at times - very dense material.",
    "The subject matter of this course is really interesting, but I don't think our seminar discussion in class did it justice. I know this is the first time this has been taught, so hopefully it will improve in future years.",
    "Yes!!! Take it if you can get in!!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, since it offers an important perspective on art history that is often missing from the department.",
    "This course had so much potential, but it ended up being disappointing. It was less of an art history than a political science course. We barely analyzed or looked at art in class. It was mostly about the political climate at the time and the intentions of the artist, which is not necessarily bad.

Meanwhile, when the discussion would have benefited from some structure, she let it meander into irrelevance. The idea for the class is great, and some of the readings in the first few weeks were good, but it got a little repetitive, and it did not focus enough on art. The worst part is really that the professor, on top of being too scattered to really carry out a helpful conversation when discussing intellectual ideas, inappropriately typecasted students. For example, when she found out a student had visited a certain country or taken some other coursework, she would cold call them to answer a question, which was uncomfortable because they did not always feel like they were experts or fit into the box she tried to put them in. This last part is particularly inappropriate, since students should not be made to feel tokenized in any way in classes. I've never experienced a professor being so wanton and careless about this before I took this class. This also meant the most vocal people in the class were called on, also, leaving out the people she cared less about from the conversation. This was really unfortunate, since those other people probably had a lot to contribute had they been drawn out of their shell by a more talented moderator who signaled that she valued them as well, not just the couple she liked. Lastly, she tended to interrupt women and favor men, which was also inappropriate, though probably not intentional. Students found out she invited select students to a dinner with a guest speaker without asking the rest of the class if they would like to come and then randomly picking based on interest, as would probably have been more fair, which also dampened spirits, since she clearly played favorites that were developed based on her at times imaginary conceptions of who had more \"experience\" in the Middle East over others. She made a lot of comments about certain students speaking in a manner that was \"too Jackson Institute,\" or using a lens that was \"too Jackson.\" This criticism is well taken in the sense that there is different set of vocabulary in this field. However, it got to a point where it sounded like she was mocking other disciplines that she has had little contact with, when there were people in her class associated with Jackson. It seemed mean-spirited at times because the joke came up so frequently. Students should feel free to express their genuine ideas, and as long as they are effective, there is no reason to tell them that they sound affected when they objectively did not. She could not speak clearly enough during office hours for students to get much directions from her, and she was frequently incredibly behind schedule in meeting with students.",
    "Yes, I think I would. Kishwar is wonderful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in the middle east or art history. The class seemed to be a good mixture of area studies\/history and art history, and there was a balance of discussion of political events and formal analysis. The readings are sometimes a little hard to get through, but I really think it's worth it.",
    "If you're interested in art making and arts writing processes, then definitely! This course is more about intellectual and theoretical art history than it is about specific works of art (even though we definitely come across major works).",
    "Yes! Take this course, it's unlike any other offered at Yale. You'll learn about art history, politics, and more.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The professor and material are very engaging.",
    "Absolutely take this course! It's great. Professor Rizvi is incredible and you'll learn a ton.",
    "The course topic is very interesting and a novel approach to Middle Eastern art. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in understanding the mordern Middle East from a different angle.",
    "Professor Rizvi is very knowledgeable about this subject. Take it even if you don't know much about art history or the middle east, you will learn a lot. However, you might feel lost at times.",
    "I had high hopes for this class, but unfortunately it did not meet expectations. It wasn't properly structured, and it felt more like a political science seminar than a history of art class. We looked at minimal art in class yet our papers were supposed to be heavily art historical in content. The assignments did not match up with the course content and little to no feedback was provided.",
    "Absolutely. A wonderful subject that is timely, informative, and necessary.",
    "I would recommend this course over and over again. I left discussion every week with new thoughts and insights, and through the writing workshops I saw my writing improve dramatically. Professor Rizvi will make you think deeply, and this is a topic that requires a lot of deep thinking."
