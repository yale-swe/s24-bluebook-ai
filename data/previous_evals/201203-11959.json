    "Cet cours avait beaucoup de travail, chaque jour pour le tout semestre. Mais j'aimais \u00c3\u00a7a, parce que il y avait plusieurs occasions a pratiquer le fran\u00c3\u00a7ais. Je recommanderais ce cours aux etudiants qui veulent apprendre le francais et suivaient un cour ou deux au lycee.",
    "take it!",
    "French 130 with Mme. Koizim was the best class I took all semester. The workload was fairly heavy with homework just about every night, but the humor that Mme. Koizim taught with made the class fly by; I actually looked forward to it every day. Disclaimer, though: Koizim has an extremely sarcastic wit, and if sarcasm isn't your thing, this class probably isn't for you. But, if you have a good sense of humor, you'll absolutely love this class.",
    "If you can test into a higher level of French, do so. This is a review of L2 with a few books added in, and your French will advance very little."
