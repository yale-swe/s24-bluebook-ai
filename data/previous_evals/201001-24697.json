   "comments": [
    "Take it!!",
    "I would recommend it. It's very interesting and Professor Cabanes is super knowledgeable",
    "This is a good course that helps to make you understand not only the importance of war to 20th century international politics, but also the personal and deep psychological effects of war on individuals,both combatants and citizens alike. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "This was a very interesting class. I learned a lot about the major themes of war and would definitely recommend anyone to take this.",
    "I would definitely take this class again.",
    "I believe all students vaguely interested in social sciences or conflict should take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student who is interested in the culture of war in the 20th century. Keep in mind that much of the class focuses on WWI and WWII. Bruno is a great lecturer and it was a very enjoyable experience.",
    "it was a good class but I wouldn't recommend it to another student because I think there are better classes out there for learning about wars if that is what you are looking for.",
    "If you take this class, make sure you at least either do all of the reading or go to all of the lectures--you can get by easily without doing so, especially if you have any factual background in the wars of the 20th century, but you won't get anything out of it. And the readings are really great. Class really gives a clear understanding of exactly what it says--it is a class based in themes: rituals, narratives, experiences of wars. What has changed over time and what has remained constant. And as a thematic class, the members of the class comprised non-history oriented freshman all the way to senior history majors, and everyone was able to find something new in the material because it was a new angle based in understanding narratives.",
    "Really cool course, makes you think about an aspect of history normally not discussed. Concepts are highly applicable to all different facets of life.",
    "Not much work but tough grading",
    "Take it. It's a great class",
    "Probably not..there was a ton of reading and it was unclear what they were looking for on the paper and final",
    "This is one of the classes that every Yale student needs to take. Lectures are brutally depressing and the reading worse, but it is a fantastic testament to pacifism and the need for global disarmament. I have never found a single class here nearly as inspiring. Take it -- but take it in the same semester as a class that's a bit happier.",
    "Interesting material, but bad professor. He talks non stop for 50 minutes without taking a breath. It was really bad. Would not recommend it at all.",
    "Take this course! A great introduction to the history of war (and its effects) in the twentieth century.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class. The material is disorganized and depressing -- all you talk about is genocide, rape, shell shock, you name it. It is also DEFINITELY not what I expected or wanted from a history class. There are little facts, events, dates and analysis of big themes over the 20th century. It's more psychological analysis and the philosophy behind war phenomenon. It should be under the sociology or psyschology department, not history. The grading is also pretty harsh. And the break down - section grade, one paper, final - puts A LOT of pressure on those two assignments.",
    "I do not recommend this course.",
    "This class is not a real history class and would fit better into the sociology or psychology departments. It is extremely focused on the 'experience' of war rather than war itself. It is also extremely depressing and I would not recommend it if you are prone to depression, or just like to be happy. The class is also quite difficult and requires a lot of work, so I would not recommend it unless you are very interested in the most brutal aspects of war as an individual experience (child soldiers, genocide, sexual violence etc)",
    "Yes! Everyone should have to take a class like this at least once.",
    "I would recommend it. Cabanes is a good lecturer. Be aware that the grading consists only of a paper, final, and section."
