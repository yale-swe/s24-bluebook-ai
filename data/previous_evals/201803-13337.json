   "comments": [
    "An understanding of Ciceronian speech, treatises, and letters.",
    "This class does a fantastic job of reinforcing and applying what students learn in L1 and L2. Additionally, students learn more about the context in which the classical Latin they were reading was being written.",
    "This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Jennifer was able to integrated technology and Latin, utilize the Beinecke, and relate Latin literature to current events. My understanding of the language and grammar improved more than any semester of Latin I have taken at Yale because of her excellent attention to detail. I loved the choice of readings and I feel like I gained so much from the experience of taking this class.",
    "I became very familiar with Cicero's writing style in speeches, letters, and philosophy. I definitely felt more confident in my ability to read latin by the end of the course.",
    "I got the ability to read Cicero fairly fluidly with moderate help from a dictionary. I also learned a fair bit about Cicero's style across his different works, from public speeches to philosophical writings and letters. I also learned how to use Arethusa tree-banking software.",
    "The sheer amount of material covered forces students to grow as Latin learners. Throughout the semester, you grapple with various grammatical and stylistic elements in Cicero's writing, often from a linguistic perspective, and think about how words, structure, and meaning can come together to deliver an effective message. My grammar, linguistics, and vocab grew greatly over the course of the semester."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths--Without a doubt the grad student, Jennifer Weintritt. I cannot believe I'm actually writing this, but Arethusa was truly the most beneficial study tool for the acquisition of the Latin language. Jennifer was sweet, knowledgable, and really comprehensive about the material. This wasn't a mere grammar review class--this was a conscious effort to understand rhetorical strategy and argumentation. It was quite a ride. Weaknesses--Workload without a doubt. This is my 3rd semester in the Yale Latin department. I know the drill and the justification, so it's whatever to be honest.",
    "The strengths of this course are the rigor, the level of engagement and feedback, as well as the interesting background knowledge taught. The weakness of this course is primarily the amount of work required daily, as well as the failure to account for students who are coming into this class with different levels of preparation the material. Often times it felt as if there were assumptions made about background knowledge about Roman history, as well as the Latin language that may have been true for those studying other ancient languages, or who have studied Latin in high school, but not for other students who were newer to the language.",
    "The use of Treebanking software was amazing, it helped us read Latin in a new and very intuitive manner and kept the material relevant. I think that this should be implemented in every Latin class at Yale. The readings were wonderful, we got a great array of Cicero's different styles at an appropriate level of difficulty. I have nothing bad to say about it.",
    "This class was the first of its kind to introduce treebanks which were a blessing and a curse. The provided answer keys to the readings which was nice to study with, but they were incredibly tedious to complete. A lot of the work for latin classes feel tedious but that's how you learn the language. My only complaint with the class is that we would \"change things up\" a lot. Since you had to prepare a lot for the class, it was a little frustrating once you got used to the class being run one way, to have to get used to something else. I understand why it happened since the treebanks were new, but I hope for the future classes, there will be more consistency.",
    "Main strength: Professor Weintritt teaches a very rigorous and structured class. Main weakness: We only read Cicero this semester, whom I got tired of after a while. I think a diversity of authors would have improved the course.",
    "The digital treebanking of Cicero's sentences helped me break down his words and understand their structure and made me slow down and analyze the Latin instead of passively translating. The weekly quizzes helped ensure that I stayed on track with the material and notified me of weaknesses in my Latin. I didn't really understand the structure of the class for the first month and fell behind in my learning and grade, but was able to recover once I figured out systems that helped me go through a large amount of reading effectively."

   "comments": [
    "I'm not sure if it can be taught better than Jennifer Weintritt.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who feel comfortable in their foundational understanding of the Latin language, and are looking for a setting in which to apply it to authentic texts. However, it is an incredibly challenging course and required a significant amount of time to succeed in.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "This is a good course to take if you want to learn to read Latin. You need to read Cicero at some point, and this selection of readings will get you to the level where you really can read him, albeit with a dictionary handy.",
    "This course is a boot camp in linguistics and grammar using actual Latin text instead of spending time on textbook charts and manufactured texts. Cicero's work can be a little dull and confusing, but has very fun, interesting moments. This course will help you learn how to learn Latin and deal with historical texts."
