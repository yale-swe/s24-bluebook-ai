   "comments": [
    "I learned so much from this course. I came into the class never having taken a WGSS course, but I have always tried to incorporate feminism into my essays. I thought I knew what I was getting into, but I was absolutely blown away by the strength and intelligence of my classmates. Whether you are a WGSS major or not, I recommend this course because it is the kind of eye-opening experience that everyone should have before they leave Yale.",
    "I learned about the intellectual history of feminist thought and about how to analyze feminist theory through a literary perspective.",
    "This course covers many cannonical works of feminist and queer theory. As such, it provided a historical perspective on the evolutions that feminist and queer philosophical circles have undergone over the past several decades. The course also focuses on form in addition to content, and as such addressed the methodologies employed by different thinkers as well. The course also featured a fair amount of written work. To that end I believe that my writing about WGSS related material improved.",
    "analysis of texts, using the texts outside of the contexts for which they were written, having conversations about the texts and with the vocabulary and background necessary to develop and defend one's own ideas",
    "The course gave me a thoughtful overview of feminist and queer thought. I learned about the intellectual history of feminist and queer theory, and I learned how to synthesize these theories with peoples' personal and lived experiences.",
    "In definitely learned how to think more critically and how to read passages more closely. I have a more solid understanding of the theory that goes behind the production and journey of academic work as well as a social production of knowledge. The feminist thinkers we work with challenge you to think differently and carefully about any statement you make.",
    "This class is the foundation of the WGSS major, meaning that it's a great course to take if you want an introduction into feminist and queer theory that can serve as a baseline for a multitude of other interdisciplinary subjects."

   "comments": [
    "As a student new to WGSS, I found everything very interesting. But I think my WGSS classmates felt that the reading was redundant, and that they had read almost everything before in other classes. In addition, this is \"Feminist and Queer Theory,\" but we only spent two classes on queer theory! I think it deserves more than that.",
    "The course did do what it set out to do, which was present a kind of historiography of feminist thought, and a general survey of feminist theory from like the 1600s or whatever to the present. I do feel, however, that what it had in terms of breadth, it lacked in depth. Which is FINE, even great, for an introductory WGSS course, or an English\/lit course, but not so much for a mandatory course for junior WGSS majors. I think this course would be great for providing a solid background in feminist theory, but by the time you're a junior WGSS major, you're not really getting much new stuff out of it. And while I could see how re-reading some of these texts could help you get something different each time, that's harder to do when you're also in a class with people who are taking their very first WGSS class. I mean, I wouldn't walk into a junior level biomedical engineering course without having taken any biomedcal engineering class. In short, I don't have a problem with this course, I don't have a problem with having a mandatory junior seminar, but I do have a problem with this course being the mandatory junior seminar.",
    "The strength of the course was Marta, but the weakness was that we had to read so many old white feminist theorists! I would have preferred if we could have done a quicker job reading the old theory for a historical perspective and more time on contemporary theory to be able to better understand it.",
    "This course could be improved by having a greater focus on black feminist and womanist thought",
    "I wish more attention had been paid to feminists of color and queer theory, considering the amount of time we spend on white feminism. That said, Marta did an amazing job of critiquing authors for their oversights and encouraging the class to do the same.",
    "The professor always led excellent discussions, which tackled the most relevant or most complex parts of our readings. I thought the readings were wonderful--we never had too much reading, but we had enough to get a representative idea of the different thinkers' thoughts. Some WGSS majors mentioned that the class' syllabi overlapped significantly with the syllabi of other classes, so it would be better if this class was open to underclassmen or if its syllabus were revised. Also, I really liked when small-group discussions were introduced halfway through the course.",
    "Great seminar",
    "It's structured like a basic seminar, so there are readings each week and we discuss them during class. The discussions are very rich and I always left knowing much more than I did coming into the class that day."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. I learned so much! Everyone should take at least one WGSS seminar before they graduate.",
    "Hmm not so much, but if they're taking this its probably because its a WGSS class and its required...not the worst class in the world, but for a required WGSS course the department could make it more relevant to all WGSS majors.",
    "Yes! Profesor Figlerowicz cares a lot about her students and the ways in which they each relate to the course material. She frequently reminds students about her availability to meet with them as well. Some of the texts discussed are very informative and proactive, others are less so.",
    "This is really interesting and important subject matter. I learned a lot and enjoyed doing the readings. As an English major, this was a nice introduction to WGSS that still counted as an English credit.",
    "Yes, if someone has a particular interest in feminist and queer theory. You must be open to and excited about learning.",
    "If you can take it with Marta, definitely!",
    "Definitely recommend this class to anyone trying to become a more well-rounded academic",
    "Yes! Absolutely! This course is a fantastic means to grasp Annette hold of feminist and queer theory for those outside of the WGSS major who have a keen interest in obtaining a foundation for other subjects and topics that have to do with gender studies."
