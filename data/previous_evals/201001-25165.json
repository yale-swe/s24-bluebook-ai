    "I would recommend the course.",
    "Highly recommended if you have any interest in the development of democratic institutions and Latin America. Take it!",
    "This was basically an extremely detailed look at a sub-field of comparative politics of which I had absolutely no prior knowledge: the study of patronage (handing out gov't jobs as a political resource) and clientelism (more general forms of vote buying). We devoted a lot of time to classifying these phenomena in detail and discussing what, exactly, separates bribery from programmatic politics. So you probably shouldn't take this class if you don't have the patience to get very, very deep into these weeds.",
    "There isn't much diversity in the literature on this subject. The class gets redundant after the first few weeks, but Professor Stokes is a great discussion leader and brings a lot of resources and knowledge to the class.",
    "PLSC 410 was a great course in distributive politics. I feel I now have a deep understanding of how clientelism works. Professor Stokes is one of the most renowned scholars in the field of distributive politics, and she is also very accessible."
