   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student, as it it one of the only science classes of its kind at Yale. The readings were consistently engaging and the professors knowledgeable. Anyone thinking of going to grad school would especially benefit.",
    "yes",
    "This is a phenomenal learning opportunity, and is one of the most unique classes you could take at Yale. Not only is the information important, creative and topical; the format of the class is rich and engaging and demands participation in the best way possible. I would absolutely recommend this class, but only if you are willing to put your heart into and get the most out of it possible.",
    "Seriously take it.You have to apply to this class early, but it is worth it. It is two semester jr spring\/sr fall will a summer research component that you are guaranteed funding for as an undergrad.Most of the work is doing the readings every week--these are essential, this is not a class where you can skip or skim.Other than that, there is a research proposal at the end.The whole atmosphere is very collegial, you will not only get an understanding of evolutionary medicine, but of the scientific processand community. The discussions are intense--everyone is super smart--but really fun and open.Take it!",
    "If you can get in, take it. You read recent papers in the field and discuss them once a week, and have dinner with distinguished visiting doctors and professors about 4 times a semester.",
    "I would totally recommend the class to another student because the course is taught by four outstanding faculty members and the student discussion based learning in a small classroom setting takes learning to the next level and helps you develop confidence in literature review and strong analytical skills",
    "Unique class to learn about Evolutionary Biology. Great opportunity to interact with amazing researchers, professors and guest speakers."
