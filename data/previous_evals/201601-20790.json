   "comments": [
    "This is a phenomenal course. Take it if you are at all interested in oil, politics and the formation of culture. It will change your perspective and challenge your ideas. Professor Rogers is awesome and your fellow students will be too.",
    "Culture, Power, Oil is a really interesting economic anthropology class. You'll take a look at oil from all sorts of angles -- whether you're considering corporate-labor relations, the influence on an American culture associated with freedom of travels, or the perceptions of oil as a material substance. Think seriously about whether you want to talk about oil all semester, because if it's not an appealing subject to you, you might get tired out. But if it has sparked your interest, this is an excellent class to take.",
    "If you're able to get into this class, I highly recommend it! The students come from very different backgrounds so conversations and discussions are always different and very unique. I'm not an anthropology major but must people aren't too, so that's not a disadvantage. Not an easy class, but very rewarding.",
    "Take it!",
    "ANTH 438 is a course in which you will learn about oil from a multitude of different perspectives. You look at oil and cultural production, the materiality of oil, the production and consumption of oil, oil in particular countries and time periods, etc. The course is very interesting. While you will have a lot of reading, it is all definitely worth doing. I would recommend ANTH 438 to another student if he is interested in learning more about oil or in taking a seminar in which he will learn a lot.",
    "Definitely! It's early in the morning but it is shockingly a seminar that wakes you up! (rather than put you to sleep\/cause you to zone out). Everyone is very \"on\" in the class, and there's never a shortage of things to talk about.",
    "Definitely one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Rogers is incredible and brilliant and really constructs a class of students with unique perspectives and different academic backgrounds. The weekly readings are all incredibly interesting and I actually wanted to do them. The first class where I've felt like I learned skills throughout the semester that I could then apply in my final paper. This class really challenged my conventional thinking of not just oil, but the whole world. You will learn so much, especially if this is your first anthropology class (it's completely accessible to non-anthropologists; in fact, I think we only had one anthro major in our class). Take is if you get the chance!",
    "A mix of ethnography and theory that uses a bunch of different case studies from a bunch of different regions to explore questions like oil's materiality, relationship between state and oil companies, different kinds of sovereignty\/agency\/etc.",
    "Culture, power, oil was my favorite class at Yale. You do not need to be an anthropology major to take this class! It was amazing!",
    "This course examines petroleum from various scholarly disciplines, ultimately establishing a theoretical and analytical framework for examining 'oil culture.' I highly recommend this course, having studied oil from a geochemistry, sociology, and economics background.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student. This course creates a forum for you to radically critique everything about the US and (much of) the global political-economic system, as it links to petroleum and petroleum companies. Professor Rogers facilitates the discussions well and makes sure that students understand the fundamentals of anthropological and sociological theories and contemporary discourses before delving into concrete contemporary case studies. The writing assignments are not too challenging and mostly self-guided, with a multi-step final project."
