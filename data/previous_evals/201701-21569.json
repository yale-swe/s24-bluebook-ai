   "comments": [
    "Honestly one of the best courses I've taken at Yale-really helped me (as someone who had never taken a poli sci class before this year) to develop my own ideas about how the international system works and some of the major spheres of thinking in IR. Super cool class, the professor is AMAZING.",
    "I learned more about international relations and the theory\/structure of thought behind a lot of what occurs in the world today.",
    "Before this course I honestly knew hardly anything about the World Wars, American involvement, the Gulf Wars, the Arab spring, terrorism etc. This course was invaluable in rendering me (someone not interested in politics) a normal human being who can hold a conversation about history and international relations. Thank you.",
    "What the course intended.",
    "I feel I now have a good general understanding of a huge amount of material and the main workings of the international system today. The sheer amount of information itself is hugely useful for helping me understand the world and think about everything that happens and may happen. I have learned to think about current events and history through the different lenses and philosophies we were exposed to and make connections between things I encounter in my life and what I learned in this class and better understand international interactions and bargaining.",
    "This class really taught me how to evaluate the current international political system, especially given the change up in Washington over the course of the semester. Intro to IR allows students to read the great IR theorists and to apply those theories to the real world around us.",
    "I learned how to think about world politics and how world politics have come to take the form they have today",
    "I gained a tremendous amount of knowledge by taking this course. In previous years I had become somewhat familiar with concepts like realism and liberalism by hearing about them in other classes or in passing conversation, but I so appreciated how this course started off by providing me with an incredibly strong foundation for the three main schools of thought on international relations (realism, liberalism, and constructivism). I also learned some fascinating new things about the world wars (particularly World War II), even though I major in European History and have already studied those wars extensively. Perhaps Professor Monteiro's greatest strength in this part of the course was distilling down bodies of knowledge (that I was often familiar with from previous classes) into bullet-points of causes, reasons, and consequences, as one tends to do in political science. He also described the course of these wars better than most history professors I know that have tried to tackle them, even though he's a political science professor! In the second half of the course, discussing contemporary challenges in international relations, I also learned a good deal. Again, one of the most incredible experiences for me was having events and concepts I had already heard about concentrated into causes, reasons, and consequences. Finally, by writing three short essays for the course, I think my writing skills improved.",
    "Understanding of international relations theories and their historical applications, as well as current global governance issues.",
    "This course allowed me to put the current events in the international world into context. Now I can somewhat understand why things are happening the way they are or what some intentions behind certain moves might be.",
    "This course provides a good overview of international relations, addressing the main theoretical schools of thought and several different topics that are relevant currently. It also includes a segment on the two world wars, that was interesting, but much more like a history course than an IR one.",
    "I learned a lot about how to look at the world today and how our current actions are influenced by past events. It also puts me in a better position to understand how to engage with politics and how to be a better citizen.",
    "This course gave a detailed sampling of the essentials of the IR field. As someone interesting in taking more IR classes, I felt this class was invaluable in establishing a strong bedrock of IR knowledge and theory. The course starts with the three main contemporary theories of international politicsrealism, liberalism, and constructivism. Then we work to apply these theories to recent historical events and understand how the three schools interact. For me, it was an extremely effective learning style, and I feel confident I can apply these theories into my other classes over my time at Yale.",
    "A good overview of theories of power politics, the causes and conduct of the two worlds, and current topics in world politics. I also learned how to respond critically to pieces.",
    "A cursory introduction to international relations that can form the foundation for further study.",
    "This class was my favorite that I have taken. It covers a great amount of information, but does it very well. This class gave me an understanding of all the basics used to look at international interactions-- such as game theory and balance of power politics, and allowed me to understand international politics better by looking through the lens of historical scenarios as well as newly forming situations.",
    "A great introduction to international security and development.",
    "The course had a heavier reading load than I have ever experienced at my time at Yale, but I thought it was essential to read all of the assignments for the course. The were all applicable and interesting. I learned how to further my abilities in taking the most important information about the readings and applying them to the course material.",
    "The factors behind international politics.",
    "Learned to evaluate different international events with historical events and political theory.",
    "All history courses I've taken seem to focus on the American perspective, even world history, which I didn't realize as strongly until I took this course. It definitely gave me a more global perspective and changed how I viewed a lot of the world, even in problems like child labor."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A LOT of readings but not all of them are that necessary. The 3 response papers were annoying to do but honestly not that bad considering you can choose what you want to respond to. The lectures were definitely the best part of the course-super engaging and relevant.",
    "It needs to have less readings for the students to better manage. The professor was a great lecturer.",
    "Sometimes it felt as though readings didn't quite relate to lecture material? I didn't enjoy the response papers; I don't understand why they have to be argumentative and can't just be a discussion of the materials. Some of the theory was pretty dry and seemed very logical and unnecessary to me, but it was good being made aware I suppose!",
    "Really solid lecture.",
    "The course was amazing lectures, sections, and readings were all excellent. There's really not much I would change about the course itself, but as for exams and grading, I think the exams were much too simple and short considering how much material was covered and how wide the range of effort and understanding could be. For example, I felt after doing the readings and putting in a lot of effort that I probably could have done about the same on the exams with much less work, even if I didn't understand as well as I did because there was very little I could do to demonstrate my understanding beyond a superficial level. Consequently, the grade bands at least for the midterm were incredibly narrow and I felt that some stupid mistakes or trivial omissions could make a huge difference in the letter grade. I think the course would be better if grades depended less on small things during an exam and more on actually understanding the material, which could be achieved by making the exam cover more and be more difficult to more effectively separate those who put in the work and get the class from those who just superficially know the concepts.",
    "The strengths would definitely be the content of the course. It contains very interesting material and is applicable to the world today. We were able to learn the theories and then apply them to the headlines of the day, such as the Presidents foreign policy decisions and updates from the Syrian Civil War. However, this class has an excessive amount of reading; an average night consisted of 80-100 pages of dense reading. Beware that you will have to put in a lot of time\/effort to both learn and to get a good grade.",
    "Strengths: well organized, great information, informative, relevant weaknesses: none really, but it would have been cool to have some sort of debate or real life application with the class",
    "Great professor, really good TF's and good sections. Slides, and outlines are available online, makes it really easy for students who missed class or need to study. However, the volume of reading is very high, and at times it can be detrimental. It can sometimes be hard to do all the readings in time at a pace that means you are really understanding and soaking in all the information.",
    "I felt the bulk of the material in this course was difficult to grasp and there were few resources to make the information more accessible. For an intro level course, the readings were lengthy and very difficult.",
    "The course has very many notable strengths and very few weaknesses. Its first strength is probably the course content. I was impressed by how much material the course was effectively able to cover, and in a comprehensive and sophisticated way, in only a semester, moving from the schools of thought of international relations to the history of the world wars as case studies to contemporary challenges (nuclear weapons, the spread of democracy, the Arab Spring, terrorism, civil war, the rise of China, energy security, etc.) It really is remarkable how much ground was covered in such an impressive way - I was blown away. How this content was structured was also brilliant, moving from theoretical foundations to historical background to modern events in a seemingly effortless fashion. The reading regimen is another strength of the course. As I will discuss farther down, sometimes the amount of reading assigned was overwhelming, but the readings assigned were almost without exception illuminating and fascinating. Professor Nuno Monteiro and my TA Nate Grubman were also definitely strengths of the course for me, whose merits I will discuss below. In terms of weaknesses, I would say the only weakness is indeed that the amount of reading was sometimes overwhelming, especially for an intro course. I'm not entirely sure where to cut the reading though - my first instinct was the textbook (FLS), since much of that is incredibly similar to what Professor Monteiro says in lecture and thus repetitive. At the same time, it is very useful foundational knowledge. Perhaps the best place to cut would be some of the less interesting articles, the type of article that when you read the introduction you just don't get excited about reading the rest of the article. For me those were usually the articles that were less central to the core questions of our class that dealt with more peripheral topics. There are too many to list here, but I'd encourage Professor Monteiro to trim down the syllabus, eliminating articles that he deems aren't as central to the class' core mission. This is really important I think for the survival and growth of a wonderful class, because students at Yale (at least in my experience) tend to get discouraged when there's too much reading, often doing none of it if they can't do all of it (or close to all of it). If Professor Monteiro doesn't trim down the syllabus a bit, I think he might dissuade otherwise bright students from taking his course.",
    "Strength: great organization, good proportion on theories and history and current affairs.",
    "This course was everything I expected it to be. It is an introductory course that goes through some theories and some real life applications.",
    "This class has so much reading it is crazy. For someone who is unfamiliar with politics or international relations to be given hundreds of pages of reading from different philosophers that often have conflicting views, it is difficult to not have any guidance on how to navigate that.",
    "I think the biggest flaw in this course is the midterm\/final\/response paper format. The class has two exams and three short papers responding to readings. I would have much preferred to write a more analytical\/explorative paper on our readings rather than simply critique them. I also would have preferred larger papers instead of our two exams, which mainly felt like rote memorization rather than learning. However, the readings and lectures in this course gave me a wealth of information. Sections were to-the-point and efficiently recapped the readingsthough I do wish they forced us to take more from the texts, rather than just their main points.",
    "Strengths: the content was always very interesting and relevant. Weaknesses: too many readings.",
    "I think this class does an excellent job of summarizing as much of international politics as it can in such a short time. I believe it would have benefitted from allowing the students to do some type of research paper, but in all it was an excellent course.",
    "As good an introduction to international relations as you are likely to find.",
    "The strengths of this course were clearly the lectures. The instructor was highly engaging, and the lecture content interesting on a theoretical level, but also applicable to present-day events. I also think that the sections were highly useful to understanding the readings.",
    "Great introductory course that offers a taste of international relations theory and practice with respect to an interesting range of current and historical subjects.",
    "It didn't talk as much about current or past international affairs so much as the theories around international politics and I wish it were the opposite.",
    "The amount of reading was a bit overwhelming, but the lectures were great.",
    "The lectures were very structured, and the sections were also very information loaded.",
    "This course provides a great survey of international relations and provides both historical foundation and modern application. However, I think the average of 250 pages of reading a week is a lot to realistically complete WELL, so more guidance on what to focus on in the readings would have been good."

   "comments": [
    "DEFINITELY. If I had taken this my freshman year instead of my junior year, I probably would have been a poli sci major. AMAZING professor, average workload, and lectures were great.",
    "Yes, it is a great introduction to the subject area. A lot of readings, so be mindful of that.",
    "Yes! As a senior taking it this was the perfect Credit D Fail. Before this course I honestly knew hardly anything about the World Wars, American involvement, the Gulf Wars, the Arab spring, terrorism etc. This course was invaluable in rendering me (someone not interested in politics) a normal human being who can hold a conversation about history and international relations. highly recommend to international students like me who don't know what's up with recent American international relations.",
    "Nuno is a great lecturer. Definitely take this course if you would like some insight into how world politics work.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who wishes to gain a better understanding the forces that led us to where we are and that may shape the future. The exposure to key works in IR literature was immensely rewarding and I now have a completely different way of looking at the world, history, current events, and international politics. Lectures are great and sections are actually helpful and enjoyable.",
    "Yes, and even to a student not majoring in PLSC. This course was very helpful in becoming a fuller member of the public sphere. I feel that I can now engage with the newspaper articles about foreign affairs on a much deeper level. However, beware of the intense amount of reading. It takes a lot of energy and time, especially for an introductory class.",
    "Yes definitely the class is so fun and the info is awesome",
    "yes, but be ready for a lot of reading.",
    "I think there are a number of better options for anyone looking to take an international relations class. I felt the material was very dense, and difficult to digest.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student - it was one of my favorite courses that I've ever taken at Yale (I'm a junior). As I said above, the course content, structure, and readings are all tremendous, and, I will explain below, Professor Monteiro has been one of my favorite professors at Yale. What's great about this course is that I think even someone who isn't studying global affairs\/political science\/history would really appreciate it. It hits a sweet spot in terms of being both accessible to students outside this area of study and still being fascinating for students like me (I'm a history major who's taken a lot of political science coursework) who are familiar with many of the topics addressed in the course.",
    "Yes, great course for anyone interested in political science \/ how the world is governed.",
    "I recommend this class to any Yale student, even if you are STEM or architecture or art, everyone needs a basic understanding of this world and this is a great course to give you some insight.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The material (particularly in the second half of the semester, where the things learned in the first half are applied) is interesting and important to know. The workload is not too bad (readings are long but not completely necessary, papers are short and can be written essentially whenever) and the lectures are engaging.",
    "I would recommend but you have to understand how much reading you have to do. Expect to have hundreds of pages and if you don't read thoroughly at least some of it then you might not understand. Really try to engage with your section and your TA because they will be extremely helpful.",
    "Anyone interested in international relations should take this class!!! The readings are exhaustive and a little overwhelming at times, but they comprise an overview of the essentials in IR theory and knowledge. The lectures are fun (Nuno is great!!!), though section can be a bit stressful (participation in them is a large chunk of your grade). The first part of the course is acclimating yourself with the major theories and ideas in IR thought, and the second part is mostly applying those ideas to recent and current events. It is an extremely timely course, with Nuno taking class time to specifically discuss Trump and his actions. It's a great class for understanding the way nations and thinkers interact and mesh. I'd highly recommend it.",
    "Definitely take this just so you'll be more informed about how the world is shaped and how it will continue to change.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who has even the slightest interest in international politics.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this class for anyone looking to go into economics, politics, or NGO work.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to all students no matter what major. There were students out of every grade in the class. The lectures are highly interesting and engaging. There are theoretical, historical, and present-day examples included in the material to help facilitate the learning. Overall, an awesome class!",
    "I would highly recommend this course because the lectures are extremely interesting and engaging, the professor explains clearly and interestingly and the power point slides, which are all available online, are very helpful for reviewing course material. Furthermore my TA was very helpful, as we discussed the readings in class and he answered questions and clarified course material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student - Professor Monteiro was excellent, and the subject covered was fresh and engaging.",
    "This course offered a lot of information that will allow students going forward to better understand and process information about international affairs.",
    "Yes",
    "If you have no background in international relations, I would take this course - I definitely learned a lot and would go as far to say that my perspective on the world has changed. It seems like a lot of reading but the lectures cover all of the important concepts and there's plenty of review."
