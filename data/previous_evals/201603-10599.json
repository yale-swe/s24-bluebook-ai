    "I had previous knowledge in Japanese and placed into this course. I found that this course helped me develop my language skills to a more natural flow. I got used to speaking in Japanese on a daily basis, albeit a few grammar errors here and there, and it made me comfortable talking to Japanese friends and superiors.",

    "I felt that the flexibility of the program was its biggest strength. The kindness and understanding Seto-sensei and Maruyama-sensei showed during the course of this semester was incredible, and encouraged me to not give up and still try my best to excel at this discipline. The other strength is the extremely fair grading system- every answer has a number of points, and each mistake results in different deductions. That also made me feel like my efforts are appreciated and in turn encouraged me to try my best.",
    "Small class size is very helpful for learning, instructors are excellent at making content interesting. I feel my spoken ability developed least compared to other skills, more chances to speak in class may help."

    "Yes, if they are willing to devote the time to learning Japanese."
