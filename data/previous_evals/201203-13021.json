   "comments": [
    "This is a wondeful class for anyone with an interest in the humanities, literature, or classics. Also, of the three DS classes, the Lit lectures tend to be the best. Lit also has the most reading of the three DS classes, so if you can't stand reading, then Lit is probably the biggest deterrent for you. But keep in mind that the literature you read in this class is the best literature of the ancient world, so it's good reading. Definitely take DS Lit with Duval if you can!",
    "I would say, \"In DS Lit, you're going to read a lot. Most of it is Greeks and Romans. Whether you like that or not, you'll be glad you've read it all later, when you notice allusions everywhere.\"Yes I would recommend DS Lit to another student, primarily on the strength and breadth of the reading syllabus.",
    "I think Directed Studies is an awesome program that leads you through literature from Ancient Greece to Dante's Divine Comedy (in the fall). It gives you a really good chance to practice the kind of reading and writing skills required in college, plus you get to read in depth the staples of the Western tradition that come up again and again. It gives you a full (well, to the extent possible in a semester) and coherent picture of the famous literature you have only tasted before. Also, the literature lectures are ALWAYS amazing.The weakness is probably the unremitting workload, because it somewhat limits your ability to do other things, but it's something I'm willing to put up with for a year.I would recommend DS to students who are so curious about the full picture of the Western tradition that they are willing to go through the stress of regular papers and extensive reading. I would not recommend DS to students who dislike survey courses, stress, or to someone who wants a diverse course load.",
    "I would recommend this course wholeheartedly.",
    "Survey of ancient literature. Good if you like to read stuff...",
    "Sure, Directed Studies is difficult, but you'll become a far better writer and reader for it. I've you're interested in a broad overview of classics, you belong in this course. And, while there may not be much time to analyze the works as much as they deserve, the lectures and brilliant section leaders (Duval) will make up for it, as will your own essays. And, if you take this course, take it with Duval! He knows all the languages, is a very balanced section leader (i.e., he has his own agenda, but reserves much of the class to discuss the students' findings), and is extremely dedicated. He writes extensive essay commentaries (both style and content), sends extra emails with further analysis, and is always available to discuss essays in his office hours.",
    "Fascinating overview of Western society's foundational texts. Highly recommend.",
    "Out of all the DS courses, I may have enjoyed the discussions in this class the most. Literature is naturally prone to deep analysis, and the professor did an excellentjob of organizing section around specific key points in the works. I highly recommend this course (and all of DS) to any freshman unsure about entering the program.",
    "I would summarize Directed Studies 001 02 as a class on reading. Of course, in the process, you end up covering an enormous chunk of the western cannon of literature, gaining a perspective of how classical thought transforms into revealed thought. But though you may one day forget about the significance of Aeneas' shield or the typographical pun in Caesar's Apotheosis, you will not lose the skills in close reading that you acquire in this course. And that is why, despite the day to day challenges of pushing through the reading assignments, I recommend this course to any student who can maintain the perspective of an end goal.",
    "I loved it! Only take it if you don't have an issue with reading a lot of books at a very fast pace though.Also, if you can, take it with Duval! He's all you can hope for in a professor: knowledgable, approachable, incredibly helpful with papers."
