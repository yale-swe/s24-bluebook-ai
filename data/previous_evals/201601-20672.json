    "This section is high-energy and you feel compelled to speak. Very few awkward silences. Specific themes of discussion are more student-directed, but the professor pulls you in the right direction.",
    "This is a fast-paced course that explores some of the greatest literary works in the Western canon. It is a lot of reading, but it was so worth it.",
    "Take this class! I guarantee that there will be at least one work that you will love and want to read again and study in greater detail. The lectures are often inspiring, also. The amount of reading is intense, for sure, with about a thousand pages of required reading over Christmas and spring breaks, but it is so fulfilling! Basically one-stop shopping for the Western canon's Greatest Hits.",
    "You will have a lot of reading to do, but it's worth it!",
    "I would recommend this course wholeheartedly. I would also recommend taking it especially with Prof. Neuman if he teaches next year."
