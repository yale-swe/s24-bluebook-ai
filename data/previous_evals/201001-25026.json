   "comments": [
    "This class basically consists of reading through Sam Adler's book on orchestration, talking through it each class, looking at some extra examples and some more extended techniques and a bunch of homework and assignments.",
    "If you've never written for orchestra before, take it. It provides basic, useful, practical knowledge with a few good performance opportunities. If you know anything about this already, you won't pick up much from the class.",
    "Not the most fascinating class, but definitely an important skill to learn if you are a composer, and if you're a musician it gives an interesting perspective on the orchestra and the types of decisions composers have to make when they write for it. The workload isn't too bad, although there are some major projects that take some time.",
    "Music 320 covers all of the standard orchestral instruments in lectures and has supplementary homework assignments. The course requires three projects (a string orchestra transcription, a symphony orchestra transcription, and a string quartet transcription) and a final exam.",
    "Professor Klingbeil does a very thorough job of going through various instruments' extended techniques and score analysis. This course is very helpful to composers of all levels. It should be offered way more often than it is, as I've been in composition seminar for three years now, and am having the opportunity to learn to write for large ensembles for the first time. Or if this course is not offered more often, some of the material should be more integrated into the class time of composition seminar in place of the guest composer presentations.",
    "A great overview of orchestration. Klingbeil covers both traditional and contemporary methods without alienating students more invested in one or the other. Orchestration can be dry material; the course's focus on three major projects allow students to come away with pieces of work they can feel proud of.",
    "Good introduction to orchestration. We had a number of our orchestrations played by real ensembles, which was a great learning experience. Lectures were interesting, especially when people demonstrated instruments.",
    "If you're hesitant about writing for any of the standard orchestral instruments, this class is a great way to gain a solid foothold so that you don't write anything too crazy. There are also great opportunities to have original orchestral\/band\/string quartet arrangements performed. The whole class was a lot of fun.",
    "It was a good introduction to orchestration, and the orchestra reading was helpful. Professor Klingbeil is also very helpful when you meet with him one-on-one.",
    "The course is mostly dedicated to learning the basics (range, tone color, mechanics, etc.) of each of the instruments of a modern symphony orchestra, with homeworks ranging from correcting parts that have been badly written for the instruments to short piano pieces that are to be arranged for specific ensembles. In all honesty, if you already have a working knowledge of most of the instruments, you're not going to learn very much. The most valuable part, though, is in hearing readings of two of your projects, which is a rare opportunity for most students. So, if you particularly value this, I do recommend the class.",
    "It's a great and probably necessary elective if you are into composition, conducting, or simply want to be good Music major. Workload isn't terrible and you'll enjoy hearing your pieces being performed."
