   "comments": [
    "I would not suggest this class to another student because as I said earlier, I did not receive a grade until April - and by that point, it was too late to change my grade by a large amount.",
    "If a student wants to engage with literature while improving his\/her French language skills, this is the perfect class. Focus on oral expression, less on written exercises. Would definitely recommend this class, especially when taught by Mme Sanjabi!",
    "Prof. Sanjabi was excellent; take FR170 with her as she is one of the most caring and chill people in the French dept. The workload is very reasonable, and the material covered is interesting and covers so many things without slowing down too much.",
    "Be prepared to do a lot of reading and not know what your grade is until May.",
    "Yup! Take it if you want to learn about the evolution of French literature - some of the reading is a wanker - but you end up with a good appreciation of French writing. Also its a pretty doable workload.",
    "Fantastic course that will whizz you through key pieces in French literary history",
    "I would recommend this course, but I would also suggest shopping it because it depends very much on who is in the class. I really liked Prof. Sanjabi, the workload is relaxed, the reading list is very interesting and diverse. However, the students in my class were very quiet, which made the course drag a bit. Therefore, shop it, see who's in it, and then decide. But, on the merits of everything else about the course, I really enjoyed it!"
