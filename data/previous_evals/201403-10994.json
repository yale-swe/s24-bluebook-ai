    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, particularly to historians of Europe or the US, who tend to be quite insular in what they study but who would benefit from both the theoretical and methodological approaches in the class. This is a class which is both about big issues that we can think about beyond the bounds of South Asian history, and it's a class about the history of South Asia. I found that to be a particularly interesting and valuable synthesis.",
    "I would think that it's essential for anyone who is working on South Asia. We do most things assuming we know enough history to get by, when we actually don't know anything."

   "comments": [
    "South Asian historians are more eclectic in their approach to history than Middle Easternists are, and this course was great in exposing me to a variety of creative ways to use sources and think about history. In that way it certainly contributed to my research. I also plan to do a field in South Asia, probably colonial South Asia, so this could also be considered a starting point for that.",
    "Yes of course it has, I didn't know any Indian history before this, and that's a shame for someone who is training to study India. More specifically, in terms of research, it has helped me situate my interests in a longer history, and find parallels between the past and the present. It has also introduced me to several texts and ideas that I find very useful, and will be sure to work with."
