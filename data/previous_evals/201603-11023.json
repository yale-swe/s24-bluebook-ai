   "comments": [
    "U.S. lesbian and gay history--the entirety of it. I had known nothing about the development of gay and lesbian identities and the history of sexualities until this class, and it did a great job taking one through the trajectory of time.",
    "I learned so much about LGBT history that I'd never known before!",
    "Learned about sexuality. This class was awesome, you've probably heard good things about it, take it.",
    "I knew nothing about US Lesbian and Gay History before this course, and truly didn't intend to take it. I dropped in for the first lecture because I heard Chauncey was a good professor, and I stuck with it because I was so blown away. I not only learned more in this class than most of my classes at Yale, I think more of the material will stick with me than most other classes as well. I also learned to challenge common interpretations of history, particularly when examining socially-oppressed populations, and learned how to engage with history from an analytical perspective.",
    "I developed a far greater knowledge of LGBT history and I believe my analytical writing improved.",
    "I have gained a completely new perspective on American history. I learned new things every class and section.",
    "I developed my ability to read at the college level while still getting enough information from the reading. Studying big swaths of time for the midterm and grappling with concepts contrary to the assumptions i've lived my entire life.",
    "I've thought deeply about the history of queer formation--it is an underprivileged, but extremely interesting history.",
    "This stuff isn't covered in any general U.S. history class that you would take in high school or at Yale. It completely reshaped the way I understand sexuality in the 21st century, and provided insights into how gay and lesbian history is intertwined with the rest of U.S. history.",
    "Classic Yale course covering a topic that many don't know much about even if they think they do. Chauncey is an incredible lecturer, obviously cares so much about his students and the course material.",
    "This was one of the best classes I have ever taken and would so recommend it to literally everyone.",
    "Learned about gay history like the course said I would. It was straightforward. I didn't really gain any skills re writing papers or how to read sources, but that's not super surprising since I took an intro course as a senior.",
    "learned about the long history of lesgays",
    "LesGay was an incredible course! It was extremely enlightening to learn about the history of a group that has not been documented as completely as those of other groups. I particularly loved learning about gay responses to discriminatory policies implemented by the government as well as the nuances of sexuality that existed (and still do!) in American society.",
    "What didn't I learn from this class?! US Lesbian and Gay History is a must-take. I learned how to write an ethnography, how to write history papers, how to respectfully interview people about somewhat controversial topics...oh, and learned about four hundred years of history detailing gay and lesbian life and identity in the United States. I will be using analytic tools and readings from this class, as well as Chauncey's deep wisdom, for a long time coming.",
    "I learned how to be a better writer, and especially gained valuable skills in writing about history, specifically. But also learned how to connect different eras in history, to develop a cohesive historical picture and make arguments based off that. I would have liked to write a more extensive research paper (and that would have been a useful skill to learn).",
    "I learned a lot about the course's history.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of not only LGBTQ history and constructions of sexuality but also of changing cultural norms across the entire nation's history.",
    "This class equipped me with so much knowledge, skills, and tools. After taking this course, I have a firm understanding of LGBT--specifically gay and lesbian--history in the United States. Because of this course, I learned about historical trends that the gay communities have undergone throughout the US. This knowledge will definitely help me during life after Yale as I continue my LGBT activism myself. Additionally, this course exposed me to LGBT leaders and their work, people and frameworks that will help me organize my own activism post-Yale.",
    "Not only did I learn about the struggle for gay liberation and developed a vocabulary to talk about minorities and communities, but I also learned about the history of gender and sexuality int he US.",
    "Overview of Lesbian and Gay history from early America to modern. Insights: history is not linear, gay people had vibrant communities for much of US history, conceptions of sexuality change.",
    "The ability to think critically about LGBTQ history in regards to the larger grand scheme of things in American history.",
    "Critical thinking about how I see my life and he social scenes around me. Chauncey applied what we were learning to our lives at yale and the presidential eleciton",
    "deeper understanding of gender, sex and sexuality.",
    "Learned how to write history papers, discuss history and learned so much about how non-linear history is. Learned about important gay and lesbian historical figures and the hidden history at times that was not taught in general US history. Also learned a lot about general US history during this time period (not just lesbian\/gay history).",
    "A deeper and more nuanced understanding of an often-underexplored aspect of U.S. history.",
    "I learned a lot about the history addressed in the course, it was extremely interesting and it was great to see the broader scope of change in society. I understood the history and context of many historical events and movements.",
    "This is by far one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale. I had absolutely no background in this subject matter, and Professor Chauncey's lectures will stay with me forever. He gives such interesting background on the subject going back to the colonial period, and his lectures opened my mind to thinking about American society and societal norms concerning sexuality and gender in a completely different way. Also great TAs. TAKE IT!!!",
    "This course is unreal. So so well taught. each lecture furthered my understanding of 20th century history, gender studies, and American popular culture in one way or another. Very well organized and engaging. Also Chauncey is such a sweetheart.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about us lesbian and gay history, the non linear trajectory of history, the rise of the Christian Right, and the overall discussion of sex and sexuality throughout US history. I think one of the coolest aspects I learned was learning about the deeper implications of famous American events or policies. For example, I had studied the GI Bill in the past, but this class illuminated the submerged effects of the bill in regulation sexuality and family life. Overall, super fascinating.",
    "A huge amount about lesbian & gay history, which I had little to no understanding about prior to taking this class. Tons of information and insights about the struggle faced by LGBTQ activists and citizens a lot. Direct and indirect policing was a fascinating subject as well.",
    "This course taught me about an aspect of American History that has personal relevance to me and that is not often analyzed and taught.",
    "Too many to put into an answer like this. I learned so much, both about the things that I had previously heard about but had no depth of knowledge and many things I had never heard of before.",
    "An incredibly interesting insight into the history of lesbian and gay individuals in America.- a portion of our country's history that I've never been exposed to. The class is designed to put the experience of the LGBTQ community in context with areas of history that students already know well. Very interesting and insightful! It definitely opened my eyes.",
    "I learned so much about US LGBTQ history, the change in perception (which is not linear, as Professor Chauncey likes to say), and so many other things that there is no way I could summarize it all here!",
    "The history of sexuality is under-taught and under-appreciated. I feel more attuned to my own sexual identity and now understand the history behind contemporary debates such as marriage equality.",
    "Incredible introduction to queer history and theory and perfect history class to encourage students to think critically about dominant historical narratives.",
    "Queer history, which I did not know that much about prior to taking this course, and how much of history is produced through struggle. For some reason the question \"does history\/the universe tend towards justice?\" is one that has surfaced repeatedly in my life this past semester, and this course provided me with a lot of evidence towards an answer: no.",
    "I learned so much about lesgay history, as well as history in general. This class really profoundly shaped my worldview and how I look at progress in our society. Plus, I learned what a truly great lecture can be like.",
    "I gained insight into a dimension of U.S. history that had previously been unknown to me. It also provided me with a new perspective to understand both past and present events, actions, and interactions.",
    "I learned a lot of history of the LGBTQ movements, and how to analyze change over time.",
    "This class has allowed me to learn more than I ever thought possible about lesbian and gay history. We discuss LesGay history from the colonial era, through the beginning of the 1900s, the changes after WWII and all of modern LGBTQ activism. It truly was a comprehensive history of this period.",
    "I learned a huge amount of information about the history of sexuality in America and specifically lesbian and gay culture. I learned new skills and tools of historical analysis.",
    "I learned how to write IDs.",
    "This was my favorite class by far this semester. I had always wanted to learn more about LGBTQ history, and with this course I got just that; I learned so much of something that unfortunately often goes ignored. Every lecture just blew me away. I was also able to read so many great texts by a large variety of authors, some of whom I'd really wanted to read more of before. I also think the course helped me with a writing a bit.",
    "I learned how to look at my own place in history and take even my most concrete beliefs with a grain of salt. I saw how the views of everyone around me have been shaped by broader cultural and political shifts in the past few centuries - my parents, my grandparents, my friends and classmates and teachers. To quote Professor Chauncey: \"This history does what any other history does, only more: it de-naturalizes the present. It helps us understand that the way we behave sexually and understand ourselves as gendered and sexual beings, seemingly natural parts of our identity, are actually a product of history, and subject to change over time. In this course, we should examine ourselves.\" We learned about everything from sodomy in New England, to the bed-sharing habits of the mid-19th century, to the Vassar \"women's smashes.\" We learned about how the poses we see in Yale football team photos have changed over time. We read diaries and declarations and articles and books. We learned about WWII, about the sexual revolution, about Stonewall and AIDS and the push for gay marriage. We learned that progress can sometimes take one step forward and two steps back. Perhaps most importantly, we learned tools necessary to help our generation take that next step forward.",
    "I have learned so much about myself as a thinker, writer, and historian from this class. I have been able to practice my writing skills and learn how to learn history in what is my first college-level history class. I have grown so much throughout this course.",
    "As someone who is gay, I did not realize the depth and complexity of LGBTQ+ history just in the US alone. This course surpassed all expectations and was really amazing. It is a must-take.",
    "Not only did I gain a comprehensive grasp on gay and lesbian history in the US, but I learned how to approach studying history and writing history papers.",
    "A broad overview of a vital part of American history that is not taught or spoken about in most of the country. It's a fascinating lens through which to revisit topics we thought we fully understood: colonial America, World War II, the Civil Rights movement, and even 21 century politics.",
    "Deep understanding of the history sexuality, same-sex relations, the concept of a queer identity and community within the United States. Rigorous historical examination with occasional and highly valuable forays into theory, anthropology, music, and film.",
    "This class taught me a history that I knew nothing about that now seems so intuitive and important to me. I do not think I will ever forget the things I have learned in this class. I am so glad for taking it.",
    "I developed an understanding of LGBTQ people's place in American history far more comprehensive than any I had previously, and also a set of critical-thinking skills sharp enough to help me interpret that understanding.",
    "This was an amazing course. In the process of learning U.S. lesbian and gay history, I also learned so much about American history, American cultural politics, and the way queer theory has changed over time. The course was really effective at de-naturalising the ways that we talk about gender, sexuality, and relationships presently, and providing historical context for those ways of thinking. Chauncey's lectures were excellent and incredibly engaging.",
    "I learned a part of history that was barely ever taught throughout all my previous years of education. It is an eye-opening and must-take course!",
    "I learned how to critically analyze historical events and not see happenings as always linear. I also just learned so much LGBTQ history that I didn't know and that encompassed all the aspects of American history I never knew about, and these stories definitely enhanced my perception of major American historical events.",
    "I feel like I learned a TON about American history in this course, and enhanced my ability to analyze historical events.",
    "I learned an entirely different history, one I've never learned before. It filled in much of the gaps for the history I've learned both in high school and throughout Yale, and added insights in a much needed field.",
    "It was my first introduction to college level history classes and it helped me realize what the study of history actually entails. It was a fun way to practice historical writings and analysis in a really fun class.",
    "A much clearer picture of sexuality as an constructed concept, and how the concept evolved through time. Also, very valuable for understanding how to conduct intellectual inquiry in a less explored field (oral history etc.)",
    "I learned so much!! This class deals with a history that is rarely if ever taught in high school and middle school, and by taking this course I discovered the richness of queer culture in 20th century america - something I never thought existed. It is one of those rare courses that you enter skeptical about whether there is even enough material to make it through the semester, and leave wishing you take it for 4 more months. Truly left me speechless.",
    "Could not recommend this course enough. Very important history and very well taught!",
    "I learned so much about a part of history I knew about very minimally. I also haven't taken any history classes at Yale, so I got a good introductory taste of what it's like to write a college history paper and how to read and analyze historical documents that were fascinating without being overly challenging.",
    "I'm a sophomore history major focusing on the United States, and this class certainly provided me with a new way to look at this country's history! I've already taken a decent amount of history classes, so the skills learned were nothing new, but the content was extraordinarily interesting.",
    "I learned about a section of US history that I had absolutely no awareness of before! I learned to see how gay and lesbian history intersects with the rights struggles I studied in courses focusing on African American history and general US history. I learned how to read sources with a critical eye to whose stories, whose voices, etc. are being left out of the narrative. Basically, I learned how to be a better critical thinker, a better student of history, and a better person.",
    "This course gave me an overview of an entire American history that I never knew existed. The course begins with Puritan America, in which homosexuality was not viewed as an identity and instead as a Biblical sin like any other. It then moves into the antebellum period in which romantic love between same sex individuals was difficult for those individuals to conceive; and the post-war Gilded Age in which homosexuality was increasingly seen as an identity with the rise of commercialized heterosexuality and rising heterosocialization. It then traces the burgeoning gay world of the pre-WWII era, how WWII catalyzed homosexual culture, post-WWII governmental backlash, and the promotion of heteronormativity. Finally, it traces the homophile, 60s and 70s Counterculture, and 80s and 90s AIDS activism. In short, the history of gays and lesbians is incredibly rich and fascinating. Reading things such as Radclyffe Hall, Francis Willard, James Baldwin, Audre Lorde, Donald Vining, Martin Duberman, and Larry Kramer changed my lifeand helped me see how my identity as a queer individual is based off of the struggles and fights of queers of the past. What I most appreciated was Chauncey doing his best to weave in the perspective of queers of color and queerness at the margins of each era of history. It gave me the strength and self-understanding to hope and act for a better future, because as Chauncey puts it, History is never inevitable.",
    "I was introduced to a rich historical tradition that I hope to continue to explore in my studies. By the end of the course I was able to look back over the information we learned and synthesize the details of Gay and Lesbian history into broad trends that are extremely relevant to current politics and events. I improved my critical reading and analytical writing skills. I learned how to better engage with primary and secondary historical sources.",
    "I learned more about the older history of what we would classify as queers in America.",
    "This class was fantastic. I learned a lot about gay and lesbian history, a subject that I hadn't realized had such a long history with important and widely unrecognized effects on general American history. I was exposed to countless primary source texts and I learned how to put a lot of American history that we learn in AP US History classes in the scape of gender and sexuality discourses.",
    "Learned a lot about an interesting and complex history which I've never been exposed to in any other history class through insightful readings and engaging class discussions.",
    "I learned a lot about this lesser-known history.",
    "This class gave me a solid foundation in a topic I previously knew next to nothing about, and for that I am grateful. It also taught me how to think more analytically in terms of social histories and individual narratives. The readings did a good job of forcing me to place primary sources in their context and read personal testimonies as historical documents, something I never think I really learned to do very well in high school.",
    "The course assessed and developed one's ability to conduct critical analysis and thoughtful judgment of history.",
    "Learned how to write a Yale history paper and how to take notes during lecture. More specifically, I learned more about queer identities and how they have morphed into what they are nowadays in the United States.",
    "It is a real pity that for identities that are not inherited, the sense of history is lost. People of marginalized races and genders tend to have inherited their identity and their sense of history with it. For those whose sense of identity is not shared by the family, the sense of history is lost, and so gay kids ave to learn their history on their own, if they are even so fortunate. This course is an essential class for gay people, as well as one of the best-prepared classes at Yale. It does have a very far left bend, though.",
    "My understanding of U.S. queer history is so much better than it was. I also think that this class was good for further developing general analysis and critical thinking skills.",
    "I learned a large amount of content about Lesbian and Gay History in the United States -- something that I had not known previously.",
    "Conceiving of history as a process and not an immobile monolith; historical contextualization of events; tracking historical themes over time\/recognizing changes and continuities; academic tolerance; history as a call to academic AND social action.",
    "As a history major, I have yet to take a course on social history, which Professor Chauncey's introduced me to. I particularly enjoyed the papers in this regard, in which we could sift through our own, our relatives, and various writers views on sexual history in the United States.",
    "Greater insight into US Les\/Gay history and American culture. I feel extremely grateful for having learned about this history as I was never taught it and would not get such a wealth of knowledge about this important topic otherwise. I had taken history classes before so the history writing skills were not so new.",
    "The course is remarkable for many reasons, not the least of which is the comprehensive overview it gives of the often hidden history of America's LGBTQ citizens and communities.",
    "I had never learned any LGTBQ history, so this class taught about an area I honestly didn't know existed.",
    "I learned about how to host an interview",
    "I learned how to analyze primary sources, conduct oral histories, and write historical essays.",
    "I gained a great deal of knowledge about a little-known history that is personally and politically relevant to everyone. It also taught me a new way of thinking about history, not as linear progression but rather as a series of events and tensions that shape norms and struggles.",
    "A ton. Great great class",
    "A good amount",
    "This class taught me how to be a better academic! How to write papers that take previous academics' work to construct new unique arguments. This class teaches you how to be a contributing part of the field of queer history.",
    "This course taught me about a subject that was entirely new in my academic career. Although I do not identify with the LGBTQ community, this class gave me the tools to better understand the Yale community and LGBTQ communities at large.",
    "I learned a lot about a civil rights movement and how to think about a non-monolithic historical narrative.",
    "I learned a lot about lives of lesbians and gay men in the States in history. More importantly, I learned that concept of sexuality and anti-gay sentiment are not static.",
    "BEST CLASS",
    "I learned a lot about the history of a minority in the United States that constitute a major political force. I learned about the importance of finding a variety of sources when it comes to oral histories. I learned how to conduct and write oral histories. I learned about the vastly different experiences encompassed in the terms 'gay' and 'lesbian'. I learned that history doesn't always move forwards.",
    "As an international student, this class taught me quite a deal about US History and definitely a whole lot on lesbian and gay history, I really feel like I learned a lot thanks to this class! It also taught me how to write history papers and how to conduct an oral history project.",
    "This course covers a fascinating side of history that I never encountered in any other class, at Yale or in high school. Lectures are engaging, dynamic, and unexpected and the course readings are varied and worthwhile. It was an excellent complement to my existing knowledge of American history.",
    "I learned a ton about a history that I thought I knew about and realized I knew nothing about. I gained a deeper understanding of actual historical events as well as how to understand history.",
    "I learned so much about history and about the world we live in. It was a great lecture that taught me how to contextualize content and think about history in the present.",
    "This was my first ever humanities course and course with a discussion section, so I learned many skills related to approaching a class such as this. For example, I learned how to manage a reading load in addition to my other coursework. I also learned how to prepare for section and participate in an engaging fashion. In addition, the insight gained related to the subject matter were highly valuable. I knew almost nothing about lesbian and gay history prior to the class due to my conservative hometown, so it was an especially enlightening course, offering knowledge that I find to be incredibly important.",
    "This class is great at providing an broad thematic based understanding of lesbian and gay history within the United States. The material is extremely interesting and is easy to place in context with the more \"traditional\" understanding of history. The course sheds a light on sexuality and components of history that are not too commonly studied.",
    "I learned so much that I would not have learned otherwise about the LGBTQ community as well as about American history. I also think I got better at analyzing primary sources.",
    "A look on the history you thought you knew, from totally new angles. Prof. Chauncey does a masterful job of weaving in canon US history and context while illuminating what was happening in the gay world at the time. The second quarter is especially thrilling.",
    "A wonderfully interdisciplinary, comprehensive course covering everything from film and music to memoir and academic prose. Lectures were probing, inquisitive, and eye-opening, while sections were a fantastic opportunity to reflect and ponder broader implications of the course. Assignments were fairly substantial, but a true pleasure to complete.",
    "I developed a much more comprehensive understanding of the history of the LGBTQ community in America. I also gained more skill in writing and historical analysis.",
    "I gained new knowledge in the field of gay history, and more importantly the knowledge that such a field truly existed. It was nice to have the overview of a standard history, but it was as if this course exposed am alternate timeline which was previously left behind. Furthermore, the course broadened my ability to analyze and interpret primary sources, as so many of the accounts were diaries taken from the time period referenced.",
    "Real understanding for gay and lesbian history and culture",
    "knowledge of an entire segment of american history that I had never learned about",
    "Incredible class. Was affirming in that I finally saw myself as a gay man in a larger history. Fill in many of the games that my public and private educations have afforded me",
    "One of the biggest insights from this semester is that history is neither monolithic nor monotonic. It is an ebb and flow between different forces acting against one another and taking advantage of certain circumstances available to them.",
    "By taking this course, I gained a new understanding of history through a specific lens: that of the LGBT population. I came into this course with very little understanding of modern LGBT culture, let alone the historical development of this culture, so this course opened a new perspective of this for me. Like all history classes, I learned how to evaluate primary sources, and how to understand history through the context of the time period.",
    "I learned a lot about LGBT history, a lot about the subjectivity of history itself, and a lot about writing.",
    "So much! I was specifically interested in nineteenth-century understandings of homosexual behavior, the relationship of gay people and the arts, and differences between lesbian and gay communities. I got plenty of really interesting answers to those questions and the papers gave us the opportunity to pursue and research our interests further. Plus a lot of very basic LGBT knowledge - culture, history, cast of characters. So good.",
    "Deeper understanding of the historical\/cultural context surrounding gay life and gay politics. Improved my argumentative writing skills in the context of history\/historiography.",
    "This was by far the most meaningful course I've ever taken at Yale or any other academic institution. Professor Chauncey provides an entirely new and unique history that runs alongside everything you learned in high school, teaching with personal nuance and infinite respect, passion, and care for the subject matter. This course taught me, amongst many things, how to question mainstream historical narratives, how to synthesize primary documents and analyses to create my own argument, how to write and think critically about history, and most importantly how to take stock of my place in history as a queer person and be infinitely more thankful towards and appreciative of those who came before me. Not to mention proud.",
    "Valuable development of knowledge and vocabulary to speak about issues surrounding LGBTQ issues",
    "I gained a lot more knowledge about the development of gay and lesbian culture and how it was a product of larger global movements.",
    "This course developed my knowledge of the LGBT community through history, especially during the 20th century, and how LGBT people formed their own communities and how they interacted with heterosexual communities as well. I gained skills in doing interviews for oral history. I gained insight into the trajectory of the US's cultural history.",
    "I learned not only about how homosexual relationships are organized, but also about how my own heterosexual relationship is organized. I learned how to understand the way our society shapes our every move, and the way that most of our identity is just a social construct. I also learned how to understand social history, which I had never done before.",
    "I learrned a lot of new and specific information about lesbian and gay history that's usually brushed over or mythified in popular culture.",
    "I learned to look at history through a different lens, and developed the skills analyzing historical documents such as diaries, articles and letters.",
    "I learned so much about lesbian and gay history that I hadn't known! Combined with other cultural history, really enriched my knowledge of American history and trends.",
    "An understanding of gay history",
    "I learned a great deal about a facet of American history that is crucial, and very important to me.",
    "I learned how to frame a major topic and trace its progression throughout time. I learned that historically, progress does not occur continuously. We often take steps backwards, so to keep up the pace of being open, accepting, and everyone having their freedom, we have to keep pushing the powers that be to make changes happen.",
    "I can honestly say that I learned more in this course than any other this year. I learned a host of angles from which to tackle difficult questions why do expressions of sexuality differ in categorical ways between people? and I think l internalized them in ways that I wouldnt in any other course. We took historical, anthropological, sociological, etc. approaches to the material, and I wouldn't ave had it any other way.",
    "I learned about lesbian and gay history history specifically, but more generally how to think about history of more marginalized groups.",
    "This course taught me how to take really effective notes in lecture, to think critically about a history of which I knew little, and to reimagine the world around me. Honestly one of the most engaging lectures I have been in at Yale!",
    "I learned that history is not a linear progression, and that sexuality is an ever evolving societal construct. In addition, I learned much more about the history of the gay rights movement and of early gay communities in the US.",
    "Learned about a whole new part of history in an incredibly engaging manner",
    "Omg I loved George Chauncey! I had no idea about so many issues in gay history, heck I had no idea practically about homosexuality being outlawed until 2003 (Lawrence v Texas in case you were interested)",
    "I obviously learned a great deal about the changing climate and thought around gay people and the construction of gay culture. An insight this course provided me with was how activism changes with different contexts, and how tactics of the past relate to tactics of other past groups and the activists of today.",
    "I learned so much from this courseas a history major, it gave me another insight into how history can be approached. As a queer person, it helped me consider my own history and how we came to the privileges we have today. As a human being, it left me with a degree of compassion that only a course on love can provide. It was a wonderful experience, as a class and as a period of reflection.",
    "I learned about the entire span of lesbian and gay history in the United States. Professor Chauncey also taught us that learning about history can be a tonic in a time where it feels like everything is moving backwards. \"History is not the story of linear progress. We face setbacks, but we live to fight another day.\"",
    "Everything I know about Gay and Lesbian history I learned in this course! Thank you prof. Chauncey!",
    "I learned a lot about a topic in history that I had not been previously exposed to at all. My knowledge of Lesbian and Gay history was greatly expanded, and the little history I thought I knew was turned on its head. Because I took this course in Freshman fall, and because of the sheer volume of reading, I also learned how to read effectively for key points.",
    "An interesting take on recent American history. Shows evolution of how people perceived and interacted with homosexuality.",
    "I learned a much more nuanced and complex version of American history before. This course decontextualized some conditions around me to which I took for granted. This was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "This class is as terrific and necessary and fascinating as everybody says it is. .",
    "I developed my understanding of U.S. LGBTQ history and developed my analytical skills.",
    "This course taught me about many people, events and stories that I didn't know before and broadened my understanding of America history. Most importantly, I gained a new way to view history. As I continue to study history, I now know how to analyze gender and sexuality in the context of history, and how those categories have changed over time.",
    "I gained a much deeper knowledge of the history of LGBT movements as well as the reactions and ideology of straight people. I found the emphasis on examining the development of terms and theories particularly fascinating, since so much has changed in the past twenty years. It's already been enormously helpful to have this background. I also enjoyed Professor Chauncey's working of history into our own lives -- this class made me feel I am living in and forming history.",
    "I learned how to analyze documents and synthesize them into a coherent argument.",
    "I developed insights into a new, often ignored side of American history, and a look into how gender and sexuality have changed and shaped all Americans' lives, not only the lives of LGBTQ folks. By taking this class, I learned that concepts of gender, sex, and sexuality have not remained the same throughout history, but instead have changed much over time and play a huge role in our lives. Although LGBTQ history may seem obscure, there's actually a lot of information about it, and it is an integral part of American history. Some skills I learned were how to discuss history, primary source documents, and terms relating to gender, sex, and sexuality.",
    "It was fascinating to learn about lesbian and gay life in periods of time in which I hadn't previously thought about there being a cohesive and well-known gay world. It was also really cool to do the oral history project, and learn about my family members' experience with and knowledge of gay people growing up.",
    "I learned so much from this course! I never knew so much about the ways that sexuality was categorized differently depending on the era, and I learned about so many important people I had never heard of. It was great to have such a wide historical context of how the gay rights movement came about.",
    "Learned how to judge people based on their actions, not who they are",
    "As I was studying for the final for this class, I realized just how much knowledge this class had empowered me with. Not only did I develop a much more sophisticated understanding of sexuality (especially in how its categorization has changed over time), but I also learned amazingly intricate specifics about a silenced history that matters to my personal present and future. Knowledge is power and this class made me powerful.",
    "The history of Lesbian and Gay History throughout the US history is very interesting. It makes me rethink about the current highly debated issue.",
    "This class provides an engaging overview of the history described in the title while teaching introductory level historical analysis skills.",
    "I learned so much about American history through a lens that no one usually thinks about.",
    "This course is one of those courses that I find myself constantly bringing up in conversations with people. It is amazing to realize there is a whole layer of LGBT and sexuality history on top of the traditional US history we learn, and this greatly deepened my understanding of our nation. It also deepened my understanding of myself and those around me! As far as skills I found the oral history paper very helpful as it was my first time using my own, self-found, primary sources and creating a thesis driven history paper from them.",
    "I learned a comprehensive queer history, and discovered how fluid sexuality was in the beginning of the 20th c. and how clandestine homosexuality was in the US for the majority of the 20th c.",
    "I learned about a history I would not have learned anywhere else.",
    "How to be an active and critical participant in a seemingly ignorant society, by understanding the history and triumphs of the marginalized lgbtq+ community.",
    "Taking this course really shaped the way I look at history, particularly the history of American gays and lesbians. I learned how to better track historical themes over time and how to construct narratives based on oral histories and primary documents. I learned so much about the US history I thought I knew, but from the perspective of the queer community, and it reshaped how I see a lot of the trends and eras in US history that I had learned about previously.",
    "I had absolutely no knowledge of gay and lesbian history in America and acquiring insight into this culture was incredibly interesting and valuable.",
    "A new way to look at history - literally.",
    "I learned so much! I basically new nothing about gay history, except from things that happened since I was born, and I learned all about gay and lesbian history since the Puritan age. Great class! I think we really learned a lot especially about gay bar culture in New York, especially with white men, and a bit less about other races\/genders although Chauncey definitely made an effort to include them.",
    "This is a pretty broad overview-type course, so while I still have so much to learn about details and more specific histories, I feel like I have a really great sense of the trajectory of queer history in America.",
    "suuuper interesting course",
    "A complete different and significant viewpoint of US history.",
    "This class did very well in teaching the history of lesbian and gay people in the United States. I feel like I came away knowing a lot more than I did before taking the course and it was interesting the entire way.",
    "I learned a lot about US Les\/Gay history (obviously), but also how to write historical papers, how to analyze primary and secondary sources, and how to track progress in social movements.",
    "AMST 135 covers a wide cross section of the rich history of homosexuality in America. Take this course if you're curious about the origin of the terms and identities we use today and want to have your assumptions about gender, sexuality and society challenged. Did you know that in the 19th century, same-sex \"romantic friendships\" were common and mainstream? Many of the lessons are about lesbian and gay life at Yale over the centuries. which is fascinating. Highly recommend!",
    "I learned a lot about US Gay and Lesbian history (hence the course title). I learned to speed read and put primary documents and first person accounts into a broader context of history and understand how the United States has progressed culturally, politically, and socially.",
    "I learned how to write a history paper"

   "comments": [
    "Oral history papers should consider some kind of revision, since it's \"bad history\" to develop an entire thesis about change within a community from two or three anecdotes. Maybe instead of making broad claims based on just a few stories from our families, we could write an essay explaining how they've influenced our own thinking. I felt like trying to make a big argument from just a few oral narratives was a stretch, and not entire accurate.",
    "Good course all around, not much to change it. I also didn't actually go to that many lectures so I'm not entirely sure.",
    "It's really big, but that's not going to go away. Make sure you get into a good section and it'll be really fun.",
    "I actually really liked that Chauncey doesn't post his slides, and that the class was taught in the YUAG, where there is no internet connection. It kept me very engaged. I LOVED lectures and the readings that I was able to do. The music at the beginning of class kept it fun, Chauncey signposts new topics very well, and I felt very comfortable in the class, despite its size. I was very impressed that Chauncey read our ethnographies and truly engages with students.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale Great mix of fun energy and fascinating, important topics",
    "Strengths- the lectures, so powerful and interesting, I never was upset to go to lecture Weaknesses- sometimes section didn't totally clarify the concepts we learned in lecture for me, we always had way too much reading to cover in section every week, too",
    "It's an excellent course. I think the readings can get dry and monotonous at times (and I hardly ever did them), but the history is still quite interesting, with phenomenal lectures and Teaching Fellows. I might suggest cutting down on the amount of reading, so that greater attention can be paid to each reading on its own (and so that the amount of reading does not become so overwhelming that it's hardly worth attempting).",
    "The course gets slightly repetitive in the second-half, with drawn-out discussions of the interactions between anti-gay groups and the gay response to these groups.",
    "Strength is engaging lectures.",
    "STRENGTHS: chauncey is great, I can't imagine the course without him. He's basically telling us his lived history, and you can't replicate that experience with any other prof who hasn't been in the middle of so many of the historical events discussed in the class. It was an interesting subject taught in a pretty engaging way that drew you into the history. WEAKNESSES: the room!! YUAG is honestly an awful lecture hall. It's hard to see your own notes, let alone write in desk-less seats. Please change the venue to LC or Davies or really anywhere else. Also, the syllabus is hard to read.",
    "so much reading assigned",
    "There was nothing I disliked about this course - I was apprehensive about section at first due to prior experiences with sections, but it ended up being just as engaging and informative as lecture was!",
    "So many strengths! The readings, mandatory film screenings, and lectures alike are amazing. No weaknesses come to mind.",
    "It's the best class I've taken at Yale. The material is so fascinating, the lectures are crisp and precise and engaging, and the professor\/TF's are so passionate about it.",
    "This is a fantastic course.",
    "The course was incredibly organized and cohesive with each lecture being slick and well put together.",
    "Chauncey is an unbelievable professor and my TF was fantastic. There is a lot of work but I wouldn't consider that a fault of this class. It's all incredibly interesting readings.",
    "This course it perfect. Literally.",
    "Lectures are extremely strong. I was not a huge fan of the papers, which I found very restricting in scope. I would've liked to have done a research portion as well.",
    "The course was amazing.",
    "Fabulous Ta. Engaging professor who saw us outside of class. Great lectures. Exhilarating",
    "I LOVE THIS COURSE. no complaints!",
    "Strengths - very well organized, runs like a well-oiled machine. Interesting lectures, great sections, awesome TAs who are knowledgable but also human - treat you like a person. Weaknesses - international perspective would also be interesting, but that could be a whole different course in itself",
    "Strengths: phenomenal lectures, wonderful professor, important subject matter Weaknesses: the papers were graded very differently based on how hard your TA was and what they were looking for, the weeks in which we were assigned a book to read were disproportionately time-consuming",
    "The lectures were extremely interesting and well presented, seminar was often conducted in a structured, clear manner. There was a fair amount of assessment in terms of a midterm, two papers, and a final.",
    "Chauncey is a genius. He is also kind and honest with his students ask anyone who was at the AIDs lecture. I never wanted to miss a lecture not only because the subject matter was so interesting, but because Chauncey is such a welcoming presence, even in a room with 500 students.",
    "Overall, it's an incredibly strong class. You can tell Professor Chauncey has been doing this for years and has perfected the lectures. Everything is clearly explained, captivating, and highly informative. I love the mix of fun and academics. As mentioned in my written course evaluation, I didn't love the lecture on the homophobe movements (it felt a little dry,) but understand their importance in early organizing. I think sometimes the lectures felt too scripted to me (I don't love when teachers read off specific scripts), but that's a few small picky thing on my part. I know Chauncey always gets this feedback, but inclusion of a more diverse look at experiences is appreciated. Overall, really wonderful -- I LOVED it!!",
    "STRENGTHS: Chauncey is remarkable, class material is really interesting, lectures are fun. WEAKNESSES: Section feels like quite the drag, and the readings fluctuate from really pithy and interesting to being really dry and overly long. I think some rethinking of the reading syllabus is needed. Some connections posed in the class felt dicey (i.e. this historical actor was absolutely formulating a queer theory by way of their music - doesn't feel all that compelling).",
    "This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. This course gave a comprehensive overview of a not-frequently-analyzed aspect of American history. It was well-organized, the readings and lectures were engaging, and I am so glad I decided to take this course.",
    "I think this course was strong in so many ways -- Chauncey's lectures have been refined over many years of teaching this class. The sections were pretty fun, and the discussion was always meaningful.",
    "The strengths are the lectures. They are fantastic. I looked forward to every single one. They are very organized, interesting, and easy to follow. The information is relevant and engaging. Professor Chauncey is a fantastic speaker and wonderful lecturer. I also thought section was meaningful - the material warrants good discussions and it's interesting to see how different people react to everything, and how their past experiences frame their perceptions of history. The only weakness would be the reading - although a good portion of the reading was interesting and important, there's just so so much of it, and I ended up not doing nearly as much of it as I should of. If the reading can be tailored and more focused, I think it would become more worthwhile. If I see that I only have to read 30 pages instead of 100, I'm more likely to actually do it, and actually spend time engaging with it.",
    "This course is glorious. Never missed a lecture, even that time when I was sick and had bronchitis. That's how good lectures were. THAT GOOD.",
    "The course material was positively enlightening, and the progression of the course was logical. Professor Chauncey is clearly an intensely compassionate and intellectual person. His treatment of the subject and his students was sensitive and profoundly thoughtful. I appreciated how he incorporated sources and narratives of queer people of color but wish there was more discussion about the intersection between race and sexuality. Perhaps that deserves a course of its own.",
    "Exceptionally well organized lectures that always presented arguments about things that I knew relatively little about. Section pushed me to engage with ideas on a more critical level. One of the best, and best put together, courses that I've taken in 7 semesters at Yale.",
    "Small note: lecture slide colors were hard to see, especially from the back of the room. Also, the ACTUP movie didn't feel necessary (it was kinda repetitive).",
    "Lectures were always amazing, and section was usually helpful for reviewing the reading. There were weeks with a very heavy reading load, however, which is understandable but sometimes meant I got less out of each text because I was speed-reading to try and reach every essay.",
    "The strength of this course is definitely the lecturing. The professor is very engaging and has clearly worked out all of the kinks, and his lectures are usually easy to understand and very interesting. A weakness is the differences in grading among the sections and expectations.",
    "This class has nothing to do with my major and it was probably the best class that I took at Yale. Chauncey does such a phenomenal job of organizing the material, incorporating audio and visual material to make it fun, and seeing the history from multiple perspectives. With Chauncey teaching it, this class is Yale at its best.",
    "This is an incredible class-- it was the perfect amount of work in that everything assigned (readings, film screenings) felt interesting and highly relevant. The lectures were engaging, information-packed, and often moving, and my section was extraordinarily helpful.",
    "Hard for STEM majors with no previous background in history in general.",
    "This course was fantastic in so many ways. The style of lecture was very organized and sequential; Prof. Chauncey is such a great speaker. I really loved the emphasis there was on learning and reading about queer people of color. It was so important to not blanket the LGBTQ experience for everyone; some people had a different and harder history than others. I also really enjoyed all the movie nights the class offered. Sometimes the readings could be a bit overwhelming, especially when we had to read whole novels, so I didn't get to complete them all. I preferred it when we were assigned many little texts instead of one big one; it made me feel more productive. I know the class is called \"Lesbian and Gay History\" but I wonder how much more we could learn by letting in other identities in like Bi\/Pansexuality, though we did mention it once or twice.",
    "I wish we could have read more articles from the conservative point of view. That Dobson article at the end of the course was really interesting. Other than that, I have no criticism of this class. Absolutely fantastic.",
    "This course offered a lot of support and I am so grateful for the paper advice and exam advice!",
    "The course is emotionally powerful and very informative. I feel like I now have intellectual and historical knowledge to back up philosophical and political arguments. I can now connect many modern American political fights, movements, and concepts together in a cohesive manner. The problem with this course is that it is very easy not to do the reading, which is a same because I wish that I did more of the reading.",
    "This course is overall extremely strong. Professor Chauncey is a fantastic lecturer- he speaks clearly, knows what he is going to say and has a plan for each day. Sometimes he would not go in exact chronological order, though. He would talk about the timeline of one group or event and then return to an earlier era to chronicle the timeline of something else. Sometimes it was hard to place things in context with each other. This could either be done in section or (as Chauncey sometimes does) by referencing other things when lecturing so it is easier to place things.",
    "This course really has no weaknesses. The lectures are definitely the best part and none are to be missed. The readings were interesting and not too lengthy, though admittedly as a STEM major with this as my 5th class I didn't keep up with them.",
    "Chauncey's lectures and a majority of the readings are fantastic. The main weak point is just that the class is so large. The expectation for how much reading is done\/quality of section discussion suffers as a result. Most sections you won't get much further than just summarizing the reading before it's over.",
    "Students obtain a deep understanding of the history sexuality, same-sex relations, the concept of a queer identity and community within the United States. I loved the fact that the rigorous historical examination is accompanied with forays into theory, anthropology, music, and film. Professor Chauncey is one of the most gifted, passionate, and personable professors I have encountered at Yale, and along with superb TFs, the quality of instruction elevated this course to a new level of academic excellence. I will say that the material gets slightly repetitive towards the very end as we talk every lecture about the Christian Right, gay bar culture, and queer activist groups, but generally the information was incredibly illuminating. Additionally, the exams were relatively straightforward but did not effectively examine the extent to which students absorbed the wide range of information presented in the first and second halves of the course; an exam with far more IDs and a much more targeted set of essay questions would be (in my opinion) a more rigorous examination of student knowledge.",
    "It is clear that Chauncey has gotten his lectures down perfect.",
    "All strengths. It was very clear that an incredible amount of thought has gone into curating and improving this course over the years.",
    "The lectures are great! They do a great job of synthesizing many years of gay history. However, the readings for section can get overwhelming at times.",
    "I found the readings to be super interesting but often wished the amount of reading in a week wasn't so extensive so I could appreciate each reading more. The lecture was fabulous and super engaging and I loved that the class incorporated Yale history as well as our own personal histories, starting with ethnographers and ending with the oral history assignment.",
    "This is an amazing class that teaches a new type of history in an important way! The lectures are engaging and fun; I look forward to class each week! The only improvement I would say is for Professor Chauncey to include more information on un and underrepresented communities (i.e. talk about black communities more than twice, and spend more time on Native, Latino, and Asian American communities).",
    "Amazing lecturers and TF's, although I think a lot of the course's issues come from the fact that there has not been that much historical research on this topic compared to other areas of history. While this provides an interesting place to contribute to the topical study through papers like the oral histories, its themes and ideas can feel repetitive at times.",
    "I think sections could use a little more uniform organization, I got the idea that sections are doing quite different things between themselves, which is not inherently bad but could be confusing for the final study groups.",
    "the lectures were incredible! I wish chauncey made them available online, but I understand why he doesn't. I loved everything about the course - can't think of any weaknesses!",
    "Prof. Chauncey is an incredible lecturer and I loved going to class and to section. That said, I think I had the most trouble taking notes in this class -- I wanted to write down everything Prof. Chauncey said because even the details were fascinating and so eloquently put, but I often didn't really have a measure of whether I was recording the most important information or not. I liked having the outlines as signposts at the beginning of each lecture, but I think I might appreciate even a little bit more.",
    "Lectures were very strong, and my sections were pretty good, too. I think section was a little too laid back, because I was able to get into a groove of doing very little reading and still doing quite well in section -- that could also be because I'm somewhat used to history lectures\/sections by now.",
    "I LOVED this class! There could have been more writing from people of color, though I know this is something that Prof. Chauncey is always working towards and I really appreciated how he always acknowledged when he was leaving out certain stories\/viewpoints. Starting each lecture with music that complements the material is genius and I think all history faculty should do that. No real critiques.",
    "The history of gays and lesbians is incredibly rich and fascinating. Reading things such as Radclyffe Hall, Francis Willard, James Baldwin, Audre Lorde, Donald Vining, Martin Duberman, and Larry Kramer changed my lifeand helped me see how my identity as a queer individual is based off of the struggles and fights of queers of the past. What I most appreciated was Chauncey doing his best to weave in the perspective of queers of color and queerness at the margins of each era of history. It gave me the strength and self-understanding to hope and act for a better future, because as Chauncey puts it, History is never inevitable. What can I say about George Chauncey, that hasnt already been said, except for the fact that he lies up to the mythological hype? His lectures are impeccably organized and engaging, each one starting an ending with music from an era of queer history. In person, he is incredibly nice and thoughtful. I especially enjoyed how the ethnography assignment allowed him to have a piece of us, allowing the course to seem more friendly and accessible despite the huge lecture. Lastly, the fact that our assignments were actually useable as part of his research gave the whole course the feeling that what we were doing actually mattered in the grand scheme of things. Section is also essential to the learning and community that takes in this class. By the end of the semester, I felt like I had gotten to know other people in a safe space that supplemented what we learned in lecture. The TAs are largely great, and the faults that they do have are mediated by Chaunceys commitment to helping them grow as teachers.",
    "This course is very well organized and teaches an enormous amount of information. The lectures are dynamic and interesting while simultaneously presenting information that is easy to process and record. This course balances looking at incidents, people, and movements for their individual significance as well as for their connections and broader meanings. The readings are also interesting and relevant, but the amount was challenging and slightly unrealistic.",
    "The lectures were fantastic and obviously polished definitely the highlight of this course. While my TF Kelly was wonderful, I think section could have benefitted from more structured conversation at times, although it was still very enjoyable.",
    "Chauncey is a fantastic teacher and probably one of the most engaging and interesting professors I've ever learned from at Yale thus far. He came extremely prepared to class and I never felt bored or lost. He did a particularly good job of explaining bits of history in context of what else was happening at the time in the United States. In other words, he explained the sets of circumstances that allowed for events and phenomena to happen. The class itself was very large and so there were many TFs. From what I can tell, some students complained that different TFs covered different material and had varying levels of engagement, although I really did like my TF Devin.",
    "Should be taught more chronologically.",
    "Professor Chauncey's lectures were engaging and well put-together. I became somewhat bored towards the middle and end of the course when we spent a lot of time on social and cultural changes from the 1950s-1960s, so I wish he'd spent less time on that, but I suppose it was all important to talk about. I felt that the midterm was quite rushed - there was not much time at all to write the essay, and I feel like my essay suffered as a result. The final exam, on the other hand, was a lot easier to manage in that respect. I appreciated Prof. Chauncey's attempts to put gay and lesbian history in the context of Yale's own history, though I felt that he may have actually done this too often. Overall, the course was a solid and engaging introduction to an underrepresented topic in the field of social history, though I did not always find it to be particularly interesting, which may just be due to my own preferences. The lectures on AIDS, Stonewall and the Christian Right were my favorites, perhaps because it felt like they covered more \"explosive\" issues.",
    "The lecture is interesting and Professor Chauncey does well to present the information in a way that it can entertain everyone - even if that person is directly queer.",
    "Strengths: well-organized; clear and insightful lectures; Chauncey is an amazing professor, second to none really; the readings wee usually engaging Weaknesses: sometimes the readings weren't necessary; the exams were not great representations of what I learned in the class (the quotations, especially, were unnecessary I read for every class and I still messed up!)",
    "It is perfect.",
    "The strengths of this class are how interesting the material is and how great a professor Chauncey is. Overall, the course was excellent and very interesting and engaging. I would say my only critique is that we were always assigned a kind of unreasonable amount of reading that no one ever finished every week.",
    "The lectures are really interesting and well thought out. The readings are also well chosen and were very helpful in reinforcing class concepts.",
    "There are a lot of moving parts that go with this course: lectures, section, readings of primary and secondary material, movie screenings, papers and an oral history. Keeping track of all of these, and integrating them into a cohesive framework was something I found difficult, because section was not equipped to cover every reading\/screening, and lectures were largely divorced from the readings. Of all the pieces I found lectures the most engaging and most helpful in learning\/understanding material.",
    "Professor Chaunceys preparation for each class shone through. He also chose incredibly interesting readings for us to complete, even some that introduced me to gay and lesbian life at Yale in the past. However, I felt that the material presented did not give the most holistic look at LGBTQ history that it could. I absolutely understand the necessity for gay and lesbian historiography to take centerstage, but at times, it wouldve helped me to see some of the other side of history as well - as in, those opposed to gay rights. We didnt read an anti-gay piece until basically the last week of the course, which left out an entire half of the conversation for virtually the whole semester.",
    "Strengths: lectures are fantastic! Many of the readings were inspiring and very interesting as well. Prof. Chauncey is obviously a huge strength of the course - his dedication to students, his passion, his ability to make this history mean something to each one of us on a personal level. Weaknesses: my section discussion was pretty weak. I know that this varies considerably from section to section, but I did not get much out of section.",
    "The strengths of this course are the lectures, the readings, and the assignments. Chauncey's lectures were engaging, clear, and eye opening. In fact, it's not hyperbole to say they were life changing. The lessons I learned about gender, sexuality, and the way culture influences the other two dramatically changed how I think about these areas of humanity in my own life.",
    "Lecture slides could be improved. Not orderly enough",
    "All strengths. Teaching, assignments, professor was amazing. I wouldn't change anything.",
    "The corse could focus more on histories that do not center white men, but it is understandably limited by the research available.",
    "I think everything about the course was amazing",
    "The lectures are great but in an effort to encourage people to attend, Professor Chauncey does not put any of the lecture slides online. I think that it would be really helpful for him to do so, especially given that they are not particularly helpful without attending anyway because most of what he says is not in the slides.",
    "Chauncey is the strength of this course. His lectures and insights are very interesting, and his PowerPoint presentations were always engaging. I think that some of the readings were too similar, however, and could have been narrowed down.",
    "This course could have further helped its students with how to write a history essay and provided better counter narratives to the class narrative.",
    "There is too much reading that I believe it will be more efficient if we focus more on 1 or 2 key text each week.",
    "Sometimes there was too much reading to properly read and comprehend everything. I think if there had been fewer readings, I could have engaged with each one a lot more. That being said, all of the readings were very good.",
    "Professor Chauncey is amazing, he made a wonderful job!",
    "Lectures are incredibly engaging, readings are sometimes slightly long (and some of the secondary literature is a little superfluous) but are generally interesting, and section was an excellent complement. The assignments were reasonable (not an excessive amount of work) and the exams very fair. Chauncey really has it down- I'm not sure there is really that much to be improved.",
    "INCREDIBLE COURSE overall. Chauncey is brilliant and super engaging. I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to learn from him.",
    "yo this class was dope i really dont know if it can be improved",
    "The lectures were the highlight of the course by far. Chauncey was such an incredible instructor and kept me engaged the entire time. I also really enjoyed the sections because they forced me to stay on top of the readings and discuss the material, allowing me to hear a variety of perspectives and deepen my understanding. I honestly cannot pinpoint any clear weaknesses.",
    "This course is well-honedit's presented in a format that's meant to maximize student learning. The material is interesting and Chauncey has a strong ability to lecture in an understandable format.",
    "Chauncey is a fantastic lecturer and the readings are for the most part very interesting.",
    "The scope of this course was utterly ridiculous. If I'm to be honest, it was rather insulting. Chauncey propagates a very particular vision of what he deems \"true\" gay history. If you're not involved with theater or sing a capella then don't take the class. He's militantly anti-\"straight acting.\" He essentially labels us closet cases.",
    "Very few weaknesses, many strengths. Fascinating material, masterful instruction, true dedication to the subject.",
    "The course did an amazing job of giving a comprehensive overview of a good number of years of US Lesbian and Gay History. It really reframed the way I viewed history in America, and history as a whole. Professor Chauncey and the lovely TFs were some of the strongest parts of the course-- they were all really passionate, engaging, and encouraging.",
    "The course does a very good job of being accessable without undermining the integrity of the information at hand. This allows for a broad range of topics to be explored without losing out on the important details. The issue with this course is through a lack of opposing opposing viewpoints which were largely popular for most of American history. While their reiteration may be deemed unnecessarily, I would think it'd be crucial to have the sources side by side, and not just at the end of the course.",
    "strengths are that chauncey is a great lecturer and is very objective weakness is that the material is often repetitive",
    "There were many strengths to this course: Professor Chauncey is an extremely engaging, passionate professor who cares deeply about his students and about the subject of his lecture. The use of songs played at the beginning of class was creative, and something that I enjoyed immensely. I also appreciated the Yale-centered context that Professor Chauncey used at times, which helped ground my understanding of history. I would suggest the inclusion of more material and lectures about the trans* community and their struggles, as well as more material on the perspectives of gay people of color. Personally, I would have loved to learn more about intersectionality in this light.",
    "This course is amazing. I genuinely can't think of a way it could be improved. I adore it.",
    "All strength, no weakness! Super well-organized, fascinating, important, huge variety of sources, opportunities for pursuing personal interests.",
    "This course was extremely fascinating and well-taught. George Chauncey is an absolutely wonderful lecturer and such an engaging personality--there is never a boring moment in the class. Overall, the course could use some improvement on the grading side--perhaps more standardization across TA sections and more accountability for the grades that are assigned on exams and papers.",
    "This course is fabulous and really fascinating, but has a ton of reading, it's not really feasible to finish all of it.",
    "US les gay is a wonderful introductory history course with an engaging lecturer on important material. There can be quite a few assignments and some lectures get a bit repetitive in the middle.",
    "I think the course is strong in almost every way, but I think it could focus more on the legal moves taken in US Lesbian and Gay history. I would love to know the history behind major cases like Lawrence v. Texas.",
    "Sometimes the material gets a little bit repetitive when it comes to the reading, however, a lot of the times the readings are very engaging and interesting. Section is a good experience to contextualise the course while the essays are a smart nexus between the lecture material and the readings which is why I had a good time writing it, discovering even more about the history as the essay unraveled itself.",
    "It was well organized and full of interesting material, but I felt it went too quickly over certain parts in history rather than focusing on them as important pivotal points.",
    "I wish there was less reading or more discussion about the reading. As it was, I didn't feel very high motivation to do them since some readings weren't even covered in section.",
    "Strengths: Amazing professor Weaknesses: none",
    "The lectures were excellent and well-paced. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "The lectures are very engaging and often feel like they relate very close to home with their touches on Yale culture and the professor's personal experience. It would be nice if the lectures could be uploaded online.",
    "Strengths: immense amount of information, niche approach to the topic that is idiosyncratic to yale in a way that feels cutting edge rather than underdeveloped as a strand of historical analysis. My TA was AMAZING. Section really sealed the deal for me in terms of engagement with the material and desire to go above and beyond the material in the lecture itself. Weaknesses: not as much engagement as I would have liked with queer theory and the modern conceptualization of homosexuality and contemporary scientific theories (I know that's a high bar to set, and I only say it because I really really liked the course)",
    "Fabulous lecture!!!! I honestly can't think about how it could be improved",
    "I think one of the strengths of this course is that it provides a wide survey of issues and moments relevant to U.S. Lesbian and Gay History. The lectures are amazingly engaging and draw you into the subject matter effortlessly. There are not many weaknesses of the course, except for the fact that there wasn't enough time to explore many of the interesting things discussed in class.",
    "The lectures were at times hard to keep up with in terms of note-taking, as Professor Chauncey spoke as if reading a speech and there were few pauses. In addition, the slides were at times hard to follow. Other than that, however, I thought the course was incredible.",
    "This course was awesome. I loved the lectures. I wish there were more primary sources readings.",
    "Strengths - Chauncey is a wonderful lecturer, bringing music and photos and movie clips into his teaching. TFs were widely liked. Assignments were explained in detail. Weaknesses- heavy on reading, especially the first half of the term. The first essay option was also not advertised beforehand and the due date came one week after a separate writing assignment had been due. It's an interesting essay and should get more attention because it deserves to be written on by more students!",
    "All strengths, personable, engaging, informative, relevant",
    "I think Professor Chauncey did an amazing job of engaging a group of student in an are of history that remained yet unexplored for most of his students. I loved how he incorporated video, art, writing, etc to illustrate his points about lesbian and gay history.",
    "George Chauncey!",
    "I believe this course needs to be updated in its assignments to reflect the different kinds of students that take the class. It seemed to operate on the general assumption that we were either LGBT and wanted to know about our predecessors, or not LGBT but willing to learn about the history. It did not seem to take into account that some people might know a large amount of older people from the LGBT community. I think this was reflected somewhat in the ethnography assignment, but especially in the oral history assignment. It just seems exclusionary to say that you have to interview straight people on what they thought of gay people--why couldn't we interview gay people on their struggles or awareness of their identity and how it tied into the larger cultural climate? As a person with several gay family members, I actively avoided the oral history assignment because it made no sense to anyone in family I would have interviewed. I enjoyed the movies and appreciated that they were available elsewhere in case we couldn't make it to the screenings, but if the professor wanted us to join the screenings, I think better scheduling would be in order. I also think the readings that were pertinent to the paper assignments were on the reading list at a time too close to the due date for the respective paper--not granting enough time to mull the information over. As for the strengths of the course, I think the lectures followed a very straightforward trajectory, and illuminated a great deal of LGBT history that is intertwined with but often overshadowed by other aspects of American history.",
    "The course is organized very well: sections are engaging (although a lack of a participation grade means that only two or three people really talk at any one time), lectures are a m a z i n g, and it works as a history course, a civil rights course, and a *look around you this is how a significant portion of the population has lived* course. The assignments are both pedagogically helpful and reflectivea really great way of making the material engaging and relevant to our lives.",
    "What we did in sections\/with the readings was pretty separate from the lectures. I thought that if we reflected on the lectures a little more I would have gotten a little bit more out of them.",
    "This course was very strong overall. It might have been nice to have more, and shorter, writing assignments throughout the course; the entire grade was based on just two papers, a midterm, and a final. I also wish the readings had been more concise. It was not really feasible to do all of the readings every week, which is too bad, because they were really interesting.",
    "Wonderful, wonderful lectures. Professor Chauncey was amazing and fantastic to listen to. There were also sections, which were fine but not the highlight of the course.",
    "Top 3 best classes at Yale. Chauncey is the best lecturer I've ever had.",
    "Paper comments could be more detailed!",
    "Strengths: engaging lectures and interesting section discussions. Weaknesses: can't think of any.",
    "The only weakness is that some of the readings were dull and repeated information from lectures. I would have preferred to read more fiction or theoretical pieces written by historical figures, rather than accounts written by present-day historians.",
    "Professor Chauncey is the best Yale professor I've encountered so far. He's extremely knowledgeable and has lived through and witnessed the history he talks about. Professor Chauncey makes the course interesting, and everyone is bound to learn a lot. This class is extremely relevant to today, so everyone can see how queer history impacts their lives today.",
    "The lectures were always engaging, and the readings were interesting and informative. The section discussions were usually engaging, although during some weeks when people hadn't done the readings, discussion was a bit lacking. The structured activities (such as impersonating different people) that we had were helpful during those times.",
    "This is a great course-- I can't say much to improve, except that often too much reading was assigned. I would have loved to have done all the reading because I found it all very interesting, but the amount was just not feasible sometimes.",
    "The lectures are spectacular. The readings are a bit long but almost always worthwhile.",
    "some lecture notes can be given to students to help them review.",
    "The course content is presented with care and energy, expectations are clear, and sections effectively accompany course content. Minor improvements might include a later due date for the first paper assignment and the online posting of first slide lecture outlines.",
    "A major strength of this course is that the lectures are so much fun. I had to miss one because I was sick and I was so sad about it. A weakness is that there's a lot of reading, some of which feels superfluous. The books Sexual Politics and Out for Good were both very long and I'm not sure if they were necessary -- the same thing could have been learned just through shorter articles or lecture material. I found both pretty unengaging and did not retain that much information from them.",
    "I don't think there are any weaknesses. This course is wonderful! Suggestions could be to include some more creative historical writings in the readings a well. Such as poetry and fiction.",
    "The lectures are fantastic! Chauncey is a gifted and emotional speaker. I maybe would have liked to have seen more supreme court cases or government documents in the readings.",
    "This course had very interesting lectures, material, and readings to engage with.",
    "This course was my favorite course this semester. Chauncey and the teaching fellows managed to make a class size this large feel intimate and engaging.",
    "I don't think this course could be improved at all, it really is amazing. I loved Professor Chauncey's lectures and was motivated to do all of the readings because we had such great discussions in our section.",
    "Strength=lecture! The lectures were really fantastic. The readings were also interesting. Just a really solid, interesting, engaging class overall. Can't really think of a weakness.",
    "Took the 10th iteration of this course before Chauncey left, life changing course! A great intro to queer and WGSS theory.",
    "great topic\/subject matter",
    "The strength of the course is that it is taught by Chauncey. He is a fantastic professor who made the class very engaging. The material overall was very interesting too but some things could be cut out and it could focus more on recent events.",
    "The course is great! I really like the way current events were integrated into lectures.",
    "Very strong lectures, could benefit from fewer readings with more discussion of each reading",
    "The strengths are that Chauncey is very engaging and knowledgeable; more importantly, he makes everything relevant and relatable. The downside is that missing a single lecture costs you a lot of information and unless you make friends in the class or have some way of figuring out what went on, that information (vital as it is) is lost to you.",
    "Strengths: definitely enlightens upon issues and history that have been overlooked",
    "The lectures were extremely interactive and engaging"

   "comments": [
    "Take it because it's a classic and you learn so much. Don't expect to have a revelatory experience, though--the class is impersonal (a huge lecture) and has all of the caveats of a big history class (like variability in TAs, classic id\/essay midterm and final, the same types of essays). But its interesting, and makes you consider your own sexuality a little differently.",
    "Great easy class. Super empowering and great for anyone with any interest in LGBT issues (whether you identify as LGBT - yet - or not). I would recommend doing the readings because people seemed to get a lot out of them, but you can also get an A without having done really any of the readings.",
    "Yes. Take it.",
    "a great class. lectures were great!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. I promise you, I didn't think I was going to at the beginning of the semester, tried one lecture during reading period, and never looked back. All of the hype is worth it - this class is amazing.",
    "I think every student at Yale should take this course. The history is still very relevant to the world today, and Professor Chauncey is one of the best lecturers I have ever been lucky enough to hear speak.",
    "Absolutely take this course. My eyes have been opened. I left every class and section feeling more educated and inspired.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class. incredibly interesting and exciting, it really makes you question your implicit beliefs and the way you were grown up and stretches your compassion to new levels.",
    "A phenomenal class by all accounts. I had never taken a history course at Yale (I'm a junior), and I thought that this class was accessible, educational, and, at its best moments, inspirational. Understanding this history gave context to many of the political issues I care deeply about today.",
    "Yes! Unfortunately, it won't be offered for several years, but it's an excellent course with a legendary professor and phenomenal lectures. I can't recommend it highly enough.",
    "100% -- it's a must-take. If not for the material, take it for Chauncey. The class honestly changed the way I look at the world, and understand gender and sexuality in the modern world.",
    "Definitely worth taking! Classic Yale course covering a topic that many don't know much about even if they think they do. Chauncey is an incredible lecturer, obviously cares so much about his students and the course material.",
    "YES. THIS COURSE WAS AMAZING",
    "Chauncey is irreplaceable, try to take it with him. It's a surprising amount of work; the ideal kind of class to take credit\/D 'cuz you'll learn of the material and can pick and choose the interesting readings to actually do. Overall, it's a 9\/10 recommend (don't take if you just want a gut and don't give a shit about the topic, OR you hate the YUAG as much as I do)",
    "highly recommend if you are gay- you will love the class if you are straight, only take the class if you love history",
    "Very highly recommended - Professor Chauncey is an amazing lecturer whose enthusiasm about the content far surpasses even the extremely interesting content itself. My TF was also great as well - he was inventive about the activities we did in section and pushed us to think deeper about the information presented in lecture.",
    "Absolutely take it! This class is incredibly well-taught, and I promise it will be relevant and applicable to your lived experience, regardless of where you grew up or what you are studying at Yale.",
    "Absolutely! Please take this course--it's obviously really well-done and engaging, but also about material that's so enlightening.",
    "LesGay is a must for anyone looking for an intro-level history course but also wanting to understand US History more in depth.",
    "YES!!! Please take this course if it is still being offered and taught by Chauncey. Arguably, the best course I have taken at Yale. Chauncey is incredibly brilliant, caring, and such an incredible educator. Wow, what an incredible course. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",
    "Absolutely. Favorite class yet!",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wonders how social change in our society comes about, how our present understanding of the world is shaped by the sweat and struggles of the past, and who wants to think deeply about the roles of gender and sexuality.",
    "Yes take this class. It's a quintessential Yale course and you will learn so much that you cannot learn any other place in the world.",
    "YES. This course is a must-take. The course-load was sometimes very overwhelming when it came to reading, but it is worth it because it will help you understand the history so much more. Really eye-opening, and such an important topic.",
    "This course is absolutely amazing. It gave me insights to things I had never before thought about and deeper insights to things that I did.",
    "Absolutely!!",
    "A must-take, everyone knows it and says it. I didn't believe it at first myself, but not only will it be the best part of your semester, it's also really fundamental knowledge particularly for anyone interested in working in activism, politics, or social policy in the U.S. Chauncey is one of the true stars of the Yale faculty, and this class holds nothing but positive experiences all-around. Take it!!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. George Chauncey is a perfect human and truly cares about each and every student.The class is fun and light-hearted, the material is interesting, and the TFs are all wonderful.",
    "Yes, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Chauncey does an amazing job of putting the course on, with interesting lectures that keep you hooked. There is some work though, compared to other larger popular classes like this. The papers are fun to write, and the midterm\/final are comprehensive, but I felt like I learned a lot at the end so it was all worth it.",
    "A must-take at Yale.",
    "Absolutely, if you are at all vaguely interested in the subject, please do take this course.",
    "Absolutely. I had high expectations and it far exceeded them. It was a pleasure to attend twice a week.",
    "YES YES YES YES YES",
    "Yes yes yes!!! One of those classic college classes you must take! So interesting and insightful and Chauncey is the leader scholar in this field -- don't miss the opportunity to take this class! It also adds important reflection in understanding unintended consequences on sexual regulation etc.",
    "Absolutely recommend! Really interesting subject material, about which the average student is likely to know next-to-nothing about. Helps give perspective on LGBTQ issues and struggles. Fun lectures and Chauncey is a gem. However, beware that the way your grade is constructed can sometimes feel arbitrary. For example, there are 2 papers, each worth 20% of the grade, that are graded entirely by your TA - this could get really dicey if your TA's standards feel like a moving target. To that end, even if you're coming from a STEM background (like I was), take the class for the lectures and insights but tread lightly with respect to grading.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The material is interesting, lectures are engaging, readings are informative. It's an all-around fantastic course, and it explores a facet of American history that is rarely explored.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! Don't miss your chance to take this. This is (unfortunately) one of those \"only at Yale\" classes.",
    "Absolutely! You'll hear from everyone who takes it that it's one of their favorite classes, and I wouldn't disagree. This is material that you literally won't be exposed to anywhere else, and Professor Chauncey is the leading scholar. It's a class that is unique, and definitely a class you'll remember taking forever. It makes you think about the way you've been taught about history, and all the other stories that are missing. 100% take it! The work is manageable - it's easy to do well in the class without doing the reading. Take it!!",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! This is my senior year, and I had heard what people said about the course (namely that I had to take it before I graduated), so I figured why not. The hype is not unwarranted. Professor Chauncey is so knowledgable (he's testified in many court cases\/writes great books\/is casually referenced in my readings for other classes that are about literature or gender, etc., because he's just that awesome and everyone knows it.) The lectures are phenomenal, I never missed one (even that time I had bronchitis) because I didn't want to miss anything. I have cried and laughed more in this class than any other at my time at Yale. As an English major, seminars are usually where I feel the most comfortable, but this lecture was one of the best parts of my entire Yale experience. Again... TAKE THIS COURSE!",
    "Great course, but take it early in your Yale career to get the most out of it, if possible. It's a fun class and quite interesting, but as a senior, there are so many more intellectually stimulating courses that are available to you. This is a good introduction to history courses, and it's fairly easy to do well if you just show up and do the readings (the problem is that it's so easy to do neither of those things, so people tend to struggle). Chauncey is wonderful, and the TAs seem to be really great as well. It's a good fifth class, and I know a ton of people who took it Credit\/D\/F and were able to just sit back and enjoy it.",
    "No matter where you identify on the sexual spectrum, this course will open your eyes to a world of insight and moving history that you have probably never engaged with before. If you do not consider yourself straight, this class will change your life and self-understanding. If you are straight, please take this opportunity to learn with Chauncey about the communities around you.",
    "In a heartbeat. One of the best courses, and certainly best history course I've taken at Yale. About a topic that is exceedingly relevant, Professor Chauncey lays out excellent arguments, content of the course challenges popular narratives around many of these ideas. Everyone should take it.",
    "Yes! Chauncey is a great lecturer and a wonderful man, and the material, given that it is what it is, is all very fresh and interesting.",
    "I think that this class should be a must-take, as it really changed how I and my classmates see the world.",
    "I absolutely would. It is a wonderfully taught course on a subject that is hard to access without a professor like Chauncey or a class like this.",
    "This is a great humanities credit. The material is very interesting and there is not too much work-- just two 5 page papers, a midterm, and a final. The midterm and final are both very reasonable, and the papers are interesting. The grading will vary based on your TA. Might be easy, might not. Chauncey is a great professor and lecture will go by pretty fast.",
    "YES! This is a must take at Yale. Chauncey is one of Yale's greatest treasures and this class lived up to and exceeded the hype. He made a huge lecture feel very intimate and I always wanted to come to lecture and I loved learning the material.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student at Yale. I feel like the information I learned was incredibly relevant to my own experience and the experiences of those I'm close to, and I learned about a part of American history that I was pretty much completely ignorant of before.",
    "Would highly recommend - regardless of my grade this was a solid class.",
    "YES YES YES take this class if you can!!! This was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale; it offers so much of a history that's often so ignored today. This is a meaningful and amazing class for everyone, regardless of your sexuality and gender identity. Professor Chauncey is an amazing teacher and speaker, and the workload is manageable. Readings are so interesting and the assignments like some of the papers are really engaging and eye-opening.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. If this course is ever offered again, definitely take it. I was a little hesitant at first, because it seemed like a subject that had little to do with me personally, but that turned out to be really silly. This is a course for absolutely everyone, and quite possibly one of the most powerful and well-taught history courses at Yale. To quote Professor Chauncey: \"80% of the people in this class are majoring in something other than HIST, WGSS, and American History. (Not even counting the freshmen, some of whom may be undeclared.) And dont worry if youre not gay. More than half of the students in this class aren't. (Still not counting the freshmen, some of whom may still be undeclared.)\"",
    "Yes, definitely take Les Gay with Professor Chauncey! DO IT!",
    "It's fun, and you learn so much. It is not difficult, but it is not a \"walk-in-the-park\" easy gut course. Honestly, the lectures are amazing that you're disappointed if you miss one for a conflict. This is definitely one of this \"must-take\" Yale classes, which is why people go here.",
    "Yes, absolutely. This is one of the \"must take\" courses at Yale.",
    "Absolutely. If for nothing else, Cr\/D\/F this class and attend all the lecturesthey are fantastic.",
    "This is a course that everyone at Yale should take, and this is history that everyone should know. Not only were lecture and the readings incredibly interesting, but it's on a topic that is not well known despite its relevance to society.",
    "It's a decent course but definitely a little overhyped.",
    "Everyone raves about this class, but I need to reiterate that it is truly one of Yales gems. I loved the fact that the rigorous historical examination is accompanied by forays into theory, anthropology, music, and film. Professor Chauncey is one of the most gifted, passionate, and personable professors I have encountered at Yale, and along with superb TFs, the quality of instruction elevated this course to a new level of excellence. In taking this class, you are participating in a budding Yale traditiona de facto requirement of sorts for curious and open-minded studentsand regardless of your sexual, academic, or political background, you will not be disappointed. Take it, do the readings, and engage with the students and TFs, and it will be one of your best classes at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend. Every lecture is perfect. It is entertaining and interesting. The readings are great. 10\/10",
    "You simply must take this course.",
    "Absolutely! I would recommend the course to anybody. I learned so much more than I thought I would, about so much more than just U.S. lesbian and gay history.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the material is something that everyone should be exposed to. But this is not a particularly easy course, so do not come in with that mindset!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is legendary, engaging, and completely challenges everything you once thought to be true about LGBTQ history or American history in general. The readings are phenomenal and the essays are actually super interesting and introspective to write. This is definitely one of those courses that you come away from knowing not only more about the world but also yourself.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I think it really enriched my understanding of a part of American history that is often overlooked.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! A MUST TAKE CLASS at Yale! I waited until senior year and felt very lucky I was able to make it work this year. Professor Chauncey is an incredibly engaging and interesting lecturer, the material is so important, accessible and relatable, and class was a joy, something I looked forward to every week. You seriously can't graduate without taking this class.",
    "yes, it'a a very interesting topic.",
    "Take this course, be you a major or not. It is important history that deserves to be taught and learnt.",
    "TAKE IT! It's such a brilliant course. It is rare that you can take a class with a professor who is contributing so much to the field, and one who cares so genuinely about his students at that! I promise no matter who you are - gay, straight, trans, queer, PoC, whatever - you will learn something about yourself, your history, and what kind of citizen you want to be from this course.",
    "It's a great loss to Yale that Chauncey is taking a break to write his next book. Hopefully he'll return soon to enlighten the great masses of students that flock to his class. For those students, this is a great class with more information about queer history than you thought could possibly exist. Lecture is more important than readings, except when it comes to the papers. Overall, though, not too much work, but you get to take a class with a legend and learn a lot about something that's not really taught in high school.",
    "Must-take course at Yale! Definitely worthwhile.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Chauncey is truly incredible, and the material is eye-opening and incredibly important to know.",
    "This has been said over and over again, but definitely take this class. It has its issues, of course -- some groups could be better represented (though Prof. Chauncey makes a serious effort to include POC and trans narratives and some of the representation issues are due to a lack of historical resources) -- but I think unless you already have wide-ranging knowledge of changing perceptions of (homo\/hetero)sexuality in America from the Puritans to today, you'll still learn a lot from the class. The lectures are amazing and fascinating and the readings are absorbing. I was really sorry when the course ended that there would be no more.",
    "I would without question recommend this class to other students -- especially other history majors. Chauncey's fantastic, lectures are electrifying, and sections are enjoyable, too (which can be saying a lot, considering some history sections). I'm not generally interested in social history, but this class offers much more than a social history of LGBT people in the United States, including a good amount on policy and electoral politics, which I'm more interested in. I think there's really something for everyone in this course, and I'm sincerely happy that I was talked into taking it this year.",
    "I would highly, highly recommend this course. I found it inspiring and I often found myself thinking about the contents of lecture for the rest of the day after leaving class. It's incredibly relevant, important material, and it will change the way you approach your other coursework for the better.",
    "The history of gays and lesbians is incredibly rich and fascinating. Reading things such as Radclyffe Hall, Francis Willard, James Baldwin, Audre Lorde, Donald Vining, Martin Duberman, and Larry Kramer changed my lifeand helped me see how my identity as a queer individual is based off of the struggles and fights of queers of the past. What I most appreciated was Chauncey doing his best to weave in the perspective of queers of color and queerness at the margins of each era of history. It gave me the strength and self-understanding to hope and act for a better future, because as Chauncey puts it, History is never inevitable. What can I say about George Chauncey, that hasnt already been said, except for the fact that he lies up to the mythological hype? His lectures are impeccably organized and engaging, each one starting an ending with music from an era of queer history. In person, he is incredibly nice and thoughtful. I especially enjoyed how the ethnography assignment allowed him to have a piece of us, allowing the course to seem more friendly and accessible despite the huge lecture. Lastly, the fact that our assignments were actually useable as part of his research gave the whole course the feeling that what we were doing actually mattered in the grand scheme of things. Section is also essential to the learning and community that takes in this class. By the end of the semester, I felt like I had gotten to know other people in a safe space that supplemented what we learned in lecture. The TAs are largely great, and the faults that they do have are mediated by Chaunceys commitment to helping them grow as teachers.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another Yale student for a number of reasons. The material is highly interesting, important, and often overlooked. Professor Chauncy is an incredibly lecturer and scholar and is deeply passionate about his teaching and work. This class was an incredibly informative, humbling, and powerful experience.",
    "Absolutely. It is such important information.",
    "LesGay is known as one of the must-take classes at Yale and one of the hallmarks of the history department a title it completely deserves. Professor Chauncey is an extraordinary lecturer and the subject matter is a history that everyone should know although few of us do. I would definitely recommend no matter what your background or orientation.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's a must-take that you will enjoy and learn a lot from. Regardless of one's major, this class is vital to making students generally more informed people. The readings are compelling (for the most part) and Chauncey is truly a fantastic professor and is a pleasure to learn from.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another students because of how interesting the subject matter is and who engaging the class was all semester.",
    "Everyone should take this class! You learn a lot about a largely untold history and it's a lot of fun. I looked forward to all the lectures.",
    "Good class, but I didn't find it to really live up to the \"hype\" that past student evaluations have seemed to espouse. It's an interesting topic that almost anyone would benefit from knowing more about, but the material can drag at times, and some of the readings are dense and\/or simply hard to get through, as are some of the lectures. If you already have a passion for this \"sort\" of social history format, you'll probably love it, but coming in with very little social history background, I did not always find the format of this course to be all that accessible. It's much more about trends than about facts, much more about individual stories than about dates, and there's quite a bit of repetition thematically.",
    "Recommend it for sure if you're interested in learning about how the LGBTQ+ community has transformed in the United States starting in the 1800's up until nowadays.",
    "Take this class!!! One of the best classes (let alone lectures) that I have ever taken at Yale. Whether you are queer or not, the material is so interesting and so untaught anywhere else that you will definitely come out of the class with a better understanding of general American history in the light of all that is discussed in class. The midterm and final are very reasonable and fair. The oral history paper is a cool opportunity to learn about your family (or someone else's) and I definitely gained a lot from it. I loved loved loved this class.",
    "I would strongly recommend taking this course. You learn about a history that is really important but is not covered by most other curricula. Also, Professor Chauncey's lectures are both interesting and fun. A great class for anyone and also a great class to Credit\/D.",
    "Even if the subject matter wasn't fascinating and important (which it is), you would absolutely need to TAKE THIS for George Chauncey's approach to historical study and for a renewed understanding of your status as an agent of history. Also TAKE THIS for a chance to challenge your assumptions of the historical record, and for a chance to redefine 'status quo.' Also, queers. So like what more could you possibly want from life.",
    "HIST 127 is a classic! Although I wish that Professor Chauncey had given us a more balanced viewpoint in presenting the history, I still learned so much information that I rarely would have come across otherwise. The readings are interesting and the papers fun to complete, so absolutely take LesGay if you can. I kept putting it off, so if youre like me in that regard, be sure to make time to take the course!",
    "Absolutely! It is one of my favorite I have taken not only because the history is important and lectures\/readings fascinating but also because it prompts so much self-reflection. No matter who you are, you will feel like you have gained new perspectives on things as central to life as love, gender, sex, etc.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It's a bucket list class, and if Chauncey leaves Yale, as it's rumored he will soon, it will be a massive loss to future generations of Yalies if the course ceases to exist. An absolutely formative experience.",
    "I would whole heartedly recommend this course to another student, and I would add that I would especially recommend this course to students who identify as straight. If you take it, you would learn that heterosexuality and homosexuality are inescapably and dichotomously locked together; where one ends, the other begins. So to learn about the history of LGTBQ people how they have been presented and presented themselves, theorized about, and persecuted, sheds as much light on heterosexuality as it does homosexuality.",
    "Of course. It's a great course, a must take for your yale career",
    "Yes but only as an underclassmen. As a senior it was very rudimentary stuff and you might better enjoy something else!",
    "Absolutely. One of the best courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Everyone should take it before graduating!",
    "Absolutely. It was incredible. Take it",
    "Take this course. You'll learn things you'll never learn anywhere else.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "I would certainly recommend this to another student, regardless of your interests. Professor Chauncey is a captivating lecturer, and you will without a doubt learn something new and interesting every class. The readings are probably worth doing but not necessary to do all of them and otherwise the class is relatively low work.",
    "Definitely",
    "Absolutely! I have already recommended this course to many of my friends if it is taught again. The course is so special and is truly a gem - a subject that is interesting and fresh, and a teacher that is truly passionate.",
    "If you feel extremely passionate about the topic then yes. As a straight male I never felt particularly engaged and really didn't find the class to be intellectually stimulating. You're told to process the history Chauncey lectures on then repeat it in class assignments.",
    "I will definitely recommend this course to another student, because it helps us to understand about sexuality, history, and how they interacted.",
    "This is NOT a gut class!!! It was a very interesting class that showed me gay history isn't always progressive. I would recommend it if you're willing to put in the time to do the readings and attend lecture..",
    "Take it please! It's life-changing and eye-opening.",
    "Absolutely. Take this course if it's offered again.",
    "This is a wonderful course. As an international student, I didn't know a lot about US history and pretty much nothing about lesbian and gay history, this class taught me a whole lot on both! Take it with Lena as your TA, she's amazing.",
    "This class is an absolute must take. Definitely among the best lectures I've taken at Yale and an excellent humanities credit for STEM majors. I hope that Chauncey continues teaching this course for many, many years to come- it's special.",
    "Absolutely! Any and every Yale College student should take this course.",
    "Yes, yes, a million times yes! This class was the best class I've ever taken, at Yale and beyond.",
    "YES!!!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! I feel like I gained so much knowledge, and this subject often goes uncovered despite its great importance. It was such a privilege to be in this course and I think everyone should take it if possible! The professor is beyond fantastic. To be honest, I even came close to tears (in a good way) various times throughout the course because the information was presented in such a powerful and moving way. Also, Chauncey tries his best to present multiple perspectives and keep the history intersectional.",
    "Great class that provides a look at history from the perspective of sexuality, something that's much too overlooked. Chauncey's lectures are interesting, understandable, and enlightening. Definitely would recommend taking this class, it definitely changes the perspective and understanding of how sexuality has progressed in America.",
    "Yes--definitely one of the best courses at Yale!",
    "It's as good as everyone says it is. Gay or straight, you will relate to this class, partly because Prof. Chauncey emphasizes that his students' experiences are as worth examining critically as what scholars write about. This class feels dynamic and important and the two essays, one midterm, and final seem like a small price to pay for such an enlightening class (plus, the essays were some of the most fun to research\/write as I've ever done). Take it take it take it.",
    "Chauncey is a fantastic lecturer, I should establish that first. Everything about his classes -- the lights, sound, powerpoints -- is perfectly choreographed. He clearly cares very deeply about this class. That being said, I've never felt more uncomfortable being gay than after taking the course. The scope of the material is utterly ridiculous. It's insultingly narrow. Chauncey propagates a very particular vision of what he deems \"true\" gay history. If you're not involved with theater or sing a capella then don't take the class. He's militantly anti-\"straight acting.\" He essentially labels us closet cases. The worst stereotype of a \"SJW\" I feel totally disconnected from a once firm gay identity, and I directly blame this course. It makes you feel as if you're living a lie unless you're challenging every gender convention known to man.",
    "Absolutely. A wonderfully interdisciplinary, comprehensive course covering everything from film and music to memoir and academic prose. Lectures were probing, inquisitive, and eye-opening, while sections were a fantastic opportunity to reflect and ponder broader implications of the course. Assignments were fairly substantial, but a true pleasure to complete. Definitely a must-take course before you graduate.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to anyone at all. Really fascinating look at history that is not normally taught in school, and really relevant to current times as well as an understanding of the past. By far one of the most interesting courses, most engaging lectures, and kindest classmates I've ever experienced.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, if it is taught again. In today's world, this sort of information is crucial to understanding the United States, and the way it is presented goes way beyond what can be learned independently.",
    "Yes amazing life changing class",
    "definitely would recommend to anyone interested in learning history",
    "Fantastic Cr\/D",
    "110% yes",
    "This class is amazing. Chauncey might not offer it in Fall 2017 or 2018. If he does, *make* *sure* *you* *take* *it*",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. As a heterosexual student, I found this course to be engaging and enlightening on so many different levels. It allowed me to understand a whole different perspective of history, which at times, conflicts with what we often learn in mainstream US history. Professor Chauncey is an amazing professor who is extremely passionate about teaching, and his students, and this shines through with every single lecture. The use of songs from the relevant time periods at the beginning of lecture, the stories from Yale students from way-back-when, etc. all speak to how creative this course is, and how interesting it can be, even if the subject matter doesn't necessarily relate! Though the workload is a bit heavy (there's quite a bit of reading every week), the readings are worth taking the time to read, and really build to your understanding of US lesgay history as a whole. An amazing course!",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, yes, a thousand times yes. It's incredible. It's not one of the most popular courses at Yale without reason.",
    "PLEASE TAKE THIS YOU WILL CRY AND ALSO LEARN A BUNCH OF THINGS YOU REALLY SHOULD'VE LEARNED IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT GUESS WHAT YOU DIDN'T",
    "Would absolutely recommend to any Yale student. Lectures are incredibly engaging, professor Chauncey is extremely knowledgeable and accomplished in his field, and you will gain an indespensible awareness and understanding of the issues facing the LGBTQ community, which is important whether you are a member of the community or not.",
    "Absolutely! This course is for anyone who appreciates learning about alternative perspectives on history - certainly not only queer people.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. This is one of the most interesting class I have taken at Yale. I also believe it is so important to become better versed in such social issues as LGBTQ issues--things that are so relevant and important to the people and world around us.",
    "This course is so interesting and Chauncey is fantastic! Take it!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student! I learned so much and looked forward to attending both lecture and section. The readings were engaging. Professor Chauncey does an amazing job of giving specific examples of historical events while also tying clear broad themes across time periods.",
    "US les gay is as great as it sounds, but you get out of it what you put in. I credit d'ed the course and frequently felt like I was regretful I could've gotten more out of it. It's also kind of a lot of work, but the material really is so fascinating and important regardless of your sexuality.",
    "Yes, absolutely. It helps you understand the world around you in a profound way.",
    "Yes, very interesting history and very well taught!!",
    "Every student should be learning this in-depth information about a very important history in the United States. The course is well-taught with a lot of primary resources, including George Chauncey's role as the lecturer and facilitater of the material taught in this course.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student, as I found the material interesting, Professor Chauncey engaging and the workload not overwhelming.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, especially as a first history course, because it's so well organized. There's a resource for writing history papers, Chauncey sends out emails before the midterm and final detailing the format, and there are tons of old student study guides floating around. I wish the first paper came a bit later in the course, but doing the 2nd and 3rd isn't bad at all. Lectures are so good and well organized (would highly recommend typing though, he jumps around a bit). Movies are fun, section can be fun.",
    "YES. THIS COURSE SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT FOR EVERYONE TO GRADUATE.",
    "You absolutely cannot pass up the opportunity to take LesGay with professor Chauncey. This is true for everyone, but especially if you're an LGBT+ person--I had never learned this history that is so crucial to my identity, and so well-taught here by Professor Chauncey.",
    "This course is the best class I've taken at Yale. It's very engaging and relevant given the progression of LGBT rights in the last few decades. You will learn about the ups and downs, acceptance and constant pushing away of, and wins and losses of the LGBT community in a very vivid way. I would definitely recommend to anyone.",
    "aI definitely recommend it to anyone who has felt any sort of distance between themselves and queerness, whether in their own identity or in the identity of others. It proves the context to understand generations upon generations of people who have grown up and either promoted or subverted normative forces in society, which are important to understand beyond sexuality itself. The way that it challenges your categorical understandings and assumptions about the world and more importantly, the people around you.",
    "Yes- it is very fun and interesting - would definitely recommend!",
    "Absolutely. A must-take course if at all possible. This history is important for everyone no matter where they come from or how they identify, and is beautifully weaved into the tapestry of american history and change.",
    "I would definitely recommend! Very interesting material, very thorough lectures, and not too much work.",
    "Yes. Awesome course. It was powerful and very relevant in today's world.",
    "Yes, as long as there is a genuine interest in the subject, and with the understanding that it is a big lecture with a lot of reading. Definitely leans toward WGSS, perhaps more than history.",
    "TAKE IT",
    "Yes! Take this course. It will open your mind and change your perspective.",
    "Yes!!",
    "This course has some flaws, mostly relating to how the assignments are set up, but it's still important (and often overlooked) history. Lecture is the best part of this course. Professor Chauncey is absolutely passionate about what he teaches. You'll follow the American conception of what it means to be gay, and the consequences of that, throughout American history but mostly from the second half of the nineteenth century to the first few years of the twenty-first. There are three film screenings, which are all heartbreaking in their own way. Some of the readings are a bit of a drag, but there are a few gems in there as well. All in all, if you're interested in American history from a different angle than you're used to, take this course.",
    "Yes of course, but everyone who's taken this course recommends it to everyone else. Must take at Yale, no doubt in my mind.",
    "What can I say about this class that hasn't already been said? Chauncey is a genius and the leading expert in this subject. It is a privilege to learn from him, and his lectures brought me to tears multiple times. It was particularly moving to take this class in 2016, and I totally understand taking a year or two off after this. Take the class if it comes back. It's so worth it.",
    "ABSOLUTELY take this course. Professor Chauncey is a delight to listen to, and unless your previous history education was really exceptionally thorough, you are guaranteed to have your assumptions challenged and to learn things your other history courses left it. It was also revolutionary, for me, to learn history through the lens of a specific subject, and that helped to create a narrative.",
    "Yes-- it is fantastic. A must take.",
    "Yes.",
    "What you've heard is true: LesGay is phenomenal. Professor Chauncey is a legend. Sadly, he is taking sabbatical one of the next two years, and he might not be teaching it the other year either, so hopefully you get the chance to take it.",
    "ABSOLUTELY",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The history is interesting and relevant to today -- everyone can see how their lives have been impacted by queer history, because everyone's lives have been impacted by the concepts of sex, gender, and sexuality. One of the most eye-opening aspects of this course were the very concepts of sex, gender, and sexuality were challenged by historical evidence -- how we interpret these concepts today aren't how they've always been interpreted. Despite this being a history course, much of our readings were personal narratives, which kept readings interesting and often heartfelt.",
    "Take it whether you are queer or straight! This class will change your perspective on sexuality forever!",
    "I would highly, highly recommend this course to another student. The course material is fascinating, and the teaching staff is great.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "Yes! This is one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, of course! The lectures and material work well together and you'll leave with a far better understanding of political and social movements.",
    "100% yes. This is a class you MUST take in your time at Yale, straight or queer (though especially if you're queer). It changed my life.",
    "Yes, it is a very insightful course that would amaze every student.",
    "Yes- this is an engaging course that treats gay and lesbian history in a way that is immediately relevant to everyone, those who identify as LGBTQ and those who don't.",
    "Take this course if you get the chance!! It's one of the most popular courses at Yale for a reason. You'll learn so much about a history that you'd never get to talk about otherwise. (Did you know that YMCA was a gay anthem? Or that gay men in the 1920s were sometimes referred to as horticultural lads?) The course is structured in a way where it's easy to do well, and even though there's a lot of reading, it's all fairly interesting and most weeks you'll want to do it. On top of that, Chauncey is an amazing lecturer -- I was sick one day and had to miss lecture, and I was so sad about it. He starts and ends each class with a gay anthem, and times and organizes his lectures unbelievably well. He's one of the world's experts on a topic that not that many people study (most of the books we read in class reference his work in the intro), meaning that not only is he more qualified than anyone to teach this class, it's not a class you'd get the chance to take anywhere else. Even if you don't think you're that interested in history, at least shop the class. You would be missing out on such a gem if you didn't.",
    "Yes. Absolutely. I almost went through Yale without taking this course and I am so grateful that I committed to it my senior year. Is so much fun and will change the way you see the world",
    "I would- a great history lecture, but too bad he's not teaching for a couple years",
    "I would recommend it. I took it for a grade and learned some very cool stuff i would not have learned elsewhere and also improved my writing and engaged with some very cool readings.",
    "Everyone, and I mean everyone, should take this class. Chauncey does a remarkable job telling the chronology and narratives of people in the lgbtq+ community. He also does one heck of a job choosing incredible TFs.",
    "I would without a doubt recommend this course to any student at Yale, regardless of major. It is so well-taught and so interesting, and not that challenging even for people who are not interested in history or humanities. The American LGBTQ community has such a fascinating and complex history that many of us don't think about when we consider current events or general American history, and taking this course is a truly fun and exciting way to gain pretty deep insight into that narrative, which is especially helpful because it enables us to understand the current state of queers in America. Professor Chauncey clearly loves teaching and makes lectures really engaging, the lecture size is large enough that you will always be able to find people to study with, and the essay assignments (particularly the oral history) are honestly a pleasure and not that difficult if you keep up with lectures and readings. This course is definitely the best I have taken at Yale and I don't think I'm only speaking for myself - take it if you can!",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this class to other students. The material is fascinating and provides really unique insight into cultural history. Prof. Chauncey is incredible and makes a 400-person lecture feels personal and intimate. There is a good amount of work (not more than usual lecture though) that requires detailed knowledge and understanding, so be willing to put in the effort if you want a good grade. This is also a great class to take Credit\/D because you will definitely still learn a lot and be engaged without having to put in a ton of work.",
    "Absolutely! Take LesGay...although I know Chauncey isn't offering it for another couple of years :( You learn so much, you learn about why things are the way they are today, you learn about a vibrant culture, you get to talk to other students about gay culture and be in an overall very accepting group of people. One of the best lectures I've taken at Yale.",
    "ABSOLUTELY, PLEASE TAKE.",
    "Lesgay is an awesome course. Chauncey is an incredible lecturer, and the material is important and exciting. It lives up to the hype.",
    "yeah but i'd credit\/d it",
    "Just--take this class. It will make you cry and forever change the way you see the world, no matter what walk of life you're from. This class is about history at its most powerful: compassion, unbiased understanding, and the ability to see that things weren't always the way they are now, which means that they could be different in the future; that stories, from the past and from right now, always matter.",
    "Absolutely. I think it teaches essential, yet rarely taught, history and perspectives. To be an informed American citizen in today's world I think that this course is necessary to any student's education.",
    "The course has a lot of reading involved but if you are alright with that then I would recommend it highly!",
    "Absolutely! If you ever have a chance to take this course (or any other with Prof. Chauncey), do it. He is incredibly knowledgeable about the subject, the lectures are fun and informative, and the class definitely adds perspective to not only LGBT activism today, but also many different forms of social organization.",
    "YES",
    "Take it! Most people aren't history or AMST majors, so you should take it credit\/D. I learned the material and loved the lectures, and I didn't have to stress out about the reading or papers at crunch time.",
    "Absolutely! It's amazing. You learn so much and after it's all over you'll ask yourself: how did I not know this before? Chauncey is incredible as a professor.",
    "Yes; it's a very interesting course and it separates itself by being based on a history that is not often discussed",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I gained so much nuance in a field of study that I won't really learn about elsewhere",
    "YES! Please take this. You will not regret it. The assignments seem overwhelming but they're actually very doable."
