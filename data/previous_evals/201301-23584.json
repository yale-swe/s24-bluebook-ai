   "comments": [
    "We needed to cover the material more rigorously.",
    "This is a class at FES, not at the law school. It's not cross-listed with YLS, and as such, there are very few students in the class with prior law experience.That said, Professor Shansky is running the class like a law class--with students volunteering (not being called on!) to discuss the cases.Without prior legal experience on the part of the students, this is often an exercise in frustration; legal cases can be hard to parse, and I often felt that many in our class struggled with understanding the cases, much less being able to discuss them clearly. Thus, class time often got extremely frustrating, with many students not paying as much attention as they could have been (myself included).I would really like to see Professor Shansky taking a more active role in teaching--in other words, to run the class more like an FES class, and less like a traditional legal class. I think this would have helped all of us gain a better understanding of the material. In this context, learning (a little bit about) how a normal legal class works is significantly less valuable than learning the material as well as we can.",
    "We were always behind in the readings -- maybe require all of them, but then only pick the 2 or 3 most relevant for presentation during class time?",
    "I imagine this varies greatly year to year, but our class didn't seem particularly engaged in relevant case discussion \/ were reluctant to participate; not sure that people actually did the reading. I think you really get out of this course what you put into it."
