   "comments": [
    "Don't take it. It's a take-home final, a final paper, and two shorter writing assignments but it's a frustrating class without any purpose or overarching themes. It encompasses everything that's wrong with a humanities class. It's cross listed under too many departments and tries to address everything without ever really dealing with one thing. Lectures consisted of Professor Rasmussen reciting what seemed to be a Wikipedia bio of a particular week's author before analyzing a one or two sentences. I still don't know what the purpose of this class was and regret having taken it.",
    "I would only recommend this to a freshman student who feels that he or she has never been exposed to literature at a high level or feels that his or her analytical skills are lacking. I would NOT recommend this to any student in either the English or WGSS majors, as any introductory course in either of those subjects would render this class completely unnecessary.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student! It is amazing and if you read all the books, you will get a lot out of it.",
    "Sure! Really easy, very very little work, and good books. If you want to be challenged, no. Find a seminar with these books. But overall there are a few really interesting things that come up in the class, you just have to sit through a good bit of disorganization.",
    "I would recommend the class because the readings are interesting and enjoyable, there is not a lot of work, the grading is relatively easy, and the professor is enthusiastic and passionate, which rubs off on you.",
    "AMST 211 is worth taking if you're going to do the reading; if not, it's a waste of time.",
    "Yes, definitely, absolutely. You'll read such wonderful and important books and get to hear this really brilliant professor talk about them so sharply and lovingly. You'll probably be a better person at the other end of taking this class and reading these books.",
    "For a WR credit, this class requires VERY LITTLE writing (whether that's good or bad depends on what you want to get out of the class). I've written more for classes that don't have WR designation. It's basically a midterm \"paper\" and a final paper, with two small writing assignments. Prof. Rasmussen is a wonderful person, very thoughtful. However, the lecture format does not work. It's incredibly difficult to sit in lecture for 50min twice a week and be lectured to about a whole book. But if you need the WR credit, I would take this. Also, be aware that there is not much structure to the syllabus (it jumps from topic to topic). No final exam is nice though.",
    "I recommend it as an interesting and enjoyable class for anybody interested in a writing credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "The class is true to its title.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in the syllabus. It's a pretty light writing credit and engaging material. It's not enlightening, but it's interesting.",
    "At least shop it. The syllabus has many books that are somewhat off-the-beaten track that you wouldn't read otherwise. Rasmussen has awesome insights and she's so sweet and motherly.",
    "This class included a lot of interesting and worthwhile books, but ultimately it felt disorganized and directionless. I was never sure where we were trying to go with a particular reading. Professor Rasmussen is a mediocre lecturer who seems to be just rambling about her thoughts as they come to her. She was also really condescending at times, talking to us like we'd never read a book or written a paper before, which I found incredibly frustrating.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class. Race and Gender in American Literature is a good class, pretty serious, but very informative. It's important, whatever background you are from. Take it before leaving Yale. Professor Rasmussen is a great professor.",
    "TAKE IT. Professor Rasmussen is so chill, the readings are great (Beloved, anyone?), and basically the only work is two papers (midterm and final paper) with two short writing exercises. Minimal work, maximal gain, but make sure your TF likes you since he\/she does all the grading.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially if you want help close-reading or paper writing. Professor Rasmussen is a fairly engaging, and extremely knowledgable, professor.",
    "I thought this was going to be my 5th course and I would end up dropping it, but that was not the case. I loved this course and everyone should take it!",
    "THIS IS A WONDERFUL COURSE. Prof. Rasmussen is a fantastic lecturer, a brilliant academic and a fabulous person. She has so much insight and is so willing to share it with students in a kind, open, non-condescending way with her students. The syllabus is great -- extremely varied (read: YOU WILL READ BOOKS BY WOMEN OF COLOR! omg how rare) and very unlike most other intro lit syllabi at Yale. If you're interested in not only literature but the politics of literary expression, I highly, highly recommend you take this course, if only for the chance to read a wide array of great texts and to work with a truly devoted professor. And if you're thinking about majoring in American Studies and have an interest in cultural expression in general, definitely do it.",
    "Great class. Take it if you like the reading list, although be aware that you will be reading about 1 novel per week. Prof. Rasmussen really makes this class-- she is so energetic and interesting and fun. The class assignments were pretty chill: a take-home midterm, two short writing assignments, and a final paper. There were also interesting extra credit opportunities. A highlight of the class was the culminating unit that focused on the genre of spoken word-- two students came and performed spoken word pieces during our last class! In general this is a very low-key class that is fun and interesting-- definitely take it if you are interested in the material.",
    "Definitely take it. Very interesting books and great lectures. Easy workload.",
    "Relatively easy English lecture with a great, varied reading list. Cool professor, interesting writing assignments, fun and easy extra credit. Overall a good way to get a writing credit and to have your eyes opened to issues that are around you everyday. I would definitely recommend taking this class for anyone who needs to fulfill a distributional requirement, needs an English class for pre-med, is looking for a fifth class, or just wants to take something for themselves instead of for some requirement.",
    "Amazing lectures. Low workload comparatively.",
    "Great reading list, semi-interesting lectures (if you choose to go-- you really don't have to), a writing credit without much work. Overall, I would recommend it, even though Professor Rasmussen could be a little scatterbrained sometimes."
