    "Overall, I would not recommend this class. The reading was interesting,the Pequot museum was interesting, and I liked writing my final paper, but class was more often than not like pulling teeth. Discussion was very stilted, I don't feel like I have learned anything all that important\/new about the concept of wilderness.",
    "Take this course if you'd like to get into the nitty-gritty aspects of wilderness politics and theory, but if you're looking for a more soul-searching imagination-based (as in, literary\/artistic) scope, go elsewhere.",
    "Even if you hate to hike, take this class. It's an amazing exploration of what \"wild\" spaces (whether or not they actually existed) meant to Americans, and how that changed over time. Over the course of the semester, you get to read a combination of amazing seminal historical texts as well as really interesting (and contentious!) modern commentary on everything from imperialism to environmentalism to wolves and cars. After taking the class, I feel that wilderness is the defining entity of the United States, and it was incredibly awesome to discuss this with somany other interesting and intelligent people. Prof Greenfield is great - but it's taught by a different person every year.",
    "Wilderness in the North American Imagination explores the history of wilderness as an American idea, myth, and space. It looks through the lenses of race, gender, and class to identify define wilderness throughout American history and discuss the implications of these definitions. Professor Greenfield is very knowledgeable, but the class could be somewhat unfocused and the reading material was not excellent. This class will challenge your conception of wilderness and make you ask hard questions about the subject.",
    "an excellent exploration of the definition of wilderness. i would definitely recommend the class.",
    "This is a great course! The questions it asks, and the things that you get to read to answer those things, are really interesting. Of course, it's taught by a different person each year, but I think the subject matter inand of itself is very valuable. If you are interested in the outdoors or the environment at all, I would recommend it. d",
    "One of my top three courses at Yale. Take this course",
    "This was the best class I have taken at Yale so far. The subject matter is fascinating and is approached from intriguing angles. It tends to draw an interesting and diverse crowd of students, which made all of our discussions engaging and interesting. You will certainly become an expert in wilderness theory, and it will change the way you experience the wilderness and make you think more deeply about it. Overall, awesome.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who are willing to do a lot of work on their own and who don't mind being a bit underwhelmed by classroom discussion. That being said, it's hard to evaluate this course in the long-term because the professor changes so frequently. I guess my best advice would be to shop the class with a critical eye. The syllabus is fabulous, no question. It's the teaching that may fall a bit short.",
    "I would recommend the course, but as a study of the evolution of wilderness in America, not as a study of the wild west, or anything of the like.",
    "Yes!"
