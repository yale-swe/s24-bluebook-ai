   "comments": [
    "I only had 4 other students in my class so that made it very interactive. Although a lot of this course is about reading and writing, we all improved orally. The readings were great but take time and Martin Wagner is very dedicated to helping his students.",
    "Take it, it's a great introduction to German literature.",
    "Yes, I would. My reading comprehension and speed in German came a long way, it was a wonderfully small class, and Martin is a great teacher.",
    "Tough since my German isn't that good, so I had to work at least twice as hard as the native speakers for 3\/4 of the payoff. When I didn't put in enough work, it was kind of miserable. When I did, I really enjoyed the readings and class. The papers were interesting to work on and mercifully graded. Martin is great. If you have the time and the interest, I would highly recommend it."
