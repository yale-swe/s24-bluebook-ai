    "Really great course - learned a lot about not only intelligence agencies but also US government and politics in general. I found this course offered a strong foundation I was able to use on my other courses as well.",
    "learned how to write a policy memo, a lot about how the intelligence community works (and better understanding of how the government works), a lot about threats to the US",
    "Understanding of how intelligence informs foreign policy decision",
    "Knowledge: The meaning and nuances of intelligence Detailed understanding of the structure of the intelligence community, its history and development Interaction within the intelligence community (FBI vs. CIA vs NSA) and outside with the federal government\/other parties History of intelligence failures such as Pearl Harbor, Cuba, Iraq Covert operations and strategies of war\/intelligence policy such as cyber security, assassinations, counterinsurgency Serious moral and legal issues facing the intelligence community such as encryption (going dark), privacy\/Snowden, drone strikes, inter-agency communication, objective analysis etc. Emerging threats such as Russia, China, IS Skills: Ability to draft a Presidential Daily Brief or a formal memorandum Organizing, scheduling and presenting a national security threat assessment briefing in its truest sense Being brief, compact and compelling Reading detailed US intelligence commission reports such as the ones on interrogations, the Iraq war failure, the 9\/11 failure Insights: The fallibility of intelligence The lingering weaknesses of the intelligence community The human-ness of intelligence The technical and non-technical aspects of intelligence and analysis",
    "The memo assignments were really great",
    "Knowledge of the organization of the intelligence profession \/ community in America, as well as the intelligence making process and disciplines; Skills in research. Emphasis on concise and effective writing was different and appreciated. More of an emphasis on oral briefings and presentations than most other seminars I have participated in. Insights into intelligence from a theoretical and practitioner's perspective, the mix of which proved highly effective as well as contemporary challenges in the discipline."

   "comments": [
    "Really interesting course. Professor Wittenstein does a very good job at encouraging student participation, but I wish he'd led a bit more with his own experiences\/anecdotes from practicing in the field.",
    "Sometimes I wish the readings had been more incorporated into the discussions.",
    "The readings are great, and class discussion is interesting. All this is supported by thoughtful input from Professor Wittenstein.",
    "i loved this course. i really don't think i would change anything.",
    "Strength - great syllabus and fascinating topic Weakness - discussion could be more contentious",
    "Strengths: A treasure-trove of knowledge about the intelligence community, historical episodes and challenges Professor Wittenstein is very involved in the seminar and adds an analysis to every comment everyone makes The threat assessment briefing is quite entertaining and instructive The heavy readings such as books are well-chosen and insightful The structure of the course is very intelligent and organized\/built for a clear\/logical flow and understanding The seminars are great and Professor Ted often shows funny\/entertaining clips from the Daily Show\/Colbert Report\/the intelligence community Professor Ted often adds insights from personal experience and has an impressive history of involvement with intelligence commissions\/CIA The readings\/workload are very reasonable (and to be honest, probably needs to be increased) Weaknesses: Probably needs a bit more discussion of foreign actors\/powers e.g. intelligence capabilities of Russia\/China, cooperation with foreign liaisons such as France, Germany, Pakistan. Most of these international encounters were mentioned either in policy terms (the enemies of the state) or in passing (German involvement during the Iraq WMD intelligence failure). However, an international perspective on the structure of intelligence agencies, their failures\/policies and what we could learn from them is often very insightful. Professor Ted knew quite a bit about this and added some comments in passing but some readings would be welcome The class tone was maybe a bit more serious than it could have been (partly motivated by the 9 am class time) despite the comedic clips\/videos Perhaps a too much of a clutter of assignments at the end and very little at the beginning\/a bit stressful A lot of technical reading initially but a bit less by the end needs more technical reading on issues like China\/Russia\/Snowden rather than just news articles",
    "The reading and discussion were great. Perhaps we didn't get deep enough into the specific issues we were focusing on that week.",
    "Strengths: diversified, well spaced out assignments that all felt useful. Emphasis in the syllabus on contemporary affairs; Professor Wittenstein noted his effort to revise it each semester by assigning a newly released book which I found commendable and enjoyable. Covered an immense amount of ground quickly yet thoroughly. I appreciated the effort at a multimedia approach using short excerpts of video clips, which were sparingly but effectively used. Each memo assignment was scenario based and unique, which I found particularly exciting. Improvement: There were some hiccups with Canvas (different versions of the syllabus, forced to turn in papers by email rather than uploading) but largely this is due to our collective unfamiliarity with the program and not a fault of the course specifically. I appreciated the preparation documents relating to the final briefing, maybe consider adding a taped example to supplement this."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely an interesting course. As for most upper-level GLBL seminars, generally only juniors\/seniors\/grads can get in. Heavy reading assignments but prioritization\/skimming aren't difficult to do. With a short memo assignment, group paper and final paper, a bit more than a normal workload, but assignments are interesting and fair.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Yes, especially students interested in the topic. Great class, great professor, course load is normal, readings are interesting, and you get to discuss current events as well.",
    "this class was amazing. learned a lot about the intelligence community and how it works, threats to the US, etc. we did a week on cyber, russia, middle east, threats to the homeland, structure of the intelligence community, etc. the readings were all very interesting and applicable to what we were talking about, also not hard readings they were pretty easy. workload wasn't too bad, one 1000 word policy memo, a group threat assessment paper and presentation, and a 4000-5000 word final paper. would highly recommend.",
    "Definitely.",
    "Definitely a very very good global affairs elective and one of the classes I have learnt most in at Yale. I wouldnt say the class is phenomenal (it wont blow your mind, especially by the end) but it is very very good. If you are on the security track and\/or deeply interested in security policy, this course is an essential.

    "A great if intense class if you can get it Great, detailed feedback throughout the course on all written work."
