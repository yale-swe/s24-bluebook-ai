   "comments": [
    "It's a class that really covers a wide range of topics, some of which you might take to more than others. But almost all the readings can potentially make you think in a new way (Deleuze and Guattari, anyone?) If you successfully do all the readings, you'll walk away from this class knowing a bit more about everything-- from the history of Dutch art, to religious prohibitions, to architecture. Professor Connolly is very knowledgeable and very British. Our class had all sorts of people-- art history majors, French majors, Humanities. It made discussion interesting, since everyone had their own areas of expertise.",
    "Take it if the topic--representations of original art in other artistic media, ie poems about paintings--interests you! The reading\/watching\/art list is varied and covers a broad expanse of origins, topics, and time periods, although some of the theory can be quite dry and\/or over-the-top (not super necessary to read in depth all the time though). Since this is cross-listed under 3 very different disciplines and had people in a wide variety of majors enrolled this year, the quality of discussion varied quite a bit from week to week, depending largely on how well the assignments for the week were understood. It's a pretty eye opening course though, and a really interesting way to look at a broad scope of artistic production through a unified, but nonetheless multifaceted and complex, lens.",
    "It's a class where your personal investment in it makes it or breaks it. The notion of ekphrasis both narrowly and broadly considered is a fascinating one to me, but if you don't think it's interesting, don't take it! You will be doing a totally manageable amount of reading and work with just two papers and a presentation along with small weekly reading responses. Class discussion will stink if you and your classmates are unwilling to engage, but if you do decide to intellectually involve yourself in the course, you might get a lot out of it, like I have.",
    "yes, sometimes you feel like you arent learning anything tangible- which is true- but in the end i think by writing and anlyzing skills improved a great deal. and you get to read really beautiful\/interesting texts\/poems and how they relate to other things. altogether great class. and prof. connolly is also amazing, knows everything.",
    "Yes I recommend this course, the readings, films, etc. were very interesting and it felt, to me, more like a personal exploration than a class, again, this kind of structure may bother some people but i found that it made me more excited to do the work and engaged with the texts. It did not feel like an art history class, though - focus is not on the visual art itself but more on the connection between image and language and the themes of the texts (which sometimes didn't seem to have anything to do with traditional ekphrasis, but still good).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Take the class, it opens up a subject which seems simple and obscure."
