    "This is a great course to get you thinking about the process of apocalyptic thinking, bridging the past and the future, and the nature of catastrophic events in the present. I felt like the diverse forms of literature and film we were exposed to in the weekly assignments was valuable in giving us a well-rounded perspective that builds on what we've looked at in weeks prior while also offering new forms of expression for familiar concepts. We could note in this course how theory, art, and literature come together to try to illustrate a commonly thought of and often misconceived concept. I come away from this class as a better critical reader and a better creative writer. I loved the discussions. tl;dr - Take this class. It's great. You'll love it if you love history, sci-fi, or literature. Professor Berger is a quality discussion leader and a very approachable grader.",
    "Modern Apocalyptic Narratives was a really great class. The discussions were well led and very interesting, and I learned a lot about the genre and how to think more analytically. Professor Berger was extremely encouraging, loved exploring any student's ideas, and facilitates great discussion. There is a lot of reading - at least one book a week - but the readings are interesting and really help make the class. The essay assignments were rather vague but Professor Berger helped brainstorm and think through possible arguments.",
    "I wouldn't recommend taking this class. It's not that much work, but I didn't really get anything out of it."
