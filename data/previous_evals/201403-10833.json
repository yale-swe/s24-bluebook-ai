   "comments": [
    "Econ 580 teaches students about the history of economic development, focusing on Britain and how this country industrialized during the industrial revolution. I would recommend this course to other students for a few reasons. One is that reading papers and thinking about them exercises a different part of your brain. (This statement may be neurologically false or undetermined, but I am trying to convey that reading and thinking about papers is an important skill that is not emphasized in the other first year courses). Through the readings and lectures, Tim taught us valuable lessons about the world of research and publication, and gave us a healthy dose of skepticism.",
    "Definitely recommend.",
    "Yes! To any student in the economics department.",
    "It's a very informative and thought-provoking class. Take it.",
    "I would recommend others to take this course",
    "Recommended. Highly interesting and gives good context to economics studies."

   "comments": [
    "I knew next to nothing about the industrial revolution in Britain before taking this course. So, at one level, all of the papers and lectures exposed me to ideas and facts that I did not know before. See the above comments for more general lessons I gained from this course.",
    "A significant contribution since this is (unfortunately) the only opportunity in the first semester to see economic ideas are applied. Besides understanding history better which I personally find important, We were exposed to various methodologies, their advantages and weaknesses.",
    "The course increased my knowledge and interest in Economic History and I will pay more attention to research in this area in the future.",
    "Gives a good background that is grounded in reality for the economic theories which we study in other courses."
