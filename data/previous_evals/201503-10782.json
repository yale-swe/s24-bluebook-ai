   "comments": [
    "Good overview of mathematical topics commonly used in the field of engineering. I would recommend this class as an overview class if necessary, but maybe not for all disciplines of engineering.",
    "I would summarize this class as a confusing waste of time. This class could be so useful and so important, but the lecturer was just so, so bad. This is a required course, so there is no way to avoid it, but it shouldn't be avoided if only it had a better lecturer.",
    "I would not recommend this course to most students (although I suspect most students are taking it because it's required). It's a broad survey that's intended to cover the basic mathematics all engineering grad students need, but considering that most of those students have studied most of this material before, it's hard to find a reason why this class is necessary. While a refresher on the material certainly doesn't hurt, I came away from the class feeling like I hadn't really learned anything new. And the speed of the class is such that if I were new to some substantial topic, I'm not sure how well I would have fared. I feel like students would be better off taking specific courses in differential equations, linear algebra, or whatever their weakness is rather than forcing them to sit through a class that's probably >75% review for most students.",
    "this is a required class.However , I don't recommend this course to students with few math background.",
    "This is a mandatory course, so everyone has to take it. IF one put in enough effort, a lot can be learnt. But with other time constraints, if the course is not making us work hard enough, we won't ourselves take initiative to work hard.",
    "ENAS 500 is a miserable course required by the engineering department. Since it is required, of course, it has virtually no standards for being educational. If you could opt out, I would strongly advise it.",
    "This class was helpful for students in engineering and math, but I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone else.",
    "Introductory\/review of math methods.",
    "Very unsatisfactory course. I would not recommend this course but since it is a departmental requirement, there is no choice. This course relies a lot on rote application of formulas without intuition or insight and the HW is badly designed. The grade is not at all reflective of what you have learned, and is more a function of knowing what parts of the textbook to study.",
    "Well, this is a requirement for all engineering students so I guess there isn't much to say about the course. But it's a good review course for other subjects involving maths.",
    "The material presented in this course i useful for most engineers, so I would recommend that they take the class. However, much of my learning was conducted outside of class. I would suggest to new students that they attempt to engage the professor in a dialogue during class in an attempt to make the material more understandable and useful.",
    "It is a good course, although moves very quickly.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone who needs to fulfill a math requirement. The course is challenging, but it provides a useful survey of advanced mathematical techniques.",
    "The course is a good review for students that have already seen the material before. I don't think it is enough for students that have not had mathematical methods earlier.",
    "I would not recommend it to another student, but it does not matter since it is a required course.",
    "It is a very good course to brush up most of the Mathematics topics. Work load is also appropriate.",
    "good course",
    "Overall a good course and survey of various math methods. I would recommend this course, a lot of material is covered but it is useful.",
    "Recommend.",
    "I found it very confusing, time-consuming (to teach myself everything from the book after getting nothing out of lectures), and was a major stress in my life for what felt like little gain. I could've learned more useful skills from a solid statistics class. It should not be required for BMEs."

   "comments": [
    "It only served to confuse my previous understanding of the mathematical topics covered. Read my other responses to see how poor this course was.",
    "All of these topics are very relevant to just about any engineering project. However, given that most engineers learn this material (in equal or greater depth) in college, I'm not sure that this course specifically contributed anything to my knowledge or research.",
    "I am not sure whether this class will contribute to my research for now.",
    "IT did not deepen any understanding, I just learnt a lot of formulas.",
    "It did not. I may have become worse at math as the result of this course.",
    "The review of differential equations, Laplace transforms, and Fourier series will be helpful for my research in chemical engineering.",
    "It didn't deepen my knowledge per se, but it pushed me to improve my accuracy when solving problems. In this way it was very helpful.",
    "This course is useful as this course reviews some of the useful mathematical tools used in research.",
    "This class gave me a good refresher in the mathematical concepts that I will use throughout my research. It did not directly contribute this semester, but I assume I will use the book and my notes to solve work with differential equations in the future.",
    "The course was helpful to teach me advanced mathematical methods. I believe this will prove useful in my future education and research.",
    "The materials in the course are methods used in all branches of physics and engineering and will be useful for any research in these fields.",
    "Perhaps the only bright side of this course is that I do feel like I learned a TON. This class refreshed math topics that I hadn't touched since high school. It will certainly contribute to my research. In fact, it has already contributed to my research (my first semester Special Investigation). I just cannot stress enough that this course is extremely frustrating...I think students would still learn a ton, even if they were given more direction for exams. The level of grief that my peers and I shared prior to tests is kind of remarkable.",
    "The course is very helpful to learn the basics of mathematics and few new topics required for other graduate courses.",
    "Methods to solving DEs helpful in my other classes.",
    "Mathematical skill is very important in my research.",
    "It did neither."
