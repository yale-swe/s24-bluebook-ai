   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it, but I'd have students come into the class with the expectation of listening to the professors ideas exclusively and ignoring their own.",
    "Yes. The student needs to be willing to really engage with the works and complete the readings. I would also forewarn students--particularly those from weak writing backgrounds--about the high expectations that professors have for essays. It can be disappointing to get poor grades on papers that you work hard on, but Directed Studies creates a good foundation for moving forwards in academic writing and deeply contemplating the Western Canon. This was my favorite course of the three, mostly due to Professor Markovits.",
    "DRST 001 03 is a great class and I would highly recommend it. The texts are very interesting and the Professor is very knowledgeable and accessible. However, be prepared for quite a heavy workload; this was probably the DS class with the most work that I took this semester.",
    "You are incredibly lucky if you are in Stefanie Markovits' section! Prof. Markovits is an amazing section professor and discussion leader. At the end of each class I always felt very grateful to have been assigned to her section. The level of literary analysis she expects of you is very high, but in section discussions she always demonstrates how to go about doing such analysis, and by the time you have to do the same in your papers, you have a pretty good understanding of what you are up to. Her sections are always organized and well-planned. She knows which passages to focus on and exemplifies to you how to properly read those passages so as to unlock the larger meaning embedded within the text. It is this delicate balance between performing a very detailed close-reading of certain passages and trying to demystify what the text at large is trying to say that defines Prof. Markovits' approach to DS Literature. More often than not I left her sections with a perplexed smile on my face, since she knows well how to astound you with layers and layers of meaning she extracts from a line that would otherwise seem insignificant to you. Moreover, the detailed commentary she provides you with after each paper is really helpful, and I felt that my critical reading and analytical writing skills greatly improved over the course of the semester. Her section should be regarded as a paragon.",
    "Would definitely recommend this class, the works we read are absolute classics and deal with timeless issues of humanity. Classical and religious stories so rich, and the discussions help us make sense of things and make connections that we would never otherwise have made. The class not only helps you become more knowledgeable in the literary tradition, but also demands that you hone your skills as a reader and a writer--a benefit in every pursuit.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I would describe this course as a literature class that discusses a large amount of work in great depth.",
    "Definitely; reading these texts with the analytic input of the instructor and specialized knowledge of the other DSers is a genuine once in a lifetime opportunity."
