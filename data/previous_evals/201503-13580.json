    "This class was really cool! It was pretty difficult though, as it went through a lot of topics pretty fast. Definitely make sure you have a good grasp of linear algebra going in, as there was a bit more than I had expected. The problem sets were cool, as you were reading and analyzing actual biomechanics papers. Some of the papers were pretty dense and took a while to get through though, so make sure you start them early. All in all, the class was super interesting, but pretty hard (even some of the grad students seemed to have difficulty). I'm definitely glad I took it credit\/d, because the amount of work I would've had to put in if I was taking it for a grade would much more.",
    "At risk of identifying myself, I was one of four undergraduates in this course and one of three who took Mechatronics with Professor Venkadesan. Compared to Mechatronics, I would say this course requires a lot more thought. However, because of the lack of labs and final project, the work load is probably comparable. To summarize: this is one of my favorite lecture-based course (i.e. no projects) that I have taken at Yale. As can be expected from a graduate level course, be prepared for a lot of work. Professor Venkadesan highly encourages collaboration on the homework. Usually, this would mean everyone gets 100% on the assignments. Overall, the class average for all of the homework assignments was roughly a B-. This isnt because people slacked off, but because some of the questions required so much thought. I think that thinking about these questions will prepare you well for post-Yale work. Half of the homework are problem set based and the other half are paper reviews. The paper reviews are very interesting because it is obvious a lot of thought has been placed into what papers you read. For instance, specific sections are highlighted and you are expected to extrapolate the reading to interpret these sections. I think this is great preparation for graduate school. Overall, highly recommended. Just be prepared for the work load."
