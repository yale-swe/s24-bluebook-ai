    "DS Spring Lit is amazing. I would take it simply for the texts, but the DS Lit profs also tend to be really wonderful teachers who know how to lead a section. Almost every single lecture this semester was phenomenal. Even though it's true that the work load is much heavier than in the fall, it's worth it, and these texts are a joy to read.",
    "Yes, definitely recommend. DS Lit in the spring is very different from DS Lit fall.",
    "This class is a lot of work but ultimately rewarding.",
    "I highly recommend taking both semesters of DS particularly because of the Literature track - Petrarch's Sonnets, Shakespeare's King Lear, Tolstoy's War and Peace, and Woolf's To the Lighthouse will truly change your life!",
    "A survey of some of the great modern literary works, absolutely worth taking, not only for those majoring in the humanities, but for humans in general.",
    "A survey of the Western Canon in literary works. I would recommend this class if you're interested in tracing the development of literature over time, and if you're an avid reader who thrives on devouring books quickly."
