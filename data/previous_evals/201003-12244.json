   "comments": [
    "i would recommend if you are interested in engineering",
    "Great Class. Very well organized, clear and the topic is very interesting and important. Prof. Ma is very prominent in the field, he is a good lecturer and very funny! Take it! (The workload isn't that bad either)",
    "It is a difficult intro course and should be taken only if you have to. I would not recommend it unless they have to take it.",
    "I would not recommend it as an introduction to EE. It scared off a number of freshmen this year. I will take 201 next semester, but I suggest you start there.",
    "i would NOT recommend this class to a fellow student. The material is not well explained in class and is not very interesting.",
    "Take it if you have to. It's not a terribly thrilling class but its good.",
    "This class will teach you everything you need to know about basic electronics. It's actually organized pretty well, and although it seems hard sometimes, if you stay on top of the material it's completely manageable. The final is hard tho. Take this class with TP Ma, he is an excellent and hilarious professor, and really nice outside of class.",
    "This is a great intro EE class. TP Ma is a funny\/informative instructor. If you do the work you will get a good grade. Even if you're not EE\/MechE major just interested in electro physics this is a cool class to take.",
    "It is a nice introductory course to electronics. Has a lot of requirements though (weekly problemsets, lab, pop-quizes, three monthly exams and a final)so you have to maintain a constant pace throughout the semester. Prof. Ma is hilarious, yet sometimes he can be painfully slow in explaining the material.",
    "Definitely recommended. A great course.",
    "I don't think anyone takes this course just for fun, so this doesn't really matter. However, as a required course, it's still taught well and isn't too difficult.",
    "EENG 200 is a pretty difficult introduction course, especially for freshmen. The majority of the studentstaking the class are sophomore EE majors and junior MechE majors. The textbook is not particularly good, and the grading can be quite frustrating at times because no partial credit is given in any of the test questions. The class is very interesting at times, but it is probably not worth it to take the class if you are not even considering the EE major (i.e. you are in the humanities and are looking to fulfill a QR requirement).",
    "Yes I would, because it covers some of the most important materials about circits and electronics. The work load is not bad either.",
    "Take it with T.P Ma. He is hilarious and really helpful and really wants you to succeed. My main issue with this class was the grader, but hopefully it wont be the same person in future years. It is a decent amount of work, but the material is very interesting and the lab is pretty straightforward.",
    "This is your basic electrical engineering course. You analyse circuit diagrams and learn basic concepts regarding electrical circuits in lecture. You build and test some of those circuits and concepts in lab. The best part of the course was Prof. Ma, by far. He's very funny and charming. I probably wouldn't recommend this course unless you intend on being an EE major (or if you have to take it for MechE). It's not particularly exciting or challenging, and overall, left me feeling unenthusiastic. At least is hints that there are bigger and better things waiting out there in future.",
    "EENG 200 is a good class! You probably have to take it if you're EE or MechE, but I would even recommend it to the non-engineering major (pretty much anyone with a little physics background). It's not that hard, but it's really fundamental and important stuff. It sometimes moves a little slowly, but it gives you time to digest the information. Problem sets usually don't take too long, and there's a lot of camaraderie among classmates. If you're taking it for your major, take it with TP -- he's a great professor. The lab TA's for this year were also helpful and nice.",
    "If you have to take it, do your homework, get through the lab, and be ready for the roller coaster ride that is the tests. If you're considering EE, this is the class that will test your love of circuits.",
    "EE200 is as good of an introduction into EE concepts as can be expected. The professor is helpful and manages to keep the class somewhat engaged despite the often boring material. The class has many small components that all count towards your final grade: problem sets, labs (with reports done during lab time), 3 tests, pop quizzes, and a final. This makes the class a considerable amount of work, although not too hard in terms of difficulty.",
    "this is one of the worst classes i've taken. Ma knows his stuff, and is really nice. BUT the TA who graded tests WAS HORRIBLE!! you HAVE to give partial credit on problems like this and he doesn't. you're wrong or right. so you end up with same amount of credit as someone who left it blank because you added wrong.",
    "A great and fun introductory course. Take it with TP Ma."
