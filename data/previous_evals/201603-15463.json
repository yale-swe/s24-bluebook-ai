   "comments": [
    "I had a rigorously formal introduction to NMR both in theory and in the practice that occurs in the lab, which is something I enjoyed. My prior exposure to NMR was at first very scarce, in the context of organic chemistry and reading chemical shift peaks to determine molecular structures but not really understanding what the peaks meant, where they came from and what splitting exactly was, and then was more in-depth in a radiological sense but still lacked the rigor this course provided. I can say I finally understand pulse sequences from a theoretical perspective as opposed to simply memorizing what happens and what the images are supposed to look like.",
    "Gained an appreciation for the intricacies of MR imaging and spectroscopy and the many considerations that must be taken into account to acquire meaningful data.",
    "I gained a basic familiarity with a wide variety of MR applications. While many of the details were less accessible to me, I now feel much more comfortable understanding the operation and limitations MR-based techniques.",
    "I learned about the basic and more advanced features of NMR. This knowledge will be very helpful when designing MRI experiments in the future. I am very happy to have taken this course!"

   "comments": [
    "As mentioned previously, the rigor of the course is a strong plus. I also enjoyed that there wasn't homework to worry about for the class. However, I would have enjoyed more rigor as well, as I am someone that actually is able to learn more from equations and mathematics than just pictorial diagrams. Additionally, although I enjoyed the fact that slides were sent before class, annotated versions would have been helpful. Sometimes, the slides only make sense while the lecturer is speaking, and trying to study from them is difficult.",
    "Strengths include a broad overview of many MR techniques and in depth presentation of the physics of acquisition of MR images and spectra. Weaknesses include some duplicate lectures.",
    "Strengths: clearly knowledgeable instructors; nice visualizations Weakness: sometimes moved a bit fast (lots of content and technical terms in a small period of time) for those with limited prior exposure to the subject matter.",
    "I appreciated the broad range of topics discussed in the course that reviewed multiple methods made available with NMR. I felt in some cases the mathematical involvement during the lectures did not correspond with what was tested on the exams. Likewise, it would have been helpful to include more conceptual practice questions for each lecture that related to those on the mid-term and final exam."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if a student wishes to understand NMR and MRS radiologically, this would be the course to take! Other courses that discuss NMR techniques are rather watered down, covering just what is required for the sake of that course. Since this course is devoted entirely to MRS, there is hardly any watering down of the material.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for any student interested in learning the physics of MR techniques.",
    "Yes. Very thorough and in-depth introduction to a wide variety of MR applications. Very challenging and past-paced, though, if you have limited prior experience with the subject matter.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for other students\/faculty\/staff using MRI."
