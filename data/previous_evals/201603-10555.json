   "comments": [
    "Very regimented course. Effective teaching.",
    "The strengths of this course are: there is a strong emphasis on establishing good pronunciation; the course is designed so that students learn writing and reading at home and use class time for listening and speaking; there is a lot of homework that fosters a fuller grasp of material.",
    "The course was very intensive, yet still manageable. I think the course could be improved by the inclusion of more characters on the daily quiz (along with the continued emphasis on tones)",
    "The course has been clearly and expertly refined -- it is clear that the course has taken into consideration the experiences of past students. CHNS 110 is a wonderful course.",
    "Strengths: professors were very engaged, they cared about students learning and took their time to explain things that were not clear. The TA Sessions were a good idea Weaknesses: too intensive, the course became all about the grades rather than learning. A bit too fast. The TA Sessions were a bit disorganized. It would be a good idea to have a plan on what to with TA every week."

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend, only if you have about 2 solid hours to study on a daily basis. You will fall behind quickly if you do not keep up with daily studies. May vary from 1-3 hours depending on the day and how quickly you memorize. It's a very straightforward and effective class, as long as you put in the time. Very time consuming.",
    "I highly recommend this class because it establishes a good foundation upon which more Chinese studies can be built.",
    "The course was incredible! Great teachers who care about the students, along with a good environment to dive into the subject.",
    "Yes I recommend the class!",
    "TA Sessions could be more organized Class can be a bit less intensive regarding exams"
