   "comments": [
    "Great class, interesting structure to the semester with weekly memos based on the book\/week and a take home final. Prof is incredibly knowledgable about a huge variety of topics.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if the structure of the class changed. This year students gave a presentation on the book and another student discussed the connections in that book to other books we'd read, which meant that the class inevitably only engaged those students presenting and Kalyvas himself. It felt useless to read the books and write a one page memo about every week if it meant that I'd spend the whole 2 hour class pretty much just waiting to leave. Other than that, Kalyvas was absolutely stellar in his thoughts and discussions - whenever he spoke everyone hung on to his every word. He's brilliant and I would encourage anyone to take a class with him if they get a chance to.",
    "I do recommend it. TAKE IT IF YOU CAN. Many people are rejected because the class is really popular.",
    "Good class, you learn a lot through the books. I suggest it if you are wiling to read a book and write 400-500 words a week. Not too demanding, but a good marker of a liberal education.",
    "You kind of need to fight your way into this class, but I promise you, it'll be worth it. Professor Kalyvas is by far the most intelligent professor I have met and he really knows what he's talking about. You might think that a book a week is a lot, but you'll be surprised. It's actually quite manageable. And besides, I had the pleasant surprise of realizing that I could genuinely enjoy non-fiction books on political economics. This class will give you a great insight into global politics and also give you a great training on how to read books in general. You'll like the class. Trust me.",
    "There's no doubting that you learn a lot from this course. You read a ton, write a ton, and don't realize you're actually learning anything until you find yourself with an educated opinion about something during a spontaneous discussion or until you look back at your memos from the beginning of the semester and notice how much better your later ones are.That said, the course can be rather frustrating. He selects new books every time he teaches it (the books are all recently published), so check out the syllabus to see if you're interested. He basically picks books that he wants to read that semester and reads them along with you, week by week. It was rather hit or miss this year, but I hear the selection's been great in other years.One frustrating thing about the class was that it often turned into a game of \"Students, guess what brilliant thought just popped into my head,\" so if you get easily annoyed by professors who fish for answers, maybe this class isn't for you. His opinions are worthwhile though; he teaches you to think critically once he's done having fun watching students try to impress him by getting the right answer (no one ever does).You're going to take this class, you're going to want to hate both it and its professor, but you won't be able to help from loving both.Oh, and the take-home final is cruel.",
    "I learned a ton. I got frustrated at times, but ultimately feel like I gained a new way of thinking about things. If you're willing to put up with the lack of structure and engagement with Prof Kalyvas, you should be ok.",
    "I would recommend this class, but it's definitely not a deep one, since you read 12 very different, very complex books and are forced to connect them all.",
    "GREAT class! Just take it for an opportunity to get to know and to draw fromthe absolute flow of knowledge that is Professor Kalyvas.To be fair, I think I enjoyed his class on violence and civil strife **slightly\"\" more, but only because he was actually in his field of expertise, and the format of that class is just fantastic. But this course only trails behind by very little.",
    "Global Politics is basically a book club on current issues in global politics guided by one of the best professors at Yale. It's fantastic if you do the readings. (Fear the wrath of Professor Kalyvas if you don't do the readings.) I highly recommend this class."
