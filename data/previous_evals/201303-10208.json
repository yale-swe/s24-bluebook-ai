    "This class is like a mixture between sociology, philosophy, and film. We look at various forms of media and learn how they have effected society. We read many works by theorists on how media shapes humans and the world. A student interested in that sort of stuff would love this class. It is cool to see some of these theories, and even cooler when you analyze our current society and see how they fit together. However, the class can be quite confusing sometimes.",
    "This course is essential, it provides anyone who is interested in pursuing film (or any art form for that matter) a base with a necessary frame in which they can understand the role and importance of their craft within society. This is especially important today as artists strive to transcend these very roles and expand and contract the influence of various aspects of their craft today. An example of this is Conceptual Art, which was developed solely to question the established role of visual art in society and how this role can be used to more progressive ends.",
    "Prof. Casetti tends to lecture from the readings, which is boring if you've done them and still kind of boring if you haven't. Most media theory seems irrelevant to our current society, so I was not at all engaged by this class until the final, at which point I realized I had gotten something kind of interesting out of all the readings. It is worthwhile to do the weekly reading responses, otherwise you'll never make yourself read them.",
    "Film majors have to take this class, but otherwise I would probably tell a friend to steer clear of the class unless they were very interested in the underlying structures of communication and the technologies and media that are used in communication. Not my cup of tea, but not a bad class either.",
    "Theory of Media is a foundational theory course. As such, it isn't the most exciting or fascinating or easy to read stuff, but it's important if this is a field you plan to work in. Lectures canbe a little boring, but they are helpful, and the actual assignments are minimal and relatively easy. I wish the theory hadn't been so weighted towards early stuff -- it felt like a lot of the stuff we read was either made obvious or kind of invalidated by the internet, and nearly the first half of the course could be summed up with \"communication happens in multiple steps\", but there was some interesting stuff later on and it was never too much of a struggle. Glad I've read what I read, but I wish the course had made me more motivated to read more of it.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in this specific subject."
