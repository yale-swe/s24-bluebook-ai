    "YES!",
    "The second semester of literature has an incredible reading list. War and Peace is amazing! (seriously, start it over break, it pays off so well) This was professor Hagens's first year and he did have difficult showing the same level of command over the material that other professors have, but he's a lot of fun.",
    "A survey of literature, starting with Petrarch and ending with Borges. I would recommend it thoroughly, but it depends on what you expect out of it. It is wrong to expect a deep and thorough examination of any of the works. Instead, it is better to look as it as learning about the major works of the western canon, but more importantly learning how much more there is to learn.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS to a fellow student -- it is a rewarding experience that exposes you to a huge range of literature in the Western canon. It was well worth the time and effort, and I feel that I have emerged from the experience a better writer and a better thinker.",
    "A great overview of some really great books. You will be left wondering\/wanting more out of some (War and Peace, Don Quixote, and Proust can't really be done justice in the short amount of time that you spend on them) but I guess that's for more in-depth classes down the line. The lectures are great, and I definitely recommend going to them even though they're post-paper night. I would definitely recommend this class, it was probably my favorite this semester.",
    "Too much material. Get as much reading done for the class over breaks, during the semester it is simply too difficult to read all the material. This said, the books are classics. Must reads.",
    "Probably the weakest of the spring semester DS syllabi, but a lot of really good works that are worth reading. Hagens is warm, friendly, knowledgeable, and chill - doesn't run the best discussions though. Very easy grader.",
    "You will be lucky to have Hagens as a professor. He is, in one word, jovial. He is helpful both in discussion and in papers, and has a very good knowledge of the works and their contexts.",
    "Definitely. I greatly enjoyed the discussion sections, learned quite a lot in lecture, and was exposed to some wonderful literature."
