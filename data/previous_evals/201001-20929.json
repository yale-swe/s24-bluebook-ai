   "comments": [
    "Good intro course to learn about the various animal and plant models of development. Expect to do some background reading if you haven't taken development classes before, but this should not keep you away from the course.",
    "This course scratches the surface of a number of very specific topics in development. I would not recommend this course to anyone who has not previously had a developmental biology course.",
    "I would recommend anybody that are curious about dev biology to choose this class",
    "Recommend. General overview of development, though without an exam, nothing is committed to memory. Meeting with a faculty to write the final paper was great.",
    "I would recommend this course for any student interested in studying the molecular biology of development.",
    "Each lecture is a on a different major topic in developmental biology, and at the end of the week you get together to discuss a paper related to the lecture topic for that week. This discussion is a more useful aspect of the course. The article summaries can get tedious and the final proposal is good practice for writing proposals in general, but only focuses on one topic discussed during the course and requires a lot of background research.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in development, but have not had much experience with the topic and are not expecting to learn a huge amount of information. It is great for someone who wants to learn some of the exciting things going on in the field and would like to learn how to think about developmental problems and experiments.",
    "I would recommend it."

   "comments": [
    "While not necessarily directly helpful to what I am studying, I think it has and will continue to help me better understand broader literature of interest to my field because I have a better understanding of the various model systems.",
    "The course help us solidify my knowledge in developmental biology and will be helpful for my future research.",
    "Helpful.",
    "This course will contribute directly to my dissertation research, as developmental biology is the focus of my research.",
    "I still find development interesting, but at the moment my research isn't directly related.",
    "I learned some very specific areas of developmental biology. Because I do not feel that the subjects being taught were placed in a broader context, I do not think that this course will help me with my thesis research.",
    "This course gave me a good background for developmental mechanisms and problems. It was also good practice for reading papers and discussing them critically, which will be very important for my research and in my future discipline."
