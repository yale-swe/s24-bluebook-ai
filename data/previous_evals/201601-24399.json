    "This was probably the class with the toughest workload, and it always surprised me just how much time it took to complete each assignment. They are deceiving - they seem simple in writing, but in practice require a lot of complex thought and close attention. And for this reason, I valued the assignments very much. A class like this is useless without repeated application, and I experienced a lot of joy as I felt certain skills \"clicking\" throughout the course of completing each assignment. It's tough - and it should be.",
    "This course is rigorous, and it should be. Although I often complained when we had assignments due on non-class weeks, I was grateful for it because it forced me to return to the material every week and make sure I understood what we were learning."

   "comments": [
    "The one thing I'll say about organization is that deadlines are unclear in the syllabus. Pat always hands out a sheet at each class that details the deadlines, but it renders the syllabus mostly useless, as there are no specific deadlines on there, so there is no one resource one can use to project due dates far in advance. Other than that, the class followed a logical sequence, all the materials were readily available, and the format of instruction was varied enough to keep a topic interesting where it could easily become dry and tedious.",
    "The course is very well organized - the only reason I did not put \"excellent\" for mix of lectures\/projects\/discussion is because I would've liked to spend at least part of one class discussion looking at an organization that is unique in terms of its financial model, whether that be the non-profit arm to a for-profit company or a traveling group or something like that."

    "Pat kept a fast pace that was a challenge but never impossible. Since we only had 7 or 8 sessions with her, I'm glad that she was deliberate about covering as much ground in her time with us as possible. Perhaps most valuable are her in-depth comments she gives on each assignment. This is where I learned the most (particularly about my weaknesses), and it is not lost on me that it must take a lot of time for her to evaluate and respond to these assignments with such detail. It is appreciated!",

I would prefer to have Financial Management once a week as opposed to some of our other courses. If that would ever be possible, visitors would be great."

    "The final project, like the other assignments, was a struggle that was instructive and illuminating. At times, I will say that I wished I wasn't making decisions about a fake theater with fake numbers. Something to consider - would it be more valuable if we did the same project, but used the real-world theaters we had been studying all semester, so that we have more context to make some more realistic decisions? I'm not 100% convinced this is the best idea, but it's something to consider, I think."
