    "Reading philosophical works Thinking more clearly about human nature Writing short responses",
    "From this class, I gained further knowledge on how to analyze philosophy in relation to the issues that I am passionate about. I wish that we could have analyzed more radical philosophical thinkers than MLK and Simone de Beauvoir within our course. I felt that their inclusions were sort of tokenistic.",
    "I read several interesting political philosophy books that otherwise I would never have a chance to read. I learnt some political theories that are very fascinating.",
    "PLSC 114 allows for an expansion of knowledge in regards to Western Philosophical thought. There is a nice sampling of philosophers beginning with the classics such as Plato and ending in the 20th Century with Simone de Beauvoir and Hannah Arendt.",
    "survey course of all the dead white philosophers that make up the western Canon",
    "I took the course with WR credit. The weekly writing responses and the mini-essays really helped me develop my writing skills, especially in terms of organizing thoughts into a coherent structure. Also, reading classical works by famous authors like Hobbes, Tocqueville, and Nietzsche gave me a solid foundation on political philosophy (and the western canon in general).",
    "I definitely got a cursory view of political philosophy in the western tradition.",
    "A pretty good base in political philosophy, which is exactly what I wanted. A little disappointed we didn't read Machiavelli, but we really did a good job of covering major thinkers. I feel like I can think about and discuss politics through a useful new lens.",
    "I got a good survey of classic political philosophers and an opportunity to engage with their work and explore their ideas.",
    "Absolutely none at all. On the first day of the semester, Professor Garsten promised that this class would help its students see how to lead better lives a lofty goal. This course could not have come even 1\/100th of the way to answering that question.",
    "I had never taken a PLSC or PHIL course before so learned how to right that sort of paper.",
    "I definitely thought about political structure and norms and if they even make sense. I gained some knowledge of the specific political philosophies of the authors we read though mostly it was more about considerations of convention (e.g. democracy).",
    "I learned about life. This is an eye-opening course and Garsten will change your perspective.",
    "Thinking critically about important thinkers.",
    "I had never taken a philosophy course prior to taking this class, but I found that it was not only a great introduction to philosophy but also a great introduction to political science. I learned a great deal about the history of intellectual thought and felt that my world view was altered by the material that I read and heard in lecture.",
    "I learned a good amount about the Western philosophical canon. It was a very quick overview, but I now have a good deal of knowledge about roughly fifteen of the thinkers who have shaped the West.",
    "Learned how to write better in this class more than in any other class I have ever taken.",
    "Mostly analytical skills with the essay writing.",
    "I learned to think about many aspects of society in ways I never thought I would. It was amazing to view one aspect in so many ways, and I very much enjoyed this course. The essays did make me think a lot, and although they were a lot of work, I feel like I gained a lot from this course.",
    "I learned the basics of most political philosophy thought, as well as how to write a philosophy paper. I also really enjoyed this class because it set out mandatory time to just think on your own!",
    "I came into the class without any background in philosophy. The readings and lectures made me think about daily activities and situations differently, and I really enjoyed the course.",
    "This class gave me an introduction to political philosophy, a field in which I have never read many works. In addition, it helped to prepare me for courses with larg reading loads.",
    "A better understanding of different political views across the centuries.",
    "This course is an excellent survey of some of the most important thinkers since Socrates. The reading can be a bit much at times, but overall, if you take the non-WR course (as I did) the workload is pretty reasonable; the WR route might help you take more away from the course as a whole substantively, make you more prepared for the final, and improve your writing (and help split your grade up into more assignments), but my experience in non-WR was quite good.",
    "I learned a ton about many of the leading political theorists. My critical reading, thinking and writing improved greatly.",
    "I think that I greatly expanded my knowledge of basic political philosophy, and I expanded the way in which I perceive the world because of this class. I was exposed to many philosophies I had never encountered before and feel that this class gave me new lenses with which to approach the world.",
    "I learned about European philosophers who influenced politics and gained critical thinking and reading skills.",
    "I learned how to think critically about philosophical questions concerning how we should view. I also have developed the skills of close reading of dense texts, how synthesizing and organizing information into a structured paper.",
    "I have gained insights on the philisophical and classical method of thinking of basic questions such as the life worth living, inequality of conditions, limits of liberty and the role of laws and constitutions. The skills that the mini-essay for writing-intensive students are very useful, especially the counter-argument skill in the second mini-essay.",
    "I wanted to learn about political philosophy, and this was a great class for it! I also learned how to write an essay with an argument and counterargument.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge in this class, particularly about the books we read and famous theories from the Western Canon (such as Hobbes, Plato, Marx, etc.). Also, I learned about writing argumentative essays from the work in this course.",
    "This course gives you a good understanding of a variety of philosophies on how humans should live. It also diverges into additional issues like authority and gender relations.",
    "I learned about the thoughts and theories behind all of the famous philosophers' names you hear in academia. I learned a different way of analyzing and questioning thoughts.",
    "This course improved my analytical writing skills and provided me with the resources to examine difficult texts.",
    "I learned how to approach complex and difficult texts in an effort to glean insights into political philosophy. I also learned a lot about many famous political philosophers and their ideas, as well as how they have influenced contemporary political thought.",
    "I learned how to frame and approach the fundamental questions of political philosophy. I learned how to relate classic texts to one another and to the modern world. I learned how to become a more critical thinker and writer.",
    "This class was incredibly well taught in lecture. However, TA's make or break this class.",
    "I learned how to carefully analyze texts about political thought and apply these texts to modern society. I gained insights into the history of political thought and how previous thought has affected society today.",
    "Understanding of key political theories and texts.",
    "I learned about philosophers from a wide time period and learned how to apply the information to different trains of thought.",
    "By taking this course, I learned how to take different primary texts and critically analyze and think about them through different philosophers' ideologies. Also, by taking it writing intensive, I learned a lot about how to construct papers that dealt with using textual analysis, answering counterarguments to my positions, and connecting our thoughts to real-world issues. Coming into this course, I had never taken a philosophy course before and it was very interesting to read texts from philosophers that I had heard of and some that I had not. Especially, I enjoyed analyzing how these philosophers' thoughts are reflected in modern politics or society.",
    "I feel like i have a general understanding and ability to discuss prominent western philosophers. Additionally I feel comfortable connecting the principles I learned to modern political thought.",
    "I improved my ability to read and analyze dense texts. I also learned the basic ideas of western philosophy. I have a better understanding of the nature of humanity.",
    "I did the writing credit for the course-- it really helped with my writing, especially as a freshmen -- i definitely recommend!",
    "I learned about a broad array of philosophers and was exposed to many fascinating ideas. I learned to distinguish the finer points between philosophers and come up with my own ideas using the texts for support.",
    "Different ways to view the world, challenges to my fundamental assumptions, and an excellent introduction to the wild world of political philosophy.",
    "I gained a strong introduction to the field of political science and developed the technical skills to write a philosophy paper.",
    "Survey of basic political philosophy",
    "A great outline of the major works of philoaophy that have influenced the systems of authority that we use today.",
    "I enjoyed comparing a variety of political philosophies from different times across history and learned how to analyze them.",
    "I became better at debating and proving my arguments.",
    "My reading analysis and deep thinking were developed by this course. Prof. Garsten also helped students gain an extensive knowledge of how to read core texts in the Western philosophical canon in this excellent course.",
    "I developed greater critical thinking and writing skills through considering the political philosophy questions prompted by this course.",
    "Critical thinking, writing and discussing political ideas and how they relate to our society.",
    "I developed a much more thorough understanding of the roots of contemporary political theory. I now am familiar with classic philosophers and their tenets to a much greater extent and have been able to make more interdisciplinary connections between ethics, morality, and politics.",
    "A new depth of understanding of a variety of ideas about philosophy.",
    "I developed the ability to think about philosophical texts and analyze them more profoundly. I developed my writing a lot as well.",
    "I gained a basic understanding of the thoughts of major political philosophers throughout history.",
    "Reading",
    "I had to learn how to read very quickly because there is a lot of reading assignment for this class. And all of them are relevant to the final.",
    "I learned about different ways to interpret texts and how to take charge of my own opinions and critique the work.",
    "I learned a basic knowledge of major philosophical writers. I also learned how to quickly read difficult texts.",
    "I feel like I improved my writing skills through the essays, and the feedback from the TA, as well as gained a deeper knowledge of the long tradition of thought underlying many of the most pertinent political and social questions today.",
    "This course developed my thought on a broad array of political thinkers and my ability to write intelligently about them. More importantly, however, Professor Garsten changed the way I *think* about them, and has changed how I will read works involving philosophy and politics for the foreseeable future.",
    "This course was my first philosophy course and it introduced me to thinking more broadly and more openly. I gained the insight that there is not always a clear, right or wrong answer.",
    "Learnt philosophy from old dead white guys everyone talks about. Helps understand and even participate in conversations that keep mentioning them e.g. Kant, Plato, Mills etc.",
    "I learned a huge amount from this class, it taught me a lot about how to deeply think about issues.",
    "I had the opportunity to learn and read about many famous political philosophers and the issuesthey thought about.",
    "Unferstanding or a fair portion of the Western Canon. An effort is made to diversify the curriculum - two women were on the syllabus this year - but mostly take this course if you want to read some old white men who had some interesting things to say about philosophy.",
    "I learned about many major thinkers of political philosophy like Mill and Tocqueville. I also learned to interpret texts in different ways and derive different implications for our time from them.",
    "This course is truly thought provoking in its instruction on human nature and society. Really a very compelling and valuable course, I got a lot out of it. It acts to make each student more aware of his or her relationship with the world.",
    "Time management",
    "I read classics of political philosophy, and I now feel confident discussing various philosophical theories of politics. I learned how to write a philosophy paper."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The readings for the course were a little long at times. I feel that the students would absorb more information if the readings were more concentrated towards the concepts that we are focusing most closely on.",
    "This class is really great. The lectures are very interesting and engaging. The discussion sections are absolutely fascinating.",
    "If you are in the writing intensive section, I would say that this course falls short in that it doesn't necessarily help you become a better writer. You're not really taught how to improve your writing-- instead most of your evaluations come from the quality of your argument (how true it is based on the text that's being analyzed. In general, there are a lot of texts that we cover and simply not enough time to get through it all. Many of the lectures provide a very general overview of some of the key points of the text and even in section we're not really able to reach a deep conversation about the text. This could be because of the introductory nature of the class-- there are some political philosophy classes that study one text in- depth in seminar fashion so there are courses that take a deeper look into these texts.",
    "Strengths are the lectures. Weaknesses are the length and speed of the readings.",
    "The writing responses and the mini-essays are very helpful, despite the fact that they are a lot of work. Also the TFs are very helpful. Of course, Prof. Garsten's lectures are world-class and is what makes the course great. However, I had some people in my section who would not listen to others' opinions, so I did not find sections very helpful. Also, sometimes it felt that the readings were very superficial and quick. I wish we could have spent some more time on the Second Sex and Nietzsche. I know there is a time crunch, but I really think it is essential to spend two lectures on each text, not one.",
    "The two paper, 1 exam structure doesn't promote too much interaction with the class. I'd prefer having weekly reading quizzes in section.",
    "The strengths are the quality of Garsten's lectures and the good selection of course readings. The weaknesses were the lack of discussion about actual politics. The course description claimed that we would discuss how the thinkers relate to current politics, which we almost never did. I recognize that there is a lot to cover, but doing this more would have been great; the few times it happened were really interesting. Also, sometimes the reading assignments were too much. It would be good for them to be toned down so that people will actually do them.",
    "This class was a solid addition to my freshman fall. Garsten is an intelligent lecturer, and the texts are exciting to read. I definitely felt like I was grappling with compelling, challenging material many times throughout the semester. I took the non-WR credit version of this course--I highly recommend you do the same. It seemed to me that the WR sections required a lot more work with not that much more reward. Although Garsten is a good lecturer, this is the sort of class you can skip, get someone else's notes, and not miss much. It's nice to have that forgiving quality in a class, especially your first year. The two essays were fun to write, but they required a lot of time if you wanted a high grade. For the first essay, my TF graded 36 and only gave 3 A's. The final was similar--2 in-class essays and an ID section. If you're able to make a lot of time to study, the format forces you to reengage with the texts and synthesize the material. I sometimes forget all the material 2 days after the test--not so here. The review session I attended was the particularly unhelpful--I felt quite thankful neither of the TFs running it were mine.",
    "The readings at times drift away from explicitly political philosophy and into more general philosophy (how to live). Some of the syllabus choices are a little strange. Locke, Machiavelli, Montesquieu were not read.",
    "Professor Garsten's lecture are great! My only comment would be that a 40% final seems a bit steep for this type of class. Also the grading scale seemed rather arbitrary. Talking with my TF after, it wasn't really clear why I got the grade I got and which aspects I should focus on in improving for my next paper, which seems like an important thing to foster growth.",
    "More balance between conservative and liberal thinkers.",
    "I've now taken both PLSC 114 and 118 (which are effectively the same class and someone should have stopped me - for pete's sake), so I'm going to use that lens to explain my thoughts. I felt like a got a much better understanding of the stakes of political philosophy in 118 rather than this class - we were asked less about our own ideas (referencing the texts we've read) and more to explain the texts. Considering that political philosophy as a field almost died in the 60s because students were only asked to trace historical threads and weren't asked to contribute anything, its a little annoying to take a class that mostly asked us to explain other's thoughts. Maybe its because I don't have enough understanding of Socratic philosophy, but spending 3 weeks with the Apology, Crito, and Gorgias felt like such a waste of class time - we get it: ask questions to make people self-reflect. Talking about Socrates for so long meant that we didn't get to talk about utilitarians that much which is undoubtedly a train of philosophy that dominates a lot of modern political talk. Mill is a bad utilitarian, so using him to understand that logic leaves students lacking important understanding. In both intro political philosophy classes, Hannah Arendt got the short end of the stick - we end the course talking about her thoughts about power and violence. Why not do that earlier in the course so the stakes of politics (state force and a monopoly on violence) are clear all the way throughout? I know her work references others', but those small slivers of references are not enough to limit your understanding of Arendt - they make you want to realize the depths of knowledge and understanding in political philosophy. Professor Garsten and the TA squad are a great group of educators - this syllabus felt like it was squashing how good they could be.",
    "Strengths: Garsten gave good lectures on the materials he knew best. Weakness: TAs were horrible. Survey style of the course bred low engagement with each text. Texts were not related to one another. Garsten did not give consistent or good lectures on all books. Course did not focus on \"political\" philosophy, but rather general philosophy. I cannot say one positive thing about this class.",
    "I did not love section, waste of time, not very helpful. Lectures were generally great, and I enjoyed reading thinkers that I had never really read before, but had always heard of. Comparing this syllabus to DS, however, I felt like we did not cover nearly as much though. Obviously DS is a different animal in terms of workload, but would've been nice to do a little more maybe.",
    "At its best this course involved thought-provoking lectures and engaging debates in section on issues of policy and philosophy. This course was often a slog, as reading two books a week meant not really getting a good understanding of any of them, and a lot of time spent trying to move from page to page. It would no doubt be a much stronger course if it included about half the books and looked at them with greater depth.",
    "The reading is directly related to the lectures which is very helpful if you don't understand entirely the reading material. It's a lot of reading, but it's necessary and you don't necessarily need to do it all.",
    "Too much content, too little time.",
    "I thought that the reading was all very interesting and relevant, and lectures were fascinating. I also loved my discussion section and found that the essays and responses were helpful in processing the material and giving me license to interpret the material on my own. I loved this class.",
    "This course had excellent lectures, and I found my section very informative and productive. It might have been nice to have lecture slides for review, and I found that with all of the reading, it was difficult to stay engaged with everything (given that I felt comfortable on the final without having done even 50% of the reading for the course). I don't know what the solution to this is, because the course was more than enough work as it was, and I think adding more work would negatively impact the experience and enrollment of the course, and as it was, I did not feel I had enough time to truly engage with the mini-essays on the level that I wanted to in order to give my best work. One thing to note is that I took it writing intensive, and while this helped to motivate me to engage more with the course, I feel that I would've had a tough time being successful if I were not already a decent writer. Therefore, if this course is to be offered for WR credit, it might serve people well to spend more time on the writing piece of the course. My writing did improve, I think, but had I been someone who was not as comfortable with writing going in, I would definitely wanted to have taken an intro ENGL class first to have any chance of success in this course. I haven't seen my grade yet, so I don't know if I got an A or an A- (I was hovering on the border), but if I get an A-, based on the level of work I put into this course compared to all of the others I know I've gotten A's in, then I might hazard the suggestion that the grading on this course is just a bit on the strict side. That being said, it was certainly motivation to do better on each successive paper when I did not get the grade I wanted on the previous one.",
    "Too much focus on Democracy. Too fond of democracy.",
    "It's an absolutely wonderful class. Prof. Garsten is truly incredible -- I think he teaches the best version of this sort of intro to philosophy class I can imagine. I also think he has structured the class amazingly. For non-writing credit, you do two papers (with very interesting questions) and outline potential essays for the final. Prof. Garsten is on to something really brilliant with this final structure -- I felt that I learned much more preparing for the potential exam questions than I had in the past, feeling paranoid that I was reviewing the wrong topics, and that I would have nothing to write for the essay questions. But with this method, I could focus back on the problems and thinkers that interested me the most, and my studying was much lower stress :). I only have one recommendation. the TA lecture was truly terrible. I really regret that we never had a Prof. Garsten lecture on the Federalist Papers. If a TA has to give a lecture to help him practice, can it be in the evening for extra credit?",
    "Strengths: good lectures, good reading material. Weaknesses: writing intensive sections were a lot of work, pace was quite fast, not enough time to really delve into the juicy material",
    "The pace of the lectures were good and engaging, however I found it hard to keep up with the reading, so in the future it may benefit students to cut down on the number of works we read.",
    "I think that this course could benefit from being less centered around the large lecture environment. I gained quite a bit more insight into the subject during section than during the lectures, so I think that allowing for section to meet more would be very helpful.",
    "The readings were outstanding. I ended up rereading (and in some cases reading for the first time) all of the course material the week before the exam, and it was awesome. The pieces tied in well to each other, and I liked all of them. The lectures, however, I found to be less great. Oftentimes, I felt that the direction of analysis in lecture was difficult to put together straight from reading, and I would have appreciated more of a walkthrough (at least in the beginning) in how to analyze texts as in-depth as Prof. Garsten does. Overall, great readings and okay lectures.",
    "Strengths: This class is crucial for a student interested in the philosophical side of politics. This class covers well the metaphysical and moral \"whys\" of politics. Weaknesses: It seems that this class has trouble relating the ideas of these pre-modern thinkers to contemporary problems.",
    "Strengths: for a course that was supposed to span a large time period, great choice in books weaknesses: lecture was hard to follow because it was so unstructured; the course didn't seem as relevant as I think it could have... I would have been more interested if it connected the texts and ideas we were reading and discussing to current events more. also would have appreciated a more indepth background on the authors themselves.",
    "The strength is in the writing sections because it forces you to actually read the materiall. The ,arterial is also very interesting.",
    "I appreciated the lectures very much and loved how clear even the most complex philosophies were made by the professor. I have no complaints about the course, I found it to be a highly rewarding class.",
    "There is a lot of reading in the class which can be hard to keep up on, especially since you are expected to discuss the significance of the text in class. Overall, the lectures are very interesting, the class goes by quickly, and the professor typically summarizes major themes in each reading, so it's easy to get by in the class without doing all the work. However, you do need to read the majority of it to do well on the tests and essays.",
    "The lectures were absolutely fantastic. I found the selection of texts to each be very different yet interesting, and I think that Professor Garsten provides so many profound insights into what we read that the class is truly thought-provoking. Things could have been improved on the section level of the course - I found that often times, our conversations were not necessarily in sync with the dialogue during lectures.",
    "Weaknesses: - The course is not titled: intro to western political philosophy. It is addressing political philosophy as a whole. I personally thought very detached from the text because I do not come from this world, especially when we were dealing with texts such as the federalist papers and democracy in America. I believe that Yale's position as one of the greatest universities in the world entitles it to have more inclusive courses to other philosophies outside the western world. - Although this is an intro class, people who have never taken philosophy before find this class really challenging. This is because the ideas that we deal with in the class are not at the intro level in my opinion. I found myself in need to come back to other texts in order to understand terms used by others. This was especially true when we read Kant's essay \"To perpetual peace\"",
    "This is an excellent course. The reading isn't overbearing if you split it throughout the week, but you definitely don't want to cram for the identifications in the final (which were reasonable). One weakness is that the last 5 minute of class are always wasted because questions are taken at the end of class, while people are packing up. It's hard to solve this problem, but often the questions are too particular to foster a discussion, or do not relate to the concepts we must understand. Perhaps skip questions at the end, and have people come up to the professor after class? In the grand scheme of things, it's smallI think this was a great course, and I got a great introduction to a field I was interested in.",
    "Great professor, great curriculum, great TFs, overall just a great course. I would have liked if the final didn't count for so much of our gradeperhaps another essay during the semester instead of a 40% final weight?",
    "This courses has great lectures and important readings. The tough part\/\"weakness\" of this course is the tough long readings some weeks.",
    "The lectures in this course are very intriguing, and they are what convinced me to enroll in the beginning of the semester. However, the readings are very time consuming. Even the shortened assignments (where we didn't have to read the entire book) were difficult to finish, because we rarely had time to discuss 1\/4 of the material that was in the reading. Reading 1-2 books per week gave us breadth but very little depth.",
    "In the regular course, it was difficult to motivate myself to do the reading because the course was possible without readings but would have been much more rewarding had I done the readings. Maybe more papers or some sort of reading check would help people stay on track.",
    "The broad nature of the material covered by the course is both a strength and weakness.",
    "The non-writing sections did not receive much guidance at all on how to write a political philosophy paper, leaving me floundering a bit to write something that my TF would judge as good. This was true despite my reaching out for assistance, and by the end of the class I still do not feel that I can write a strong paper in this subject. The lectures were well organized and gave insights that were not readily apparent in the readings, which made them interesting and enjoyable to attend. Professor Garsten was great at keeping you engaged, though occasionally his line of reasoning would become obscured, making the rest of the lecture difficult to follow. Section offered almost no insight into the readings.",
    "The lectures were very interesting and made it much easier to understand the texts. While I always enjoyed section, I sometimes wish that the section discussion related more directly to what was talked about in lecture, and also spent more time drawing out connections between the texts.",
    "Strength: Lectures. Weaknesses: TA's. Materials were far too dense without enough time to fully dissect them. Furthermore, grading was arbitrary.",
    "This course did a good job of giving students a broad overview of the field and allowing students to engage with the texts. The course could be improved by receiving more thorough feedback on reading responses so that expectations are clearly provided.",
    "Fascinating lectures and readings.",
    "I thought the main strength of the class was the weekly lectures by professor Garsten. I thought a weakness was the lack of structure of the sections, and I think that could be improved by setting a clear agenda before each section.",
    "I thought the selections for this course were especially well chosen and gave a good chronological procession from Socrates\/Plato to Hannah Arendt at the end of the course. Additionally, I felt that taking it writing intensive especially helped me understand the text better through the weekly responses. As for weaknesses, I felt that sometimes there was a lot to go over for some texts but there was not enough time for them. Especially towards the end, with Beauvoir and Arendt, I wish there were more lectures devoted towards these thinkers.",
    "This course could be improves by providing more opportunity for assessment. I also would appreciate if there were less Plato on the syllabus and slightly more diversity. I think the number of readings was managable and appropriate.",
    "I think the reading is a little heavy. If it was more reasonable, I think it is more likely that all the students will do it. This will then increase everyone's engagement with the course. Otherwise, the lectures and sections were amazing and I enjoyed the essay and final.",
    "The course had a lot of writing assignments -- which allowed me to think through the readings and lectures but was also a lot of work",
    "Strengths: good introduction to philosophy, moderately helpful discussion sections, interesting lectures, reading materials and essay topics Weaknesses: moderately low level of effective assistance for writing essays",
    "The strength of the class is that it is able to offer students an introduction to the world of political philosophy focusing on a set of themes that is represented by the selection of different offers. Prof. Garsten's lectures were very engaging. I think sections could focus more on how different authors and works relate to each other.",
    "The coursework is great and really interesting, and Garsten is a great professor.",
    "I'd like more time to discuss the works. We went very quickly, and section didn't always allow for a full-blown discussion.",
    "This course's lectures and readings were excellent! I would add that the grading across TFs was very arbitrary.",
    "The course material and reading list is incredibly interesting but the graded workload for regular students can be constraining.",
    "The strengths of this class are the by far the quality of lectures. The lectures are extremely fascinating and had me questioning my own understanding of human nature. The readings are also very engaging and fascinating. I would have liked for Professor Garsten to give us more time at the end of lectures to pose challenges to the material and his own infused opinions of it.",
    "The course was interesting, however I think that inconsistencies with the teaching fellows hampered it overall. I feel as though the professor had no impact on students, instead leaving most of the important stuff to the teaching fellows. In addition, the essays and finals did not depend on listening in class, just the readings.",
    "Lot of reading. TA's weren't that helpful. Took too long to get back grades.",
    "A weakness of this course was just lack of time to discuss all of the texts during section, but the biggest strength was how everything came together in the end and the ability to compare and contrast the authors.",
    "The strength of this course is that you get to read a bunch of major philosophical writers, and that you get to hear an expert in political philosophy speak about the texts. The other strength of the course is having a good TA who can facilitate discussions. The main weakness of the course is the speed and breadth. Although I understand this is a survey class, I do think Professor Garsten could have chosen more poignant readings. I wasn't able to complete all of them, and I wish I could have at least read the most poignant parts of each writer. Obviously it isn't ideal to only read a little bit of each writer, but I don't think it was very feasible to read all the readings assigned unless we devoted an insane amount of time to the course.",
    "The course and lectures are helpful for a rapid overview of many important texts, but the pace and the lack of depth of engagement in many of the texts meant I felt like I lacked a deeper understanding of some of the texts. I think it would also help to more explicitly (perhaps in lecture or section) to tie together the themes of the various works.",
    "Professor Garsten always brought insightful analysis and enlightening perspectives on each and every thinker in the syllabus. He was the course's greatest strength and its most important positive element. With that said, the syllabus left something to be desired. After a treatment of Plato, we skipped directly to the predominant thinkers of liberalism and the Enlightenment without being given any idea what those thinkers were reacting against. Hobbes, Rousseau, Mill, Kant, Arendt, and Publius are all incredible thinkers more intelligent than I can ever hope to be. However, my perspective on them was incomplete without anything to pit them against, save two Marxists. Tocqueville, in Democracy in America, perhaps came closest to offering an alternative to liberalism within the syllabus when he wrote about the hierarchical order of the Old World--but even then, he mostly spoke about how the new equality-focused form of government he saw in the New World would eventually sweep it away. It would have been nice to see that system, or at least its basic underpinnings and tenets, given some voice. Where was Aristotle's Politics? Failing that, give me some excerpts from Augustine, a splash of Thomism and ruminations on just war, snippets from De Maistre to contrast with the monochrome parade of liberal thinkers. Even some Burke or Oakeshotte would have been nice. I'm not concerned that the course wasn't fair. Far less am I complaining about bias towards liberalism; liberalism is pretty great, in my opinion. If the course were simply an exploration of the liberal tradition, that would be completely fine with me. But even such a course would be better served by considering what liberalism is opposed to, where the boundaries of the tradition are, and what constitutes it. The syllabus of this course offered many thinkers, but aside from Plato's dense and difficult dialogues, there was no principled defense of moral authority, no reflection on the moral and political dangers of freedom. Liberalism \"enlightened\" by seeking to shatter those reactionary notions, and students of this course would be left with a better perspective on that intellectual tradition, and the scope of political thought more generally, if they were confronted with a more intellectually diverse syllabus.",
    "Lecture and the professor are amazing. TAs could give better feedback on exams and essays and papers.",
    "I think the readings were very good for this class but little opportunity was given to being able to truly delve into the topics presented in the course.",
    "I loved the class,the teaching was engaging, section was fascinating, and it was generally very good.",
    "Strengths: Professor Garsten and the books. Professor Garsten is a consummate lecturer. Insightful, easy to take, and just a nice guy. It's really a privilege to listen to him talk for 55 minutes. The course also benefits from a great syllabus which should be of interest to any with an interest in philosophy and Western thought.",
    "The course gives students a great overview of nearly all major political philosophy thinkers but it moves quite fast and we often don't get a chance to fully explore each work in depth. I think we should have read Plato's republic, if only because the professor mentioned it so much. But I understand that we can never cover everything in 12 short weeks.",
    "I think the course would be better if a little less reading were assigned, as at one point we had one week to read 23 chapters from de Tocquevilles Democracy in America. This becomes a race to finish the text instead of a valuable reading experience.",
    "The course has many great readings. It is very hard to engage in though",
    "Strengths: Quality of material; what we're learning feels intentional, the ideas we're exposed to are eye-opening. Lectures are great; elucidating. Weaknesses: The class lacks cohesion. Texts do not seem related beyond the premise that they are political by nature. Some effort to understand where these ideas fit together in a larger sense would have been helpful.",
    "I often felt that the course would work well as a seminar; I wished I could discuss concepts in-depth for a longer period than just a weekly section. The weekly writing responses were useful, but I wished that they had been counted toward the grade because I put a large amount of effort into them. Grading was unnecessarily harsh and arbitrary, in my opinion. Many students in this class were freshmen who had never written a college essay, and most more had never encountered philosophy before. I would be more inclined to continue with this course of study had I felt more confident in my ability to earn grades reflective of the effort I put into the class. The amount of reading assigned was often too great to digest fully. Lectures were interesting and engaging, and section discussion was typically thoughtful and enjoyable. I did not feel that the writing section improved my writing very much."

    "Yes it was amazing, very educational and applicable to how I think about everyday issues",
    "All students who are interested in politics and western history should take it. I love all the books that we have read in this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to get a good introduction to Political Philosophy, however I would not recommend the writing intensive section. Don't take this class for a WR credit, take English or something where you'll get profound feedback on how to improve your writing. Also the grades seem to be deflated for writing- intensive students.",
    "I would recommend this course. The readings are a bit much but they are engaging and worthwhile. I took the class Credit\/D, which made the whole things more manageable.",
    "No, it was not very engaging or interesting. Section was not very helpful to understanding course material.",
    "Keep up with the readings and make sure you have a decent TF",
    "Be prepared to do anywhere between 100 to 250 pages of dense philosophy reading every week. I would not recommend this class to anyone who doesn't like reading, and especially anyone who is not interested in politics or philosophy. This is not a gut class. But you do end up learning a lot, and some of the texts really change the way you think. If you're going to take this class, then take it with WR credit. Although taking it with WR is so much work, you're not going to get much out of it if you take it without WR. People say that this class is a watered-down version of DS Philosophy, so if you were considering DS but didn't actually go for it, I'd recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend it. The material is interesting and Garsten is a great lecturer.",
    "This class was a solid addition to my freshman fall. Garsten is an intelligent lecturer, and the texts are exciting to read. I definitely felt like I was grappling with compelling, challenging material many times throughout the semester. I took the non-WR credit version of this course--I highly recommend you do the same. It seemed to me that the WR sections required a lot more work with not that much more reward. Although Garsten is a good lecturer, this is the sort of class you can skip, get someone else's notes, and not miss much. It's nice to have that forgiving quality in a class, especially your first year. The two essays were fun to write, but they required a lot of time if you wanted a high grade. For the first essay, my TF graded 36 and only gave 3 A's. The final was similar--2 in-class essays and an ID section. If you're able to make a lot of time to study, the format forces you to reengage with the texts and synthesize the material. I sometimes forget all the material 2 days after the test--not so here. Take the class if you're interested in politics, philosophy, or aren't taking D.S. and want a \"lite\" version.",
    "A good class if you want to get a chance to read some of the great thinkers of Western philosophy. Professor Garsten's lectures range from very good to brilliant, and the thinkers themselves and their works are utterly fascinating. This course definitely gave me a lot of food for thought that I'll be chewing on for a long time to come.",
    "Yes, this is a great crash course for anyone who wants to dip into political philosophy but feels worried about the content's difficulty. I consider this class to be Directed Studies-lite.",
    "Take it if your interested in political philosophy! Professor Garsten really is an amazing lecture, and it's a pleasure just listen to him speak. The readings are all very important and do a great job of providing a wide range of different authors and schools of thoughts. The assignments and finals are my only complaint, as the essays were graded a bit subjectively and the final is worth 40% of your grade, which is really steep for a philosophy-esque class where deep thought, not quick writing, should be stressed.",
    "No.",
    "If you want to actually think about your own politics given the texts as references - take PLSC 118 in the spring. If you like regurgitating what dead people said, take this course.",
    "I would not. Even if you are interested in political philosophy, do not take this class. It is designed only to help kids who want to major in EPE.",
    "I took it without the WR credit, which was very chill. Would recommend with a good lecturer like Garsten.",
    "Yesbut with reservation. It is definitely thought provoking and can be engaging. But be forewarned you will fly through the best stuff and may be left feeling unsatisfied and frustrated as you are confronted with yet another book to read while you are still wrestling with all the ideas from the one you read two days ago.",
    "I think everyone should take this course or a course like it. It is amazing how old books can apply so much to the present political situation. Garsten's lectures will stay on your mind for the entire day as you contemplate the topics of readings. Really amazing class.",
    "Yes, but the amount of reading makes it feel less like an introduction course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to all students. I felt that it widened my view of the world and was a great introduction to a subject that I previously thought was irrelevant and uninteresting.",
    "This course is appropriately dubbed \"Mini-DS.\" You get an introduction to a lot of thinkers, and it's a lot of reading. Upwards of 100 pages\/week near the end of the course. So be prepared for that. The final isn't that hard even if you didn't do all the reading; the quote identifications are obvious enough that if you've been paying attention in class (the lectures are very good, but you need to be prepared to take good notes and to come to the lectures, because if you don't you're losing your main lifeline in the course), paying attention in section (I had an excellent section leader, Umur), and going to the review sessions before the final, you should do just fine. I want to mention that I took this WR-intensive. This had positives and negatives. The positives are that it did, somewhat, improve my writing, and that it made me engage a lot more with the thinkers than those who only had to write two papers on one to two thinkers each. This also made me feel more comfortable for the final. The downside was that with all of the other things I was doing this semester, plus all of the reading for this course (of which I did very little), it made me have to rush on the papers and not give them my best effort (unless I wanted this course to dominate my life). So, I'm not sure I would recommend WR-intensive if you're looking at a busy semester. Also, I would **STRONGLY** recommend against WR-intensive if you do not feel comfortable with your writing skills going in. This is not a course where you learn how to write, this is one where you think you write decently, get bad grades, and then by the end of the course write a bit better. It's a decent challenge to do it, and I only recommend it if you're confident in your writing and want to spend the time engaging with these thinkers. Be prepared to get knocked down a bit: nobody in my section got higher than a B+ on the first mini-essay. Even if you aren't a political philosophy fan, this class will feel rewarding when you finish it. But make sure you know what you're signing up for. Worst case, this course shows you why the only \"A\" that matters is between the Y and the L.",
    "Yes. Hard but super useful. You will learn how to write better no matter what.",
    "Yes! Prof. Garsten's lectures are so beautiful -- he's brilliant and an incredibly talented speaker. He strings the texts together in a really interesting way, and also touches on modern relevance at a good number of points. I would just recommend skipping the TA lecture.",
    "I would recommend it - it's a survey of some of the most influential works in political philosophy; the readings (mostly) are really interesting.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It was a good overview of political philosophy in general and I felt like I learned a lot in questioning and analyzing many important aspects of society through reading and talking about the important texts. If you take writing intensive, it will be quite a bit of work. However, I felt like I learned a lot from the writing responses and essays, and it was generally nicely spaced out. Lectures were usually monotonous, but still stimulating.",
    "I highly recommend this course if you have any interest in political philosophy or philosophy in general. Professor Garsten explained big ideas in manageable terms and the lectures were engaging the entire semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking to learn more about the philosophy aspect of politics, and is interested in reading the classic works associated with that area. I would describe this course as \"Directed studies lite.\"",
    "I would recommend this course to someone truly interested in learning about philosophy. I wouldn't recommend it for someone looking for an easy writing credit (which I admit to having done), but it was a great intro to philosophy. I DEFINITELY recommend taking the writing intensive sections for this class. For me, I don't think I would have picked up a single book until the very end if I hadn't been held to the reading responses and papers. Writing intensive section was a great way to hold myself to keeping up with the class.",
    "No, not unless they are very interested in philosophy and already have a background on the authors we are reading.",
    "Definitely! But read all the readings!!",
    "Definitely!! These philosophers changed the way I analyze the world around me.",
    "I took this as a senior with a fair amount of experience in philosophy but no coursework. From that perspective, it is pretty much a gut. The authors are all the ones you would have heard about already anyways, and you don't go into much more depth than you would in the YPU. I'm not sure what all the hype about Professor Garsten is, but then again, he is the only Poli Sci professor I've ever had, so maybe he does stand out from the department.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. This class covers a wide range of philosophical perspectives and every philosophy discussed in the class is excellently explained by the professor in his lectures.",
    "Definitely recommend this course. If you're hoping for hardcore philosophy this is probably not the course for you (the philosophy department political philosophy course probably aligns more closely with your interest). THAT SAID, I still recommend this political philosophy course because Bryan Garsten is so damn good. Very likely the best lecturer I've had at Yale. Although I might have preferred a more rigorous philosophical focus, Garsten's teaching more than made up for any disappointment I might have felt.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student interested in philosophy, but not to a student interested in politics. If someone is interested in discussing authority, human nature, justice, then take the class. If you're wanting to discuss political institutions and current affairs, stay away. There is little to no discussion about the political implications of each reading, and almost no discussion of current political issues. The closest you get to discussing politics is talking about Socrates' experiences with Athenian government, or the pros and cons of democracy. All abstract ideas, little discussion of how it affects modern society. I also felt the reading selection was a bit narrow, mostly white males with the exception of two female authors at the end of the term.",
    "Even if you think you aren't interested in topics of philosophy and political science, this class is still definitely worth taking! Professor Garsten is a wonderful lecturer and a brilliant guy - he chose really interesting texts for us to read and provided really profound insights into each of them.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, but only when they have previous background in philosophy, or when they are not in their Freshman Fall.",
    "Yes. Great WR credit",
    "In every course, there are some lectures that are stunningly good. In this course, every single lecture is incredible. I actually looked forward to lecture, section, and readings every week. The writers the course covers are classics and it was good to be exposed to them. The grading for papers is pretty tough, but if you're engaged with the material you should have no problem.",
    "Take it! A must-take at Yale.",
    "You will learn so much in this class if you want to learn about political theory.",
    "I would recommend this class with anyone. It got me more interested in philosophy than I anticipated and now I find myself drawing off of ideas I learned from this class often.",
    "This class had great lectures and interesting assigned texts. I definitely enjoyed the class but wished I did more of the reading. I took the class non-WR and had a hard time getting the grade I wanted on papers because I had so few opportunities to get feedback. I say take the class, but find some way to incentivize yourself to do the reading (maybe that means taking it for a writing credit) and meet with your TA ahead of time for essays. The regular section was also significantly less insightful than the WR sections (I sat in on one) because few people had done the reading.",
    "I would recommend this course because it provides a good baseline to analyze political rhetoric.",
    "Take this class if you want a good introduction to political philosophy. Professor Garsten is a good lecturer, and he provides a strong set of readings that expose you to a wide array of political viewpoints that form the foundation of contemporary western thought. If you have the choice, take the writing section, as the non-writing section did not provide sufficient support for proper understanding of the material, and I feel like I would have gotten much more out of the class if I had been required to write about each week's readings.",
    "Definitely! Professor Garsten is amazing, and makes political philosophy approachable and interesting. It is so important to go back to the basics and question our assumptions about politics, society, and life.",
    "No. Don't take this class unless you absolutely want to learn political philosophy, and read texts that are mostly devoid of diversity. TA's make or break your experience. My TA was terrible, but Professor Garsten was a fantastic lecturer.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Too much reading and not enough graded work to make up for one not great grade. Way too harshly graded for an intro class--and watch out for people in section who are beyond obnoxious!",
    "This course provides a good amount of reading in political philosophy to give the fundamentals of the topic. I would recommend if interested in the topic and in the readings in general.",
    "Excellent lectures and a solid foundation in political theory.",
    "I would recommend the class to others because the content was extremely interesting.",
    "Take it if you actually want to learn about political philosophy. Sometimes the material feels distant, but Garsten is a good lecturer. I think the course depends alot on your TA.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. Even though I had not had much exposure to philosophy before, I found this class to be a good introduction towards some major thinkers and ideologies and how these thoughts apply to politics and our structure of government. The texts that we read in this class are what I see to be foundational texts and taking the class writing intensive helped me hone my analytical thinking while practicing my argumentation.",
    "I would recommend this class only if my peer enjoyed dense philosophical reading as this was the bulk of my involvment with the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as a way of improving one's ability to analyze texts. The ideas are also very interesting and Garsten is an incredible lecturer.",
    "Yes!! I loved Professor Garsden and the course was really eye opening.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The texts the course exposed me to were some of the most important ones to modern western thought. I feel equipped to take a more specific class now that I have taken this survey course.",
    "Categorically. It will help you think in ways no one has ever prodded you to do so before. In the process, you will understand more about yourself and the kind of life worth living. All of this has real world consequences, and you will better understand your country and society.",
    "If you have an interest in gaining an interest to political philosophy, this is an excellent course if it is taught by Garsten. If you do the readings, you will get a lot out of the class; if you don't, then it won't be very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is easy and manageable if you put in the minimum amount of work, but very rewarding if you choose to do all the readings comprehensively.",
    "Sure, if they are at all interested in political science\/philosophy; it's a good foundation.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student as it is an interesting introductory course.",
    "Great introductory course to Western philosophy from a political perspective. Professor Garsten's lecture are overall lucid, interesting, and all too relevant to the present day.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Garsten's lectures are fantastic. I would try to go to all of his lectures as they force you to question your own deep-seated beliefs and understand the historical and sociological context of readings and authors you are assigned.",
    "I definitely would",
    "There isn't a whole lot of \"political\" involved in this class. I thought the class would relate the philosophers we discuss to modern politics to at least some extent, but it didn't. At times this course just felt like a basic intro to philosophy. If you are prepared to do the readings and are interested in philosophy, take this class. I'm surprised that this class can be considered as in the poli sci department.",
    "Yes!",
    "This class gives a solid foundation to political philosophy",
    "Don't take this for credit. Even if you think you're interested in philosophy I don't care don't take it. Take this course credit\/D or audit it, but don't waste a course on this.",
    "Yes. Great professor and mostly interesting readings.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is a great intro course and gives a nice overview of political thought throughout history.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have little understanding of the major philosophical writers, and if you would like a speedy breadth course. This course is great in that you leave with a basic knowledge of major writers, but you don't get to delve deeply into the major texts. In my opinion and according to many students I talked to, you aren't able to do all the readings because there are too many. If you want to delve into a text and really explore the writer, I would say this isn't the course for you. If you have experience reading philosophy before and want to explore more in college, this is a very introductory course. I did the non-writing intensive. Also, you're not supposed to say this but TA's are EXTREMELY important. I had to switch TA's in the middle, and my second TA was exceedingly better than my second. I don't think I would have learned as much as I did if I had stuck with my first TA.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are willing to read one seminal work in the western political tradition per week, and to get a quick overview of political philosophy. The lectures are excellent, as is professor Garsten and most of the TFs, but there are definitely times when the treatment of the works are too brief.",
    "This is an excellent course with an exceptional instructor. It is entirely worth taking, whether for a distributional requirement, credit for your major, or a credit-D. If you can do even half of the readings and attend the lectures, you will leave the course intellectually and personally enriched.",
    "Take it! Take it! Take it! With Garsten. The books are a bit complicated but Garsten makes it clear and TAs explain other main concepts not covered in lecture.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to other students, it was quite fun and engaging.",
    "Yes definitely, just figure out how to make time for all of the readings, it makes the class much more enjoyable and understandable if these can get done.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course - but DO NOT TAKE IT WRITING INTENSIVE. The WR option is well-intended but impractical. It consists of weekly writings - which are not graded, and are often begun two hours before the deadline - and a series of mini essays expanding on these prompts. I have a number of concerns about the program, namely: -weekly writings involve no grade, so there is little incentive to put much work in. -mini essays often sound very contrived. It is hard to expand an essay designed for a 500 word target to a 1500 word target. -standards are not clearly communicated to students. The syllabus referenced a standardized rubric that would be used, but I never saw it or heard about it. -No writing instruction is done in class. It happens only in the specific WR sections and often (and understandably) falls to the wayside when there is a fat book of philosophy to discuss in 50 minutes. -feedback is limited to after-the-fact (often very after-the-fact) comments on 3 mini essays and the final essay. There is no significant revision process or peer editing\/handing in of drafts etc. -the workload is manageable with the normal requirements but becomes truly ridiculous with weekly responses and two extra essays. This should really be a 1.5 credit class with the WR. It's really easy to fall behind on the reading if you are committed to the writing. Many of my friends (in several WR sections) regretted taking it for WR credit. I do not the TAs for this - it is just an impractical program for a 150 student class. Many of the TAs were very thoughtful and just not afforded the opportunity by the course structure to provide meaningful feedback. The only (seriously the single one) argument I can conceive of for taking the course WR is that it makes you read more diligently because you have to write those responses. But you shouldn't be taking this course unless you want to do the readings in the first place. Until the program is seriously revised, I would recommend taking the course normally and just enjoying the books and Garsten's lectures. You will get much more enjoyment and much more feedback and much more sleep from a WR credit in a small, writing seminar with a professor who is dedicated to improving your writing.",
    "This is a great course. Would very much recommend. Garsten is amazing!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who would like to learn about the major thinkers that we talk about even today. Plato, Mill, Rosseau, these are all, in my opinion, foundational thinkers and they help make us understand politics in history and today. Warning that although professor Garsten is a great lecturer, he doesn't use any visual aids in his teaching, which can really be helpful at times. Also, there's a lot of reading, sometimes as much as a book in a week, so be prepared.",
    "Yes, it was very compelling.",
    "I would not recommend this course to most people. If they had a very heavy interest in philosophy I might.",
    "This course is a good survey of the classics of political philosophy for students who did not take DS. The lectures are excellent, but assignments are rather harshly graded. You will cover a good deal of material, but occasionally it will be too much to manage each week. I did not feel that the writing section improved my writing. I would recommend the course non-WR and with an understanding that this is no gut."
