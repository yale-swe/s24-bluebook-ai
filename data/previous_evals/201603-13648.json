    "From a craft perspective, this course covered all the fundamentals. I developed better sense of voice, point of view, time, language, and revision.",
    "The value of the discipline that a writing course necessitates cannot be underestimated, and this course continues to prove that--the smaller exercises that focused on different topics each week were very interesting and often so helpful for the longer, full short stories that we eventually wrote. I definitely gained a greater ability to identify elements of my writing that were not as fresh or true as they could be, and I also found myself gaining more of an ability--through the regular workshops--to recognize new issues in my own work through closely studying that of others. This is one of the oldest and, I think, finest ways by which writers learn their craft.",
    "I feel my skills as a writer increased greatly. I learned to write better stories with more developed characters and better language.",
    "I learned not only how to construct a narrative, but more importantly to critique my own work by doing exercises in and out of class and by workshopping my classmates' papers. It's helped me self-improve both my school writing and personal projects."

   "comments": [
    "The course was designed well. I liked the workshop structure for the longer pieces along with the short assignments interspersed throughout the semester. There is nothing I would change.",
    "I think that the course was excellent overall, but I would have preferred to do perhaps more reading for it. It was helpful to read other students' works, but I felt that I benefited the most after reading a final, polished copy from a professional author."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. If you're looking to learn fiction, this is a great way to do it.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I would have loved to have been assigned even more short story reading assignments in amidst the writing assignments, because I always find these helpful in inspiring and pushing forward my own writing. But so much can be said for the fact that you will walk away from the course having produced two full short stories, and a number of shorter exercises. Classroom discussions and workshops were daunting but lively, an exciting opportunity to have a very generous portion of time--and often very insightful student critics--examine your work."
