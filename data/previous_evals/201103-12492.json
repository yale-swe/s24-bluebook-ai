    "This course contains a lot of information, and gets much harder at the end of the course. The teacher does not do a good job explaining new information and expects you to understand it based on what is written on the board. I would recommend this class if you are really good at learning difficult math concepts on your own very quickly, otherwise you may end up lost by the end.",
    "Pretty manageable, Ivan is a decent teacher and it wont be too bad if you put the work in at the end.",
    "Take it if it is a requirement and if you're good for math. Otherwise it is necessary to spend a long time trying to figure out what was meant in the class, because topics are treated very fast.",
    "An interesting and challenging course. Getting extra help is possible but not effortless.",
    "See above.",
    "A fast paced course going over a survey of multi-variable calculus. It might be beneficial to have taken multi in high school. If you need Math 120 for a requirement then take it but expect a lot of work.",
    "This course is hell. I consider myself a generally math\/science person but I still did not enjoy this class in any way, shape, or form. If you must take this for a requirement or major then the general strategy I would recommend is to try to do as best you can in the first half of the course while it's still easy. The second half of the course gets extremely difficult in both the problem sets and the midterm (there's a big drop in the average score from the first to second midterm). And it gets worse from there. There is a curve of some sort made at the end, but I have no idea how generous it is.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Math 120 is multivariable calculus, it deals with similar concepts of single variable calculus but applied to the three-dimensional field. Therefore it is not too scary for a student familiar with calculus, but can be very tricky and difficult to understand. I would recommend this class to another student because it was a great continuation of calculus.",
    "Math 120 is straight math. After taking this, I feel like I understand how to apply the formulas, but I don't necessarily understand why these formulas work. There are no connections to real life applications. The class is not very interesting. I would take it only if you are truly interested in math or need to take it for your major.",
    "From plane to space.Application of calculus in 3-d (sometime 4-d), exploration of higher dimensions and reconciliation between calculus and geometry."
