   "comments": [
    "Yes. If you are interested in Buddhist art, this is a very resourceful class.",
    "I believe this course is essential for those working on Buddhist art. Not only does it cover major tenants of East Asian Buddhist art, but critically examines different media on which it appears. I would highly recommend students to benefit from both the course and Prof. Kim's instruction.",
    "Mostly about East Asian Buddhist Art, and sometimes not really about the visual material or art. Onus is on students to direct the class as there are few presentations from the instructor. There are, however, guest speakers who give insightful presentations.",
    "This course is a great introduction to Buddhist art - the themes of time and space are broad but allow for focused discussion on different artworks produced in varying media and styles throughout East Asia."

   "comments": [
    "I do not have much exposure to Buddhist art and its related research paradigms, so this course was crucial for my work as it touches on these visual and artistic traditions. The lessons learned would feature heavily in my dissertation work when appropriate.",
    "I loved taking this course. I hope I will have a chance to learn more about East Asian art and possibly to focus on this area for my oral exams."
