    "Great way to practice Chinese with interesting content! Also a great way to learn about modern issues in China.",

    "Very informative and good teaching.",
    "Strengths: Zhou Laoshi is excellent; interesting units, reading assignments and class discussions; grading is fair if you put the work in; no big stressful assignments but lots of smaller assignments and projects. Weaknesses: Too much partner\/group work -- I would have learned more doing presentations alone; everyone picks their own vocabulary words to study, which is also sort of a strength. Zhou Laoshi's logic, which I understand, is to help us learn independently, but I found I didn't learn the words I chose. Communal vocabulary would have been more effective.",
    "Strengths: Engaging and dedicated instructor, creative projects, and independent learning. Weaknesses: Sometimes the requirements for the assignments seemed a little wordier or unclear.",
    "it was really good and really fun! i think it's great the way it is,"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, very educational on Chinese current affairs.",
    "Yes, but don't expect a traditional Chinese class. There's no textbook reading, no communal vocab, and no character quizzes, which is often refreshing but also unsettling at times. You get used to learning at your own pace and gain confidence reading and writing more formal language. You might not learn as much grammar and vocab as you do in a traditional Chinese course, but you'll complete more creative assignments that often feel more relevant than a test or essay. For one project, we translated an exhibit brochure for the Yale University Art Gallery to use.",
    "Yes! Zhou Laoshi is great.",
    "definitely! it was a lot of fun, Zhou laoshi is a phenomenal teacher and really nice!"
