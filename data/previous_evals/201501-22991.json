    "This was Jacob's only time teaching this class (most likely), so this probably isn't going to be much use for future students. But Jacob was a really chill instructor. That being said, he definitely overestimated the ability of everybody in the class; it was a good challenge for me but I can definitely see it being over a lot of other peoples' heads. But like I said, he probably won't be back to teach (at least for a while) so look at the reviews of other professors if you're interested in this class.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who loves classical music and wants to be able to listen to it more critically.",
    "if you have Jacob, just practice outside of class to get better at the things you learned in class.",
    "Take it. It is a great skill to have as a musician."
