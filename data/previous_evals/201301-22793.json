    "I'm reviewing a seminar on logical consequence taught by Sun-Joo Shin that we got her to offer as a \"Tutorial.\" It should go without saying that you should take any class that Sun-Joo teaches. Just do it. She is one of the best teacher you'll ever have. She agreed to teach this tutorial to a group of Math& Philosophy majors. We studied logical consequence. It was an awesome synthesis of things I'd learned in other logicy philosophy classes in my four years. An awesome end to an awesome major.",
    "You should always do anything with Sun-Joo. Great section leader -- indulged in our random tangents, told us interesting stories, etc. in addition to promoting great discussion. The material was actually very interesting and enlightening (Etchemendy, on the concept of logical consequence)."
