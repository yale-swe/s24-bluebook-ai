   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it! Not a hard lab, and it is fun and interesting most of the time.",
    "Yes, if you have to take a lab I would definitely recommend this lab. It isn't that difficult and is the most painless",
    "This is a great lab! I am not a science major and I absolutely loved it. The individual labs are interesting and fun, especially towards the end of the semester, and lab reports aren't too intense. Marta is wonderful and passionate, and if you come in with a good attitude every week, you'll have a great time. Just be prepared to spend a little more time in lab than is listed on the schedule.",
    "It's a very interesting lab. You go to the greenhouse to do some labs and also take a field trip to a river to collect data and specimens. You also prepare a presentation at the end of the semester. Besides that, you just have lab reports each week which aren't that bad.",
    "This class is really fun and quite educational. Dr. Wells is an amazing woman, and some of my friends asked her to be their adviser after taking this class. The final project was a little stressful with workload from other classes, but it was fun and interesting to learn about. It ended up not being that bad in the end. Take this class if you have any interest in biology.",
    "This lab was an easy, relaxing way to get credit for a biology lab. If you need a bio lab for premed, I recommend this one! Nothing is applicable for future bio labs, and you will learn nothing that will help you if you are interested in working in a molecular bio lab. This might not be for you if you really want to gain some skills for future lab work. However, it was a great way to get the credit out of the way. Going to the stream was a lot of fun, and in one of the labs we ate all sorts of exotic fruit.",
    "E&EB 123L is a very solid bio lab if you're looking for one. It is tedious, like any other lab but not at all difficult. It broadly covers important topics in E&EB. Definitely take this lab if you're premed.",
    "I would definitely recommend this lab to anyone looking for a biology lab credit. The work is not as intense as the other labs, but there is a presentation at the end instead of a lab final. The experiments are really cool and you get to visit many places like the Peabody, the greenhouses and Sleeping Giant state park.",
    "If you need a bio lab, this one is pretty easy, but not the most exciting.",
    "This is a fantastic and fun lab if you are really interesting in ecology, plants and small organisms. If you are not (like me) then it can be a little tedious, frustrating and not so captivating, especially when lab sessionsrun long. However, having said that, overall it wasn't bad at all, mainly because of Dr. Wells and the TA who were consistently helpful, patient and enthusiastic.I would recommend this lab to another student who had some interest in EEB.",
    "Must take! You will learn alot while still having fun!",
    "Take this course! It is super fun, you will get to learn a lot of cool facts about plants\/animals, try fruit that you have never tasted before, visit the peabody museum, go explore in a river, and Marta Wells is the best. The first few quizzes\/lab reports are a bit tough, but hang in there because everything is worth it in the end.",
    "Recommend if you need a bio lab. A pretty large amount of work, timewise (not thought-wise, it's pretty straightforward\/tedious) and it's frustrating it's only a half credit...but a pretty guaranteed good grade.",
    "If you need to fill a lab requirement, take EEB 123 lab. The labs themselves are awesome, you dissect fish and do field work in streams and generally have a good time. Its easy, laidback, and you are doing some cool stuff. However I found writing lab reports a somewhat tedious waste of time, and am not sure I actually learned all that much from the course. Take it if you need a lab and you'll have fun and look at some cool organisms, but unless you derive enjoyment out of lab reports, don't take it just to take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! My advice is to start the lab reports early and not to take them lightly. You can have a ton of fun with this class, so don't stress yourself out by putting yourself in a bad situation with the reports!",
    "This lab is 50% really long, boring and monotonous and 50% very, very fun. You will do cool things like try 50 different kinds of fruit and study stream ecology in the field and tour the Yale greenhouses, but you will also spend long hours looking at slides and drawing in your notebook. The lab reports take 2-4 hours depending on the week and are quite dull, but you get faster the more experienced you are with writing them. There are 4 quizzes - study for them because this is where the grades really come from. They aren't too difficult, but it's easy to get points off for an answer that's only a little wrong because of how the points are distributed. It's also hard to tell what to study (you should re-read the lab manuals, but this can be a lot of detail and it's hard to tell before the quizzes how much detail is really necessary). There is a presentation at the end of the class which is a fair amount of work (coming up with outline, making powerpoint, talking to TA, practicing with partner(s)), but ultimately rewarding. Overall it wasok, really fun at times but not an insignificant amount of work for half a credit.",
    "Weekly lab that is pretty easy and straightforward, but does require a pretty big time commitment with a weekly lab report. Even though it was only a half credit, it was one of two classes this semester that took up the most of my time.",
    "Take it! You'll devote one afternoon a week to being in complete awe at the beauty and complexity of the natural world. It's a great perspective.",
    "This is a great lab. The experiments are easy and fun and the lab reports don't take very long at all. Take it!",
    "I highly recommend this lab! Take it if you like hands on learning and love learning about Earth's diversity. It is not too demanding--just a lot of lab reports to write and the lab itself takes a while. It's great because you get to go on field trips--to the greehouses, Peabody Museum, and Sleeping Giant State Park.",
    "Standard introductory bio lab. It is not terrible, it seemed that everyone that took it either needed it for premed or their bio major.",
    "It's a fun lab if you want a bio lab. You get to dissect plants and animals, and go on a stream excursion. Keep in mind, though, that the lab report is not short, and you will probably get out at the end of lab every time. However, I thought it was a rewarding lab and I encourage people to try it out.",
    "You learn a lot, and it's really interesting stuff. Pretty easy lab in comparison to what I've taken in the past (gen chem, orgo, mcdb) with only 4 quizzes and lab reports to do. Takes a long time in the lab, but the reports are fine. Recommended.",
    "This is an OK lab course. It's not too hard or too much work out of class, but you spend at least the full time in lab each day. The experiments are at times cool, but often very tedious.",
    "This course is okay, but it takes a lot of time - however, so does MCDB 121, so I'm not sure which one is better if you are just trying to get the introductory bio lab req out of the way.",
    "Professor Wells and the TAs for this course are great and very helpful. However, the 3-4 hour labs (and the lab reports) are very long and tedious. Honestly, I would say not to take this class unless you have to, and if you do have to, keep in mind that it improves as it goes on. By the time you get to the last 4 or 5 labs (and the final presentations) they're wonderful.",
    "I needed another bio lab for my pre-med requirements and was tired of the crazy, typical pre-med classes that were unreasonably stressful. It was pretty tedious at times, but I took it with a couple of friends so it made the 4 hours much more bearable and even fun. I don't think I'll retain most of the knowledge, especially since I didn't take the lecture but it was a nice, easy lab to take with physics lab.",
    "I would recommend this course. One of the best and most interesting lab courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "I thought this was a fabulous lab. Professor Wells is the most informed, enthusiastic, warm teacher. She taught us so much about ecology in so little time, and (it seemed to me) she and the TA's really wanted us to learn how to be scientists. I learned not only how to write ecology labs (that was a steep learning curve) but also how to do field work (in a stream!) and make presentations (with fossils! from the Peabody!) It was a very valuable experience. The first labs are a little tiring because there aren't many live specimens, but it's totally worth it if you hold out for the stream labs and green house labs. You'll learn a ton and enjoy yourself on the way.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT iits the most fun lab ive taken",
    "I would highly recommend 123L. By far my favorite lab I have taken at Yale. In fact, I'd say its one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale period. Loved the fruit lab!!",
    "Very, very fun lab! Take a break from the stuffy chemical labs and take this super cool course -- you'll get to look at animals, plants, go on a trip to a stream, and learn a lot of neat stuff. The lab reports are pretty easy, albeit slightly time consuming, but totally worth it. This lab definitely changed the way I look at plants&animals.",
    "You learn about biology in many of the most exciting ways. Take it because you learn in really fun labs. Look, it's just really fun, so take the class.",
    "This lab was great. It was extremely enjoyable to go to. It requires about 4-5 hours of work per week outside of class, which was really manageable. The lab itself was always interesting and fun. I would definitely suggest it to anyone even marginally interested in biology.",
    "Take it! Probably the most laid back lab Yale offers.",
    "I really enjoyed this lab. To sum it up in one phrase, I would say \"exploring the diversity of life.\" We basically just looked at specimens of animals and explained them in terms of evolution and ecology. The last lab was really awesome because we got to go to a stream and collect invertebrate samples... overall a great experience.",
    "Recommend, refreshing break for science majors",
    "Good introductory lab course. You get to observe a lot of different plants, animals, and other organisms in a very hands on setting.",
    "Great lab! Lab reports are a little tedious, but lab itself is fun and easy and generally well worth the time.",
    "E&EB Lab 123 is an excellent lab if you want to do fun things during your lab session - it's basically like going on field trips you used to have in middle school. You visit the Peabody, the Yale greenhouses, and Sleeping Giant. The grading is based on a final presentation in addition to your weekly lab reports. However, while I enjoyed the lab sessions very much, I found the weekly ~6 page lab reports to be very dull, especially since they're just doing research on topics that weren't always interesting (e.g. earthworms). I spent a considerable amount of time writing about things like the life cycle of mosses and liverworts, which I will hopefully never have to think about again. I ended up being a horrible procrastinator on the lab reports since they were so dull.",
    "Take it! It is the best intro lab class at Yale. Better than any other intro chem, physics, or bio lab. Trust me. I have taken them all.",
    "If you want a bio lab that's not much work, take it. You're probably taking it for a premed requirement or for a major requirement, so you'll take it anyway.",
    "Weekly lab reports which could take a while, you definitely have to prepare for the lab quizzes, lab itself goes until 5 pretty much every week...so the time commitment is not small. But in the end I felt like I learned a lot about biodiversity in a really hands-on way that I will remember for a long time. If you're looking for super rigorous, experiment-based biology, this is not your class, but if you're looking for an interesting and relatively challenging exploration of the amazing diversity of life, this is your course!",
    "YES.",
    "I would recommend this lab because it forces you to look at things you experience every day and think about them in different ways. You truly learn about diversity. It's also a harmless lab, in that they lead you through it step by step and you're not expected to have a lot of fundamental knowledge about evolutionary biology. Some of the activities are amazing, the labs the end, particularly, because you get to go out and experience and study the diversity you've learned about all semester.",
    "I would recommend this class if you need a bio lab credit, as it is a low stress and relatively fun way to acquire one. However, it is not so much fun, as well as only mildly informative, as to cause me to recommend it to someone who does not specifically need this credit. The last few labs are the most fun.",
    "Recommended if you are a freshman or sophomore who has not taken AP Biology. The labs themselves tend to be fun and interesting but the lab reports are busy work. As far as lab reports go though they're not bad. If you're thinking about EEB or EVST and need a lab and are an underclassman, I would recommend it.",
    "I enjoyed this class. It was wonderful to explore the Peabody museum and the Yale greenhouse. These two places have wonderful collections and were a joy to visit. The Yale greenhouse is beautifully set up and managed, and being introduced to it and getting a chance to tour and explore it were the highest highlights of the lab experience. Things that could be improved: I think some of the labs' activities did not add very much value to our elementary understanding of evolution and diversity. I think the quantity of lab exercises could be pared down and focused so that instead of exploring random techniques and pieces of data informing the very broad theme of biodiversity, we should focus on one or two techniques each time the lab convened. This would keep attention focused and result in a deeper, more thorough knowledge of one-three themes in biodiversity\/evolution of life rather than broad, random knowledge. Also, by doing this, the weekly terms of the lab would be more manageable - class would end consistently at 4:30 (and would keep students more engaged\/intellectually focused the entire time) and lab reports would be less tedious and cookie-cutter and more analytical and evaluative.",
    "What a fun lab! Marta Wells is my hero! Her enthusiasm is truly infectious. Her subject knowledge is extensive and she is good at explaining things, and at looking things up that she doesn't already know. The subject matter was necessarily broad, but I felt like I got to encounter a bunch of different techniques and areas, which was cool. Nice that it can be taken without the course it's associated with to fill a lab requirement.",
    "I would recommend this other students so that need this to fulfill their requirements. Be wary however that there is a significant amount of extra work that will be involved with the laboratory and some laboratories may go over on their allotted time period. The professor is amazingly nice and helpful however, and I would take the class only if Marta Wells were teaching it."
