    "A great introduction to the complex sociopolitical climate in Israel. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone looking to learn about the conflict in Israel, or just hoping to become more globally aware. The workload is manageable and Professor Roginsky is super helpful!",
    "Take this class take this class take this class!!!! This course goes over topics about Israel from the pre-statehood Zionist period until today. It takes great care to provide perspectives and narrative from multiple viewpoints on every topic, which is EXTREMELY fascinating and a useful way to learn to think about the complexity of Israel's history. There were many students in the class who knew nothing about Israel coming in. I had already learned about Israel in many formats including spending time living there, and I still learned a ton. The material is accessible and useful to anyone. The readings were SUPER interesting. I was often genuinely absorbed in the reading assignments and had a ball doing them, something I can't say about most of the classes I've taken at Yale. In-class discussions were engaging, and the workload was totally manageable. I can not say enough good things about Dina as a professor. Her background is in sociology, which makes her well-equipped to help us think about the nuanced perspectives involved in everything we learned. She's extremely intelligent and articulate, and puts so much energy into creating a positive, engaging learning experience for her students. She is always willing to provide detailed feedback and help students prepare with presentations and other work, and she just goes above and beyond in every way to make sure you get the most out of it. I could go on. TAKE THIS CLASS! You will not regret it.",
    "Very low key discussion-based seminar on Middle Eastern historical (leading to present-day) issues viewed from a variety of perspectives."
