   "comments": [
    "Analyzing the thoughts of an author, evaluating the merits of political decisions and philosophies",
    "My ability to parse texts for big ideas and relate ancient events to modern ones and to one another certainly grew a lot in this course.",
    "Professor Smith is extremely approachable, the class discussed numerous interesting topics such as the interplay of philosophy and politics, political regime across different ages, and more.",
    "I learned mostly how to discuss complicated topics in a seminar style and how to write clearly.",
    "I gained a solid understanding of the development of historical and political thought, from the Greek historians Herodotus and Thucydides all the way to the Christian theologians Aquinas and Augustine. The purposes behind writing histories and the views ancient thinkers had as regards democracy, autocracy, and other forms of government became much clearer to me. Furthermore, my ability to write effectively improved dramatically; I now feel confident stating that I can write a college-level paper.",
    "Historical and Political thought was the DS class that I was the most uncertain about going into, as I was clueless as to what might be meant by historical thought or political thought, or the both in the same context. Of course it cannot be said that leaving the course I now have a full understanding of the topic, but each of the books we read and the analysis that was done helped me to gain insight on topics such as the role of a historian, the purpose of law, and the nature of human communities.",
    "This course was valuable in developing both my writing and reading skills, as well as providing critical insight into the methods of historical narration and the reality of the human condition.",
    "A much greater insight into political philosophy than I had before taking the course.",
    "I learned about the philosophy of history, and how histories that are not completely factually can be more telling than those that are. I also learned how to write a history paper, which I had literally never done before coming to Yale.",
    "Close reading of source texts, Knowledge of historical events and personalities, Links between older \"canonical\" texts of political philosophy and history and modern political events"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Pacing was a little fast, a little more emphasis on the important ideas or a reading guide of some sort would be nice to help with comprehension.",
    "The strengths are just the quality of the texts and the quality and proximity of the amazing professors. One weakness for me for all of DS is that there is a point at which the reading load is so great that it begins to limit itself (sort of a point of limited returns) because the assignments feel impossible. If a teacher is going to focus on 20% of the reading in class, then I feel like that should be communicated to students, so that, even though students have the option to read everything, those specific portions are studied in depth. I think this would improve the level of engagement in seminar discussions. This is especially true of H&P, where it is often a long list of sections of the reading and classes often focus on two paragraphs.",
    "The reading assignment can be shortened",
    "Its DS so you move very quickly. This is good because you get a lot of material but bad because there is very little depth.",
    "The strengths of this course are the focus on discussion and analysis, the significance of the texts, and the steady feedback on essays. The weakness of this course is (I hate to say this) the fast pace.",
    "I very much enjoyed the discussion format of the class, but I sometimes felt that we moved too quickly from one book to another.",
    "I felt like the course's texts were very split: we had history texts (Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy, Tacitus) versus political philosophy texts (Aristotle, Plato, Aquinas, Maimonides, Al-Farabi), and it often felt very hard to reconcile the two. On the final exam, where much of the content regarded political philosophy, it felt difficult to draw on the former authors who wrote more episodic history.",
    "The biggest strength is also the biggest weakness: I love how much material we covered, but it made it hard to linger on any topic for too long regardless of how important or interesting it was."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, a great intro to historical and political thought",
    "Yes! You get a really interesting taste of a lot of different kinds of writing and ways of conveying thought (explicitly, through a history, through allegory, etc.). Its a very interesting way to read works that often seem like mere chronology.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes. If you know what youre signing up for it is a fantastic program.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but I would also warn them that they would have to commit significant time to reading the material and that they have to take initiative when it comes to improvement on the essays. This course really is a case where students get as much as they put in. Nevertheless, the material is engaging and the professor is excellent at guiding discussions. If a student wants to learn, they will.",
    "If you can handle the workload and the amount of the reading, yes, I absolutely would.",
    "I would recommend directed studies as a whole to another student. Even though it was a lot of work, I found it very gratifying and totally worth the effort. I would especially recommend this history section because I felt it did a good job focusing on the big picture instead of small details, which is necessary when going through so many topics.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to gain baseline knowledge of Historical and Political Thought. It is more of a broad survey than a detailed analysis of single works. Students looking for a more thorough reading of specific works might be better off taking another course. For others, this is the way to go."
