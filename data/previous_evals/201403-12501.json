   "comments": [
    "Music 304 is a challenging and interesting and in-depth look at 19th century music theory, from a point of view of chromaticism. There is not much on musical form, but so much information on chromatic techniques! I would definitely recommend to another student",
    "Probably the hardest music theory course ever, but what an amazing class. Professor Cohn opened up my eyes to a new world of musical analysis. Take it take it take it.",
    "Take. Cohn is where it's at in terms of music theory. And he's just a really fun guy.",
    "An in-depth analysis of 19th century theory and the varying roles of chromaticism-- I highly recommend this class to anyone deeply interested in music theory.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Great music, great analysis. I have no idea if it'd be good without Cohn teaching it, but jeez it's good. A fair bit of work (if you want to do well on the weekly or bi-weekly short papers) but I learned so much. I think everyone did.",
    "Take this class! You will get so much better at music analysis, and the topics in music theory that you discuss in class are really interesting. Also, if you liked what you learned towards the end of MUSI 211, then you'll likely find this course fascinating since it goes into each of those topics in much more depth. Rick is a great professor and an expert on the course material. I highly recommend this course!"
