    "I would recommend the course. I think it gives a very good introduction to a very important branch of physics.",
    "I would definitely recomment it, even if the student is not planning on pursuing a physics career related to QFT. It is very interesting stuff, and extremely important for physicists in general.",
    "I would recommend the class, but I would mention that the student should put more work towards the end of the class than the beginning, by a long shot.",
    "Great class. Would definitely recommend.",
    "Physics 609 is an excellent course, and I would definitely recommend it to another student. The workload and pace of the class are manageable, and the course covers a tremendous amount of fascinating Physics. Professor Appelquist presented the material very clearly, and did a great job answering questions and clarifying concepts. Physics 609 is an excellent introduction to Quantum Field Theory.",
    "Definitely. The course teaches a lot of key concepts and covers a lot of important material."

   "comments": [
    "It does not apply to my research at all, but it is a great class nonetheless that everyone should take. Other than the note about the format of the final exam that I referenced before, completely worth it.",
    "I think the course is great, but it needs more polishing for the last 3 weeks. Everything until then is described in so much detail, but after the LSZ formula everything just seems thrown at the student.",
    "Quantum Field Theory is one of the most important topics in modern Physics. This course introduced me to a great deal of new information, and Professor Appelquist did a great job of making the course material exciting and easy to understand. Physics 609 was a fantastic course.",
    "No",
    "Hard to say. I think it did not specifically contribute to my research but definitely helped me understand basic concepts which are always helpful."
