   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to fellow students, regardless of their chemical field. The exercise of going to current papers to master concepts is invaluable.",
    "This course brings students up to pace with the current field of chemical biology, including discussion of cutting-edge techniques and fresh literature. Indispensable course for any student who intends to study proteins and other macrostructures in a natural setting.",
    "The course would be recommended. It gave recent techniques in chemical biology and developments from historical techniques.",
    "I would summarize Chem 521 as a great overview of chemical biology for someone who is interested in learning a diverse range of topics. I would recommend Chem 521 to all students in the biology and chemistry fields.",
    "A great class for learning about how chemistry can be applied to answer biological questions. A firm chemistry (especially organic chemistry background) is very helpful. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in biology and strong in chemistry.",
    "Great. Yes",
    "Good review of the current literature of chemical biology. You get out of it what you put into it, and I'd definitely recommend the course.",
    "An in depth overview of the many facets of the field of chemical biology today. Attention is paid to both tools and concepts and a wide range of skills are tested and developed through the assignments. I would highly recommend this class."

   "comments": [
    "It gave me more current examples and techniques in chemical biology. It will definitely be helpful in my research, as I can employ those techniques.",
    "I am an environmental engineer, so it made me aware of the field of chemical biology. I learned a lot and both broadened and deepened my understanding. It likely will not directly impact my research, but the practice reading scientific articles will definitely come in useful even if the topics aren't directly applicable.",
    "This course has done a significant amount to prepare me for work in my field. Knowing what is being done by the top researchers today, directly informs what I may be able to accomplish in the next couple of years, and indeed in my life.",
    "This course encouraged active engagement with the literature in a way that no other chrmistry grad course did."
