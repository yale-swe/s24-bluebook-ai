    "The course is extremely well thought out with a reasonable amount of reading for each week, in addition to an in-depth discussion on each reading. I thought the course was well organized and very insightful. I would say that maybe perhaps the course could be improved by having weekly responses for those who are more shy to speak in class, so that they can show that they have done the readings and participate in a different way. I would also say the course could be improved by providing more guidelines in the writing process and more deadlines."

    "This is a really fun, informative course with a wonderful professor. Highly recommend this course -- or any course on Greek history -- to students interested in Southern European politics, the Eurozone, or modern Greece. Professor Aslanidis is a really awesome, engaged professor who will take the time to meet with you and make sure that you really understand the nuances and realities of Greek history. The course also gives you freedom to explore specific topics within Greek history that interest you",
    "This is a great course and I would definitely recommend it. Professor Aslanidis is very knowledgeable about the subject and modern Greece is a generally understudied topic, so it was very interesting.",
    "If one is interested in any aspect of the modern history of Greece should definitely take this course."
