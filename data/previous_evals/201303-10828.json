    "This course wasgreat. The teachers are hilarious, they really try to interact with the students in a way that the students will actually want to use the language to speak with them, rather than feel forced. The videos they used were also really fun to watch, they made all the work feel like less of a hassle. As far as the workload goes, it wasn't too bad, it was much less intensive than that for L1\/L2. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the language.",
    "awesome language class to learn lots of material. moves quickly, but not overwhelmingly so. teachers engaged and committed. they always have an exact lesson plan to follow in class, and it gets done as they planned it every day (japanese punctiliousness).BUT one little grievance was the weird constituency of L3 japanese. L1 class has lots of kids, and they forma close community. I think L5 is also close, but of course less kids. L3 has mismatch of grad students, seniors, juniors, sophomores, and a few freshmen. Not a close community, unfortunately. may change in other years, though!apply for light fellowship!keep up with daily schedule, sometimes you dont realize all the assignments due the next day, so read it carefully! very accommodating if you have a busy day and couldn't do all your hoemwork though.",
    "A great class! Less work (or at least it feels so) than year 1, but you learn a ton and the instructors are amazing. Take the class!",
    "Recommended without hesitation: one of the best class experiences ever at Yale. Professors were both fantastic: extremely friendly and approachable, while also extremely organized and responsible. I was really impressed that the syllabus and class schedule were clear and straightforward; response to emails and requests was fast, and all our assignments were carefully graded and revised. The course was also pretty fun, even though it was Monday through Friday. A fantastic course overall."
