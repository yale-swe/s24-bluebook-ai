   "comments": [
    "I honestly feel like this is one of the most practical science classes I have taken at Yale so far. The lectures themselves were not very helpful, so you will really be doing most if not all of your learning from the textbook. But it felt really great to take a class where I knew how this could actually be used in real life. And professor Taylor is a really nice guy. Just be warned that the lectures were not that helpful.",
    "While it's certainly not a pleasant experience by any means, I came away feeling quite fulfilled that I learned real engineering theory that's directly applicable to real stuff. So I got that going for me, which is nice.",
    "Taylor is a very cool, approachable, fun professor. However, this class is incredibly poorly taught. It's more or less taught directly from the book and, rather than actually teaching the material, prof Taylor just writes equations on the board for 75 minutes without providing any context to the material. Despite a 10% participation grade, it was never worth my time to go to class. The only reason I ever went to class was to turn in problem sets. But that's Yale engineering, right? Please get better teachers or invest in current professors by teaching them how to teach.",
    "I would really, really like to say good things about this class because the professor is so sincere. Unfortunately, this was not a particularly good class for me partly because of disorganization regarding presentation and problem sets, and partly because the class itself consisted of a lecture usually involving lots of copying down numbers and not a lot of understanding. That being said, when you actually think about the things that you are can solve, it is pretty cool.",
    "It is a class that you probably have to take as a required class, but I think it is very valuable and was a lot of fun. I feel like I learned a lot of real life skills that were very transferable. I really felt accomplished finishing this class, and I would recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "It's required, so you have to take it, but be warned that the lectures don't really help that much. Make sure you do the problem sets, get a copy of the textbook, and go to office hours. Other than that, the material is actually pretty interesting and not too bad if you read the book.",
    "Transport Phenomena is a required course for chemical engineers and environmental engineers, however it is not one of the most enjoyable courses you will take. The course heavily depends upon students checking up tables and memorizing several equations. Much of the course is about plugging and chugging numbers into equations, and very little is about application to new situations. The course also is taught in a way that students must copy down large number of derivations of key core equations, but don't really apply as much. Professor Taylor does do a good job of doing a few sample problems in class, but often times it is hard to see the bigger context or see how the new information fits into the larger curriculum as a whole. Transport Phenomena is a dense course: it is wise to understand the method of solving problems as opposed to memorizing the equations themselves.",
    "The note-taking format could be improved, but overall, Professor Taylor genuinely cares about his students and in getting them interested about Chemical Engineering. Solid class overall.",
    "You probably have to take this class, and it probably won't be too bad. Professor Taylor won't be teaching it next year so it's a completely different class than my experience. The material is useful and interesting at least.",
    "If Prof. Taylor is teaching, it\u2019s fair, doable, but really frustrating. Helpful hints: 1) use the book. The example problems are really good, and homeworks and exams follow them exactly most of the time. 2) work in groups \/ check problems in groups. There are some really long and frustrating problems on problem sets. 3) bookmark the book really well for open-book exams, especially example problems and tables. 4) write out key equations from the book sections before doing problem sets. 5) don\u2019t stress about taking notes in class, except for example problems. They\u2019re often wrong and unhelpful anyway. More info: This course is better than it had been in the past, but it still has a long way to go. The organization of technicalities of the type that go on a syllabus (exam dates) were better, but problem sets should have been assigned much more regularly. They should be assigned one week in advance (not on Sunday to be due on Wednesday, with an extension until Friday). They should also be given regularly, not two assigned at the same time and a period of time when there are no problem sets due if we have covered new material. The parallels between the book material and the course should be explicitly stated, since the book is good. Tests would be better if they were not open book. As in most other engineering courses, having an equation sheet is more than sufficient to not memorizing, but it forces students to learn the material. It was overwhelming to use the entire book in an exam, and it kept me from learning the material well because I just depended on the book (and ended up just teaching myself things in the exam instead of actually studying them for the test). Prof. Taylor is friendly and really seems to be open to feedback and tries hard. But, he has a ways to go to be a good professor. The main issue with this course was the way in which Prof. Taylor gave notes. The topics he covered and the example problems were good, but it felt as though he was transcribing his own notes onto the blackboard rather than teaching us and using the notes and the blackboard as tools to do that. The reasoning behind each step, what leads from one line of a problem to the next, should be explained during class. For example, every new variable should be defined; if any terms drop out or disappear, the reason why should be explicitly stated. It is very confusing to follow the reasoning when one is first learning the material (and even if one has seen it before) when these steps aren\u2019t explained during a lecture. It is not helpful at all, and rather even more confusing, when big equations are projected on slides. They should only be written out on the blackboard, with each term explained, rather than being presented all at once. The other difficulty was in the way he answered questions. Rarely did he actually answer the question I asked. For example, he told me and other students, when we asked some specific question on an exam problem, that we should \u201cfigure out what the question is asking and figure out which equations to use to answer it\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s pretty obvious and totally unhelpful. The same sort of thing happened in class. Perhaps Prof. Taylor could work on identifying exactly what questions are asking and how to answer them specifically, or to realize when he doesn\u2019t know the answer and to tell us and then find it for us later."
