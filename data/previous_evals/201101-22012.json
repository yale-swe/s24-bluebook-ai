    "It's a pretty boring, terrible lecture class, but if it's a requirement, many people seem to do okay in it.",
    "A very thorough course of electricity and magnetism. It was a lot of work, with online quizzes and problem sets every week, but it definitely helped to learn the material. Be aware that this class will pretty much become your life. But you will probably come out of it knowing a lot about E&M.",
    "yes if you need it for your major, otherwise it's nothing special",
    "Yes",
    "This was the worst class I have taken at Yale but the fact is most people who take this class have to for their major. PSETS are long and doing well on them has no correlation to doing well on the midterms. Pre-lecture quizzes are annoying and can take awhile.",
    "I think it's a good course- take it over 171. It gets a little more in depth and isn't as hard as I expected.",
    "You'll learn a lot if you read the chapters yourself; you probably won't get it all from lecture.",
    "If you like Physics there is a lot of cool stuff in this class and 180. The problem is it moves so fast... The professor said he expects you to spend pretty much 9 hours a week at least in the class and I personally wasn't up to that and as a result I did the PSets and did fine on the midterms after a good amount of last minute studying but didn't really learn all to much. Simply satisfied a prereq....",
    "Take this course with Sohrab. He is incredible. I never thought I was very good at math or physics (almost no preparation from high school), but the material was presented in a very clear manner that I understood or and actually began to enjoy learning about physics.",
    "SOHRAB IS SO GOOD. This class has changed my life. That might sound like hyperbole, but Sohrab made electricity and magnetism so much fun that I now want to be an electrical engineer just so I can study more of this stuff! The lectures were fantastic, the problem sets were (usually) challenging without being frustrating, the lectures were fantastic, the TAs were helpful, the lectures were fantastic, the midterms were doable, and the lectures were fantastic. Did I mention that Sohrab's a great lecturer? He is. If you're reading this, you should take this class. Seriously.",
    "Instructor is better than 201's but the tests are harder. You have to sacrifice one thing for the other, pick one.",
    "I really would not ever recommend this class. It simply had too much work associated with it. While it was pretty well-organized, the course expected too much from the students. There was too much material as well as too many homeworks. Written problem sets (7-10 questions) were assigned with less than a week to complete them, online homeworks (3-4 multiple choice questions that required material that had not yet been covered in class) were assigned with one or two nights to complete. This class was by far the most work I've ever had to put into something and I really don't feel like I gained that much from it. I didn't learn the last section of material, banking on my good grades on the two midterms to carry my grade, since there was simply too much. We didn't spend enough time going over concepts; it felt like we were constantly introducing new things which made the pace break-neck and unbearable. I sorely wish I had taken 171, just so that my semester could have been at least breathable.Beyond that though, the instructor seemed nice. He made changes to the syllabus based on student feedback, which was really cool.Prepare yourself for three (3) problem sets a week. It really annoyed me that we were expected to teach ourselves the material that would make up 10% of our grade (how much the online quizzes were worth). I'm sorry, but I'm not paying all of this tuition to teach myself the material out of a book. There is no way we should be tested on material that we have to teach ourselves. Also, there was rampant cheating on these quizzes, which really made it unfair for people who were actually trying to learn physics.Exams were ridiculously hard, even the final, which he said he was going to try to make easier, but no, it took the whole 3+ hours. This was just the icing on the cake for a ridiculous class. We used the book that my high school used for AP physics, so I expected this to be a more rigorous version of that. Yet I was mistaken and completely put-off by the outrageous expectations. Students cannot be expected to devote 15+ hours to one class each week.Also, and this just may be an unreasonable deeply-held pet peeve, but there were so many typos all over everything: problem sets, lecture notes, even online homeworks. I understand that everyone is human, but the frequency was just too high.In all, if you can take another class, please do. I shopped 201, but felt that my multi-variable was just too rusty to be sustainable. I considered shopping 171 but thought it would be too easy. I thought 181 would be better this year than past evaluations had made it out to seem (\"How on earth can anyone think 3 problem sets a week is still a good idea?\" thought the impressionable me) but it was not. I only wish I had been lazy enough to take 171, I thought I would accept the challenge of 181 but this backfired in my face. Please do not overestimate your physics abilities, as I did. As a sophomore, I hadn't had E&M in two years, and I felt that a lot of students had probably had it just last year. Yet another reason that I should have taken 171. Although the curve in this class may yet salvage my opinion of it.",
    "The material was pretty difficult and there was a lot of it covered very quickly...about 1 chapter per lecture. There is a lot of work...1 problem set per week (usually 6-8 problems long), and an online quiz due before every lecture. The midterms were pretty difficult as well. Take it only if you need it for your major.",
    "I enjoyed the course overall, although I'm not sure how well I did.",
    "This is a hard class, but I think it was worth it at the end -- I know a lot more physics than I did when I walked in, and I think that is the mark of a good course. The workload is high, and you will be spending a good amount of time of the week on physics; between reading, short online quizzes, problem sets, and studying, expect to spend 7-15 hours per week, more before midterms and the final. You will learn E&M well though, especially if Sohrab is teaching.",
    "There is no way I would ever recommend this course, but I don't feel like anyone would ever consider taking this class unless it were required or credit\/D\/fail.",
    "Don't take it unless absolutely necessary. Ruined any interest I had in physics.",
    "This class is a basic university intro to E&M. Sohrab does a good job making plenty of opportunities to help the students, but the fast pace and large amount of information still make the class a challenge. Problem sets are time consuming and fairly difficult, but you come out of the class with a lot of knowledge.",
    "Professor Ismail-Beigi expects a lot from his students. Exams were difficult and psets were long. BUt the professor focuses on problem solving in class which is a dream come true. its actually worth your time to go to class.",
    "Physics 181 is a lot of work. The reading is pretty heavy every week. The class moves very fast. I would shop the various levels of Physics to see which would be best for you.",
    "This class is extremely fast paced, but ultimately not that enriching. Much of the material was covered in high school physics (AP physics B). I often felt bored with what was being taught, but even still, I felt that it was taught at much to fast a pace. The professor told us that we should be spending essentially an hour each day studying physics outside of class, plus several hours for problem sets. I don't know about the average Yale student, but I,for one, do not have 20 hours to be devoting to physics every week.",
    "I would recommend this course. Keep an open mind and positive outlook, and you'll learn a lot of interesting material, particularly later in the course when you have a greater understanding of fundamental topics in physics. Many pre-meds who are not interested in physics (which is perfectly fine) are forced to take this class, and so many reviews are negative because the course does not interest them.The higher level physics courses, if you have a strong math background coming in (i.e. at or above multi-variable), are often said to be more interesting, and usually a bit less work because it is assumed that you have some prior knowledge. Take 181 if you don't have that background, and actually want to learn physics; go higher if you do have the background.",
    "This is a useful course. I would recommend not taking it for fun because of the workload and difficulty of material.",
    "Hard, but interesting material. Have to be good with classes that require daily maintenance, clickers every lecture, p-sets and reading that can't be left to the last minute.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. Some of the material is cool, but a lot of the stuff is very very picky and unusable in daily life.",
    "I would definitely recommend Physics 181. The professor was great, and anyone taking this class would have had to take Physics 180 (or 200) already, so you might as well take the second half of the set.",
    "For those of you who have taken AP physics C coming in - there's a lot of review in the first half, and then halfway through the semester everything becomes completely unfamiliar and bewildering. Fast paced, dense overview of all things E+M",
    "Take it if you're Pre-Med or have a bent towards physics or want a taste of physics. It does require a lot of work and you have weekly problem sets and online quizzes twice a week. It is work.",
    "Physics 181 is a good introductory physics course and most students take it because it is a prerequisite for certain majors. The course was interesting and definitely manageable so I would recommend taking 181 if you do not have a strong physics background like I did not. Professor Beigi gives good lectures and is really helpful during office hours.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student but I must caution them that this is one of the more difficult classes I have taken in my time at Yale. Sohrab is a very good professor but the class is very fast paced and the material is very challenging. I dropped down from the 200 level first semester because I had not taken physics electricity in high school and this class was very hard to keep up with. It'd doable but it takes a lot of studying and a lot of extra practice.",
    "Physics 181 is a pretty tough course. Since it only meets twice a week, the pace is rapid and the material is demanding. Every assignment is fair though, and Sohrab really wants students to learn, so help is available if needed. Just make sure to stay on top of the daily assignments. You actually learn physics though if that's what you want.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants a good, calculus-based Physics course in E and M. It's basically an equivalent to Physics C in high school, so take it if you haven't taken that. The course is very well taught.",
    "It is an okay class to take if you have to take it. Otherwise don't take it.",
    "This class is definitely MUCH harder than 180 but is overall a less painful experience. Sohrab is a much better lecturer than Richard Easter, but that is not saying very much. He has obviously put a lot of effort into his powerpoints but they are very hard to follow unless you have already read the chapter, and no one over has time for that. Some of the material is really difficult to grasp, and the pace of the class is just too fast to keep up. I often found myself interested in the lecture, but simply finding it too hard to process because there is just so much information. The worst part of the class is the testing- even when you study a lot and can do the problem sets, the tests are much more difficult than anything you have seen in the class. Sohrab writes very conceptual questions that we sometimes simply do not have the preparation to answer. Especially for the first midterm those who do well are the ones who already have a very strong background in E&M.",
    "I found the subject matter more difficult than 180, but ultimately more satisfying. Sohrab was great about incorporating student suggestions into the course. The basic course structure is weekly problem sets, the same online homework setup, two midterms and a final (drop one). Take this over 170 because (1) it's in Davies and (2) it's real, interesting physics instead of \"physics that tries to be nice to bio majors by tossing in applications related to the life sciences.\"I did not have the official math prereq (I'd taken only Math 115, not 120) and it served me just fine.",
    "Great course that helps you develop a strong conceptually understanding of physics. The pre-lab quizzes, and problem sets help you to solve more conceptual ideas and put them into more standard problems respectively.",
    "yes, by all means",
    "I feel like much of what you learn in this class you will never use again, but the reason almost everyone (I think 98% of the class when we clicker tested it) takes it is because they need it for their major\/for premed. The topics are harder and not as easily applicable as the 180 topics, it is a lot of work with the problem sets and online quizzes and the exams are tricky. Lots of people drop down from the physics 200 level classes so it's lot harder to do well in this class.I would only take this if you have to. Sohrab at least listened to the comments of students who said the problem sets were ridiculously hard at the beginning and then adjusted them to make them easier so that we could feel more confident to tackle them without a TA. He really does care about students enjoying the class. It will be a lot of work whoever you take it with though.",
    "While this class is pretty tough, you'll learn a lot. I wouldn't recommend taking it if you don't have to (simply because it's a very big time commitment), but I don't think you'll regret taking it if it's a requirement. Professor Ismail-Beigi is a really good lecturer, so you're bound to get a lot out of it.",
    "This is a work intensive class that you will probably not enjoy. I only feel moderately prepared after a full semester of onslaughts of \"educational initiatives.\" I wish they had focused more on teaching the damn class. The problems sets are pretty long, you constantly have work (twice a week!) and it will excite and engage you 1 time out of 10.",
    "The material is what you would expect from an introductory physics course: magnetism, special relativity, lenses and mirrors, etc. The professor, Sohrab Ismael-Bergi is GREAT! Take the course if it is with him! The problem sets are doable and actually really helpful \u0096 just find a group of friends to check answers with. The best part is the clicker questions: in-class questions that make sure you understand the material. It doesn\u0092t matter if you get them right, just if you answer them, so go to class and you\u0092ll learn something. As someone with a very minimal physics background I found that this course was difficult, but not unreasonable if you read the textbook and pay attention in class. It\u0092s a difficult class, but definitely a good class and worth it. If you have a minimal or basic high school physics background, I would recommend it over the other intro physics courses.",
    "take it if you have to - find study buddies.",
    "If you enjoy physics, then take a more advanced class. Unfortunately, for most premeds who can't handle more advanced physics, you may not have a choice.",
    "Sohrab was a good professor, but the class is somewhat frustrating because people come with very different physics backgrounds. If you have to take 181, then you don't have much of a choice, though. However, I would recommend taking the class with Sohrab.",
    "Don't take it. It's too much annoying work. The psets take long, and the quizzes include the worst-formulated questions ever. The curve is really bad, too.",
    "PHYS 181 is about what you would expect for a mid-level intro E&M course. There is quite a bit of work, but you do come out of it having a firm grasp of the material.",
    "I enjoyed this class much more than Phys 180. The material is interesting, although a little more challenging and foreign (for me at least). Understanding the material was very important to doing well in the class.",
    "You should only take this class if you need it for pre-med or for your major.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student looking to learn Physics and\/or looking to learn how to learn Physics. Because of this course, I've learned that my \"learning\" in Physics 180 (fall-term part of the sequence) was just tweaking formulas with a bare understanding of the qualitative pictures behind the formulas. But now, I've grown from simply tweaking formulas to understanding what's actually going on. So if the student has a not-so-strong physics background and doesn't mind struggling bit,definitely take this class.",
    "Physics 181 requires a lot of time due to the pre-class quizzes and weekly problem sets. However, you need to put in the effort to really understand the concepts and to do well on the conceptual questions on the exams. This is a hard course, but it is well taught with Professor Ismail-Beigi. Take it if you must, but it is not an easy course.",
    "If you need\/want to take physics but don't have the math background for 200\/201 you should take this course. The biggest bonus is that you escape the majority of the more rabid pre-med students.",
    "Physics 181 is a tough class because you are expected to learn by reading the textbook. Lectures are supplementary to the textbook, not the other way around as you would expect. You are responsible for everything in the textbook, as opposed to being responsible for what you are taught in lecture. On the other hand, the textbook is not very difficult to understand, and topics are covered on a very conceptual basis. But don't be fooled: I would venture to say that Physics 181 teaches you the concepts better and makes sure you actually understand the concepts more than Physics 201 does. If you've taken calculus, Physics 201 is probably easier.",
    "it is necessary for a bunch of classes, however the exams are super hard. study",
    "This is a solid course, and if Professor Ismail-Beigi teaches it, definitely take it.",
    "I thought this was a cool class- the special relativity and quantum physics units were especially interesting. That said, it is a hard class and a lot of work. If you're an MCDB major like me it might be easier for you to just take Phys 171.",
    "Don't do it if you don't absolutely have to. This class was terrible. The tests were impossible and the explanations in class were anything but clear. Run, run as fast as you can away from this class. It demands an unreasonable amount of work for a one-credit course.",
    "yes good course work and clearly went over the basics",
    "You must likely have to take it because it's required. As a student you have to use your resources early on and be proactive - read ahead in the book, pay attention in lecture, start psets early, go to study hall, and get a tutor early if you need it.",
    "Physics sucks. That\u0092s all there is to it. Unless you really like the subject, you will not have a pleasant experience. Thankfully though, Professor Ismail-Beigi is really good and tries very hard to help his students succeed. He actually listens to complaints with the class and takes suggestions on how to improve it, which I think is pretty cool. The online quizzes due before each class are a pain since they test material which hasn\u0092t been covered in class yet. I guess the assumption is that you should read the chapter before class, but if you\u0092re expected to understand the material before the lecture then I don\u0092t get why they force you to attend with the clicker questions (which would actually be helpful if they weren\u0092t just an annoying way of taking attendance). Overall the material is actually pretty interesting, so if you can stay on top of the reading and actually understand it you should be fine.",
    "PHYS181 is a basic follow-up to AP Physics B, which covers AP Physics B and C topics. I took AP Physics B and felt well-prepared for this course (I would hesitate to take it without this background). I would definitely recommend PHYS181 to another student, especially with Professor Ismail-Beigi - he is a very clear lecturer who truly cares that his students learn the material well. However, be warned that the material in this course (magnetism, induction, etc). is often difficult to understand conceptually. Try to stay ahead, especially since many of these students SHOULD HAVE TAKEN PHYS201 (I am not just guessing; this was the result of a survey taken by the class).",
    "It's hard. It's physics. That's life.But 181 was do-able, more so than I expected. Prof. Ismail-Beigi is a very fair professor (or maybe more than fair), and he took more of an active interest in making sure that we actually learned the material than I've seen in many teachers. So if you're going to take physics, take 181.",
    "A good course to take if you want a straightforward approach to physics.",
    "I wouldn't recommend PHYS181, but you have to take it for your major (most likely) so there's not much you can do. Try to go to office hours as much as you can, talk to the TAs, and get a study group early. This class is a ton of work and it's easy to get behind and not do well in the course."
