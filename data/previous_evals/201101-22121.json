    "This is a broad overview of different national cinemas, and the overlap that occurs among regions. Itook it Cr\/D and am glad for it - it becomes very time-consuming, with many papers, weekly film screenings, and an impossible-to-study-for final. But I am glad I took the class; I watched some great movies and had very interesting discussions. You won't necessarily come away with a strong factual knowledge of film history - and a lot of the theory is really kind of ridiculous and jargon-heavy, which I felt detracted from the actual study of the films, because instead of engaging with them as art\/intellectual materials, there was a bit of imposing theory inwards. And because of the somewhat weird organization - the lectures were sometimes a bit rambly - I'm not positive that I would recommend it. But I would definitely suggest shopping it if you're interested in the topic and can make the time commitment.",
    "I somewhat regret taking it because there were so many papers and I didn't need a writing credit, but if you aren't taking 4 other difficult classes then yes. It's cool and the films are really interesting.",
    "This is an excellent course for those who want to better understand the intersection of art and infrastructure that is cinema. I would recommend it, even though I wasn't very interested in the infrastructure side of things until partway through the semester.",
    "Take the course if you're looking to watch a wide variety of beautiful, fascinating films. It's a good writing credit because there's much food for thought in the material - these films are easy to write about and the assignments leave you a lot of freedom. There is a fair amount of work - it's not an easy course, but not crazy hard either. If you are easily tempted to skip lecture and become disengaged, then this course is not for you; the films may be the highlight, but lecture is like broccoli.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to other students. Essentially, the movie selection boils down to the best one or two movies that most of the major movie-producing countries (and many minor ones) have EVER made. Really, almost every single movie we watched I enjoyed tremendously. And while watching one (or sometimes two) movies a week can seem like a lot of time commitment, not only is the reading light (and only really necessary for the exam...), but watching a movie is such a great break from other work, as well as stress and worries...and it's technically \"work\"! Take it.",
    "Take it",
    "Yes. Good material, good professor and TAs, and good writing credit.",
    "It's a weird workload. Essays are not your typical film studies essays (for example, there's an anthropological paper) but they are fun. Professor Andrew's a great person in the department. It's a good WR if you are interested, a lot of my classmates were not film studies majors. Amazing film selections.",
    "Great course - definitely need to take this if you're a film major, and should consider it if you're not as well. Really interesting to learn about a wide variety of cinemas from around the world, as well as about different approaches to viewership\/analysis\/etc. and how they relate to one another...tons of interconnected topics and cool things you've never heard of before and totally worth taking."
