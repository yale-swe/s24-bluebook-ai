   "comments": [
    "This class was amazing! Readings could be lengthy and a bit boring but I was always excited to come into class, which is saying a lot for a section that meets at 9am on a Monday. I was put off a bit at first by the course description because it described a lot of really weird fan practices that I wasn't sure I was ready to dive into. I'm so glad I did because you learn so much about things that you'd never otherwise consider, and Bo made sure class discussions were always legitimately fun and interesting. She can be kind of a harsh grader but I promise you'll be a better writer after taking her class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course. It was really fun, and it gave me the opportunity to stretch beyond my comfort zone in writing.",
    "I shudder to think where I would be if I hadn't chosen to take 114. When I compare myself as a writer before taking 114 to the writer I became as a result of my time in 114-- those are two completely different people.",
    "English 114 is an intro level writing class that allows students to transition from high school to college level writing. This course is ideal for first semester freshmen who are looking to improve their writing skills.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, especially if you're an avid fan of anything at all. I learned so much about writing, and about fandom, and I've become a more critical consumer of media.",
    "I absolutely loved this class and would recommend it to anyone, whether you consider yourself a good writer or not. I thought I was a good writer in high school, but this class made me challenge that notion because college academic writing is different than what I was used to. The readings for this class were great and they made me look forward to doing the reading. I can honestly say that this class has made me a better writer and I am incredibly happy that I took it.",
    "ENGL 114 16 is about fan culture and is really interesting because fan culture permeates so much through society today. The class is really really interesting even if you think you have no interest in fan culture. The readings are kind of annoying and take a bit of time but it's really not too bad. Not a lot of work.",
    "This was a great course! The professor was very knowledgeable, prepared, and well-versed in the subject. On a more personal level, she genuinely cared about me as a person, and she was extremely kind and personable. I would definitely recommend this course, although I do think some interest in fan culture is necessary. The material was very interesting, but you will spend the entire time discussing it, so make sure you are very interested."
