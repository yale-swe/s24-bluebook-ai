   "comments": [
    "This class is amazing. It has a lot of work and a lot of reading, but it is totally worth it.",
    "A thoughtful investigation. Professor Dudley is really amazing. This is a gem of a class.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in ethnography. Some of the books are more interesting than others. It was a small class but discussion was good.",
    "I would if you have a pretty good working knowledge of some anthropological theory. I didn't have a very strong background in it. I believe that taking Intro to Cultural Anthro would be a good prereq for this class. The professor is very smart, and the discussions are interesting. Most of the books you read are interesting- some are hard to get through. Tough grader, but fair.",
    "This class is amazing. Every anthropology or American studies major should take it (other people should too!). I learned a lot about the theory and practice of ethnography, the difference between anthropology and sociology, and anthropological theory. Professor Dudley pushed us to be very clear when we spoke using theoretical terms, and even when we used words like \"community\" that most of us are used to throwing around without really thinking about. The books we read were all really interesting, and making connections between them was challenging and fun. I learned a lot about many different individual American communities, how to study a community, and what a community means.I left this class most days feeling really excited and inspired, like we had all worked hard together to try to understand something, and had gotten somewhere. That's what you want from a seminar, but I've never gotten it like I did in this class! Definitely take it!!",
    "American Communities is a rare and awesome course. The reading list is 12 books, and you'll actually have to read all of them, but also, you'll actually want to. The class discussions (assuming you get a good group of people, and we did) are interesting and people come at things with very different points of view. The syllabus is varied enough that if you don't like a book one week, you'll have a very different book to look at the next week. The class was very accessible to someone who had never done anthropology before without being all surface-level stuff. The three essays are tough, and long, but structured and not as hard as you might expect as long as you've done the reading. Highly, highly recommended."
