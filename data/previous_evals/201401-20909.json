   "comments": [
    "I would take this class if you can get in. However it's more work than it seems. Don't let the name of the class fool you - you'll be learning real physics. Class is a little boring, but pay attention to do well on the in-class quizzes.",
    "This is not a gut. It helps if you have prior knowledge of Physics going into the class. It's a very interesting class taught on an intriguing topic. Strengths: very interesting and easy to relate to Weaknesses: Lacked structure in teaching and grade percentages not accurately represented",
    "Take it if you liked physics or think you might!",
    "I would summarize it as a beginning physics course taught through the lens of action movies. I would recommend it as a beginning science course because it is a fun course and teaches beginning physics well.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who would like to learn basic physics and who is willing to internalize the concepts until he or she understands them. Do not take this class if you are looking for an easy A, but do take the class if you want to understand physics (and if that's the case, you'll probably indeed then get an A).",
    "I recommend the class, but be prepared to put in A LOT of work.",
    "It is a great class to take. Fun way of learning basic Physics if you have not taken Physics in high school before. You do have to put in some effort into it but it is very manageable.",
    "Movie Physics with Prof. Irons is great. He works hard at the beginning of the semester to make sure that the people he admits to the class are pretty much on the same page physics-experience-wise, which helps make the classroom an environment where people actually learn and don't feel embarrassed about how much they know or don't know. He keeps lectures interesting and varied and homework assignments are of varying difficulty levels but never overwhelmingly hard. Also, you'll have a Piazza page for the class, so you can post questions and get help from other students and from Prof. Irons when you're doing homework. The final exam was tough, but the fact that we had a final project, weekly quizzes and pre-quizzes probably helped our grades quite a bit. Yale sometimes seems to have a dearth of truly \"introductory\" STEM classes, but movie physics is one of them -- not a gut, really, but an extremely doable class for those of us who lack physics and calculus experience. I highly recommend it.",
    "In this class students study the different topics in physics and then apply them to films to see if the films are scientifically correct. It is an interesting course and I feel that anyone interested in science and movies would enjoy it."
