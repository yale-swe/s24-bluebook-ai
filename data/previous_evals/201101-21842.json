    "This class is a great science credit. However, don't go into theclass thinking it will be a gut course - it is not. There isn't a whole lot of outside work, but the midterms and the final paper aren't a piece of cake (especially the midterms). However, Professor Turner is a great lecturer and I truly enjoyed going to lecture twice a week to hear him speak. Also, we get to watch movies in class - what could be better?",
    "This class taught me to not take things that you might find interesting and you don't need. Most of the time, these classes seem interesting until you get tested on the material. I would not take this class unless you're an E&EB major.",
    "Yes! It's very interesting and lectures are usually enjoyable",
    "This is a good class if you're interested in parasites, pathogens, and infectious diseases, and Paul Turner is awesome. However, the main focus of the class is not necessarily epidemic diseases that affect humans, so if that's what you're looking for, then this might not be the right class for you. Also, E&EB 122 is listed as a pre-requisite, but it's not necessary.",
    "Great bio class to take. So much fun. The only enjoyable science class I've ever taken here.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone interesting in thinking more broadly about the world around them, specifically as it relates to host-parasite systems --which are much more prevalent in nature on various scales than I originally thought. If you're curious about the topic, at least shop it -- it was definitely worth it for me.",
    "I would take it. It is interesting and a different kind of bio class.",
    "I liked this class. Professor Turner is a good lecturer and the material isalways interesting and presented well. There is a required section - which counts for 20% of your grade. It is certainly not a joke. For non-majors, it is a non-lazy yet still reasonable science credit. For majors, don't expect to be at the top of the class. Your papers and section participation might be better, but I didn't feel as if the tests were easier for majors than for non-majors. They were pretty long!",
    "Yes. Any student with a remote interests in infectious disease biology should take the course.",
    "If you're interested in parasites and the diseases they spread, absolutely.",
    "This is a great course. The lectures are very interesting and the material is definitely accessible. The readings get a little tough and the final paper is daunting, but it's definitely worthwhile.",
    "I would recommend the course. As a non-science student, I would recommend it as a Cr\/D\/Fail course, because it can get deceptively hard in the second half of the semester. Also, the final paper is very long (20 pages). That said, if the topic interests you, Prof. Turner is a really great lecturer.",
    "This is a great class! You will have a very BROAD view of infectious diseases and their ecology and evolution. The paper is very rewarding.. make sure you pick your topic early! I thought the exams were VERY long (8-9 pages for a 50 minute period) and quite difficult, but overall I'm happy I took the class.",
    "YOu won't learn as much as you think you will...",
    "Don't take this class. The lectures were interesting and engaging, and there wasn't much reading each week, but what we were assigned to read was way over our heads. Section and lecture were so disjointed, and it was mainly just painful trying to make it through the readings. Also, the final paper-- a 16-20 page paper on an infectious disease-- was extremely difficult to write because we were instructed to only use journal articles, which no one really understood.",
    "This is a good interesting class. Go into it expectin an ecology and evolution focus though. Final paper is very long and annoying.",
    "A very interesting course which will change your perceptions of disease. Turner is an awesome lecturer.",
    "Definitely a class worth taking. A bit of emphasis on memorization over concept-learning, but a great class for anyone interested in parasites or infectious disease.",
    "EEB 228 is a cool class. It's interesting and not too much work. I would recommend it to non-science majors as a fun science class that doesn't require too much background knowledge; however, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to EEB majors because it overlaps with several other classes in the department.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes! It was a great class. There's no real textbook and the material is very manageable.",
    "It was a good experience. I have never taken any evolutionary biology before and it was an enjoyable class - still challenging and interesting.",
    "Don't go into the class thinking that this will be solely about infectious diseases. There's a good amount of concepts from EEB that one should be familiar with before going into the class. That being said, it is not a difficult class, pretty low key, and very enjoyable.",
    "EEB 228 is designed as an introduction to parasitology and infectious disease.It provides a broad overview of antibiotics, parasites, disease, and the role of evolution in modern disease, as well as requiring students to specialize in a disease of their choice. It is intended to inspire curiosity and encourage people to pursue the field farther. Therefore the class is very intellectually stimulating and a joy to attend each day. I would recommend this class to another student. The workload in this class is pretty light throughout the semester. However, the exams are long for the time allotted and the final paper is eight to ten pages long, single spaced."
