    "Yes, I think its an important, and interesting course providing you like the reading.",
    "I took DS almost entirely for the second semester of H&P, and I wasn't disappointed. If you read anything the entire year, read Arendt! And Professor Gordon is amazing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Professor Gordon organizes our section with an artist's exquisiteness.",
    "You're going to love class with Professor Bruce Gordon. He's at once attentive to the progression of the class' discussion and hands-off enough that a back-and-forth between students can maintain a great conversation that illuminates the texts we're exploring. One of the best parts of class that I hadn't experienced in other classes was when he'd have us break into groups of two or three and talk for about five minutes about a paragraph or so apiece. The groups then came back together and all said their takeaways from the passage. These passages made the rest of the things we looked at so much clearer. And then the discussions themselves are wonderful with his guidance. His comments on essays are really helpful and give critical advice even on A papers, which is really helpful for getting your writing that one step better. And (for our class) he would always have lunch in Pierson to talk with students who wanted to stop by. Do it. You'll be glad you did.",
    "An introduction (very nuanced, but still only an introduction) to the defining historical and political works in a mostly Western, but increasingly global, world. I recommend this for anyone interested in...any history, really.",
    "Would recommend course to another student who was interested in the subject matter, workload is a definite consideration."
