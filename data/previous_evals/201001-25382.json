   "comments": [
    "I'm not sure to summarize, because, in all honesty, I'm not sure what I learned. I would reccommend it for an easy WR credit, but I would warn the student that it's not as fun or as interesting as you may expect.",
    "Interesting course for those who are in to history of science\/medicine and issues of sexuality, culture. More scientific focus than cultural, though, at times.",
    "This is a must take class if you are even at all interested. The great thing about this course is that the learning is so personal, and the concepts and ideas i've taken away from this class I feel will stick with me for the rest of my life.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend it. The course overviews the development of the study of sexuality (all kinds of sexuality, including fetishes, sadism, etc. not just homo\/hetero sexuality.)",
    "It doesn't matter what you're interested in. Take this class. According to the syllabus, this course is a survey of the development of scientific and pseudoscientific literature on human sexuality, but really it's a course on everything. I kid you not. I've used lessons from this class in all my other classes and often in everyday life. Prof Trumpler is brilliant-- the class discussions she provokes are always interesting and often hilarious. She asks great questions and is very reasonable about deadlines for papers. I'd especially recommend this course to students interested in the sciences. If you go into this class with mind and ears open, it will totally shake up how you view the discipline.",
    "I would recommend it to anybody interested in the broader issues which this class deals with and as an introduction to WGSS in general.",
    "It is an interesting class that challenges your world view and makes you realize the power relations and societal mechanisms behind the ideologies we tend to take for granted - whether values that have to do with how we express our sexuality or values completely unrelated to the topic of the class. It also is good for teaching you how to analyze primary sources and to work in Manuscripts and Archives. A good freshman seminar. It really takes you step by step through the writing process as well so you know exactly what is expected of you for each paper, so it is very possible to do well. You're expected to participate, everyone has to say something in the beginning of each class about what they thought about the reading. The class is not so much about what makes you gay (somehow everyone is always saying you shouldn't be curious about this - but it's an interesting question) but about the nature of society's view of sexuality over time and how it changes, who challenges it, etc.",
    "History of sexuality provided an intriguing approach to altering not only the way one perceives sexuality, but also how one conveys his or her point of view through writing or reading a wide array of texts.",
    "Take this class!! It's just plain fascinating. I come from a very conservative community, and being able to talk about sexuality in an academic setting was very liberating. Professor Trumpler makes this class. She's knowledgeable, considerate, understanding, and funny. The class isn't too much stress, which in my opinion, enables you to take more away from it. Sometimes readings can be quite lengthy, but the discussions you have about them make the readings well worth your time. Take it, and you'll learn a lot!!",
    "Yes, the course teaches how to read data and compare scientific studies."
