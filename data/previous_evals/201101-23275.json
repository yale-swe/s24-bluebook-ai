    "As Andy Eggers is leaving, this course won't be offered again under his leadership, which is an enormous pity. His knowledge, commitment and dedication combined to create what has been the most intensive intellectual experience of my time at Yale. I am truly grateful to have had the opportunity to take such a remarkable course with such a remarkable professor.",
    "Vote buying+campaign finance (mostly this) leading up to Citizens United+lobbying\/disclosure. I understand A LOT about these things now but you have to find these things interesting. You need to enjoy the intersection between economics and politics that forms the umbrella of \"Money in Politics.\" I really liked Andy Eggers and thought that I learned a lot. I didn't love the discussion format, but I know that some people love a class where they sit around and talk about the readings. Andy Eggers is leaving, so I'm not sure how relevant these responses will be for any of you reading this.",
    "Take it, except Eggers won't be here next year.",
    "Money in Politics was a look at the varying means of corruption in politics through monetary influence, and how it can be stamped out, or at least reduced.",
    "Take it -- you will not regret it.",
    "I would recommend this class because it's a subject that may not be covered in other classes--how money affects politics and vice versa.",
    "Fantastically well-taught and designed course exploring the theoretical and practical aspects of money in democratic electoral politics. I find this sort of material to be fascinating, and this course was perfect.",
    "This is a great course: interesting subject matter that is extremely prevalent to current events. The reading requirements are not overbearing and helpful in learning the material fully, and Professor Eggers is extremely helpful, encouraging, and skilled in leading class discussion.",
    "Absolutely- unfortunately he's leaving, but if he ever comes back, do your best to get in.",
    "An interesting course"
