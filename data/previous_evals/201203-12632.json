    "Definitely! This class was incredible! Take it! Your entire perception of the body will change and for the better!",
    "Great overall coverage of the significance of the body and how it was represented through the ages. Very interesting material. Most weeks very manageable. Midterm and final papers were actually fun to write!",
    "Excellent course! Lots of reading, but the amount of writing isn't bad (4 \"thinkpieces\", 1 midterm paper, 1 final (~12-14 pgs)). We to visit some of the primary sources we read about in class that are in Yale archives, and go to the Bodies exhibit in NYC during fall break - definitely worth it! The professors are wonderful people, class is interesting. The topics are extremely relevant to everyday life, and make you leave the classroom with more questions and a more in-depth analysis of what goes on around you (sexuality, media, race, and so much more!). I would definitely recommend to a HSHM student. Probably better to take if you're not a senior since it is a seminar course. Take advantage of the knowledge of the professors and all of the resources at Yale!",
    "yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The historical topic covered are very interesting on their own, but the course's forum\/discussion style created a very effective mix of current events topics as well.",
    "This was my first seminar course at Yale (hello, large science lecture courses and my unfortunate luck in the freshmen\/intro course roulette) and I had quite high expectations for it. Thankfully, they were for the most part, all met: I found most of readings and themes interesting and enjoyed the class discussions with the professors and my fellow classmates. I wish I had a bit more time to devote to the class (a couple of my short pieces were a bit rushed and cringe-worthy in restropect) but that was the fault of my scheduling decisions.",
    "Very interesting topic, but very woman heavy (which I should've figured since it's cross-listed with WGSS). LOTS of readings and the professors were very tough graders. Despite that, they really helped me develop critical thinking skills necessary for history.",
    "A very fun course. Every week was interesting, and the professors were great. They essentially let us discuss what we felt was important from the reading each week, which was nice. The only weakness was that you do not leave the class with a holistic comprehension of the \"history of the body\"--rather, you become an expert each week on a number of specific topics. I'm not sure if there is any way to avoid this, being such a large topic, but when I took the class I expected a more structured presentation of the history. That being said, the topics we did focus on were interesting and engaging.",
    "This class is one of those ones where you ask a lot of questions and talkabout them at length without ever really resolving anything. For some that is frustrating but even still I learned a ton that I will take with me. They also challenge you to be a better writer, reader, and to more effectively communicate, so you are getting two classes for the price of one. I would recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! The discussion is engaging and the material is interesting."
