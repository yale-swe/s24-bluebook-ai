   "comments": [
    "Amazing class. Pogge is such a good professor, he's pretty funny and you learn so much from him. His explanations about Marx Hegel and Rawls are amazingly simple, accessible and if you're into philosophy and political philosophy you don't want to miss this.",
    "I would certainly recommend Philosophy 178 to anyone who wants to dive right into political philosophy. The work is a lot, but you can learn a lot from the course as well. Professor Pogge is a world expert on Rawls and an excellent teacher.",
    "Take Smith's political philosophy instead, even if you're a philosophy major.",
    "great intro to most of the major liberal philosophers. pogge is great: very knowledgeable, amusing, clear. You'll learn a lot and it will help you think about politics better. the workload is manageable, 2 short papers a long paper and a final isn't bad although if you do ALL of the reading it is a lot. just do the minimum and use summaries\/other philosophers critiques and you will be fine as far as workload. the reading is mostly interesting anyway if you like philosophy.",
    "It is good to think on these things, to understand the groundings of you own beliefs about the role of government.",
    "An overview of the classic political philosophers.",
    "Covers major political philosophers. There's a good amount of reading every week. The course felt rigorous, since we had to critically evaluate the philosophers in our essays. I think, despite its challenge, it's still a good introductory course for learning to write philosophy papers and to read philosophy.",
    "Amazing class. Intense, challenging and rewarding. It greatly develops your critical thinking, challenges your assumptions about the world and politics, and compells you to clarify your own ideals. You will get to study the most important and ineteresting authors in history. Pogge is awesomely intelligent. Take it!!!",
    "Take it only if you're interested but, if you are, you're in for a real treat.",
    "great intro to the major...you'll really enjoy itif you're not big on philosophy papers, watch out for those. the class isn't out to get you, but i recommend spending extra time with the material if you want to get the grade you desire",
    "Take this class if you want to learn about political philosophy: you will not regret it. Please notice the number of readings you are required to take every week (200-250 pages per week).",
    "I wide ranging intro to political philosophy class. Take it if you want to tick off everyone from Plato to Rawls.",
    "If you feel like you lack a full understanding of political philosophy--take the course. It's a very good introduction, but be prepared to read a book a week.",
    "I took this class instead of Prof. Smith's because I wanted a smaller class as opposed to a huge lecture. That I got. Prof. Pogge also has a more comprehensive reading list, I think, which is something to consider if you're willing\/able to put in the time, and what you hope to get out ofa class like this.Prof. Pogge is very knowledgeable, but lectures were a little dry sometimes. Also, I think he assumes that we've all read most of these works before. While that may be true for some people, it certainly wasn't true for me--and I don't think it's really a fair assumption, given that the class is an introductory course. The reading load is immense (but you can skip around and do just, just fine), but the writing assignments (2 short papers and 1 longer one) are totally manageable.Section was insufferable. You should check to see who the TA is\/who your TA would be if you took Prof. Smith's class instead in making a decision (if you're deciding between the two).",
    "For someone with little formal background in philosophy, it was an excellent introduction to the main ideas of many important philosophers throughout history. A little rushed and doesn't get too deep into any individual philosopher's ideas, but that's unavoidable. Don't take it unless you're ready to listen to some intense lectures and do a lot of reading, but if you do those things it's a fantastic experience.",
    "yes. 100 percent.",
    "It's a good introduction to great philosophers, but it is a lot of reading, and you're expected to get through material quickly. Pogge's lectures are great, often funny and always thought-provoking. It is a class where unless you're willing to work you won't get much out of it. That being said, I got the impression that effort was rewarded in addition to clear thinking and good analysis."
