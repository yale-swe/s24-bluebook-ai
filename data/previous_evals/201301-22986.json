    "If you take it credit D you will not have to do much work and as a consequence learn very little... It's really interesting so I kind of wish I had not taken it 2nd semester senior year just so that i would actually do the readings. Kind of sad that I took it credit\/ D",
    "Absolutely take this class! Even Cr\/D or just for fun, these issues are important and will no where else be better articulated.",
    "I had heard lots of amazing things about con law, but was actually quite let down. This could possibly be because my expectations were too high, or it might have been because, while con law was a solid class, it was not amazing. Amar's lectures don't have very much structure. Section is great though, because all of the TAs are pretty much superhumans who have done absurdly amazing things with their lives. Grading was fine, a little harsher than I was used to, but nothing too horrible.",
    "If you already know a decent amount about the Constitution and US history, you won't get too much out of this course. Amar's lectures aren't the greatest and he doesn't cover the material in an organized fashion. That said, if you are willing to do the reading, I think you can take away quite a bit from the course. I'm not sure how much I would have gotten out of it had I taken the course Cr\/D though.",
    "A comprehensive overview of constitutional case law. Take it if you like American politics and want to be a more informed citizen.",
    "A good course that will introduce you to law and current events if you were not exposed to those areas before, but still a tiny bit of a challenge. They say section is optional; it is not. ELECT A SECTION. It will save your butt. Also make sure you keep up with readings and go to lunches and read the NY Times over breakfast each morning. Don't bring food into the auditorium",
    "Take the class Credit\/D\/Fail unless you want this class to be your main focus throughout the semester. I haven't done a page of reading and haven't been to lecture or section in 2+ months and I still did solidly on my midterm and paper. While the final is worth a massive 50% or 60% of your grade, it's not a concern if you're using a Cr\/D\/F on this class.Prof. Amar is quite the engaging lecturer, though he also loves the sound of his own voice.",
    "ConLaw was overrated, but still good. Amar is a brilliant scholar, but he spends a lot of time restating points made in the last lecture and restating the importance of things. Section is great, though: the TFs are all accomplished and very articulate, and they'll explain concepts very clearly and concisely.You'll learn more about strictly legal reasoning. If taken for a letter grade, it will require a lot of reading and studying to do well (the TFs in general are rigorous). Take it Cr\/D to save yourself the stress.",
    "Con Law doesn't live up to the hype, but it's still a great course. Prof. Amar is kind of disorganized during lecture, and some cases get a lot more treatment than others. It's a great class to take Credit\/D, since it's a lot of reading, and you will learn a lot just by listening to Amar talk and reading briefs of the cases online.",
    "He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.",
    "Absolutely take the class. Getting an A is definitely within everyone's capabilities, so long as you do all the reading, which can get quite long. Otherwise just take it CDF, definitely worth taking either way. All the TAs have amazing qualifications, so definitely take it with a section too.",
    "I think you'll get out of it what you put in. I didn't put in that much, so I didn't get that much out.",
    "Nope. Or if you do take it credit\/d because there's no wayt o get through the reading.",
    "Do not take it. You will regret wasting your time when there is so much better stuff to take at Yale.",
    "This class covers a lot of landmark cases that help you understand the Constitution and the American government better. However, be warned that this is Con Law from Akhil Amar's point of view, which means that lectures often center on Amar's opinions rather than the concrete details of each case. That can make things very confusing if you are not up-to-date with all the readings (and there are a lot of readings). I personally did not think this year's Con Law class lived up to the hype, but I do not regret taking it. This is a fabulous class to take Cr\/D, and you get a lot out of it even if you don't read the entire casebook.",
    "Not the must-take class people made it out to be. Amar is a great guy, not a great lecturer.",
    "Great class to take Cr\/D. It's a TON of work if you take it for a grade, but you can get by doing very little of the reading taking it Cr\/D, assuming you go to the lectures and pay attention. The exams are take home, open note, open internet, ect (just don't contact any friends in the class during the time of the exam), so it's pretty easy to get at least a C if you go to lecture. The 5 page paper is super easy, you just write a reaction to one of the cases we talked about in class. And section is optional, I didn't take it but friends that did said section really added a lot to what they got out of the course. If you have an interest, or think you might have an interest, in con law, I would take it Cr\/D.",
    "Definitely worth taking, but ultimately a disappointment. Lectures started out AMAZING but Professor Amar became very disorganized as the course progressed. Taking it for a grade was a bit stressful come final-time, as it's more-or-less impossible to do all the reading. Probably a good Cr\/D option",
    "If you are interested in the subject, can deal with sometimes rambling lectures, and are able to do a lot of reading, you will love this class. Also a great class to Credit\/D if you can't commit to the work but like the subject.",
    "This course was a huge disappointment. I had been looking forward to taking it since Bulldog Days, and perhaps my expectationswere too high from the excellent quality of that lecture and the multiple years of stellar reviews. However, it quickly devolved into what I would generously call \"Things According to Prof. Amar,\" which 80% of the time were incoherent ramblings on topics only tangentially related to the cases we needed to cover. Most of the actual teaching was left to TAs, who were incredibly frustrated\/frazzled by this--but they thankfully were very good. However, it was incredibly frustrating to be far behind the syllabus each week and not cover important topics. A class that assigns 300+ pages of reading each week needs to be at the very least a solid Political Science lecture, and this is a far cry. Regardless of what I say, you're probably dazzled by Amar (yes, he is brilliant) and going to take this class anyway. Hopefully the quality will go back to what it was in previous years.",
    "I'm sure this will be said a lot, but this is an AMAZING class. I'm an MCDB major who just decided to take this class on a whim, and it has completely changed the way I look at the law. The class will, however, be a lot of work. If you want the full experience, you will really have to keep up with all the hundreds of pages of reading per week.",
    "A crash course in constitutional law, but be aware you need to do a lot of reading\/asking questions\/thinking outside of class, otherwise you will not understand what is going on nor will you learn.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking it if you are willing to put in the work. This class is very demanding if you take it seriously, and completing the readings is very rewarding and leads to a better grasp of the overall material covered in lectures.",
    "Constitutional law is a phenomenal class, but you should make sure you are really interested in law beforehand or take it Credit\/D\/Fail. There is a ton of reading (usually around 200 pages or more a week), which can be hard to keep up with if you have other difficult courses. However, the class will definitely help you figure out if you would like law school or not. Professor Amar teaches a Constitutional Law class in the Law School and you will read most of the same cases. Overall, this is a great class that will provide you with the fascinating history of our Constitution.",
    "Interesting, take it credit D. You'll thank me later.",
    "Great course, with a lot of work. You will leave truly understanding the constitution.",
    "Strengths: 1) Learned the most from this class of any I've taken this semester, since it's a very fast-paced introduction to legal thinking and analysis, which most of us haven't been exposed to. 2) My TA was the best TA I've had at Yale, 3) I have a greater appreciation for the Constitution and its complexity and learned a lot about the structure of government, how the law works, etc. 4) Exams are FUN, not about regurgitation, it's all about applying the theories and cases you've learned.Weaknesses: 1) Amar is clearly very intelligent and influential, but I found his lectures to meander and repeat a TON... Not sure how many times he randomly talked about DOMA. Also, huge name-dropper. 2) It's not life-changing, and definitely didn't inspire me to go into law. To me, Con Law showed me that \"the law\" - which imagines itself to be a strict, principled, rule-obeying field - can be incredibly arbitrary, irrational and loose in its analytic rigor. Some people will love that \"flexibility,\" but I found it unnerving how unaware law seems to be of its human imperfection.",
    "Very interesting course, and I actually enjoyed taking the tests. The class is a ridiculous amount of reading though - to be ready for the tests, you don't necessarily have to do all of it but you do have to know all the cases and their significance. I'd definitely recommend it credit D. Take it for a letter grade if you're feeling brave.",
    "Great class, and like everyone is probably saying on here, you should definitely take it before you graduate.",
    "Great to Credit\/D\/Fail",
    "Take it A-F if you can spare time for reading. An A- is achievable with effort. All comes together at the end. Very unique course. Great TAs, but shop around.",
    "GOTTA LIVE THAT KREDIT\/D\/PHAIL LYFEEE",
    "Take it!",
    "Take it Credit\/D\/Fail",
    "Take this course if you want to gain exposure to case law or want to learn about American history from a legal point of view. The readings are long, the midterm\/final are necessarily stressful, but overall the course is worth taking in order to better inform your decision to or not to go to law school.",
    "This is a good and interesting class, though a fair amount of work and not the life-changing, Yale-defining experience its greatest advocates claim it to be.",
    "It's a great class, but if you're not prepared to do a lot of reading and a lot of studying for the exams (which are actually difficult to get an A on), take it credit\/D! I took it credit\/D and loved it.",
    "Yes, definitely take it! And absolutely take it with a section, so helpful and you'll definitely get way more out of it.",
    "yes, I think it is a class that everyone should take, given its relevance in our would today. Lectures are great and so are many of the TAs. the reading is A LOT but i took it credit\/d so that made it much better.",
    "Yes, with reservations. Take this class credit D. It's more fun and less stressful that way. That said, fascinating and worthwile.",
    "Great class to take if you think you might be interested in law school. It will tell you whether you might like it or not.",
    "Alot of reading, but you get a good understanding of what a law school class will be like. Take it if you are considering law school or are interested in US government.",
    "This is a very entertaining, informative survey of constitutional law. You'll learn a ton, and Professor Amar is extremely knowledgable andenthusiastic about the subject; lectures are a whirlwind. You'll get a lot out of the class even if you take it credit-D and don't do most of the reading; you'll get much more out of it if you put in your best effort. The TA's are all brilliant, and this class really opens up your mind to legal thinking and constitutional issues and argumentation.",
    "This is what I want to do with my life",
    "This is the epitome of an overhyped, overrated class at Yale. PRofessor Amar's first few lectures are AWESOME...then they quickly devolve into repetitive rants. By the middle of the semester, over half of the lecture would be spent recapping the previous lecture, often only leaving half an hour for any new material, by which point it was hard to refocus. Amar is a great lecturer when he wants to be, and the class material is fascinating, but be willing to do a lot of reading if you want to get anything out of the class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. If you are interested in the Constitution, constitutional law, the Supreme Court, or America in general, this is the class to take. Professor Amar is very passionate about the subject and a great lecturer. Discussion sections are optional, but you should take one because they are very interesting and helpful. The only drawback to this class is the amount of reading, so be prepared to read a lot of cases or make sure you have the time to look over cases extensively to keep up with the class.",
    "It was a good introduction to how to make constitutional arguments and I feel like a more informed citizen after having taken it. However, Professor Amar's lectures often felt very scattered, so I would definitely recommend taking it with a section. A lot of reading too!",
    "If there were required classes at Yale, this class would totally be one of them. YES, you should take this class. Absolutely, yes.I was a second semester senior science major (aka I-don't-care-about-anything-except-leaving) and I LOVED this class. Professor Amar is an inspiration to us all; I particularly like more ranty professors and loved going to lecture. My TA was a rockstar in the law school and was super helpful by teaching us stuff Amar never got to, giving us extra practice for the midterm\/final, and providing loads of feedback on papers.Is this class a lot of reading? YES. Do you have to do all of it? NO. Is this class a lot of work? NO. Just take it and be a real informed citizen of the U.S. You're at Yale, you might as well.",
    "This has a reputation for being a hard class, but I didn't really find that to be so: you don't actually need to do all of the readings (or any of the readings if you're taking it credit\/d) and the take-home midterm and final, while obnoxious, aren't hard per se (as in, you don't need to have done all of the readings). However, I also found it to be vastly overrated - wouldn't even make top 5 classes I've taken at Yale, much less the best. Take it if you're looking for a class that you can credit\/d with minimal effort, or if you are really into politics and legal philosophy.",
    "YES..if you're like me in that ur genuinely interested in the material, maybe are thinking about being a lawyer, and are willing to read a lot. If not, shop it the first week to get a taste of how the class is going and to be and if this is the type of class u want to take.Taking it Credit\/D (I did) relieves a lot of stress because you wont have to do all the readings\/analyze it too much.Tests -- the midterm and final are take-home...so if ur taking it CreditD u wont even have to study. The final is 60% + u have a midterm and paper. Tests are not easy, but definitely reasonable. Everyone gets an option to take the midterm in 8hrs and the finals in 24hrs.Readings -- LOT of reading but I really enjoyed it. Never felt insurmountable, but it is a ton.Overall I'd recommend it if you're serious about Con Law!",
    "Take this course, keep up with the reading, join a section (Ben Cain's is great), go to the lunches with Amar (wonderful professor), take advantage of Amar's invitations, and have a wonderful semester.",
    "it had so much potential in the beginning. amar obviously knows the information but in the latter half of the course he presented the material in such a disjointed an incoherent manner. it would have been more helpful had we only done 10-15 major cases and really focused in on them like we did powell, mculloch, and marbury.",
    "Akhil Amar is passionate about constitutional law and generally has great insights. However, his lectures are scattered and the material on the midterm and final are an amalgamation of random things he's gone through over the course of the class - the questions are hypothetical case scenarios that test your knowledge of issues that Amar is concerned about, with broadly sweeping structure (e.g. a question will ask \"What should happen in this case?\" rather than \"How do past cases apply to this, what is the standard of review for this case, what are the arguments that could be made,\" etc, and are hard to answer without knowing exactly what is required of the response). Take it if you're interested in pursuing law as a career -- you'll find the class interesting. But be ready to be frustrated with the format of classes, the sheer amount of reading, and the open-endedness of the exam questions.",
    "Don't take it unless you're going to put in the work",
    "A fantastic course for students interested in law, politics, American history or just life in general. The fame and popularity of this class speaks for itself. It's also great that the TAs post their bios during shopping period so you can pick one whose interests match up well with yours (especially if you lean more conservative than your classmates--there's a couple of conservative TAs every year, which is nice). Also, I would not recommend taking this class with four other classes. I did so, and it was an intense semester. If you're one who is driven to do all the readings, there's 1154 pages of reading from the casebook, plus the hundreds of pages from the companion books. Amar will admit the first day that there's an inordinate amount of reading and that the class is very ambitious. He's not wrong, but that's the only time he reminds you, so beware. Lateron in the semester, he'll just casually assign hundreds of pages of reading and act like it's not that much. But he did warn you. Finally, as far as grades go, don't worry too much about what you get on the midterm because the type of questions asked are nothing like you've ever had to answer before. Just make sure you ace the paper and if you don't do Cr\/D, then take the extra time to do the research paper, which should guarantee you an A- in the course, and absolutely no less than a B+.",
    "Oh god. Save yourself the misery and don't take this class, especially if you are familiar with Con Law. Or if you do, join a section, do the reading, and never attend lecture. Akhil Amar is far too into himself to be a good teacher. For someone who studies law, it is remarkable how difficult it is for him to construct coherent sentences or lectures. And instead of teaching us the cases, he preferred to either a) go on historical tangents that were mildly stimulating at best, b) attempt, and fail, to teach us economic concepts...and spend more time on them than most Econ classes, or c) name-drop the many famous students he has had. Don't be mistaken, Akhil Amar is brilliant; and a lot of the ideas he has are pretty interesting; but he is so blindly convinced that he is right, that he is incapable of fairly expressing any side but his own. Also, don't let him convince you that he is an Originalist, because that's just silly. On the bright side, the TAs are all wonderful and really the only reason to take this class.",
    "Definitely. It is a great learning experience, especially for those considering law school. It teaches you A LOT about the constitution, and it is just a lot of fun.",
    "I'm copying and pasting my answer for strengths and weaknesses and adding a recommendation.Overall assessment: A strong course on an important subject taught by a high-profile that most students should probably take.Strengths: The materials is inherently fascinating. You'll leave the course having a new way of thinking. You'll be proud of your ability to analyze legal issues. Amar is often a humorous, entertaining, and engaging lecturer.Weaknesses: Amar goes off on wild tangents very frequently. Which I don't normally mind from professor, but it seriously detracted from the material.He also likes to name drop and his ego is very evident. Additionally, he \"reviews\" at the beginning of each class. I tend to like when professors give recaps, but these reviews can last an hour--meaning he'll only get to new material in the last 15 minutes. Sometimes it seemed there was very little movement forward. Finally, I say this is someone who loves con law and hasn't complained about large amounts of reading in the past: there was too much reading for this course--specifically with respect to what we actually managed to cover. Reading is fine, but asking your students to read hundreds of pages beyond what is actually covered in class is asking a lot.Recommendation: You should take this course, despite its weaknesses. I hope that problems this year were an aberration, since I know the course has been incredible in past years. The material is still really interesting, and if you don't understand the Constitution, you're really missing out. But actually. This is stuff is super important and so terribly misunderstood my most people, especially Yalies, who think they know a lot already (forgive my sanctimony...). You will undoubtedly enjoy elements of this class; it just may fail to amaze. I'd also recommend taking this with many friends. My experience was made 50 times better by having friends I could study with and also laugh with about some of the ridiculous shenanigans from lecture.",
    "Oh boy. So, Amar's lectures can be amazing and inspiring and packed with neat information, but generally I only felt this way on days that I did the reading in advance. This is really difficult, since there is a TON of reading in this class, most of it pretty dense. Amar says on the first day of class that it's a great Cr\/D\/F option, which is true on the one hand - it takes a lot of the pressure off (it's not hard at all to get a passing grade on the open-book, open-note, open-internet exams). On the other hand, I would say I got maybe 25% of what I could have gotten out of the class if I'd actually done all the reading. In retrospect, I kind of regret taking it Cr\/D because of this, but on the other hand, it's an insane amount of work if you don't take it that way. So make of that what you will. Great lecturer, will really solidify your understanding of why America is the way it is, but really freakin hard.",
    "This class should be mandatory for all Yale students. Constitutional Law is an essential part of an American liberal arts education, and this course in particular teaches an invaluable system of thought.",
    "Yeah, it's a good course, but I think the hype surrounding it sometimes sets expectations too high. I Credit\/D'd it which wasn't a bad choice. You get to go through some of the main cases, but it's not too stressful.",
    "I loved this class and would definitely recommend it to another student. Professor Amar knows his stuff, and though his lectures were sometimes all over the place, the material was fantastic and gave me a new perspective on current legal issues. But PLEASE don't take this as a freshman unless your other classes are really easy - you will get MUCH more out of this class if you can really invest in it (goes for all years, freshman or not). And trust me, from the perspective of a student who never used to miss a page of reading, the readings take a lot of investment and are impossible to keep up with.",
    "Choose your T.A. carefully it will make or break the class for you.",
    "Not all it's cracked up to be.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, but I think you should take it freshman or sophomore year if possible. Junior spring, I had way too many things outside of school keeping me busy and unable to put the time into this class that it deserves. I took it Credit\/D and definitely learned things, but I know I would have gotten much more out of it if I had taken it for a grade, done all the readings, and taken a section. Still, it's a good way to get a credit, learn about some important historical cases, and listen to a famous lecturer if you want to take it credit\/D. Just know that you won't get nearly as much out of it if you don't do the (extensive) readings.",
    "Definitely. For all the reasons I mentioned in the box evaluating the class and the instructor.",
    "If you have any interest at all in law, this is a must-take class. Even if you don't, it's just generally a good class to take. Amar is world-renowned, and it's easy to see why. But don't expect this to be a class in which you can just show up to lecture and do well. In fact, the lectures are not that useful, unless you just want more historical context about the opinions. You will definitely have to do ALL of the case readings (not so much the outside book readings), and DEFINITELY take it with a section. Your TAs are your number one resource, and go ahead and do the optional research paper if you can. As long as you are diligent with the readings, it isn't terribly bad. I'd recommend taking this as a sophomore or junior, though I took it as a freshman and did well.",
    "Take it credit\/D\/F if you can because the grading can potentially be tricky. Also, get ahold of the con law bible. It is better and more succinct than the case book.",
    "Great way to test out whether you want to go to law school. Really made me confident that law school is in fact for me",
    "It is equivalent to a first year law school course, and I recommend all who are interested in law take it.",
    "Prof. Amar is an out cat. He'll namedrop his \"friends\" Tony Kennedy and Ken Starr and all sorts of folks and expect you to have a tear in your eye because you go to Yale, and where else would we have this experience? He also digs talking about current events. Sometimes that's a bit silly, but it's mostly OK, you can hang in the SLB Auditorium balcony and pass the time away with some snarky comments\u00e2\u0080\u0094just don't be friends with the 5-6 folks who are just a bit too interested in being Amar's main man. (You'll soon know who they are.) But Amar's lectures give an interesting spin to an old subject. He's got his own way of doing things and that's pretty cool to see unfold at the lectern.Maaaaaaaaad reading for a lecture. But the tests ain't too hard.",
    "This class is so overrated",
    "No.",
    "It is a class I feel everyone should take sometime in their four years at Yale, not because it is the greatest lecture, but because it is a unique lecture and one that allows you to grow as a thinker and arguer. Take it Cred\/D\/Fail if you are not a PLSC major - it will take some of the pressure off. Also, make sure to enroll in a section. The TAs are so special and they will help to reinforce all you learn in lecture.",
    "Take it! You will learn a lot! and you can make it as work heavy as you want it to be!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. That said, I would warn them that it is a lot of reading (more than you think it will be) and not to take it along with other reading-heavy courses (which I personally made the mistake of doing).",
    "Must-take!",
    "It's a pretty decent course. Lots of casework and case readings, but if you like Amar's lecture style in shopping then give it a shot. It's still one of those classes that everyone should take at Yale, but there is a ton of work.",
    "i would definitely recommend this course to anyone! its a yale college classic.",
    "If you're considering law school at all, you should probably take ConLaw...the most useful thing about the course was that it showed me that I don't want to go down that path. I would only recommend taking ConLaw during a semester when you have the time to actually do the reading and go to class, and take it for a grade. The grading isn't that hard, you just have to do the work. Taking it Credit\/D, while relaxing, was kind of a waste of time. And DEFINITELY take a section, no matter what.",
    "I loved Con Law. If there's any chance you might be interested in law, or in American government, or in public policy, this is a course you need to take. Lots of fascinating readings (on a fairly flexible syllabus; you don't have to do everything, though you should do as much as you can), excellent sections, and substantive and compelling lectures from a superstar professor who makes an extraordinary effort to be available to his students. This is one of those courses that has a way of clarifying things for people: not just essential things about the origins and structure and spirit of American government, but littler things about the individual students who take it: whether they like reading cases, whether they like thinking and writing about these issues, whether they might want to do more work like this in the future. It's a lot of work, but it's not wildly difficult, and it's very rewarding. I'd recommend it unreservedly.",
    "Take this class. It's fascinating and it covers material that everyone pursuing a liberal arts education should know. I took it credit\/D and from what I've heard about the grading, that was probably a good decision.",
    "I would recommend this class Cr\/D for people who don't need this for their major. Reviews definitely fluctuate vastly because some people are really infatuated with Prof Amar and his opinions. That being said, those are only his opinions, so I would have liked a bit more of a holistic approach to what critics of these views might argue. I really enjoyed reading the cases, though, and I think that you get a lot more out of the class if you do the readings.",
    "Good class, important material, worth taking. Beware that Amar's lectures can be tricky to follow \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he rambles and goes on frequent tangents \u00e2\u0080\u0094 unless you know the material inside and out going into class.",
    "There is a lot of reading in this class--even if you only read the cases-- and you really should do it! It will make you a better American. You also really should take the optional section. Very worthwhile-- especially if Mike Shih is teaching again.",
    "It's very much a PoliSci class, as the 2 lectures\/week format simply isn't enough to dig really deep into the substance of Constitutional law. It's decent as an overview class, and Amar's lectures can range from mundane to exhilarating, but temper your expectations and you'll learn that you get as much out of this class as you invest in it (it's all about the readings).",
    "Constitutional Law taught me a lot, and it's all really relevant and important information for anyone who wants to be an involved citizen of the United States. Akhil Amar is passionate and an expert on the topic, but his lectures are not well organized, so if that is a problem for you, then don't take the class or take it Credit\/D. And TAKE A SECTION.",
    "Yes!",
    "This is a phenomenal overview of constitutional law, from ratification through the most recent constitutional challenges (think DOMA). Professor Amar is absolutely brilliant, and his lectures are always really insightful and entertaining. This was easily my favorite class I took during my freshman year. And this class isn't just for people who want to go to law school! I learned as much about history and politics as I did about the constitution itself. This is really a must-take class at Yale.Don't be scared off by the workload!! I almost was, and I'm so glad I took the class anyway. We only really discuss the reading in the casebook, and you definitely don't need to do all of it to enjoy lecture and do well in the class. A lot of people cr\/d the class, but I personally wouldn't recommend it. There is a lot of reading, but it's not all that hard to do well in the class. Besides, the midterm and final are both open-note, open-book, and open-internet.",
    "This is one legendary Yale course that lives up to the hype \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0Constitutional Law (the class and subject) is absolutely fascinating and essential for any Yale student. I looked forward to coming lecture twice a week from the beginning until the end of the semester. Amar can be very opinionated (much to the chagrin of some), but I found his passion more engaging than anything, and he's always careful to give other viewpoints. He's also clear that what he says is not fact, and for a subject with no real clear answers, I found the approach to be fair.Yes, there is a lot of reading, but you'll discover from lecture what's essential and what's optional (but still interesting). The exams are very fair and very flexible, and only one five-page paper is required. (An optional, longer paper can be written to count for part of your grade.) Even if section is optional, take one \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0it really helps to tie the ideas together.",
    "Go to the first class, then make your own decision as to whether you want to take it or not.",
    "Constitutional Law is an interesting class, although Professor Amar occasionally sounds more like an MSNBC pundit than a university professor. In many ways, his liberal bias benefits the class, making lectures more engaging and prompting student arguments afterwards. However, it sometimes makes for a distorted narrative. (Amar spent two lectures lamenting the partisanship in Bush v. Gore but practically excused FDR's court packing threat in a matter of sentences.)If you want a good introduction to Con Law, take this class and read some secondary literature by another more moderate or conservative scholar. Amar assigns three texts with his own name on them and \"America's Unwritten Constitution\" is not really worth your time.",
    "This is a classic Yale course. It is overrated, however. Akhil Amar is an inspiring professor but he also knows that he's brilliant and is very happy to share that and all his opinions with the class. He's a raging liberal (but also closet textualist) so his opinions generally speak well to the majority of the class, but it can still be irritating. I definitely feel like I came away with strong methodology for analyzing court opinions and Constitutional modalities, but that was more because of section than lecture. In lecture Amar harps on the same big themes a lot or it can be all over the place. For me, the class was worth it; I'm thinking about going to law school. But I'm not sure I would recommend it to other people unless you're really interested in it and\/or willing to take it Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "Despite some flaws, Con. Law is one of the most valuable courses I have taken so far. Prof. Amar's lectures are sometimes hard to follow, but the information covered was never tedious or boring. You will learn the processes of Constructional decision-making (asthe title of the casebook would imply) more than what is and is not constitutional. If you take the course, sign up for a section and go every time. The sections bring new perspectives and help cement an understanding of the material. For the same reasons, if possible, find a TA who is a polysci guy and not a law student.",
    "Yes take it! The reading is not nearly as bad as people say it is and you do not actually have to do all of it. I would do all of the cases, or at least all the ones that are important (you recognize most of them for AP U.S.) but don't worry about reading his books. I really enjoyed doing the optional paper and would highly suggest doing that as well.",
    "definitely. the reviews don't lie. I would recommend credit\/d though, not because it is particularly difficult, but because the workload is entirely overwhelming and its nice to just not have to worry about it.",
    "Interesting and relevant class. Glad I took it.",
    "This is a class that embodies Yale political science well. Professor Amar is an extremely passionate and interesting lecturer. Though sometimes his knowledge outpaces the classes and his lectures get convoluted, the readings help give the class direction and focus. There is a ton of reading for the class, but if you're willing to do it (or, more realistically, most\/some of it), you will get a lot out of the class. Definitely take it with a section - that was probably my favorite part of the class. The TFs are incredibly qualified\/knowledgeable and the sections create a smaller space to learn the lecture material, one where you can ask questions and be more engaged in the class than you possibly can in a lecture of ~400 kids. This class is important to take even if you're not majoring in Political science, it teaches you a lot about pop culture, the history of America, and the backbone of what makes us all citizens.",
    "Please don't think about or approach PLSC 233 entirely as a pre-law course. Though it can offer a valuable perspective for those wanting to know if they would enjoy the kinds of classes taken in law school, there is a reason why this class is listed in the bluebook as an UNDERGRADUATE course in the POLITICAL SCIENCE department. I stress this point because it wasn't clear when I signed up for the class, and it's this facet that became most valuable for me. The case law covered is not complete for a course of this nature because it's used to teach students about who makes constitutional decisions and how they make them. I would recommend this course for students who wish to acquire such an understanding. Putting this point to the side, you ability to enjoy this class will in part rest on your ability to appreciate and enjoy reading supreme court decisions. On a final note, this is definitely one of those classes that only offers as much as put into it as the quantity of reading so outweighs what can be covered in lecture and (optional but essential) section.",
    "I took ConLaw because I was curious about the Constitution. I thought it would be a good idea to be more familiar with the framework which I've been living under my entire life as an American. In reality, this class was less for people like me and more for future lawyers. I do not want to be a lawyer (ever) so I didn't enjoy it as much as other people.",
    "I would recommend people take this Credit D. I wish I had. The course material can be quite interesting, so long as it is communicated in an interesting way, which may or may not be the case when Amar lectures.",
    "Yes, a must-take at Yale. If you credit\/d it, make an effort to do at least some of the reading. It's hard to force yourself to do every week, but it makes the course that much better.",
    "It's a good class, but only as good as you make it. People hype up the class a lot, and I think it is only worthy of the hype if you put in the work. It's easy to get lost in the lectures if you didn't do the reading, and then you'll easily slip into a cycle of not going to class because you didn't do the reading, and not doing the reading since you are already behind. The material is fascinating, but there is a lot of it. There are also these huge sets of notes floating around from years past because it's just so hard to take notes from lecture. Thus you are even less motivated to do the work since you have these great notes and you can just Ctrl+F for the open book midterm and final!",
    "A great survey course that I would definitely recommend.",
    "A great way to get a grasp of the constitution and what it means today. Be prepared to do a lot of the reading and be self-disciplined about it, otherwise you won't get a useful experience from the class.",
    "A demanding class that gives you a small taste of law school. DO NOT take it as a freshman. Take it as a senior, or junior at best.",
    "Tough questions, great professor, engaging readings (but lots of them!), and smart classmates. Truly, a great class that I seriously doubt you'll regret taking. Take it, or at least shop it.",
    "ConLaw is an excellent class which will equip you critical analysis and legal skills. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "ConLaw is hugely overrated. A couple classes were strong, but I'd say a solid 60% of the lectures were misses.",
    "Amar did not live up to the reputation he has garnered, though it is still an interesting course.",
    "Take it if you enjoy reading cases\/enjoy law. Be aware that lectures aren't always the most useful. Don't expect Amar to give useful or amazing lectures (although they are usually worth attending). Take a section.",
    "Take this class if you have the chance. Don't let the amount of reading scare you; it is manageable and you will also find it to be very enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this course, but with reservations. Constitutional law is an excellent thing to learn. You will become a better informed person by taking it, and if you like thinking about legal issues, this class can be really fun. Do be aware, however, that the class also comes with a lot of reading, primarily consisting of Supreme Court cases, but also a fair bit of legal analysis. If you're into that, that's fine. One thing that was particularly concerning, though, was that Professor Amar seemed rather disorganized during his lectures - something the TAs who been in or seen the course taught before even agreed to. I don't know if this will be an issue when the course was taught again, Professor Amar may choose to give it a bit of an overhaul. But it seems like enough new developments in the law have taken place since the course was originally created that the syllabus has a hard time fitting them all within the structure of the course as it stands now.",
    "Constitutional Law is a course to center your semester on; do not approach it lightly. The readings are difficult to keep up with and there is a lot of material to learn. But getting through the class is a very rewarding experience and a wonderful new approach to American history.",
    "MY GOD YES JUST TAKE IT IF YOU DONT TAKE IT IN YOUR FOUR YEARS HERE YOU ARE JUST BEYOND STUPID.",
    "Take it whether or not you think you're interested in law school because it's important information to know, but be wary of over-achieving pre-law types. Also definitely shop sections before committing to one.",
    "If you care at all about the way the U.S. government runs, you should not miss this course, one of Yale's best. The reading is daunting, as are the midterm and final (30% and 60% of the grade, respectively), but the course material is great, and you, by no means need to feel obliged to read everything. The course is a little strange in that it doesn't focus at all on the Bill of Rights, but deals more with issues of Constitutional structure and text, as well as broader issues of Constitutional decision-making amidst the branches of government. Amar is fabulous, a passionate and dedicated professor. The TFs are also phenomenal.",
    "Yes, because you really need to study the constitution and how it's interpreted; it's not enough to read it by yourself.",
    "Take it!",
    "A thorough introduction to Constitutional Law with one of the top Constitutional scholars guiding you through case by case. Prof. Amar is incredibly enthusiastic about the material, and communicates that throughout the course. Class lectures give a sweeping overview and tend to emphasize the historical and political science aspects of how decisions are made, while exams focus on applying the finer details of the cases. Definitely enroll in a section if you can, as that's where you'll focus on the skills you need for exams. I would definitely recommend it, but be prepared to do a lot of reading unless you're taking it Credit\/D.",
    "Great class - so interesting, so relevant, absolutely take itbefore you graduate (and sooner is better than later), especially if you are not a Poli Sci major",
    "Constitutional Law is a course every student who plans to live in the US during their adult life should take. This course is vitally important because it teaches you to think about the Constitution rather than allowing talking heads on Cable TV to tell you about what the Constitution means. Far too many citizens are ignorant when it comes to rights and the Constitution. This course can set you on the right path. The course is also valuable because it will improve your critical thinking skills, your reading comprehension, and your ability to identify patterns in arguments."
