   "comments": [
    "This is an amazing class. It is philosophy oriented, but the material is accessible broadly. The reading isn't too heavy and it was interesting. I read almost all of it. I loved having Gwen as a teacher, and the class atmosphere was lively.",
    "Amazing class, take it if you can get in. It's fun, engaging, and especially exciting if you like philosophizing and arguing for 2 hours with the brightest minds on the planet.",
    "I don\u0092t know if Gwen plans to teach the class again, but if she does\u0097TAKE IT. It was a class that changed life in subtle ways, simply by making me reflect and consider and grow. The readings were short, the discussions were always long and interesting, and the papers were an absolute joy to write. Gwen is an incredible listener and teacher. Definitely the best class of the semester, and I\u0092m going to miss it dearly.",
    "The search for the meaning of life. Take this class!",
    "This class was about exactly what its name suggests. If you're interested in the subject, you'll enjoy the readings and discussions. The work load is minimal, and the experience is enjoyable.",
    "Interesting philosophy class that focuses on the humanistic approach to the meaning of life. I recommend it, especially if you are less interested with the semantics of philosophy and more focused on a general understanding of meaning of life.",
    "If it's offered again, take it - best class I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "Yes. Gwen is amazing, so are the readings."
