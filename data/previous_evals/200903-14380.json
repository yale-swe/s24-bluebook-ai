   "comments": [
    "I would summarise the class as an extremely interesting discussion of questions of genetics in the 20th century. This is an emerging field in science, let alone in history, and it takes a really interesting perspective on bioethics.I have no reservations in recommending this class to everyone (especially guys- we were very underepresented this semester!).There is a lot of reading, but I view that as a strength- some weeks there would be as many as 8 assignments, but it allows for a really wide and simultaneously deep overview of the issues at the time that would not be afforded if Professor Kevles were to only offer 1 or 2.",
    "Great class--LOT of work. Tough grading. NOT A GUT. MORE LIKE THE OPPOSITE. You'll get a lot out of it but you'll have to put in a lot of work.",
    "Overall, this was a great class. Sometimes Kevles' lectures got a little dull, but for the most part the material was fascinating and writing the papers was actually kind of fun.",
    "Genetics, Reproduction and Society is a very interesting history course covering a range of biological, political, and social issues from the middle of the 19th century through most of the 20th century. I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in the subject,and particularly for history and HSHM majors who need this class for credit.",
    "This course is actually quite interesting. Give the professor a chance. On the first day, I know a lot of people who shopped it quit because they thought the lectures seemed dry. Profesor Kevles is not only a very intelligent man, but also very engaging if you listen to what he says! This course is very enlightening and surveys a lot of the historical and societal causes behind the science. A bit reading heavy, but as long as you follow the lectures you should be all right.",
    "This course was very interesting. I did not expect to be so interested in the topics discussed in section or the readings, but they were great. The TAs are really good and Prof Kevles is organized. But he assigns the paper topics only one week before the deadline, which means everyone has to work around it to meet the deadline with a decent paper, which was very stressful this year and definitely hindered the quality of my work. The final is not easy - its a few IDs and 2 essays, the IDs are ok but the essays are hard to tackle. Work load for this class is not absurd, very manageable, but A LOT of reading to do! Interesting readings, but a lot of it.",
    "Lectures can be a bit dry but the readings are incredibly interesting and the material very topical and fascinating.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this to another student",
    "Really good course; if you're at all interested in intellectual property law or social choices based off of genetic information, take it; there's also a lot dealing with ethics in the readings and in section. Two papers and a final, so not heavy on the workload, but there's a lot of reading (not all of which you have to do). Definitely worth taking.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in the subject matter. We focused a lot on the Human Genome Project and in vitro fertilization and recombinant DNA.",
    "It was a good class. There were a lot of reading, but it was overall very interesting.",
    "This course surveys the histories of American and British eugenics, molecular biology, genetics, and reproductive technologies."
