   "comments": [
    "Would reccomend. Great class, not too harsh and short HW every night. Fernando Riva is the best teacher, absolutely awesome guy who teaches well and keeps you awake. Definitely reccommend.",
    "This class is made by its instructor. My instructor was absolutely astounding: Not just in his expertise in the Spanish language and its history, but also in the way he was able to bring his own studies to bear so fluidly on the class. He made learning the language seem very easy and fun--every day was engaging. This class is also extremely well organized; every component adds to your learning.",
    "I would recommend the class if that person were to have the professor that I did. Otherwise I would say that they could definitely do without it. I loved the class, but that wasn't because I loved the material-even though I do love the language-but because my professor did a great job.",
    "Most likely you have to take this class anyways. The grammar is mainly a review which is nice since it should all look familiar. Fernando Riva Camino is the best spanish teacher and I would highly recommend his class.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "I LOVE FERNANDO. HE IS AMAZING! He cares about his students, creates a relaxed atmosphere in class, and just wants his students to improve their spanish! Take this class with Fernando. You'll also read and watch interesting stories and movies!",
    "It is straightforward and allows you to develop your spanish speaking and writing skills.",
    "L3 was much better than previous levels. It moved though topics quickly but not before going through them thoroughly. I would recommend only if you need to fulfill a language requirement."
