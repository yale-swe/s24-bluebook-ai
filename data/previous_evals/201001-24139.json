    "Don't take this class unless you are willing to do a lot of tedious reading, before sitting through a long and frequently banal discussion.Zany is definitely a good word to describe professor Mayer. His knowledge is extensive, his perspectives interesting, and his willingness to engage students is good. This is tempered, however, by the fact that he frequently dominates discussion, is sometimes unclear, and can be hard to follow.If you're very interested in the topic of economic anthropology, and are willing to do ALL of the (many, many) readings (not the required 60%), and to work closely with the professor on the final paper, you will get a lot out of the course. Otherwise, you won't.",
    "I would definitely recommend Economic Anthropology to anyone who is interested in learning how economic and social behaviors are intertwined. It's a very specific course, though, so make sure you are super interested before you commit.",
    "I would recommend the course. I think it explores economics from an oft neglected yet very valuable perspective. What I found most interesting was the study of societies whose economies have yet to be fully transformed by capitalism.",
    "A lot of reading and not a lot of discussion. The course is definitely determined by the other students in the class (which was half undergrad\/grad students this semester). If you're really interested in the subject, definitely take a shot at it. Otherwise, be wary.",
    "If you are really into the subject matter, then it is worth taking.If you like economics or the Andes and have an interest in anthropology, the class might be for you. While there were some fascinating readings, economic anthropology, at least as taught in this class, isn't as interesting as it sounds. But on the other hand, the course really isn't as hard as the syllabus makes it sound either. Just make sure you have a good subject to write about going into the 25 page term paper."
