    "If you want to finish your senior project in Environmental Studies you will take this course. Try not to leave everything until the draft deadline and work on things in pieces. Good Luck!",

    "If you are an dEVST senior, you have no choice but to take it. That said, I enjoyed colloquium a lot this semester.",
    "As painful as it was at times to write the thesis, I'm really glad i had this experience.",
    "If you are an Environmental Studies major, the class is mandatory. I would highly recommend taking it.The class is essentially a once-weekly meeting to make sure that you are on target to complete your senior essay, and that you're not getting too panicked.",
    "you have to take it, but recommendation would be doing research over the summer!!!",
    "Write your senior essay! If you don't do it fast enough, you will meet the equivalent of a cattle prod.",
    "Definitely take it--great chance to bond with your major and a good opportunity to expand ideas for your senior thesis as well as get beneficial feedback on your major."
