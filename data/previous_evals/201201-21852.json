    "Other than the fact that Sharma seemed to expect us to read a book a week, this class was really enjoyable. There were thoughtful and delightful people in it who made discussion really interesting and insightful - Sharma really knows his stuff and that made it easier to facilitate when we weren't necessarily heading in the right direction.",
    "it's all about medieval-ness so don't think you'll be doing any modern state building.",
    "Best political theory class I've ever taken at Yale. Sharma is a really quick mind, and his arguments are seamless. The class, the reading and the discussion have really made me think hard on a lot of important state-building issues and social-political theories in general. Highly recommended.",
    "Yes, if you're very interested in early European state formation. If not, you'll probably be bored. Don't take it thinking you'll talk a lot about failed states. As a student interested in France, it was fantastic, but if you're mostly interested in African states, there might be another class better suited to your interests.LOTS OF READING.",
    "Definitely! Professor Sharma makes you question the fundamental assumptions of international relations and development. Even if you are not convinced by his argument this class will make you ask the kind of questions we should all be asking.",
    "PSC 177 is a great course for those who are looking to learn about the in's and out's of state formation, and state formation theory. It's an interesting course with a large reading load, but worth the effort."
