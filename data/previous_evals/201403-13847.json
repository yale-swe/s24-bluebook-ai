    "Always remember that Harold is Harold is Harold. If you have the opportunity to take his class, take iteven if you think you don't have room, take it (good sixth class). You will learn a v v different way of thinking about literature than most Yale classes, which depends on unpacking strains of influence, aural qualities, and tea.",
    "I was fortunate to have this opportunity, to learn from a profound person.",
    "It is very simple: we sat and discussed the two plays in each class. The discussion usually centered around particular characters or passages each time, but the discussion was very free.",
    "A seminar in which to meditate on two of the great works of literature available to us, with an individual who has made this his life's work for over half a century. The company is like-minded and committed to the rigorous contemplation of art.",
    "I highly recommend this course to any lover of literature or of Shakespeare. Taking a class with Professor Bloom is not like taking any other English seminar at Yale. Professor Bloom has spent his life immersed in the texts you read, and it an amazing experience not only to hear his thoughts but to be challenged to answer the difficult questions he asks during discussion. The students in his seminars tend to be diverse in their interests and this adds to the complexity of class discussions. Professor Bloom is also a skilled listener and listens intently to everything that is said. He cares deeply about his students and will want to set up individual meetings with you in order to get to know you better and hear your ideas. This is an incredible opportunity to engage in discussion with a true literary expert. If you do take a class with Professor Bloomdo not be afraid to speak during class discussion. When he asks a question, he truly wants to hear student opinions and the more opinions offered, the more lively the discussion will be.",
    "Amazing. This class is everything I thought a Yale education would be: a legendary and truly insightful professor leading a group of students in serious discussion where everyone felt secure enough to not show off. Do not hesitate to take it if you can."
