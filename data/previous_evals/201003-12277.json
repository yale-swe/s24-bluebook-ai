   "comments": [
    "Yes! The course is interesting from a lot of different points of view.",
    "don't take it",
    "This is a pretty good course, although it is much more linguistics than it is psychology. Still, if you are a psychology major (as I am) don't let this deter you. In terms of assignments, there are three 3-4 page papers, a midterm exam (essay based), and a 10-12 page final paper. The lectures can be somewhat dry but they are comprehensive and the material is quite interesting. By the course's end, you don't really actually answer the question of how language evolved but you are fully caught up on the debate. There is a lotof reading for the course but it isn't necessary, not even for the midterm. I would take this course, especially if you have taken another course taught by Anderson because there is some degree of overlap.",
    "This class did exactly what it set out to do: explain the evolution of language (given the data available in the field). It was interesting and did present a lot of good information, but it got a little redundant at times. It didn't require too much work outside of class (except for the end of term research paper), and it was a great introduction to Linguistics as a major.",
    "If you're interested in the material. Some stuff was more interesting than others. The stuff on protolanguage and grammar\/syntax was pretty cool too, though probably nothing outside what you'd get from a linguistics class.",
    "I found this class frustrating because the general message of it seemed to be that it's really hard to say anything definitive about the evolution of language. Still, I found the class really interesting. There's nothing particularly entertaining about the reading or class, so only take it if you're truly interested in the subject. You'll have an advantage if you've already taken into linguistics, but it's not a pre-req. I found all of the assignments really interesting; you don't have to do much outside research, they're just an opportunity to really engage with class materials.",
    "Although much of the material is individually interesting, the course can be difficult to follow. No doubt this is because we still do not have a firm grasp of how language evolved, but it does make it difficult to see how the lectures fit together at times. Take it if you are interested in linguistics or evolutionary biology, but don't expect to know precisely how language evolved by the end.",
    "evolution of language is a general grab bag of topics relating to language and its evolution. my recommendation is to go to class high as often as possible, because that's how you keep it interesting. aside from that, the delivery is boring but the material is really cool and the work is minimal. recommend if you are intellectually curious and have the ability to have this curiosity overwhelm the urge and ease of slacking off and not paying attention-bc you can get by without doing so but it'll be a complete waste of time and an ordeal.",
    "Psych 322 is an interesting course for students interested in the evolution of language. I found especially interesting that it highlights the parallels and differences between animal communication (especially primates) and humans. Professor Anderson is very knowledgeable in the field, and always happy to answer questions during and after lecture. However, the second part of the course covers more theoretical aspects of human evolution (e.g. the Baldwin Effect, and the evolution of the Homo Sapien) such that lectures can sometimes get a little dry and boring. Overall, this is a good course for those interested in the evolution of language, also with respect to other animals and their communication systems.",
    "This is a very cool subject with a lot of potential, but the class is poorly taught. Prof. Anderson is not a good lecturer and never seems very passionate about his lectures, so I found it very boring. He sighed before almost every sentence and rambled quite a bit. I didn't feel like I learned very much until I wrote my final paper - and that was because I did research for it on my own. I would not recommend the class unless it is taught by a different instructor, preferably someone with more energy."
