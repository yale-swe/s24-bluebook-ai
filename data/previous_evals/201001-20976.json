    "I would enthusiastically recommend the course to anybody with an interest in twentieth-century history, politics or economics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. As an Americanist this introduced me to crucial international issues I didn't even realize I needed to know about in order to understand certain events in Am. history. This is a tough class with difficult reading, so I would recommend it either in a semester without two other tough classes or as an audit! It's kind of like jumping into the lion's den.Probably it would be much less difficult for someone in economics or with strong European history background.",
    "I recommend this class wholeheartedly. It covered the stated subject matter very well, balancing discussions between continental Europe, Britain, and the United States."
