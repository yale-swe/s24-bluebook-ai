   "comments": [
    "Important concepts and theorems in group and ring theory, approaches to writing mathematical proofs",
    "groups, rings, fields, some basic number theory",
    "group theory (I didn't even know what groups were coming in) and some basic ring theory. More importantly, and extremely rigorous logical mindset when tackling the problems, and developing good mathematical problem solving techniques. How to struggle towards something and deal with feeling stuck. How to synthesize scattered sources of information in a single proof.",
    "I learned what deep-diving into a single field in mathematics looks and feels like. It's a very intense experience, and it's impossible to learn every single tidbit of information in this course. I got a lot stronger at linking together abstract concepts and writing clear, logically sound mathematical proofs. I learned a lot of group theory, number theory, and ring theory through this course, taking away how difficult these subjects are. This class showed me, rather painfully, how intense of a commitment being a math major will be.",
    "Group and ring theory, but the greatest takeaway might be better problem solving skills and a greater appreciation for math",
    "I got a very rigorous understanding of the basis of abstract algebra. We covered pretty much all the group theory in D&F chapters 1-5 (basic stuff, group actions, sylow theorems, semidirect products, all that stuff) and a bunch of ring theory.",
    "Group and Ring theory",
    "Group theory and ring theory! The course follows the first few chapters of Dummit and Foote for the most part and provides a great introduction to Abstract Algebra.",
    "Group and ring theory, and in general how to think mathematically",
    "A general survey of introductory concepts in group theory (basic group concepts, isomorphism theorems, group actions, Sylow Theorems, direct\/semidirect products) and ring theory (basic ring concepts, ideals\/quotient rings, rings of fractions, Euclidean Domains, Principal Ideal Domains, Unique Factorization Domains). I think this class also helped me grow in terms of mathematical maturity and proof-writing.",
    "I learned about rings, groups, ideals, abelian groups, commutators, subgroups, fields, homomorphisms, direct products, semidirect products, centers, stabilizers, conjugacy classes, group actions, permutations, kernels, isomorphisms, quotient groups\/rings, isomorphism theorems, and RSA. Yeah, there's a lot",
    "A lot of very, very hard math.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about introductory topics in abstract algebra. I learned how often my intuition may fail me, and how much of the course relied on being very comfortable with definitions and theorems proven in class.",
    "Lots of knowledge about groups and rings, further practice with writing proofs and struggling on problems",
    "I learned a great deal about group theory and ring theory. I also improved my proof writing skills.",
    "A ton of group theory: definitions, subgroups, normal subgroups, cyclic groups, isomorphism theorems, Sylow p-subgroups, classification of finitely generated abelian groups, etc. We also did ring theory near the end of the semester.",
    "Group theory and some ring theory.",
    "The course covered group theory and introduction to ring theory in extreme detail. Great familiarity with proof writing was expected.",
    "You learn about group theory and ring theory, as well as gain insight into how think about proof-based mathematics.",
    "I improved my ability to come up with and write proofs. I also learned a lot about abstract algebra, such as group theory and some ring theory.",
    "Proof writing. Problem solving skills",
    "Covers chapters 0 to 5 and 7 to 8 of Dummit and Foote. This gives a really good foundation in (mostly finite) group theory and ring theory. Lots of cool applications in number theory.",
    "Learned about basic group\/ring theory.",
    "My proof writing skills greatly improved in this class. Additionally, I feel better equipped at attacking complex problems.",
    "We learned group theory, ring theory, and a quick summary of RSA encryption, an application of ring theory.",
    "group theory, ring theory, proof-writing, how to reason with very complicated abstract concepts",
    "Comprehensive coverage of group theory and an introduction to ring theory that will provide the foundation for many advanced upper level math courses.",
    "An mathematically rigorous introduction to the field of group theory and ring theory.",
    "There's a lot of material covered in the semester, generally centered on group theory and ring theory. Proof writing and mathematical thinking. Intuition for some challenging abstract ideas.",
    "General introduction to group theory and ring theory. Group classification, fields and more ring definitions than I can remember. Also gained a significant amount of mathematical maturity from the material.",
    "I learned the basics of group and ring theory, including classification of finite groups, semidirect products, Sylow's theorems, isomorphism theorems, and types of integral domains.",
    "This class was a great introduction to group theory, which is a really interesting area of math. Miki inspired a love for the material, and she's an outstanding instructor. The problems were challenging but fair, and the homework definitely helped me learn the material. Every week you have to type up a proof in Latex, which is a super helpful skill. There were plenty of opportunities to talk with Miki or the ULA's about the course, which definitely helped me understand what was going on. I spent a lot of time working on this course, but it was worthwhile.",
    "I gained a general (and in-depth) introduction to Abstract Algebra, a subject area that I had not previously been familiar with. I was given some insight as to how I need to better my time management skills and my approach to problem solving and psets.",
    "This class gives an amazing introduction to the world of Group Theory. It is hard to describe exactly what one will learn in this class to one who has not yet taken this class because of the volume of knowledge learned during the semester. Even a month into class, one will have learned enough to read and write what would have previously been incomprehensible.",
    "A thorough understanding of introductory group theory and ring theory. I also learned how to approach difficult and long proofs effectively. I think my proof-writing ability has improved due to this course.",
    "I learned a massive amount about the field of abstract algebra, primarily group theory. More specifically, I learned the basics of dihedral groups, cyclic groups, quotient groups, direct products, and semidirect products. Additionally, I learned a bit about ring theory and cryptography, with introductions to basic ring definitions\/applications and the basic underlying theory of RSA (which was super cool!). But more importantly than any specific math knowledge, this course taught me how to deal with a very challenging subject that I struggled to comprehend. At times it was discouraging to work so hard and still struggle so much, especially when everyone in the class is so bright and seems to catch on more quickly, but I really learned to embrace this feeling and use it to grow as a student and person. Now, I better understand how to use the resources available (ULAs, office hours, friends, etc.) and to accept that sometimes you cant master everything quickly (or even after what seems like many hours). In the end, I actually understood the course material relatively well and gained a lot of confidence in myself in terms of being able to tackle challenges.",
    "I learned a lot of math, and made\/continued friendships with people in the class by working on homework together. I was awed by both the intellectual challenge that math can present and the ability of some of my classmates. I also gained confidence in my own ability in math: the difficulty of the course meant that completing each homework and the class as a whole was really satisfying. This class definitely pushed my ability to synthesize information during lecture, which made me adapt to get more out of the lecture.",
    "I learned about group theory and a little bit of ring theory."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "psets are a bit long (~10-15 hours per week, every week) and aren't particularly engaging (just textbook problems for the most part) - Miki is a solid teacher tho, and cares a lot about the students",
    "Strengths: Professor is amazing and goes over course material clearly, and the textbook is also very thorough. Problem sets, if enough time is devoted, really train the concepts and drill them deep into one's mind. Weaknesses: exams have too little time, which makes it seem like it is testing speed rather than mathematical knowledge, as I've found that speed is not truly that important in eventual academic success, but more a willingness to keep struggling through a problem (as the problem sets have trained us to do).",
    "Miki organizes this course extremely well. She and the ULAs give students ample opportunities to improve their proof-writing skills and mathematical thinking, as well as having loads of review sessions for the course material. The graders give detailed feedback on the homework, and Miki puts a lot of effort into making sure the course is best facilitated to student learning (such as making p-sets slightly shorter). Dummit and Foote, the textbook we use, isn't the best. It doesn't explain theorems in the clearest way, but it is often very helpful, and definitely a necessary resource for this class.",
    "Strengths are that it's incredibly well taught and interesting material. The weaknesses might just be that it's such a high workload though I understand it's already less than it was before so I'm not sure how much less it could be without sacrificing the integrity of the course.",
    "Strengths: Miki is an incredible professor, and she really cares for her students. The fact that she sent each person in the 60+ person lecture a personalized email with their midterm score and comments about their grade and their improvement throughout the course is remarkable. The subject matter is also really beautiful and opens itself up to really incredible math (this class is more or less required for taking more number theory, Galois, etc.). The grading was also by FAR the most thorough\/helpful of any math course I've taken here. Weaknesses: simply too much work without being really worth it. Some of the p-sets for this class took forever, and I feel like they did not necessarily improve my understanding of the material too much. It's one of the most work-intensive classes in the math major, but I don't think the difficulty of the material justifies the workload.",
    "If you aren't a natural born prodigy with a mind like Euler's (although most people in the class are), you wont do so hot in this class. I feel like I learned a lot, like in other math classes I have taken, but the tests and psets rarely reflected that. This is a class where you either have it or you don't, and I wish there was more of a spectrum for the people in-between.",
    "Strengths: incredible professor and engaging lectures, really interesting material if you genuinely like math, many opportunities to get additional help, work on problem sets, etc., Dummit and Foote is great too Weaknesses: problem sets are quite long and tedious at times (depending on the topic)",
    "The major obstacle of the course is its difficulty and workload, however this is necessary for the class to be as fulfilling as it is. If youre prepared for the work, there are honestly no weaknesses. Miki is another great strength.",
    "Strengths: Miki is a fantastic instructor! She keeps the class very engaged (and entertained with her mathematical humor). The workload was a bit high, but I feel like it was necessary to help reinforce content learned in class. The course went at a fairly fast pace (which was probably necessary given the amount of content covered), but the material was also super interesting. Weaknesses: The ULA workshops were a bit disorganized, and I feel like it could be helpful if they were a bit more structured.",
    "Its a really good class but its also really hard. The homeworks are quite brutal and will take a chunk out of you each week. Miki is very responsive, however, and she dialed back on the homework after the midterm reviews went in. Still though, I turned in a 27 page PSET one of the weeks. The course is very fast paced, which is at times scary, but it does a very nice job following the book which acts as a kind of safely net because everything makes sense when Miki says it, but nothing makes sense when you're actually trying to figure out the homework problems.",
    "The hardest course I've ever taken at Yale, period. Honestly a well-structured course, but it is definitely a lot.",
    "I really enjoyed how this course was structured. Lectures were helpful and engaging, there were plenty of resources provided, and Miki was great at being available for her students. I learned a lot and had a fun time doing it as well.",
    "Strengths - Miki is a great lecturer with a real passion for the material and for student success. The subject material is interesting. It lines up very well with the textbook, Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote. The course is essentially just chapters 1-5, 7, and 8 of the text, and problem sets are mostly book problems with occasional outside problems. There are plenty of ULA study groups and office hours, especially leading up to the exam and midterms. Weaknesses - This class is hard. Very, very conceptually difficult. The problem sets are very time consuming, certainly taking at least 10-15 hours a week. Make sure you stay on top of understanding the material, as if you fall off the wagon it can be very hard to get back on, especially in regards to the advanced group theory topics.",
    "I think the structure of the course is very good. ULA sessions and office hours can be helpful if you fall behind. However, I think there's too much homework and that can be a pain.",
    "Strengths: Learned a lot of math, and it was fun. Weaknesses: Not really any that come to mind.",
    "Miki is an excellent teacher and her mastery of the material is beyond evident. She gave consistent examples and explained concepts well. At times the pace of the class could be very challenging and the problem sets consistently took 15-20 hours easily.",
    "It covers a lot of material but because it covers a lot, it goes pretty fast.",
    "The workload is a lot, but the class is taught well, and the textbook is amazing.",
    "This class is at its peak right now",
    "I can't complain about much.",
    "Class was well taught and material is structured well.",
    "This has been my absolute favorite class at Yale so far. It is extremely well taught, and if you are interested in high level math, the material is fascinating. The weekly problem sets are critical for helping you learn the material.",
    "I think Miki is a great lecturer and runs the course very well. The exams are fair, although the midterms were way too long for the only 50 minutes we were given to complete them. The problem sets are also very long, but they are great practice with the material and are a good way to learn. The office hours and ULA sessions are very helpful, you need to go to them if you want to do well.",
    "strengths - Miki is a wonderful lecturer, peer tutors are very nice and helpful weaknesses - you need to be willing to put in a LOT of time to understand everything, sometime the homework questions didn't feel like they related a lot to the concepts learned\/tested in class, sometimes homework grading felt very arbitrary, would have been nice to have homework solutions",
    "Strengths: Miki - she ensures that each and every student is getting the most of out of the class. Teaches you to think quickly and determine what information is useful and what isn't Cons: First exam was very time pressured, psets take over 20 hours a week.",
    "This course covers a tremendous amount of material in one semester. The lectures are well-structured and Miki is a wonderful lecturer who cares a lot about her students even still, I found it impossible to do well in the course without a significant amount of time spent outside of time working through the textbook\/additional problems. (In my opinion, doing the problem sets alone will not be enough to understand the concepts, despite the fact that they would take many hours a week.) The ring theory concepts covered at the end of the semester felt very rushed, and I never was able to understand them to the same level of depth as the group theory; perhaps it may have been better to stick to group theory concepts and slow down the pace of the course slightly to make it easier to keep up.",
    "It moves fast, and it takes a ton of work to keep up. But easily one of the best designed, clearly taught, well-supported classes I have ever taken. Miki cares so much about the student experience that, even when she's challenging you, you feel like she's on your side. The lectures and material take focus and diligence to follow, but everything is presented as intelligibly as possible. Miki's also so efficient with class time not a single minute of lecture ever felt like a retread or a waste. The problem sets are a little ridiculous in length, but probably necessary for learning the material at the pace the class moves.",
    "Lots of problem sets and constant feedback on all the problems. At times this could be overwhelming, but also really helped to teach the material.",
    "The strengths of this course include the rigor and challenge of the content presented, Miki's willingness to help at any stage of the semester and peers who were as invested in the content. The weaknesses of this course include no official solutions to the homework, no quick and dirty guide to the dense textbook, and impossibly fast teaching pace in class.",
    "Miki goes through the material way too fast, this class was way too hard it started giving me major anxiety ...",
    "This course could be improved by spending more time on ring theory. I felt like it was a little rushed at the end. The time spent proving the Sylow theorems could have been spent on polynomial rings and the relationships between the different kinds of domains.",
    "The teaching was excellent and the class-time was engaging. The class goes at a very fast pace, which made it tough to follow sometimes. This is to be expected I think and isn't necessarily a bad thing. There were plenty of helpful resources and Miki and the TAs were fantastic at reaching out to us and giving us opportunities for review. All in all, a well organized course, and it needed to be given the very intense subject matter.",
    "The lectures were really engaging and the problem sets were really helpful. Really appreciate the ULAs as well.",
    "Strengths: This class is organized brilliantly and Professor Havlickova is an excellent lecturer and obviously an incredibly talented mathematician (albeit a little intimidating). The workload, while heavy, is manageable, and probably about 50-67% of Math 230's. Weaknesses (but not really weaknesses): If one is expecting the same support structure as Math 230\/231, one will be sorely disappointed. Two of three of the ULAs were not quite as delightful as one might hope, but the third was one of the best teachers I have had the pleasure of working with. This is not so much because Math 350 is lacking in any way, but is more a testament to Math 230's welcoming atmosphere. This class also feels less satisfying in many ways than 230 in that there are not as many \"Aha!\" moments or slick proofs that make one jump up in joy. Again, this is only with 230 for perspective. In reality, 350 is an excellent course in mathematics with very few weaknesses (Not really a weakness, but good to know: Because of the amount of information that is learned and just the structure of Group and Ring Theory in general, this class is difficult in that one is expected to store away and recall many small Theorems, Postulates, and the like. This is not a fault of the course structure, but I feel that it would have been good to know this coming in.)",
    "I loved the energy in the classroom. It made lectures more than tolerable; rather, something to actively look forward to. I think that towards the end of the course, the level of rigor dropped slightly as we transitioned into ring theory. I think this could be improved by returning to the original number of weekly assigned problems (pre- middle of November).",
    "The main strengths of the course were the overall course curriculum and structure, the challenging yet enlightening problem sets, and the excellent teaching from the professor and ULAs. While abstract algebra is an inherently complex subject, the course presents it in a mangeable (as manageable as possible) way, building up from the basic concepts to more complicated ideas. The textbook is relatively effective, and the lengthy problem sets yield a better understanding of the topics. However, what really makes the course stand out to me was the incredible instruction from everyone involved in the course. Miki was always willing to explain things after class and would answer emails almost instantly. She went so far as to reach out with encouragement emails when she knew you were worried or struggling, and I felt very supported. Furthermore, all the ULAs were exceptional, and I gained a much better understanding of the material by going to their study sessions. Benjamin especially was one of the best instructors Ive ever had, both in terms of technical explanation and emotional support. The main weaknesses of the course are its extreme difficulty and frustration at times along with sometimes confusing lectures. The problem sets are very lengthy, taking at least 10-15 hours (often more), and the material itself is very hard to wrap your head around. Furthermore, the exams are extremely difficult, as they are designed for you to not finish. However, you can find some solace in the significant curve as well as the aforementioned support systems. Nevertheless, the difficulty is the one truly discouraging or potential problem with the course. Additionally, lectures were often at too quick of a pace for anyone to follow, with many definitions and complicated proofs squeezed into 50 minutes. I know this is the case for many upper math courses, but since many people just had to read the book anyway (some even forgoing class by the end of the semester), maybe a slower pace would be better.",
    "This class is a ton of work: every pset is at least 10 hours, and can easily take more than 15 hours and we get one every week. I think that the course would be better if we had fewer homework problems (like how it was the second half of the course), so we could spend more time thinking about each problem and less time writing out the proofs. Also the lectures went very quickly, which made it easy to be lost in lecture and made it hard to learn the material just in class. A good thing is that for almost the whole semester, Miki taught out of the book, so you could learn a lot just from reading the appropriate chapter. Another weakness is that the two midterms (especially the first one) were really quick, so it mainly tested the ability to recall theorems and pset results very quickly, as getting stuck on one question could mess up your whole midterm. The exam was longer which was really nice, but I didn't like that it was mostly on stuff learned after the second midterm, since we didn't spend much time at all on that stuff.",
    "The course covers the material quite fast, which is both positive and a negative. The problem sets are quite long though Miki shortened them in the middle of the semester. The tests don't match the problem set material completely. It might be good to give students past tests or practice tests so they know what to expect."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. It is extremely challenging and time-consuming (average of 12 problems per problem set) but also very rewarding. Miki is an amazing lecturer (you will never be bored) and this class is well-structured with many ULA sessions available. The ULA sessions are very helpful and the ULAs were always willing to explain a concept or provide some hints on problem sets.",
    "Yes, if you are willing to devote enough time for it to be your primary or at worst secondary priority. The problem sets require an incredible amount of time and effort. This course is completely geared towards pure math majors, so if you do not have any interest in that, stay away. Even for a joint math econ major, the math did get very theoretical at times, and this is very very different from any analysis math. This is not a course for applications (a brief discussion was had on RSA cryptography at the end however, which was interesting), instead it is pure theory and training of the mind to think in completely abstract ways. Be willing to take on the challenge and you will get a lot out of this course.",
    "This class is hard. Group theory and ring theory are huge fields of math with a lot of nuances and detail. I would recommend this course to students wanting to further their studies in pure mathematics. You learn a lot about the structures working within mathematics, and if you haven't done a lot of number theory before, then you learn a whole lot more about how the integers and modular arithmetic work. Miki is an amazing human being, and she makes incredible hard topics approachable.",
    "Yes! Deserves its reputation for being time-consuming and hard (or at least harder than average) but there are more than enough support systems to get through. You'll make friends just through the experience of sheer suffering (I think Miki also intentionally tries to help you make friends so that you don't have to struggle on your own...thanks mom (mom is Miki)). You will also come out a better problem solver and will probably think math is cool.",
    "I would recommend this to pretty much any math majorwhile not exactly a prereq for the major, it's a prerequisite for pretty much all the algebra\/number theory classes. I would also recommend it to non-majors, simply because the material is beautiful and the class is very well-taught, with the caveat that it is a lot of work, so it might not be worth it for you if you're simply interested in the subject (this might change if the class isn't with Miki, though).",
    "I enjoyed it a lot, but it really kicked my butt. Definitely opens your mind up to a higher level of mathematical thinking, but be ready to pay the price.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in abstract algebra! Be prepared to really put in the work to do well in the class. Miki makes the class really challenging, but at the same time, fun.",
    "If youre interested in math, yes. Its not technically required for the math major but this is essentially THE Yale math course. You also learn so much from it.",
    "Absolutely, especially if they are interested in math. The course is a fantastic (and rigorous) introduction to abstract algebra, which I found to be a really beautiful area of math",
    "Yes and no. I took this course with a heavy courseload and would definitely NOT recommend taking this course with anything too time intensive. Unless you're a genius at abstract algebra, even if you understand what you're doing, the PSETs take time, and lots of it. Not to mention the material itself is literally called abstract, so very often its hard to understand and internalize. Things make sense in the moment but that doesn't stick. So back to my recommendation, really only take this if you intend to major in something related to CS. There are a lot of easier and interesting math course to take if you're just interesting but not willing to go far. If you do decide to take it, however, it will separate those who actually like math, and those who liked math because they were pretty good at it.",
    "Yes, but keep in mind this will be a LOT of work. I probably spent 1.5 to 2 times the amount of time I spent on Math 230, for comparison. The level of rigor you'll need is very high. But this course is essential to understanding complex math.",
    "Yes - while definitely a difficult class conceptually, it was very rewarding to be able to synthesize all the different pieces of the course together in the end. The course challenges you with a lot of material and work, but Miki is always willing to help out and will actively listen to feedback. This is a class that you can definitely benefit a lot from with active and intentional work.",
    "Yes! Miki is an amazing professor, and while there is a lot of material that we go through quickly, it all feels worth it at the end of the year.",
    "If you are the right person, yes. This course is very challenging, and you should know that when you take it. It is very rewarding if you're interested in math. If you think you're ready to take it, then go for it!",
    "Not unless you are incredibly into math. This course was incredibly difficult, and while I learned a lot, particularly due to Miki's excellent teaching and having some really great ULAs, I regret taking the course due to the high workload, and often found myself miserable on Wednesday or Thursday nights working on the problem sets for hours and hours and hours.",
    "For some reason math majors can get away with not taking this course, by doing so you would be doing yourself a disservice. Algebra shows up all over other branches of math - there is literally 0 reason not to take it. It's fun, challenging, and will absolutely make you a better math student.",
    "I would recommend this to someone extremely confident in their abilities and who is taking no other comparably challenging classes during the semester. I made the mistake of taking this alongside 310 and it was a brutal semester. The problem sets consistently require 15-20 hours, not including un-starred problems. Exams are very challenging and an extremely high level of understanding is expected. I read and re-read the book chapters more times than I care to remember. You will absolutely learn all the group theory you could ever dream of, but definitely understand what you are taking on.",
    "If you are interested in higher level math, this is a great course to take. The professor and ULA's do a great job teaching the material and making sure students understand.",
    "Yes, the course is great for math majors, but you should not take other difficult math classes at the same time as abstract algebra",
    "Yes, this is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale",
    "Anyone interested in abstract math or theoretical physics should take this. Make sure you are comfortable with proof-based math at at least the level of 230\/300 before taking 350.",
    "Recommend if you are a math major and comfortable with proofs and looking for a challenge.",
    "Yes!! This is one of the best math classes at the school. I absolutely loved this class.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who wants to feel the beauty of mathematics, but maybe take it Cr\/D\/Fail if you don't need it for your major. Be prepared to spend a while on problem sets and studying for exams, but in the end you will look back on what you've learned and feel satisfied.",
    "yes abstract algebra is a very cool subject taught by a fantastic professor. just make sure you're willing to put like 15hrs per week doing the psets and not feel bad about getting rekted on the exams",
    "To anyone remotely interested in proof-based math, this is a must.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you are seriously pursuing higher-level math; this course is not for the faint of heart. Besides the problem sets alone taking many hours a week (for me), it took me many additional hours of working with the material outside of the assigned problems to get a handle on some of the concepts. There are easier classes if you're just looking for an interesting theoretical math class.",
    "If youre taking this, know what youre in fora ton of work with a trial by fire sort of approach. Miki was very enthusiastic and supportive, but also a literal professional mathematician who might sometimes struggle to move at the speed of a kinda confused sophomore or junior, so you gotta meet her in the middle.",
    "Yes, absolutely. You will grow so much as a mathematician and, even if you're not a math major (I'm not), you will develop your abilities to think creatively about problems and concretely about difficult concepts.",
    "Yes, for any prospective math major this is a course that will challenge you, and either develop your love for the subject or encourage you to pursue something else",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if they are extremely passionate about math and are willing to spend ~20 hours a week working on psets or grasping the material. Although it is highly encouraged to take this class after Math 230\/231, it is not for the faint of heart and will be much more work than Math 230\/231. However, at the end, each student will leave knowing they learned a lot of group and ring theory that will be relevant in their mathematical pursuits.",
    "No way, only if they're a genius. This class is math god mode, not for the faint of heart. The psets were long and tedious, and Miki goes through the material at breakneck speed.",
    "This class was a great introduction to group theory, which is a really interesting area of math. Miki inspired a love for the material, and she's an outstanding instructor. The problems were challenging but fair, and the homework definitely helped me learn the material. Every week you have to type up a proof in Latex, which is a super helpful skill. There were plenty of opportunities to talk with Miki or the ULA's about the course, which definitely helped me understand what was going on. I spent a lot of time working on this course, but it was worthwhile.",
    "I would, but I would warn them about the amount of time that it will demand. The course is one of the strongest that I have taken in the math department, but it's really no joke and it's nearly impossible to get by without putting in many hours per week, unless you're a genius, of which there were several in the class as far as I could tell. Even then.",
    "I definitely recommend the course to anyone who is serious about math. It is a very large time commitment though.",
    "Unless one believes that one will be a math major, I do not know why one is in this course. If one is a math major or is heavily considering being one, this course is a must take and is very enlightening. I learned so much in this class that I can \"speak\" Group Theory better than I can my foreign language. It is truly incredible how much one learns in this course, and I would recommend it to anyone proficient enough in math (in the top half of 225\/231) with a strong sense of intellectual curiosity. Be warned: this class is significantly more difficult than 230\/231 and a fair portion of the class does drop.)",
    "Certainly. I think it is an incredibly effective introduction to abstract algebra, and, especially with Miki, a lot of fun.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student with a strong math background (success in Math 231 or higher) who wants to learn a lot about abstract algebra and is ready to take on a very challenging course. You should be willing to work very hard and accept occasional failures. However, as a consequence of this you will become a much stronger mathematician and student overall. But I would definitely caution against taking this course if you are taking many other time consuming courses or are unsure if you are willing to work hard throughout the semester. This is not a class that will necessarily boost your esteem while your in it; its a struggle that everyone goes through together and comes out better for.",
    "This class was probably the most challenging class I've ever taken. The course material is not easy, and doing well requires a lot of time spent on trying to gain an intuitive understanding of each topic. I often felt like there was no point in taking this course because I was spending so much time on stuff that I didn't know any application for. However, if you like abstract math for the sake of abstract math, then this class is rewarding. It was also interesting near the end of the course when we spent two classes on encryption. I'd only recommend this class to a student who is prepared to spend a ton of time on this stuff.",
    "If you are majoring in math, this course is basically mandatory. Otherwise, students majoring in computer science, physics, or chemistry stand to benefit from taking this course as group theory is the language of symmetry."
