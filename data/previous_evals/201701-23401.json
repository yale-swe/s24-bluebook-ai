    "Very practical approach.",
    "Overall the course is very enlightening. It introduced a number of epidemiological concepts in occupational and environmental medicine using articles in the public health literature. My only suggestion for improvement would be for the instructors to share their slides after the lecture to help students reinforce their learning and for further study.",
    "I liked the variety of guests who lectured. Some lectures were a little bit geared to the physicians in the room, but overall it was still helpful to learn.",
    "The class is amazing! So engaging and interesting and made me really want to learn and read more about epidemiology and the many issues faced in env. and occ. medicine. The low workload on a week to week basis takes away some of the stress during class time of having to absorb every detail and allows for more space to think critically about how to best handle many of the issues, studies, and outbreaks discussed in the course.",
    "Excellent, with focus on a spectrum of Occupational exposures and how to manage them. Very informative.",
    "This course gives an excellent overview of the epidemiology of occupational and environmental illness. Through case histories and an understanding of the various methodological issues unique to the field.",
    "I loved this class! It was honestly more of a seminar than a class, which is how grad school should be. I found this style to be more enjoyable and less stressful. Every week, we engagingly discussed relevant EHS topics per the syllabus. The only assignment throughout the semester was a final take-home exam.",
    "Very good. Encouraged student participation and discussion."
