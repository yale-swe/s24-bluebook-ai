   "comments": [
    "Great material even if not always the most engaging. Problem sets are mostly very easy but if you don't know C++ there are a couple that may be troublesome (and you won't learn C++ in this class).",
    "Take it for the credit, not to learn anything. Still better than comp vision though.",
    "The workload's not crazy, the material is really interesting, the exams are fairly difficult... If you're a CS major, this is probably a good elective to take.",
    "Fischer is very dry and unengaging, which makes it difficult to focus during lecture. Overall, I would not recommend this course. The midterm and finals is based on your ability to memorize a ton of slides and regurgitate them. Homework is fair, though.",
    "Very good class. Interesting and essential concepts you need to know as a computer scientist.",
    "Great overview course into cryptography. The lecture material is interesting and going to be more and more important to know. Lectures are often dry but the lecture slides are comprehensive. Fun problem sets, mix of written assignments and some programming ones in C++ and C. Overall workload is definitely manageable. 8 problem sets, 1 midterm, and 1 final. The final factors heavily in the weighting though so be prepared to study a lot of slides for the final. Take the class if youll be motivated by the material and want to learn about cryptography.",
    "Great class. If you're looking for a CS elective where you learn a ton of important and useful information, but aren't saddled with difficult and time-consuming programming psets, this is the ideal course. Many CS electives suffer from poor organization, but this class is exceptionally well organized. There are 8 psets throughout the year, one midterm, and a final. Four of the psets involve programming, the rest are just writing out answers to questions, none are too difficult. The midterm and final are just explaining concepts discussed in class. What I liked about the class is that all of the information is super important and relevant, and you learn a lot. The lecture slides are immaculate--however, Prof Fischer is a bad lecturer. Time is much better spent skipping class and looking at the slides on your own.",
    "The material is really cool. It's like computers and security and hacking and stuff. I dunno, I thought it was cool. If you're into that stuff, it might be cool for you too. Here's the main takeaway from the course: You would think that \"computer security\" and \"cryptography\" involves a f*ckton of complicated math and obscure algorithms that you first have to learn before even getting close to the real implementations of cryptosystems, but you actually learn throughout the whole course that the cryptosystems aren't actually *that* complicated. Sure, they're not the simplest things in the world, but their security relies on fundamental principles and the applications thereof, rather than insane obfuscation. The course is pretty much an explanation of different systems that either build on each other or resolve problems with earlier ones--and most of these systems were used at one point or another. The last part of the course is a survey of all of the fancy ways that the US government likes to snoop on our emails and browsing histories, as well as a few available and theoretical ways to try to keep some privacy and anonymity in your online life. Fun stuff. The course is not programming heavy. I probably wrote a total of 100 lines for all of the programming questions that were in the psets. I would say it's mathy but the math is also stupid easy unless you're aggressively bad at math. Nothing that you actually have to know how to do gets harder than basic algebra and some stuff about multiplying in modulo. The psets are well spaced and not that challenging if you have any clue what's written in the lecture notes. Honestly, you could probably do them without going to lecture, if you just looked up the topics and terms as you came across them in the psets. You do have to study for the midterm and final--it pays to have a comprehensive understanding of the material, as there are enough variations on certain protocols that it would be risky to try to memorize all of them last minute. The lectures can get a bit dry, but if you just read the lecture notes before lecture and listen for the parts where you didn't understand something (the lecture notes are occasionally illustrative rather than sufficiently explanatory by themselves), you should be fine. If you're curious about computer security, or you need another course for your compsci major that isn't going to destroy you like algorithms or systems programming, then take this. It's fun, and if you have Ewa as a TA, she's amazing.",
    "Tips to fail in CPSC 467: - Use all of your physical\/mental energy reserved for the semester to focus for a minute on what Prof Fischer is trying to say. - Spend 10 hours\/week overthinking the complexity of the programming assignments (they are joke compared to 223\/323) - Never read the lecture notes until a day before the exams (trust me, it covers too much material to cram in just one night) Psets are straightforward and many people get almost full points for all of them. So you should really prepare for the exams if you care about the grade.",
    "Interesting concepts in the class, just poorly, poorly taught. Everything is fair (problem sets and exams), but Professor Fischer is fairly unengaging. If you're qualified for other CS electives, take those instead, but it's not a total waste of a credit if you take Cryptography (you'll learn a lot when studying for the exams and I found those concepts to be fascinating).",
    "Previous reviews of this course are pretty much spot-on. Lots of cool material, incredibly dry lecture. The problem sets generally took 2-8 hours. That's a wide range, but I would consider that a fairly light load. There's no real reason to go to lecture except that it's required by Prof. Fischer. Also, I thought the test were pretty hard. They really required you to know EVERYTHING from the slides. And there are thousands of slides.",
    "A pretty decent CS electives. It's not riveting, the lectures are really dry, but the material is interesting and the workload is very manageable. Ewa and Prof. Fischer are super nice. You learn a lot of the theory behind crypto systems. It's mainly focused on background and system primitives rather than implementation specifics, but I thought that was good.",
    ".I really liked this course. The material is super interesting. The only issue is that Fischer is a horribly dull, unexciting, not engaging, dry, lecturer who mumbles and stutters through the material. He knows his stuff though - email him if you want to get decent answers to questions. Ewa Syta, the TA, was very helpful and the lectures she gave were worth going to. The assignments were cool and not too hard if you know how to code at all (though you have to code in C++). I say take it - cryptography is a really interesting field and his slides are amazing. You're probably better off just going through the slides on your own or during class each week and totally blocking him out. If Ewa is teaching it in the future, definitely take it. He does take attendance though which is really annoying because lectures are not worth going to.",
    "Overall this is an interesting course: shop it, don't take it if you can't stand the lecture style, but its worthwhile to take if you find lecture bearable. Crypto requires some number theory that can be really fascinating, but frustrating if you're not into it (its not very intuitive). The course is well organized, I think, spreading out the in-depth number theory with the survey of applied topics evenly, making the intake of material pleasing. You get a window into a really important field while digging in a bit into the math and its never too crazy. Work pushed me intellectually but was not hard to manage. The biggest problem with the course is just that lecture can be boring. Fischer is a great professor: understanding, smart, fair, but lecture is required and can definitely be dull. Luckily, lecture is actually useful (if you can pay attention) and the TF Ewa is great.",
    "This course was a solid survey course in topics in cryptography and computer security. It covered a broad range of topics in-depth, and also helped students learn how to implement and break certain cryptosystems through the various programming assignments. I found the content of the course and the problem sets really interesting, and found Prof. Fischer and Ewa very helpful if I ever had questions on the content or on problem sets. My only critiques include: -the sheer amount of content in the course was extremely large, and made studying for the two exams an ordeal. (However, the exams and problem sets themselves were reasonable, so perhaps this balanced out the large amount of content.) I'm wondering if, at the end of the day, I would've retained a lot more material from the course had there not been so much of it. -Prof. Fischer, while excited about the material, is a very soporific lecturer, and (I'm ashamed to admit) put me to sleep in class a few times! However, overall, a good course, and one I'd still take again if asked to do things over.",
    "Overall: The material is fascinating, the professor is awful, and the TA is good. Previous reviews said this, and I got exactly what I expected. Oh, and the course is ridiculously easy because it surveys too much of crypto to ask intelligent questions about any of it. Prof Fischer: AWFUL. He has the rare ability to turn interesting material into interminable, dull lectures. His slide shows are comprehensive but he goes through them so slowly it's painful. I read through the slides at the beginning of class every day, understood all the material (which is to his credit!), and then spent the next hour answering emails, doing homework, etc.",
    "The material in this course is very interesting. The professor is somewhat quiet and reads off the slides, so the actual experience of the lectures is not super stimulating. But I think that it is worth it for the really cool, relevant, and important stuff that you will learn about computer security. Everybody in modern society uses these cryptographic schemes every day, and a very small fraction of the people using them know how they actually work!",
    "Cryptography has to be the coolest subject ever. However, this class butchered it for me and has made me realize that I should have studied abroad in a random Hungarian computer science college to get CS elective credits so I could actually obtain an education and avoid 1) the atrocity that is Yale CS electives 2) the level of stress equivalent to what Navy Seals go through on the last night of Hell Week and 3) going from a curious, motivated student to a lifeless zombie fatigued by mental hazing"
