   "comments": [
    "Wonderful class. Be prepared to learn every single verb tense in the language by the time the semester is up. And really don't take it unless you are already good with Romance languages.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student if he\/she wishes to learn portuguese. The class was fun and entertaining and I still felt like I was learning how to speak portuguese. Also, Ibelieve the class is set up in a way that adequately prepares you for a summer in Brazil. Even so, I learned a lot about other portuguese speaking nations. Take the course. You will not regret it.",
    "Class meets 4-5 times\/week for 2 hours and 15 mins each day. The time really breezes by, though. Marta Almeida is a great professor and very entertaining. The class did not feel like it was really 2 credits worth of work, but the workload fluctuated. You really need to stay on top of things, though, because if you fall behind it will be difficult to catch up. You should definitely take this class if you are looking for an intro Portuguese class.",
    "It's a great course if you want to learn Portuguese. Portuguese is an important language, as Brazil rises as a global power. Additionally, as a generally small class, this course fosters a group environment like no other class I've attended at Yale. Even now, everyone in my class are good friends with each other and we do stuff together often.",
    "Intensive Portuguese moves at a fast pace but is really rewarding if you want to learn the language quickly and in a fun manner. I would definitely recommend this class."
