    "I would say it's a fun class, but not one that you will necessarily come away from feeling like you've learned a large body of knowledge. It's enjoyable though because you get to dance. Thinking and theorizing are fun, but I didn't feel that I gained anything particularly concrete.",
    "Yes, this is an amazing course I seriously recommend it",
    "I would recommend this course. Don't feel like you have to have rhythm or be a dancer - your dance skills are not being graded here. It's really about the research and the understanding of the context behind the dances."
