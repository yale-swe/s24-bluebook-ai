    "I would describe Basic Drawing as an intensive drawing class that places special emphasis on what Professor Reed calls \"Individual Drawing Research.\" This basically means that mid-way through the semester, you choose a subject to draw, and you spend the rest of the semester focusing on this subject. Reed doesn't work with the figure, so you won't be drawing any live models in the class. You will work mostly with graphite, charcoal, and tempera. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in the art major, because the class requires a significant time commitment. So if you don't take it seriously, you won't have any fun. However, if you make the commitment, it is an extremely rewarding class.",
    "It's pretty much what you hear. You do a lot of work. You deal with a lot more cardboard than you'd expect. But you learn a lot, mainly that you shouldn't be so precious about what you create.",
    "Take it! If you can wake up and want to learn to draw in a rigorous way, then this is the class for you.",
    "This class will change your approach to your artwork, most importantly in terms of work ethic. Robert Reed has a certain element of crazy, but if you can avoid joining the cult of personality around him, his class can be transformative. Otherwise you will have joined a cult, which is great if you're into that. Basic drawing sections with other teachers are not as time-consuming or soul-destroying as this class. For me, it was worth it, but do not take this class in conjunction with any other high work load class. The rest of your schedule must be light in order to manage taking this course, and I recommend that you care as little as possible about the other courses. 10 to 20 hours of art homework over the weekend, then the same during the week is the norm for this course.",
    "Only take this class if you're willing to give it everything you've got--and I mean everything. I worked very hard, but I still did other things during the semester. I may have done 100+ drawings, but it wasn't nearly enough, for myself or Prof Reed. I had friends who did nothing but draw and they gained an awe inspiring amount. It's and ALL or nothing thing. You have to be willing to put in everything, or the experience will be mediocre to miserable, to all.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. I am so glad that I took it before graduating. It is difficult and will force you to think in different ways about the work you do. Sometimes it isn't pleasant, but it almost always is and looking back at the end of the semester, it is definitely worth it. The work is intensive, although Prof. Reed asks less than previously, apparently. You learn the benefits of this rigorous attitude towards drawing by the end of the course when you look back on all that you have done. Also, you should take this course because I doubt that you will ever have a professor who devotes so much time and so much of himself to a course."
