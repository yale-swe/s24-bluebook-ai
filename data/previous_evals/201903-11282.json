   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought that this course was taught very well. I don't really think there were any weaknesses. There was ample review material for each of the tests and the homework sets were difficult enough to the point that they force you to really understand the concepts, however not so difficult so as to consume all of your time.",
    "This course was really fun and engaging, and I learned a lot. However, towards the end of the course, homework was returned increasingly late or not at all. This made it really difficult to study for the final exam.",
    "This course was taught well, and I feel that the problem sets and practice exams really helped the students prepare for the difficult exams.",
    "material was pretty challenging at times, and expectations felt high with Ross teaching. peer tutors were great though, and future versions of this class should definitely have them.",
    "Could be more proof based. Applications often felt like a repeat of math 120 and made the material too easy. Ross was the strength of the course. Another problem is that we often had substitutes on important days like when we learned the implicit function theorem which made the progression of the course difficult. There were no homework solutions.",
    "At times the workload was very high. For example, on October 1, our 5th pset was due; on October 6, our 6th pset was due; on October 8 we had our second midterm. I think Professor Berkowitz asked a bit too much of us at times, although I will admit that the problem sets really did help me learn the material. I also liked how we met 3x a week. Shoutout to Sonali and Sanelma, the greatest peer tutors ever.",
    "You get to see a bit of what real math looks like. That is both a strength and a weakness. I wish there were more resources on canvas. We only had lecture (no slides of course), homework (solutions never posted), one practice exam for each exam (better than nothing), instructor office hours (those were good), and peer tutors (I never went, but it seemed like they were well received). Examples were given in class, so that was good. The book was fine I guess.",
    "I thought this course was successfully at encouraging a higher-level\/more proof-based engagement with this material. Homeworks and exams generally had relatively reasonably expectations although homework difficulty varied fairly substantially from question to question\/assignment to assignment (although it did really help to have the ability to drop two assignments). It did also seem like generally useful preparation for higher-level mathematics coursework.",
    "Strengths: analysis is cool in an abstract sense and it's a pretty good bridge between intro maths and higher maths Weaknesses: it can be really confusing lol especially since its abstract",
    "The course is fairly well made, but it would be great in the future the course didn't use Hubbard Hubbard. While at it, the course could be lean more towards point set topology, and analysis.",
    "This course went way too fast for me. Ross is a very smart guy but not everyone is at his pace of math-brain and I could have used some periodic check-ins during the lecture to make sure we knew what was actually going on (rather than just scribbling down the notes). Most lectures seemed kind of like a big long math monologue by Ross with little engagement from much of the class.",
    "The class was super disorganised which made doing anything really difficult. When you combine that with moving really fast through a lot of material, it was a recipe for disaster for basically anyone who didnt already know all the material. Its a shame because the material was actually really interesting.",
    "Ross went through the material way faster than anyone could understand. The textbook was also very poorly written, hard to understand with a lot of special notation that isn't found anywhere else. Also the psets are quite challenging. The graders were also pretty bad, they made a lot of mistakes grading my hw.",
    "This course is very poorly organised and jumps from topic to topic without a clear link between all of them, but more importantly this list of topics seems to change considerably depending on who's teaching the class. The material itself wasn't too hard or obscure for the most part, except for some proofs and little details that seemed rather pedantic and necessary. The midterms weren't too hard either, but the final was really long and challenging. The main problem was with the logistics of this class. Initially we were told that there would be a weekly pset, but these were never regular and we had no idea when the next homework would be assigned or how long we would have to finish it. Ross would often upload the assignments several days after he was supposed to, meaning that instead of regularly sized weekly assignments we would often have extra long assignments, with a couple more days to finish them, due on different days of the week. As a result, Ross would often assign a flurry of assignments right before a midterm or a final because we hadn't had enough time to practice solving the topics on the exam yet. The last week of classes, we had two homeworks due. Ross also went out of town a lot, and we had a variety of substitute professors, most of which were good at teaching but had vastly different teaching styles. It took ages to get our psets back, so we never knew what our grades were or where we were making mistakes. In fact, we didn't even get all our psets back by the end of the term. Overall, horrible organisation that leaves you very frustrated because you feel like you don't know what's going on with the class even if you understand the material."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course, especially if Professor Berkowitz is teaching it. The material itself is very interesting (doing calculus in arbitrary dimensions) and Ross' teaching style was relatively easy to follow in class, and the tests were very fair. Perhaps not \"easy\" but definitely fair.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to another student. If you are applied math like me, you might have to take this as a prerequisite for MATH 300\/301. But this was also a very enjoyable math class, and I found the information interesting and challenging. Ross's lectures, though sometimes a little off-topic, were overall very clear and informative.",
    "would recommend if you want to move to 300 level math classes. would not recommend if this is just an elective in your major that isn't pure mathematics.",
    "Surely worse than 230.",
    "Yes! I enjoyed it!",
    "For your major, yes. I suppose this is a good introduction to some proof-based math before the all-out analysis classes.",
    "I would recommend this course. I thought Professor Berkowitz was generally a strong professor who presented the subject matter fairly clearly and had a good mix of proof-based and computationally based material. The course was challenging but mostly doable, and it was nice to have the additional support from the two ULAs.",
    "I think usually vector analysis isn't the worst course, but I think it was harder this time with Ross. I think the curve was kinda bad this year too. I think the topic is really interesting and important to give you an intro to what higher level mathematics looks like, but it can also be kind of abstract. It kind of just depends on what you want -- it's not at all like math 120 though. Also you'll never get your HW back rip. and no solutions either :\/",
    "Yes, I think the course is manageable. Of course, it goes without saying that students need to put in work. Moreover, it is very entertaining, and enjoyable.",
    "No I wouldn't, especially if you don't need to take it for your major. It is highly theoretical and is too much work to do if you don't care about the subject.",
    "If youre going to take 250, its probably because you need it for the major. If you dont need it, youll probably want to take it with a different professor",
    "If youre interested in getting a taste of analysis but aren't quite ready to let go of multivariable calculus",
    "100% depends on who's teaching it. The material is interesting and not too dense, but changes significantly based on the instructor. From what I've heard, almost every professor covers a different range of topics in a different style. If it's with Ross, I probably wouldn't take it."
