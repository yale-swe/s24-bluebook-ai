    "Yes, I would recommend it. Moreover, Peng Zhao is a professor I would definitely recommend. He's very clear, and you'll be fine as long as you have some ability in math to keep up since he doesn't explain verbally too much. Make sure to you over your PSETs once they're returned though. They're graded by some people, and some are stricter than others.",
    "its just your basic math classi would recommend it if you need to or want to learn calculus",
    "This class goes in a lot of depth, so even if you have taken BC calculus, this class could easily still be a challenge. The structure is pretty standard: lessons with problem sets due each week and then two midterms and a final. Only thing I'd recommend is to shop the different sections because the teaching styles vary and some teachers speak English better than others.",
    "Be prepared to spend time on the psets. A very manageable course overall. Make use of the peer tutors!! They're so helpful!!",
    "Standard calc II class. Not very exciting but not terrible.",
    "It is your standard calculus class. Take it if you need it.",
    "I didn't need to take this class, so I regret taking it, but if anyone *does* need to take this class, take it with PZ!"
