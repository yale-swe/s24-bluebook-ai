   "comments": [
    "A fantastic course - I would recommend it without hesitation. Prof. Kaplan provides a tremendous amount of personal attention, and seems to care about her students as people as well as scholars. Weekly reading responses kept everyone honest about doing the work, and the lack of final paper also made the end of the semester much more pleasant.Excellent selection of books which while sometimes difficult were always interesting.Overall, an excellent way to improve your writing in French while also having a great time. Take this class!",
    "This course is like a French book club. Class discussions followed a relaxed sharing of ideas kind of flow. I would highly recommend this class to a fellow student!",
    "I really liked this class. Professor Kaplan is a great discussion leader and very enthusiastic, and the readings were varied, interesting, and enjoyable. We had to write a 500-word fiche de lecture for every book we read, which were graded by a grad student\/actual published author. These really helped my writing and analysis, and were short enough to not be aggravating to write. The class is pretty high level, and there were times when I felt a little over my head (especially in terms of the quality of my French) but overall it was a really rewarding experience. Highly recommended, if it's offered again!",
    "Definitely take this class! If you think you might enjoy just a tad bit reading about the jolts and bolts in the lives of famous French writers, I most strongly recommend that you give Prof. Kaplan the chance to charm you with her extraordinary teaching. You will walk out of this class not only with a much better taste for literature, but also with the talent to skillfully criticize literature orally and through writing. If for nothing else, take this class as an opportunity to meet Prof. Kaplan - I waited for too long before becoming acquainted to her, and she proved to be one of the best professors I ever had in my entire Yale career!",
    "A good opportunity to improve your writing skills, with lots of opportunities to write and to discuss the works aloud in class. Pretty standard reading load for an advanced French class, with about 1 book per week.I would recommend this class.",
    "This is a great course, designed to give you a survey of autobiography and autofiction in French literature. The writing of the course takes the form of \"fiches de lectures\" or short critical essays that you write about each work. Because we had to write a short essay each week, I felt this course really helped me improve my writing in French. It was also a different type of critical writing than I was used to. Instead of focusing on in-depth close readings like a longer essay, this type of writing challenges your ability to do a compact analysis that also brings together or highlights a major theme in the work. Professor Kaplan brings a great contemporary perspective to this study of autobiography\/autofiction."
