    "huge amount of knowledge about catalytic mechanisms and metal catalyzed transformations",
    "I got more insight into which chemistry is actually being used in industry, I found this very useful. I also got a more thorough understanding of these reactions.",
    "I learned a lot from this course, specifically from the second half. The second half was so much better than the first. I really liked the focus on practical knowledge of reactions that are actually used frequently in industry.",
    "I learned in dept about cross couplings, heterocycles, photoredox and organocatalysis.",
    "Great course for learning the more practical aspects of rxns. I.e. ligands, solvents, precatalysts, functional group compatibility etc. Heavy emphasis on cross couplings, SnAr and aromatic heterocycle synthesis.",
    "learned a lot of mechanisms and current topics",
    "I learned about organocatalysis, photoredox, and transition-metal catalyzed cross coupling"

   "comments": [
    "This is an excellent course, and I can not think of any possible improvements.",
    "The strength of this course was its focus on practicality. The first half focused on material that seemed abstract. Also, during the first half of the class it seemed like we would learn a reaction and then we were tested on something of a similar category but that didn't follow the \"rules\" that we discussed, which was really difficult to do with a strict time limit. The second half of the course was extremely straightforward and I feel like I came away from it with a lot of knowledge that I will use frequently.",
    "Jon and Seth are both solid lecturers but there could have been more interaction between them and the class (especially given the small class size). Also we never got our midterms back. Both parts of the course covered really interesting material.",
    "Could perhaps go over more medchem reactions like fluorinations by cutting down on cross couplings",
    "good class",
    "This course is pretty good."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, excellent course.",
    "It's very hard to answer these questions because the first and second half of the course were almost completely different courses. For example, we never really received any feedback about how we were doing during the first half of the course, we never even got our midterms back, which was probably good because I'm pretty sure we all absolutely failed it. I felt like I was getting a lot of good feedback though during the second half. So I would recommend the second half of the course, not the first.",
    "Why not, if you're interested in organic chemistry. It's more interesting and engaging than Jorgensen's and easier than Natural Products (which are unfortunately the only other advanced organic classes left in the department for what that's worth), and you get to learn lots of useful and relevant chemistry that one would not normally see in the standard organic sequence.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course to any student in the organic track",
    "yes, if you are considering going to graduate school for chemistry, definitely take this (along with chem 528 - natural product synthesis)",
    "yes",
    "Definitely. This course provide a lot of good insights into organic chemistry"
