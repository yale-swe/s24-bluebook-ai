   "comments": [
    "This course does a great job of making students comfortable with speaking, reading, and writing in Spanish at a more advanced level. Coming out of L3, you should be ready to speak and write in present tense, but L4 really pushes you to experiment with extended verb tenses and express more complex ideas.",
    "I learned about Spanish grammar, especially the uses of the subjunctive. I gained some exposure to various authors.",
    "I learned a little bit of vocabulary and a ton of grammar which really facilitated higher level discussion in Spanish. I had a hard time staying focused later in the semester for various reasons, but I enjoyed the class and thought I learned a lot and got a lot more confident using Spanish",
    "This class taught me more advanced facets of Spanish grammar, but more importantly it gave me the opportunity to practice my Spanish skills daily and therefore gave me more confidence and facility in speaking and understanding Spanish.",
    "This class really helped enhance my speaking skills and also helped significantly with my grammar.",
    "Speaking, reading, writing, complex grammatical structures, presentation\/ preparation skills",
    "Due to a lack of a Spanish course senior year of high school, I was very nervous to come back to Spanish. However, now I have regained much of my confidence when it comes to my Spanish abilities. Now, I feel that I have gained a much better understanding of grammatical concepts that were hard in the past and can even incorporate them into casual speech\/writing. My reading and writing skills returned and surpassed my previous state, and my conversational skills vastly improved due to speaking in class every day. My listening skills still need practice but also improved.",
    "I improved my grammar a lot in this class. It was incredibly helpful to improve my conversational skills since you spend so much of class talking."

   "comments": [
    "The online textbook is a disaster. I feel that rather than improving my learning in the course, it detracted from it. However, the course itself (separate from the textbook) is wonderfully designed and well taught. The pace is perfect, and there are just enough activities and projects thrown in to make the course dynamic, but not *too* work-heavy.",
    "I think that the course did not really offer sufficient opportunity to practice the language in a more free setting. The course relied too much on doing exercises in pairs, which did not produce particularly natural conversation and often felt stunted as the questions or tasks were rather hard to build off of. This was especially true when we were asked to write down something satisfying certain requirements. Perhaps creating pairs was intended to ensure that quiet students would have the opportunity to practice speaking, but I dont feel like it usually had that effect. The conversations that occurred as a whole class often fell into a pattern of conversing with the professor, but with students not interacting with each other as much, which seemed less than effective. The class did offer some effective techniques of creating conversation though. I found that discussing thematic material in groups of 4-6 was generally effective (especially when this was in regards to something we had already read\/seen rather than speculation about something we would read\/see in the future). The oral exercises were also interesting, like the debate or the trial, although I think the groups were a bit too big for those. I did not find it particularly onerous to prepare for such exercises, and think having more semi-prepared oral activities like those would be good. I thought the discussions of Las Batallas en el Desierto were interesting, though maybe could have been done in groups rather than the whole class. I found the Supersite homework essentially useless. Though practicing grammar is helpful, doing so in such an uncreative context was extremely irritating to me and didnt encourage exploring the uses of grammar and learning how to create more varied sentence structures - rather it taught using very particular forms, which is not the area of grammar I find difficult. The feedback provided by the site was also not very useful, since there was some amount of mind-reading involved in performing some of the activities. I also felt that the homework was very much separate from the proceedings of the class - they covered the same topics, but there was really no reference in the teaching of the class to the homework. I would have prefered more homework like readings that directly served the purpose of the class, since this would have given the class more to talk about. I also would have liked to have assignments involving writing longer lengths at home, since this gives opportunities for creativity within the language. The class did seem effective in demonstrating a variety of grammatical constructs, if weaker in teaching their fluid use. I felt like I corrected a lot of grammar that I had previously used incorrectly and at least, in writing, can usually apply this content correctly. I also felt like the selection of readings for this course was very strong - there was definitely interesting thematic material, and the readings were at a difficulty where I could understand the plots of the stories well and capture many of the finer details, but where there was still considerable challenge in reading them. I very much enjoyed both reading\/watching and discussing what we did and think it helped my abilities with Spanish.",
    "I didn't think there was anything to change here. Grammar just inherently sucks, but I think they do a pretty good job of keeping students engaged and it's really very useful stuff if you want to get better at speaking the language",
    "I think this class was very helpful in allowing the student to practice his or her skills, and I think it could benefit from more open and less organized discussion, which seems to take up time in class that could be used talking.",
    "This course was run well overall. My only suggestion would be to perhaps change the last few weeks of the course as it felt as though the course was significantly more difficult and busy in the last few weeks.",
    "It's very helpful to have the course every day. I really feel that my Spanish improved. Worst thing about this class was that it used classes v2 not Canvas. Classes v2 is terrible, very hard to use",
    "I really liked the format of this class. The online homework problems were incredibly helpful. Also, having class and work every day helped to immerse myself in the language and gain an observable increase in my Spanish skills. There weren't many issues. Sometimes the online questions were unfair because it was unclear what they were asking and would only accept a specific answer. Sometimes the grading system for exams and assignments was also unclear. However, the class itself was great.",
    "I loved the structure of class where a good portion of class was spent talking to each other or in partner activities. I felt very engaged the whole time and I also liked that you could get to know your peers pretty well. The only weakness was that the workload seemed to pick up a lot in the last few weeks of the semester which made keeping up a bit more challenging."

    "I would. While there's a lot of work involved and the course is far from easy, the reward in terms of improvement in Spanish is worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, there are some pretty cool L5 classes that really motivated me to take this class, and I think it definitely made me more comfortable using my Spanish and prepared me for the next level of classes",
    "I would recommend this course to any student desiring to learn Spanish due to the amount of practice that one received.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student looking to fulfill his\/her language requirement. It was an overall good course that helped significantly with my knowledge of Spanish.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially since L4 is a requirement for many. It was much harder than I thought it would be though, as someone who did L4 as a first semester freshman. You will definitely see and feel your own improvement over time, which is cool. Very manageable but occasionally there are a couple of sort of unexpected rough weeks with a LOT of work.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course! My Spanish skills have vastly improved and I feel much more confident. The class involves a lot of work but it never felt overwhelming. I made significant progress in the language throughout the semester.",
    "Yes, I really liked this class. I learned a lot and also had a lot of fun."
