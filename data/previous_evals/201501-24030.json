   "comments": [
    "Leans more towards Joyce than Proust, but that makes sense given the amount the length of the respective texts and the time constraints of the semester. All in all, would definitely recommend.",
    "There's no one you'd rather have guiding you through the labyrinths of Joyce and Proust than Marta Figlerowicz. By the end you'll be able to say that you've read (more or less read for Proust) these two epics, and what's more, that you understood and truly experienced them in all their richness. I don't need to convince you to read Joyce and Proust (you must already know how indispensable that is), but I will tell you that this class is the ideal way to do it. Marta is an artist as a professor; you'll be fortunate to learn from and get to know her.",
    "Take it. You read two of the greatest novels ever written and get to discuss them with one of the greatest professors at Yale. It's one of my favorite classes I have taken, and I wish I could take it again.",
    "This is a fantastic class! Prof. Figlerowizc is fantastic and you get to read texts that are hard to tackle on your own. A fantastic seminar environment like I've always dreamed of. Take this class if you want to challenge your reading capabilities.",
    "ENGL 441 offers the opportunity to engage deeply with the works of James Joyce and Marcel Proust. Professor Figlerowicz guided us expertly through these challenging texts. I highly recommend taking this class if you are dedicated to the study of literatureespecially if you have an interest in modernism and the development of the novel. Professor Figlerowicz is not only a terrific section leader, but also a wonderful person to talk with about paper ideas or ideas about literature in general.",
    "The first half of the semester is spent reading Joyce's Ulysses and the second half is spent reading Proust's In Search of Lost Time, with some secondary readings throughout. A wonderful exposure to some of modernism's major concerns, an incredible syllabus, and a professor that Yale is lucky to have! Every discussion was thought-provoking and both focused and open-ended. Professor Figlerowicz is simply brilliant, but she's also really kind and approachable. A wonderful experience for those who are serious about Literature or English, and who are interested in or curious about modernism!",
    "The best possible way to be introduced to Joyce and Proust."
