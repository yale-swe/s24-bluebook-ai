   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it. I was shopping languages and this one was the only one I felt I would actually be able to understand and I still feel that way. If you are looking to learn a great language and about a great culture this is the class for you.",
    "The teachers are nice.",
    "If you're planning to learn Hindi, this is the class to take. It covers all the basics, from the Devanagari alphabet to simple vocabulary and sentence structure.Overall this isn't a very difficult class. The homework is 3-4 worksheets and a journal entry every week, with a quiz on that week's vocabulary and grammar every Friday. The grading is fairly lenient and a lot of weight is put on effort and participation.That being said, the disorganization of this class can be frustrating. There's no formal syllabus, and you can expect to get 10 pm emails about homework for tomorrow's 10 am class. The teachers are very forgiving about missed work, but fitting a random Hindi assignment into your full schedule can still cause stress.I would recommend this class to anyone who's serious about learning Hindi. Within a semester you'll go from basic pronunciation to writing entire pages in Hindi. Plus, despite the occasional stressful assignment, overall this class is a lot of fun, with plenty of singing exercises and skits to lighten the mood.",
    "I would recommend Hindi with the caveat that in order to really gain some proficiency, much will have to be learned on your own.",
    "This course was alright. Not too difficult compared to other language classes. I'll take L2 next semester because I possibly want to study Hindi over summer. However, it could have been better organized. Often, we wouldn't receive (long) vocab lists we needed to study before the quiz every Friday. Students seemed to always be guessing when particular homework assignments were due. Seema and Swapna are sweet ladies, but they're both native speakers, so it was a little hard for them to understand how to teach the language to someone who had never been exposed to it. Especially Swapna, she would sometimes get lost in a whole tangle of descriptions and explanations. However, Hindi in terms of learning the script really is not too difficult, and if you put effort into it you will be rewarded. The projects\/midterm\/final for the class were also really fun and engaging. Best part of the class!",
    "I would definitely recommend it. I took it to to get my language credit out of the way, and it is a ton of fun. Not 1.5 credits of work, the pace seems a little slow at times but mostly it is manageable and something to look forward to. Plus the different script means even mundane grammar assignments have an aura of mystique to them. Great for impressing friends.",
    "Yes. You get to learn an interesting new language with a beautiful script in laid back classroom environment. The teachers are great and the students are a pretty cool group.",
    "Hindi 110 is an introductory course to both Hindi and Indian culture. We were not only taught basic Hindi from the ground up, but multimedia was also incorporated; for instance, we were taught how to count using the Bollywood song \"Ek Do Teen\" (if you have not heard this song, look it up; it's undeniably fun and catchy). This class, while challenging at times, is never overly difficult. I recommend it to anyone that has any sort of interest in Hindi.",
    "Absolutely take this class. If you're at all interested in Hindi or Indian culture, this is a great class. It's also quite easy, very little work, only one quiz a week that is graded pretty easily. Hindi is great!",
    "It's a great, chill class. Instead of a midterm you have a skit project, and instead of a final you make a magazine. You'll learn quite a bit if you try, though.",
    "Hindi is a great language to take at Yale! It's quite laid back and the professors are absolutely incredible! Great class.",
    "Hindi is a great language class to take if you are trying to fulfill a distributional requirement. It is not that difficult and a very interesting and enjoyable class to take.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The class is pretty well taught. Though I had a bit of trouble with the quizzes I think that they were pretty fair for the most part. My one complaint is that I would like to see the vocabulary words for the quizzes sent out far in advance so that students can take in the words and absorb them rather than flash memorizing them for the quiz.",
    "Very fun class! You learn a lot and the teachers are really sweet! The curriculum does seem a little strangely organized but overall from knowing no Hindi at the beginning of the course I do feel like I have come quite far in a short amount of time.",
    "Hindi is not a hard language to learn. You will pick up the syllabary (not alphabet) quickly and be at ease with writing in the Devanagari script within weeks. The L1 class is a lot of work (think as many as six worksheets to complete in one night and a quiz to study for every week). On the bright side, writing and acting in a skit instead of taking a typical midterm is awesome. And the final is a magazine project.",
    "A fairly simple class that is a good introduction to hindi."
