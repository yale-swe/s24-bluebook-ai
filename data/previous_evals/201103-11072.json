   "comments": [
    "Yes, would recommend it to other students interested in medieval art or the body in art more generally.",
    "It was an ambitious class that ultimately focused largely on religious issues, and not much on science or medicine. I'm not sure I would recommend it to people in outside fields.",
    "Would highly recommend, for reasons given above.",
    "This course is exciting and engaging, but at times seemed disorganized. I would certainly recommend this course to another student, but students should be aware that this structuring was difficult at times and adjust their way of reading accordingly. I found it most useful to spend some time after I had done the reading drawing these connections independently, so that I could try and bring them up in class."

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the class, but I'm not sure it addressed the \"how to\" issues of scholarship very much.",
    "Engagement with prominent contemporary issues very important for any scholar. Specific treatment of issue of body as it cuts through all aspects of medieval culture (scientific, religious, secular) and wide selections of readings presents useful methodological and historical tools for future research.",
    "This course gave me the opportunity to learn more about certain areas related thematically to my primary research interests, as well as to further explore the ways in which the new material I read was related to work I have done already in other departments."
