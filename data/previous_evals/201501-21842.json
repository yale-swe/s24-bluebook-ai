    "L2 Japanese feels like a natural continuation of L1. It's certainly time consuming but if you put in the time and effort, you'll be stunned at how much Japanese you'll learn in a semester. I personally loved the small class sizes and all of the teachers.",
    "Japanese 120 is the second level of elementary japanese. You learn more of the nuances of the languages and how to express more complex ideas. I absolutely would recommend it, but only after 110.",
    "Pretty standard for an L1\/L2 language at Yale. Most of your grade is determined by the Unit tests and by the core conversations you memorize every day. Grading is also not curved, I think. Teachers really love what they do. Probably more work and harder grammar than Chinese.",
    "Absolutely take this class. You'll learn so much about this wonderful language and wonderful culture. This class is a gem and one of the most special of all the privileges that come from attending Yale. I cannot find words to describe how much this class impacted my year in a good way. All I can say is thank you for this amazing opportunity.",
    "Basic Japanese conversation, vocabulary, grammar, etc. for beginner's level. Very rigorous training and intensive assignments on the daily basis, which is very rewarding. Recommended.",
    "Very fun and exciting class, definitely would recommend to another student. Keep up with the assignments and always make sure to know skim the grammar structures before class each day, and you'll be fine. Tests weren't too difficult at all.",
    "If you're curious about Japanese, go ahead and do it! I just had a feeling that I wanted to take Japanse, and followed through (and then was required to take L2, which I loved). I feel like I could confidently make my way around and ask questions in Japanese, and that's a great feeling!"
