    "Awesome class. Take with Stefan if you can. His lectures are really entertaining, and I learned a lot. It's a lot of material, and it's not a particularly easy class, but it was really interesting and I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class when taught by Stefan. Unfortunately, I hear that he may have been diverted to Math 230\/231, but if that is the case I advise any freshman to take 230.",
    "Honestly, way better than expected. If you're a math major who took 250: warning there are a lot of annoying SOM and Econ biddies who will show up in suits and talk about finance BS in a snooty way. But if stefan is teaching the course it's definitely worth it!!! I thought I hated and sucked at analysis, but apparently I just hate and suck at analysis when it's taught poorly. Stefan was a great prof!!",
    "Very funny and entertaining!",
    "I would recommend taking this class with Stefan. It's hard to say what it would be like with a different professor, but if definitely gives you a nice overview of analysis (mostly just real analysis, although we did a little complex).",
    "If you're Econ\/Math, definitely take this with 250 beforehand rather than taking 301 or any of the (way harder!) classes. Also be careful who you take it with, that can make a massive difference",
    "A great introduction to analysis, a rather heavy workload but not impossble.",
    "Good course with a healthy mix of the practical and theoretical aspects of real analysis. Emphasis on fixed point theorems and other estimation techniques, and why they work. Homework challenging and simulating (especially the bonus problems!), if a little uneven at times. Tests very fair (if a little too fair). If you want to get anything out of this class, you need to do the homework though - and do it independently if possible. Lectures were perhaps a little more disorganized than I would like, but no major complaints. Stefan's musings make taking real analysis well worth it - he definitely cares about his students.",
    "The core of math you should probably know if you want to do things with math.",
    "Take any math course that Stefan is teaching I promise you will not regret it! The material for 300 can be tough, especially if you dont have experience with proofs, but everything is eminently manageable if you practice. The assessments and homework assignments are very fair, and there are ample opportunities for extra credit. One of the best things about Stefan is that he is a true democrat he always polls before deciding on logistical issues such as when to have the final, how many midterms to have, when the homework should be due, and what supplemental topics we cover. Take this class!",
    "STEFAN. STEINERBERGER. The quality of this course was almost entirely determined by this legendary man. Definitely take this course if you have any interest in learning about the foundations of mathematics. From what I have gathered, Stefan is not teaching it next year, which means that it will be worse. How much worse is unclear. Honestly take it anyway. Great material.",
    "If interested in problem solving!",
    "Great class. Material covered by Stefan was interesting.",
    "Great class, great professor",
    "Yea but depending on the professor.",
    "MATH 300 is a tough course, no doubt. Prof. Steinerberger is a good, lively lecturer and has many office hours and values student input. He is generally easy to follow, but the class did feel a bit disorganized at times. A hard class, but worth it in the end.",
    "take if you like this stuff. stefan is pretty easy",
    "Outstanding class, especially when taught by Stefan. The topics covered started with things that were review for me, so the first few weeks were kinda slow, but I'm sure it was new for other people, so it was understandable. The stuff later in the semester definitely helped further my mathematical knowledge and was really interesting. Also, Stefan is the best professor I've had at Yale, so that helped me enjoy the class even more!",
    "If Stefan's teaching it, TAKE THIS COURSE. Stefan is unreal. Best math professor at Yale by far. Actually, just take whatever class he's teaching.",
    "Math 300 is a great class. Professor Steinerberger is awesome and does a very good job of teaching the material. He's very passionate about math and it comes across in his lectures. Math 300 essentially covers the foundations of calculus in a rigorous way. The class is almost entirely proof-based, and almost all of the homework questions consist of proofs. But the homework is fairly reasonable and took me around 6 hours a week. The tests are also very reasonable (and significantly easier than the homework). Math 300 will teach you to think critically and precisely (as well as increasing your mathematical maturity), and I think that all of these things are very valuable. I definitely recommend taking the class.",
    "A good introduction to analysis. I think that any student who is studying math should take math 300, regardless of the professor (even if it not required i.e. The BA). Stefan makes it fun, but be prepared to spend a lot of time on the course.",
    "Recommended if you like proof-based math class",
    "This class was amazing. Just logistically, Stefan graded our exams and sent us our results the same day of the exam. He's so passionate about the material, and clearly considers how to make it easy to understand. Analysis isn't an easy subject but I never had trouble keeping up in class. Before this class, I was OK at math but never thought I'd get excited about it or find it beautiful. Epic class. I wish Stefan could stay at Yale and teach all my future math classes. He's exciting, hardworking, and magical. Best best best math instructor at Yale. He doesn't rely on time crunch tests to force a curve; he genuinely cares that we learn the material. He spends so much extra time crafting his homework problems to showcase interesting concepts, and I'm grateful that I got to take his class.",
    "If Stefan Steinerberger is teaching this class, I would highly recommend it to any student in math or applied math. From a content perspective, this class is very much an intro to analysis class. We were not able to reach a lot of the really interesting areas of analysis. However, Stefan taught the class incredibly well and his enthusiasm was really inspiring.",
    "Math 300 with Stefan is the best thing since sliced bread. He is a very engaging lecturer and is very sympathetic to students concerns. His problem sets are creative and his policies are fair. You not only learn mathematics, but you also become familiar with the history of mathematics through his stories about Euler, Cauchy, and Banach (first name also Stefan). A great guy and a great class. What else is there to ask for?",
    "Great introductory analysis class. Much more enjoyable than I have heard real analysis can be. Would definitely recommend to other students.",
    "good class that you should most likely take.",
    "MATH 300 with Stefan? ABSOLUTELY recommend it! He is a very clear instructor, who genuinely cares about his students. I loved his mini tidbits about math history and whatnot. He made a proof intensive and sometimes dry material seem fun and useful. Homework was sometimes hard, but exams were completely fair. All in all, great class.",
    "This course is for non-math majors. That being said, if you are interested in physics I would strongly recommend this class to you as a freshman year course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student. The material is engaging, Stefan is fantastic, and you will come out feeling like you truly understand math much better. Best math course I have taken at Yale so far.",
    "MATH 300 is all of the fancy calculus with proofs that you probably never learned in high school. You move very quickly away from \"infinities\" and \"infinitesimals\" to precise ways of bounding errors and seeing whether or not sequences, series, Newton's Method for finding roots, and Picard Iterations for finding fixed points converge. The subject is precise and beautiful while putting all of the rigor into calculus and analysis. Stefan is an amazing teacher who is very funny and clearly loves the subject matter. I always loved writing down quotes by him and stories he told about famous mathematicians. The homework is not too bad: it starts out pretty simple but quickly becomes more involved and difficult, but this should not be a problem if you prioritize this class properly and work with a group of friends (they saved me this semester). The tests are fair if you review the material from lecture and homework. I would definitely recommend this class to any math or science major who wants to know where analysis and calculus come from, or anyone in an applied science who wants to understand proofs for relevant topics better.",
    "Fabulous. Stefan managed to make a survey course be at once deep interesting, and accessible. The problem sets were challenging, the lectures extremely engaging, the material interesting, and the office hours helpful. Stefan is a gem in the Math department. Stefan was able to achieve the rare feat of explaining concepts while balancing two things: the understanding that the math is very interesting and has great applications, and a respect for the students' abilities by not assuming they already know the material. Furthermore, he was able to cover a huge breadth of topics in the semester. Lectures could at times be more organized; explanations less hand-wavy, and less time could be spent repeating proofs for the second and third times to recap previous lectures. However, these are small points compared to the course as a whole.",
    "In workload, this is an easier pure math course, that is, decent\/heavy for non-230 kids. People sitting around me used 7-12hours a week. You get a sense of what limits from calculus courses mean and how some integrals, etc., are approximated or why they can be approximated. In quality, math courses (fully) depend on the Professor. Stefan is great."
