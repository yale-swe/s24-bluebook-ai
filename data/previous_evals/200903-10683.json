    "This course was a great opportunity to practice before a mixed audience, such as we will face for job interviews. The students and instructor worked together to give feedback to the student presenter each week, giving a broad array of opinions on stylistic matters. I would highly recommend the course as a good professional development.",

   "comments": [
    "The course was very helpful, both during my own presentation and watching other students present, as it helped me determine what works (and what does not) when presenting to a mixed audience (rather than specialists as often occurs at professional meetings or within lab groups). It allowed me to further improve my presentation skills which are necessary for successfully completing research in this field (both for the actual thesis and at professional meetings).",
    "Listening to a diverse array of research presentation from my peers gave me a better understanding into the interconnected and interdisciplinary nature of the earth sciences. Understanding the earth as a whole requires a thorough appreciation and understanding of the unique research activities in the sub disciplines of the earth sciences."
