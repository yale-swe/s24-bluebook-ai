But I spent about 10 hours on each of the short writing assignments (though I know you could get them done in less, I'm just a perfectionist) The most time consuming part of this class is the case study paper. I easily spent upwards of 50 hours working on this project. Then the case study presentation took another 7-8 hours to put together, practice etc. And then also had to spend some time studying for the final.",

   "comments": [
    "The course provided me with an excellent basis on the science behind climate change and an understanding and appreciation for the variety of ways it impacts health around the world.",
    "Prof. Dubrow is very nice and knowledgeable. I feel that I learned a lot in this class. Prof. Dubrow provided extensive feedback on both the case study paper and presentation, which was good from a learning perspective but also meant more time had to be spent making all the recommended changes.",
    "A good seminar style course w\/ lecture grade aspects material. Strengths: Good foundation and flows logically from first class into later presentations which were student-run. Weaknesses: Very slightly; course can be very reading intensive; not excessively; but the in-class participation and interactions only drew from readings some of the time. Discussion questions were engaged with some prompting but not always seamlessly so.",
    "I liked the course and topic. The lecture layout was good. I would've liked to dive deeper into global policies and learning about climate models. Loved the student presentations.",
    "strengths: the professor (very responsive to students), critically important topic areas for improvement: could make the lecture portion of the class, especially the first few weeks, more interactive as opposed to a more one-sided sharing of information",
    "Strengths: covers a wide variety of climate change impacts and starts with a scientific understanding of the geological processes that feed into climate change which I appreciated. I think because it covers such a wide variety of health impacts, it's able to appeal to many students from across YSPH. Weaknesses: I don't know how much this can be changed, but having the course for 2 hours of straight lecture early in the morning once a week doesn't exactly entice participation. I'd suggest splitting the class up over multiple days or making it later in the day when students are more awake.",
    "It was hard to know what to study for the final exam because the slides are so information dense. Doing both the paper and the final exam make the class quite work intensive toward the end I appreciated that the final exam was moved earlier so that we could get home for the holidays",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I especially enjoyed hearing students' presentations of their case studies. I think it might have been better to have another short assignment rather than a final exam. Since there was a final exam as well as a final paper, it seemed like a lot at the end of the semester. Overall, though, it was great. By far the best thing Professor Dubrow could do to improve the course would be to push it forward an hour--8am is very early!",
    "This course faces the challenge of introducing climate change and health to people with a range of experiences. Some have little knowledge of climate change, others have studied climate change for some time. Some people have very little clinical or public health experience, others are getting their MPH degrees. The course is demanding in that you get an overview of climate change and climate change debate, then dive right into various health impacts. Some of the assignments seem designed to help you learn the main debates about how to address climate change. Depending on what you expect or hope to gain, the course can be overly technical and research-oriented. The course is mostly focused on research papers and reviews, and advocacy is fairly limited. There is also in some ways more work than one would think is necessary. Beyond the short papers and extensive readings, there was a final exam (relatively straightforward) and a 5000-7500 word essay due a few days after. About a month before the final essay, a rough draft was due for a grade.",
    "Strengths: 1. Very intuitive\/well-organized course, which allowed students to grasp a basic understanding of the fundamentals of climate change, followed by delving into broader and complex applications to public health, followed by focusing on specific topics that bring together CC and health. I loved the student presentations that complemented each topic, and genuinely enjoyed coming to class to learn about what the professor and other students had to say about their specific focuses. 2. Learning from Rob Dubrow (with his incredible wealth of knowledge and obvious passion for the subject) was a huge strength of the class. 3. I really enjoyed the two successive short writing assignments: the first, where we had to counter an important climate change denier perspective with facts\/figures, and the second, where we were given a little more free reign to reply to an economic perspective on climate change. 4. Although perhaps coincidental, I really loved learning from my diverse set of peers in this course, and I always enjoyed class discussions. Weaknesses: *All weakness listed are pretty minor and do not outweigh strengths* 1. This is minor but something I found particularly frustrating each week-- I would have sincerely appreciated if the instructor could have posted lecture slides prior to class each week, since it was very time-consuming to have to reconcile my notes each week with the lecture slides, and I found that eventually I stopped taking almost any notes, which was obviously a detriment to gaining as much from the course as possible. 2. A final exam along with a huge case study paper was a LOT of work for the end of the class, complemented by a significant amount of work along the way. Although I felt both were important and helpful, I believe the paper didn't need to be as long or as encompassing as it was. I, and others, ultimately felt like the paper involved summarizing a lot of other studies to fill space, when it wasn't always necessary. 3. There were complaints of a lot of \"hand-holding\" for this class (i.e. submission of presentation ahead of time, draft of case study) which seemed a bit excessive for grad school; on the other hand, Rob Dubrow's comments and suggestions were always helpful and ultimately provided significant improvements to my own work. 4. Although Dr. Dubrow briefly discussed the election and its consequences, I would've appreciated a little more focus or discussion on the political environment and potential action items.",
    "Amazing class. Learned so much"

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0He was extremely knowledgeable and eager to teach us what he knew. His passion for the subject truly came through and made learning all that more enjoyable. It was clear he had put a lot of time and thought into the course and was always willing and interested in feedback from students throughout on how to improve it.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Knowledgeable, organized, flexible and patient. Passion apparent in organization and engagement of material; not always in delivery.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow put together great lectures and topics. Some questions he asks are very open-ended and slightly unclear, making it difficult to foster discussion. Having a more discussion section setup may help.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0strengths: clearly cares about the student experience and does a great job seeking and acting on feedback about the course content, format, deadlines, etc. also does a good job summarizing the key takeaway points from each lecture, which is very useful areas for development: Rob could work on making lectures for interactive - he often asks questions, which is great, but he could maybe phrase them in a way that would spur more discussion. This was his first time teaching the course so I'm sure it will only get better next year",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0He clearly knows his stuff when it comes to this course. This was the first time teaching and he created very well structured slides and it's clear that he's dedicated to the subject and properly teaching the subject. He does tend to ask questions that are a bit obvious and I don't think students really want to answer obvious questions at 8 am, which creates for awkward pauses.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Clearly very invested in the class",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I thought Professor Dubrow did an excellent job teaching this course. I am so impressed by his decision to study how climate change is impacting health and to make it a priority for YSPH--he's truly inspiring. It was hard to believe this was only the first semester he has taught Climate Change and Public Health. I have recommended the course to friends.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Professor Dubrow is taking on an important challenge by teaching this course, as many people do not seem to readily make connections between climate change and health or realize the threat. At the same time, Professor Dubrow seems to expect graduate-level reading and writing, but in some ways treats the students like middle school children in terms of hand holding. For the essay, for example, we had to do a rough draft (for a grade) almost a month in advance, and there was a minimum requirement of 20 sources. I had never been in a class in graduate school where the professor had established a minimum requirement for sources, either a paper is good or it is not (and any paper that has a 5000-7500 word length most likely has a good amount of reference material). I also did not find it common to have professors require rough drafts due for a grade so far in advance. The benefit of that, however, is that if you work hard on the rough draft, the final draft goes by more quickly.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I felt Rob Dubrow was a fantastic professor for this course. As mentioned previously, his knowledge on the subject material was incredibly extensive, and his passion for the cxn between CC and health was always at the tangible forefront of the class. He was able to speak to a huge breadth of topics, and always seriously considered (and answered) student questions with respect and understanding. Prof. Dubrow was also very fair, encouraging and flexible (i.e. when students needed extensions, he considered giving extensions to all students, and he was very understanding when students needed time to figure out their case study topics). He also genuinely valued feedback on the course and would approach us independently and collectively to get opinions on potential assignments, structure of the course and each assignment, and even structure of the lectures themselves. It is highly unusual (and awesome) to experience such introspection and evolution of a course while it is happening.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is very knowledgable and dedicated to the study of climate change and health. He was responsive to the class' feedback, as it was his first time teaching the class, and eager to improve the class as it went along. He provided very detailed feedback on our work and is clearly committed to helping the students become incisive scholars.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Very helpful and clear"

   "comments": [
    "Learn about how climate change impacts health in a variety of ways globally and in specific regions. Background on climate science will be provided. Yes, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Would definitely recommend, just be ready to spend extra time on this course, especially right before the case study draft is due.",
    "A good seminar style course w\/ lecture grade aspects material. Worth taking regardless of familiarity\/comfort with many and varied themes.",
    "It's an introduction to some climate basics and how climate influences health. I would recommend.",
    "Climate change is a critically important issue and will only continue to become more important in coming years. This course is an excellent way to becoming versed in the language and facts about climate change, while understanding its very real impacts on all dimensions of human health. highly recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to others. It is a solid introduction to climate change as much as it is a public health course. You will learn about the impacts climate change has on heat related illness, infectious diseases, air pollution, and more. Everything is interconnected. My favorite aspect of the course was learning from my fellow students' case study presentations.",
    "I would recommend the course with caveats. It can seem like more work than necessary, and might be excessively technical or research oriented. That being said, there is no other course that links climate change and health together right now at the university, and anybody who is going into global health, health equity, development, or climate change policy should at least be aware of the connections between climate change and public health.",
    "This course is an overview of \"climate change and health\", but take this with a grain of salt, as it also delves deeply into a multitude of different topics within this broad title. Although a significant amount of work, the course will help expand your knowledge and become excited about this critically important subject.",
    "I really enjoyed the class and would recommend it to other students who are interested in climate change.",
    "Great class if you are interested in climate change. Loved focusing on something I am passionate about for the final paper."
