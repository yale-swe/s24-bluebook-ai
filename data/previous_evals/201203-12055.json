   "comments": [
    "The readings for this class were quite comprehensive and gave great perspective to the real Latino histories that we never read about in elementary or high school. The discussions could have been better, but Master Pitti always does a good job of directing conversations, and I loved how much freedom he gave us for the final essay- as a result, I did a good amount of original research and analysis. Overall, an important class that everyone should take.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. As everyone already knows, Prof. Pitti is a dream of a professor -- so kind and supportive and amazing at what he does. The workload is also really manageable. Typical seminar format of a book a week, plus a four- to six-page analytical paper on one of the books, leading discussion on one week, and a final research paper (15-20 pages). I appreciated the flexibility of the course in that we could write the analytical paper on any of four books and could write the final research paper on any topic related to Latino History. This class gave a good overview of the history of Latinos in the U.S.",
    "This is a solid course for students interested in looking at labor history, women's history, and immigration history through the lens of Latin@ history. The workload is very manageable and Pitti is great, but what you get out of this seminar really depends on your classmates. When I took it, this seminar had a lot of students who were new to ER&M, which led to some frustrating\/unhelpful discussions throughout the semester.",
    "I thought this was a great seminar, though in unexpected ways. I joined as a novice in the topic, expecting to learn about a group of people and about places with which I had little experience. I did learn about new group(s!!) of people and about places, but Latin@ Histories proved most of all a great exploration of historiography. Questions of narrative, sources, and memory proved central to the course and to our discussions. These topics are rich and provocative. Indeed, there were times when they almost overwhelmed the content of the books, but I didn't mind because they tied the weeks together and connected disparate topics. I'm excited to apply the ideas I picked up in this class to other history classes I take.",
    "I took this class with little knowledge about latin@s in the US but with a general interest in identity politics, immigration, transnationalism, and the policing of borders. Overall, it was a positive experience because I enjoyed the topics we covered. Though the coursework is def a lot and class discussion can stall quite a bit sometimes.",
    "Latin@ Histories is a great history seminar that takes you through a survey of various Latin@ communities in the U.S. It most interestingly deals with what it means to be a Latino\/a and how that is complicated by differing cultural identities among distinct Latin@ groups. This class has a heavy reading load, a book per week,and each deal with a different Latin@ community or topic. Take this class if you're interested in taking a survey-like class and want to know more about how Latin@ identities could be formed. The class won't give you a greater understanding of Latin@s in the U.S. as a whole, but it gives you glimpses of different identities\/communities that are interesting in and of themselves.",
    "Latino Histories is a pretty standard history seminar, in that you read a book a week for seminar, write a 5-7 page midterm paper, and a 15-20 page final research paper. There was also a 3 page paper on a memoir towards the end of the term.Subject wise, the class covers a different topic every week. Topics included Border Patrol history, the Immigrant Rights Rallys of 2006, and Latinos in Baseball. It's all over the place, but it's in depth and very interesting. If you have any interest in Latinos, I would highly recommend it -- you can't really find this information in any other courses at Yale."
