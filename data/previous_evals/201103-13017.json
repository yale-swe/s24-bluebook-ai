   "comments": [
    "Great class. Not a huge amount of work. Make sure not to get stuck in an Italian speaking section.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, every student should take Dante in Translation before they graduate. The workload is not overwhelming and the lectures are well worth attending.",
    "Take it if you like humanities. It is not an easy HU credit by far! The Divine Comedy is at the basis of the Western Cannon and it's a very important piece of literature. It is also hard to read. Take this class if you have an enjoyment or are trying to develop an appreciation for poetry. Otherwise, it will be very hard for you to enjoy this class.",
    "Dante in Translation is AMAZING and I would recommend it to everyone. It was particularly valuable having taken Italian and understanding the relationship between the Italian and English texts when it was discussed in class, but this is not at all necessary for an appreciation of the course. Professor Mazzotta is a brilliant man and a brilliantlecturer and if anything I would recommend taking the course to hear him talk about Dante. The ideas presented in class occasionally feel a little disjointed, but everything comes together beautifully at the end.",
    "This class is awesome and everybody should take it if you have any remote interest in Dante at all. Professor Mazzotta is incredible and the material is awesome. If you don't have a background in the Classics you can still get a good grade but if you are worried at all take it Credit D\/F but you somehow need to take this class.",
    "Yes. You will never have a chance to study Dante like this again so it is a no-brainer",
    "Class is interesting sometimes. I thought the poem got a lot more interesting when we entered paradise so my opinion of the class really changed for the better when we read paradise and when I wrote the final paper. Only take this class if you plan to finish every reading on time. I would recommend this class if you are interested in old literature and thinking about theology. I do not regret taking it and towards the end I found the part of the poem I thought was fun but if I knew then what I know now I probably would not take this class.",
    "Manageable, especially if you use Open Yale Courses as a reference point.",
    "Dante in Translation is an amazing class. If you are an Italian speaker, don't be intimidated by the idea of analyzing Dante in Italian in the sections; it's a ton of fun and a great way to keep up with the language. Professor Mazzotta is one of the most revered scholars at Yale; learning Dante from him is a privilege that everyone should try to take advantage of.",
    "It's not as great as everyone says it is, but it's worth reading Dante. I would shop the first several classes (since Prof. Mazzotta doesn't really say anything the first class meeting. He just walks in and asks if anyone has questions and then concludes it) to see how you like the materials\/teaching style. Many people say Prof. Mazzotta's lectures are genius but to be honest I didn't always understand them and often wished he would identify more clearly the main themes of the work.",
    "Take. This. Class. Professor Mazzotta is staggeringly brilliant, and you'll learn more the first day than you'll learn in some entire courses. Don't be alarmed if some of the connections he makes go over your head or aren't intuitive to you, because that's going to happen to everyone, and that's what section is for.The whole Divine Comedy is a beautiful work, but the Inferno is the only one you can really read on your own. It's more accessible than the others. If you want to really appreciate the Purgatorio and the Paradiso, which you should, a class like this will be invaluable. Shop one lecture and you will be hooked - that's what happened to me.",
    "Your grade consists of a midterm and final, each worth 25% of your grade, and a 3000 word final paper worth 50%. The exams have line IDs and essay questions. You only need to read a few cantos (not much!) for each class. The Divine Comedy is a challenging read. There is so much background information you need to know in order to understand it, and the medieval style of thinking seemed very foreign to me. Unfortunately, lecture was not always the most helpful in providing this background. I had no experience in medieval studies and ended up doing fine, but know that you will need to take advantage of section and do some reading on your own if you have no background in this sort of thing. I would recommend this course if you're interested in medieval history, philosophy, and literature. I would also recommend it if you have always wanted to read Dante and are afraid you won't finish it on your own. If you are more interested in literary analysis, you may want to look elsewhere, because Professor Mazzotta's insights often stray away from the text. Overall, I'm happy I took this course. Dante is a deeply thoughtful and insightful writer, but for me, his work would have been totally inaccessible if not for this class.",
    "If you have a sincere interest in The Comedy, take this course, though be aware having a background in other literature and Christian theology of the era will help significantly. You should also watch one of Professor Mazzotta's lectures on Yale Open Courses before you take this class to ensure you can follow his distinctive lecturing style. Overall, I enjoyed this course for its literary value, and Professor Mazzotta is an authority on Dante, so pursue this class if the subject material is for you.",
    "Take it! An excellent, unique class with an extremely talented professor. Reading is almost exclusively from the Divine Comedy\u0097one of the greatest literary works of all time. Mazzotta\u0092s lectures are fun and packed with information, but the exams\u0092 expectations are fair. There are two exams (20% each), a 3000-word paper (50%), and participation (10%). The paper was my favorite this semester\u0097not a burden at all. I took it as a fifth class and I\u0092m very glad I did.",
    "This is a great course, take it if you like literature, you don't have to be an italian major. The exams are kind of difficult, but if you study you will be fine.",
    "Yes! It was a fun course for anyone looking to study Dante in depth."
