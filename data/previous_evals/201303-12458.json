   "comments": [
    "Yes, I overall enjoyed this course and the material, instructor was hilarious, as long as you read the book thoroughly the course is fair and useful.",
    "This course is undoubtedly a must-take if you are an organic chemistry student. You cannot learn such interesting and useful knowledge from someone better than Prof. Crabtree. Also, although his book is somewhat expensive, but I strongly recommend everyone who is taking this course to buy one. It would help you through the course and it will definitely be a great reference if you want to re-study organometallics within a short period of time.",
    "A comprehensive introduction to the field of organometallic chemistry. Absolutely indispensable for anyone who intends to study catalysis, and a beneficial primer for other organic chemists planning to use transition metals in their research.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "It's helpful for students interested in TM study.",
    "sure, very helpful, learn a lot.",
    "yes, of course!",
    "Chemistry 552 runs the gamut of organometallic chemistry, emphasizing simple but predictive principles like the 18 electron rule and ligand field theory to rationalize a variety of chemical phenomena. I would recommend the course to any student interested in organometallic chemistry."

    "I'm an inorganic student so this course helped me understand more about the field.",
    "I learned a great deal in this course, most of the learning was on my own, from reading the book. Class meetings were not too helpful",
    "This course is a thorough introduction of the organometallic chemistry and I am currently working on a related project and this really helps me a lot. Thank you Prof. Crabtree!",
    "Probably helpful in further research",
    "helpful",
    "very good course!",
    "Definitely learned a lot, especially since I have never taken inorganic chemistry. Very useful to learn about the general aspects of organometallic reactions, and of metals.",
    "The course reviewed some content I had seen previously and went over a variety of topics I was unfamiliar with. Because I'm studying in an inorganic\/organometallic research group, this course is of immediate relevance to my research."
