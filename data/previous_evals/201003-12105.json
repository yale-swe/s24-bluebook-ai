   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. There's a fair amount of reading and the writing assignments can take some time, but the material is extremely interesting and the class is very laid back. Shop this class and you'll see what I mean.",
    "This class is definitely not an easy science credit. The tests are difficult, and the first half of the course is pretty boring because you talk a lot about bacteria. It's an okay class if you're into science and need a writing credit because the writing load is minimal, but the exams are hard and on a lot of little details.",
    "This is a tough class. It is definitely not a gut science course. You will cover lots of material. The class is interesting. You learn a little bit about every type of living organism.",
    "If you're really, really passionate about learning about all the different species of bacteria and protists and plants and animals in the world, go for it. Otherwise, you'll just drown in an ocean of taxas and synapomorphies that you can't bring yourself to care about.",
    "Recommend if you are a bio major looking for a writing credit.",
    "Fun class, lots of cool pictures. Would recommend it!",
    "It's a decent class. I didn't like it much because the entire focus of the class was just memorizing a bunch of facts about various species, but if you like that sort of thing then you'll probably enjoy it. I took it just because it's a writing credit, and only one 12-15 page paper is required.",
    "The course involves no required homework, besides the two short papers (assuming you take non-writing intensive), but the tests involve a ton of tedious memorization. Certain parts of the course were somewhat interesting, though, in the end, I can't honestly say I was better off or personally enriched by having taken this class.",
    "Yes. It is not an \"easy\" class but you will learn a lot of interesting information. The material is exciting and not too much reading.",
    "If you are looking to fulfill your science requirement then I would recommend you take this class. For science majors who want to fulfill the writing requirement, this course would be really easy.",
    "The class is a comprehensive look at the phylogenetic history of all life, focusing on the phylogenies of plants, animals, and fungi. It also looks at the issue of biodiversity and the current biodiversity crisis, though only for one week at the end of the semster.I took this class believing it would be \"science for non-science major\" course, oriented towards the social sciences. I was wrong in this assumption. For students who have a background in biology (i.e. biology AP), this class will be reasonable, if not easy. For students such as myself with a weaker background in biology, prepare to spend hours memorizing and sometimes reading unassigned chapters in the textbook to catch up with lecture material. This was without a doubt my hardest class. I am leaving with a comprehensive understanding of plant, animal, and fungi evolution, but far less understanding of the issue of biodiversity as it is affecting the planet today.",
    "I've copied my statement from the first question here:EEB 160 is a nice course to obtain a Science credit, or for someone genuinely interested in seeing how living things relate to each other and the environment. It is 'science for mostpeople'. The non-writing intensive option is very nice for people who don't want to write much; we pretty much summarize science articles, and these articles can be reader-friendly articles in Nature, or a science magazine like 'American Botany something'. Those this review may seem very casual, there is still a lot to be learned, even at a layman's level. I'd take it again.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend E&EB 160.",
    "This class was absolutely fantastic. Professor Clement is a very interesting and engaging lecturer. The readings are entirely unnecessary. If you pay attention in lecture you do not even need to buy the book.If you have any interest in biology this is a great class.If you are a science major looking for a writing credit take this class. The writing credit is one 12-15 page research paper on a topic of your choice.Take this class!",
    "A good course to take if you want to get a general knowledge of diversity of life and evolutionary history. Prepare for the workload though cause each class is stuffed with materials. I didn't take AP Bio and I had hard times absorbing everything learned in class.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone who wants to experiment with the science department at Yale. Be prepared to study a great amount for the three exams.",
    "It's a pretty easy science credit, but don't take it if you're looking for something more than general knowledge about diversity among the three kingdoms.",
    "Yes. Pretty easy, lightish readings, interesting matter, and open professor. Study with a buddy for the midterms and finals and it should be relatively painless.",
    "This biology is the basis of evolution, if you want to know the evolutionary pathways and how things came to be this is the course for you.",
    "If you take this class, you will be impressed by the incredible diversity of plants and animals that exist on Earth. Prof. Clement is very nice and shows some great animal clips. This class is also a great way to fulfill a writing requirement; you have to do one 12-15 page research paper on a diversity topic that interests you."
