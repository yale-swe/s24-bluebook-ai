    "Greater knowledge of French and proto-surrealist poetry, improved French reading skills",
    "I learned a lot about the French canon - I felt like I was reading some of the most influential poets of the 19th and 20th century.",
    "I developed my writing skills further with the help of my teaching fellow. Also, I was able to develop a skill set for interpreting and understanding poetry better than when I first began the course.",
    "It was my first introduction to a lot of poets, so I learned a lot about their lives and their writing styles.",
    "I learned a lot about the lives of major French poets of the 19th and 20th century. I feel, however, that we did not engage enough with the poems themselves, but rather took a historical approach, which I found very interesting and and informed my way of looking at their work.",
    "The assignment format was one of the best Ive encountered at Yale in terms of active, intentional, direct effort to improve writing. The mandatory draft, engaged feedback, and graded revision set-up was very well structured to facilitate practice, and the in-advance abstract for the final paper really helped us help ourselves.",
    "This course was extremely helpful for learning to analyze the technical aspects of poetry. I took the course more out of interest in the reading material than anything else but found that, as an English major, I benefited from focusing on the technical parts of poetry rather than narrative content. It was also refreshing to step into a different literary canon, with different preoccupations, styles, and legacies. This improved my understanding of the American poets that interacted with the French canon, like Poe and Burroughs.",
    "I learned to appreciate poetry!!",
    "Better writing skills and reading comprehension, specifically for poetry.",
    "This course was a cool way of packaging a survey of 19th c French poetry. Professor Connolly gave lots of freedom on the essays, and the lectures had a lot of fun, historical perspective.",
    "I improved my ability to understand, interpret, and write about poetry."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Most of the lectures for this class centered around the lives of the poets we read. The lectures would recount interesting anecdotes, biographical backgrounds, etc. And while these are always good to know, I don't believe the focus of a Literature course should be on the writers themselves, but rather on their written works. Or if these personal details are included, they should always be linked back to how they affect the text. The best lectures were those that referenced ideas (e.g. Surrealism) or focused on close reading rather than on anecdotes. To be frank, if I wanted fun facts about these poets, I could look them up myself. The context in which literature is produced is obviously important, but I think such context should have more to do with intellectual movements and historical events rather than personal details about individuals. I also think there is a value in examining texts without necessarily bringing in outside knowledge. The text exists as a work in and of itself. Let's do it justice. On the plus side, the actual readings for this course were amazing. Content-wise, A+. The course's approach and organization need work in my opinion.",
    "I really enjoyed learning about a new poet every week. It was very interesting to look into the lives of the poets we were reading. Something that might help is if the professor or a teaching fellow put the lectures written on classes v2 because sometimes it was hard to catch everything that was said. Also, maybe going over more of the poetry in class would help.",
    "The strengths are the syllabus which has a lot of great poets. I also liked the cultural context and biographical context that was provide, but I think there should be less emphasis on this. I think it could be improved by moving away from the q&a lecture format. I didn't really get a lot from students' contributions in lectures. I would have preferred some more close analysis of the poems. Also, for the French section could be improved. We all just came in and said one blurb about a poem per person, there wasn't much discussion. I think section could be improved by focusing on a smaller number of poems and having more people discuss each poem.",
    "The lectures, though interesting, did not always offer material that could not be gleaned simply by doing the reading and\/or a quick internet search about the life and times of the poet in question. I would have liked to see more of Prof. Connolly's own insights into the text -- or at least his interpretations of the links between biography and poetic output.",
    "I feel that the structure of the class could have been more organic and natural--if only we had focused on a couple of poems instead of trying to cover a larger range of the poets' literary work.",
    "There seemed to be pretty low accountability in this class in terms of graded assignments (no exams, etc.), but the weekly section and the participatory components of lecture helped me stay engaged with the reading. The draft-feedback-revision format of the papers endeavored for active writing practice in a way that most other classes Ive taken disregard.",
    "The level of interaction between students and professor during lecture was one of the best in any lecture I've taken at Yale, helped no doubt by the small lecture size. I found the lecture style to be a good mix of biographical detail and analysis of specific poems. If anything, there were times (particularly during the Baudelaire unit) where the amount of reading assigned was very disproportionate to what was covered in class, and having specific poems flagged for emphasis would have been useful. Perhaps the promise of integrating the poets covered with the modern world (as promised in the first lecture) was not fulfilled, but overall the arc of the course was well executed.",
    "While the historico\/biographical content of the lectures is really helpful and informative, I do think the course could be improved by a few more sessions in which lectures takes up close readings of poems\/poets.",
    "Excellent course, fascinating subject and instructor",
    "Connolly is a fabulous lecturer and the texts are wonderful!!",
    "It was a great course. The professor was engaging and knowledgeable as were the TAs, and the course was well structured.",
    "I thought the lectures and sections were interesting and the reading assignments were a very manageable length! I thought the class was great. One suggestion for improvement would be clearer feedback on the papers."

   "comments": [
    "This class has an excellent selection of literature, especially for someone who is interested in French literature, madness, \"writerly\" literature, or the foundation of surrealism. Since it's lecture style, it's not necessary to be really meticulous about the reading if it doesn't really interest you one week, which is nice.",
    "I think this class is really helpful for being introduced to the French canon. As someone who loves literature, I really enjoyed the readings for this class as well. The lectures were just not that engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is a great writing class. The professor wants you to enjoy the poetry that you are reading. The papers were enjoyable because it allowed me to think critically about a poem and develop my own interpretation on it. The feedback that I received on my papers allowed me to make improvements and better them. It was not a stressful course which made it an enjoyable environment.",
    "I enjoyed this course because of the syllabus and sometimes because of the lectures. If you know you'll enjoy most of the (strange and interesting and cool) poetry, then I would recommend it, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend this course if you want a great literature lecture in general. I don't think my writing skills or understanding of poetry improved greatly, but I learned a lot about 19th and 20th century French poetry.",
    "Great syllabus and poets that you're not likely to have encountered together (or at all). Celan and Baudelaire were personal favorites. The workload is incredibly reasonable (weekly readings, section, and 2 papers plus a final) and the poems thought-provoking.",
    "I do recommend this course--I really enjoyed learning about the major poets in French literature that not everyone knows about. The approach of the class allowed us to be creative in our own readings and to give the poems unconventional interpretations.",
    "Yep. This was a fun class. There seemed to be pretty low accountability in terms of graded assignments (no exams, etc.), but the weekly section and the participatory components of lecture helped me stay engaged with the reading, which most weeks was really really cool. The draft-feedback-revision format of the papers endeavored for active writing practice in a way that most other classes Ive taken disregard. Prof. Connolly is a great teacher.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, providing you are interested in the material. Professor Connolly is wonderful and the class is well structured, but I discovered that I wasn't the biggest fan of these particular poets.",
    "I don't speak French, which is no problem in the course itself, but naturally limits how deeply you can dive into the poems. If you like poetry, then you will be introduced some dope poets (Holderlin, Celan, Rimbaud, Baudelaire being my favorites). If you need to be persuaded of the magic and needfulness of poetry, then Connolly is a good ferryman. He is a great instructor, with an abundance of knowledge on his hands, both of all the poets you will be reading and all the languages through which their literature runs. The course load is not heavy at all and focuses primarily on close readings of poems you select, which is a real treat.",
    "Would recommend!",
    "Absolutely! You learn an enormous amount about poetic analysis and the great French poets!",
    "Yes I would. It was an interesting and well taught course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course"
