   "comments": [
    "I could not recommend taking one of his classes more! The course covers all interesting aspect of computational vision in very innovative ways with a extremely engaging and fun lecturer!",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT!!! Prof. Zucker is generous, passionate and a genius, everything you would want from a Professor. I took the class as an undergrad, and my lack of background in differential geometry somewhat handicapped me initially, but this class is all about being prepared to a life where you will not always know exactly what is being talked about, and what is asked from you is to hang on and make an effort, you come out of it feeling like your brain's size doubled. Prof. Zucker's research and the techniques and ideas explored are applicable to many fields, and the constant interplay of mathematics, biology and computation is delightful. Much more math than the last class, but you are also expected to follow conceptually rather than know how to apply everything. The homeworks are helpful in that sense, they are very guided and a great way to put what you learned to work.",
    "Yes, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Prof. Zucker guides you through a whirlwind tour of vision and is one of the most entertaining, intelligent and down to earth professors I've had.",
    "Highly recommend for reasons stated in answers on question 1 and 2.",
    "This class is fantastic. You learn extremely interesting material from the pioneer in the field. For the first time, I really cared about linear algebra. Take it now.",
    "Take it! This class is absolutely the best. More math, more bio, more Zucker doing his thing. It's great."
