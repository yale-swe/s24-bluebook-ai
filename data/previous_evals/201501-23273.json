    "You watch Spanish films and discuss them.",
    "Interesting, because there's always a large contingent of people who take the class and put absolutely nothing into it. That makes the class a little awkward, when only maybe 4-5 of the 15 people have done the readings, or even watched the movies.",
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Profesora Tortora does an amazing job in choosing some of the most important historical events in Latin America, and finding a related film to each. I really learned a lot about Latin American history and culture, and some of the films and the directors I discovered are priceless. One of the best things about this class is the special screenings and visits of some of the actual filmmakers of the films you would watch. Tortora is well-connected and does simply an unbelievable job in constructing this class as a once in a life time experience. I directed a short for my final exam, and it was super fun! Highly recommended!",
    "You watch movies and discuss them. Then you write some papers on the visits of movie directors and take two tests.",
    "Only take it if you're fluent in SPanish and love film. Also only if you have an otherwise light courseload and don't mind watching multiple movies a week.",
    "This is a fun L5 class. You get to watch a lot of interesting movies from many Latin American countries. Just do not forget to do the readings."
