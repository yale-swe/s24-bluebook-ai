    "The course was a very fast-paced and in-depth look at the concept of homology. I recommend the course another student if they are interested in the topic, and willing to put the time in to do the reading, and thus be able to participate more effectively in the class discussion.",

   "comments": [
    "This course did not contribute significantly to my dissertation research. It helped somewhat to deepen my knowledge of my discipline\/profession. The topic of homology is very important to developing characters and character states for systematics, which is an important part of paleobiology, however, the course focused more on the biological aspect of homology, so characters that might not be observable in a fossil, and also was not aimed towards those trying to apply the concepts to systematics. So the topic could have been relevant, but the focus was more towards non-relevant parts of the topic.",
    "It made me think more about the problems of homology and gave me some good papers to read but I am not sure I really made any progress. I am just as confused about homology as before.",
    "I knew nothing about homology\/gene regualtory networks. I now feel confident reading primary material on these subjects so that I can learn more."
