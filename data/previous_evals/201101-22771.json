    "I would absolutely recommend Prof. Gilmore's section (and DS philosophy, and DS generally). The readings were certainly challenging, but Prof. Gilmore had a clear and authoritative style that made them much more manageable.",
    "An exciting continuation of intro philosophy with modern thinkers--Kant, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard...More focus on moral philosophy as the semester moves forward (less on metaphysics). Phenomenal lectures all around. Gilmore's section was sometimes frustrating because we didn't have many inspiring discussions (more lectures with question and answers) but he is a knowledgeable professor and certainly knows what he is teaching and is approachable for help.",
    "Take it--you'll get a great introduction to modern western philosophical thought. Professor Gilmore is very good.",
    "Professor Gilmore is SUPERB in clarifying concepts and telling you the main objections and counterarguments. You will come away from section knowing so much (if you take good notes). He is a great speaker, has a good sense of humor, and makes pithy remarks. But he is also great with answering questions-so ask questions! If you want to make section more of a discussion, you can and it has been done before. so come to class having done the reading. if a a good number of people have done the reading, I have learned that in addition to the discussion between you and Professor Gilmore, your classmates make great points too. Of course, this is only possible after Professor Gilmore talks for a bit - ifthis is not what you want (meaning you want more arguing back and forth among you and your classmates) know what Professor Gilmore's spiel is always worth it and pleasant to listen to. You'll have such a clearer grasp of the material. THEN, you can really discuss. But take the initative. Professor Gilmore is a great thinker and speaker - he will address any doubts and challenges your bring to the text. Take the initiative and don't just complain about it later.Listen to what the professor says. He knows what he's talking about. You can be that too."
