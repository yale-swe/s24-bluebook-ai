   "comments": [
    "Learn about history behind Zionist movement, various strains of Zionist theory, and applications to the Palestinian conflict.",
    "A better understanding of where Zionism came from and how it developed. This class added the historical BODY to a hotly contested ideology. Many people have strong opinions about Zionism but have no clue what it really is (how not monolithic it is) or where it came from. This class fixes that misunderstanding among its students, at least.",
    "I learned a lot about competing histories and theories of Zionism. I felt like I learned so much about a history I already thought I knew a lot and learned how to criticise and carefully read material that is both fiercely personal and political.",
    "A good overview of the philosophy and history of Zionism. I learned about the different political, cultural, and religious aspects of different Zionist movements.",
    "A great overview of the different versions of Zionism that established the state of Israel",
    "This course gave me a fantastic foundation to better understand the Zionism movement. From the historical roots of the movements to the many ideological thinkers who influenced its progression, all bases are covered in this course.",
    "I learned the long history of Zionism the context of how this movement arose, the different streams of Zionist thought, and how this movement evolved along with the history of the land in Palestine\/Israel. I gained the knowledge and perspective with which to analyze the current conflicts in Israel. This was more than a current events course; it was both intellectual and political history."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Good class. Sometimes lectures were a bit repetitive and ignored important details, but overall a good class. Did a good job mixing history, theory, and applications and lectures were generally engaging.",
    "Suggestions for improvement: - Organize the course more clearly. It discourages students from doing the readings when Prof. Stern comes in and intellectually bashes a reading he assigned and apologizes to students for wasting their time to read it. It also discourages students from doing the readings when Prof. Stern arrives and lectures on something other than what the syllabus says. Strengths: the workload is manageable, the material is interesting, Stern is an engaging lecturer. This is a very solid lecture\/seminar history course.",
    "I really think this course is excellent and organised really well. The lectures and readings were really interesting and I feel like I learned a lot. Very specifically, I wish I learned more about the holocaust and contemporary Israeli politics but it is a course with so much to cover I did not feel like it missed very much at all.",
    "PowerPoints would have been helpful in lecture rather than the professor just talking. It would have made it easier to follow the lecture.",
    "This course provides a very strong historical background on Zionism with interesting readings and thought-provoking lectures. The section was also fascinating, as it gave us an opportunity to discuss literary works that broadened our understanding of the historical events we discussed. If possible, I would hope that this literary component would remain a part of the course if there is a different TA. The course is not always the most organized, but not in a way that detracts from learning. All in all, this was a great course.",
    "Strengths: relevant subject matter; small class allowed for engagement with the professor and TF; Professor Stern was extremely passionate and caring; good mix of intellectual, political, and religious history Weaknesses: sometimes the class felt like too much of a survey course; the readings and lectures didn't always align the class did not do a great job of enhancing the readings and making it worth reading them"

   "comments": [
    "A good but not great class. If you are interested in the subject area definitely worthwhile to take, but also not as insightful as some history courses because there is a bit too much emphasis on presenting different arguments or theories without deeply examining them. What the class does very well is putting the theories of Zionism in a broader historical context.",
    "The more I hear from\/speak to Professor Stern, the more respect I gain for him. Yes, this class can be disorganized-- and I hope that changes, although I don't think it will (I don't think many people did the readings, because Stern would come into class and apologize for assigning certain readings, or would just lecture on something that wasn't in the syllabus for that day). But this is an engaging and super manageable history \"leminar\" that is worthwhile to take, if you're interested in Zionism. Some people didn't like what they saw as the political bent of the course, or Stern's biases. To them, I say, CHALLENGE HIM! Stern loves to engage and argue and debate; he wants critical reception of his ideas-- but he can't engage with you unless you tell him what you think. You can definitely come into this class with different opinions and challenge Stern throughout-- he'd appreciate that. Too many people don't do that though. Sometimes the ideas in class felt a bit sterile because students weren't doing the readings or challenging Stern at all (from the political left). Also, if Lital is still around, she's a fantastic TA. Sections were a pleasure and a cool way to look at Zionism through the lens of literature.",
    "Yes I would, but I would caution that it is necessary to attend each lecture because Stern's, very clear yet sometimes meandering message, seems to be unique to the course.",
    "Yes. You learn a lot and Professor Stern is an exciting and brilliant lecturer. The course is so interesting and well designed -- I was never bored.",
    "Yes it is a very good class if you are interested in taking a class related to Judaism or want to learn about the Israel-Palestine conflict from a unique angle.",
    "Take this course!! Hands down one of the most informative courses I've taken. Stern is an impressive and compelling lecturer and he does his best to present a balanced perspective on the conflict. Obviously, the focus of the class is Zionism and not the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However, understanding various zionist ideologies is critical in understanding how the conflict has been exacerbated over the years. This class has a minimal workload: midterm and final papers and a final take-home exam, there's no weekly work - there are readings but Stern basically summarizes them in lecture so you don't need to read them though they tend to be short. Given the combination of the low workload and how interesting and provocative this course is, this course is a must-take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! By the end of this course, you will have both a better understanding of the history and new insight into the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This is a fascinating course that encourages students to question their readings and think critically.",
    "I really liked Zionism. Stern really cares about his students and is extremely passionate. He is a great teacher and makes the class worth taking. This course gave me the context and tools with which to analyze the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict, and I think that is invaluable for our current times."
