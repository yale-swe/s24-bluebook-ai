    "I would absolutely recommend French 120 with Madame Skorupa. My section legitimately rearranged our schedules so we could continue taking French with her this semester. If you are planning on taking French, do everything in your power to take it with Madame Skorupa!",
    "Take French with MADAME SKORUPA. It will be the best decision of your shopping period. She is the very, very best, and you will actually learn how to speak French while enjoying a comfortable, friendly atmosphere - and maybe even a crepe or two along the way! Seriously, take this class with Madame Skorupa. You won't regret it.",
    "I would recommend this to any student as an excellent early French course--and I would insist that they enroll in Mme. Skorupa's section.",
    "I love french. Take it. It's obviously the best language.",
    "Great course. You learn a lot in a short amount of time and come out feeling confident in the French that you know. If you can, take it with Madame Skorupa. She is hands-down the best.",
    "YEP",
    "I think it all depends on if the teacher suits you, one should shop around",
    "Take this class. Plain and simple. And take it with Candace Skorupa. I've heard the French department is generally good but Madame Skorupa is phenomenal! I am not exaggerating here. She is the best Professor dans le monde! I could start writing about how good she is and I can write a 10 page essay. If you get into her section, you are set for life. Not only will you learn French, you will have so much fun doing it. There is no dull moment in her class. She is extremely understanding. She pays individual attention and is basically a great human being. I should probably stop now. But again Mme Skorupa is the best professor in the WORLDDD!!!",
    "I have never had a teacher who takes as much pride in her work or invests herself so completely in each and every one of her students. Whether she makes an extra study worksheet the evening of an important exam or brings in crepes and French jam on a culturally important holiday, no extra task is too great for Madame Skorupa if it aids understanding, enhances knowledge, inspires excellence, or merely lifts spirits. Her enthusiasm is infectious, her warmth unparalleled, and her teaching methods direct and effective.STOP READING THIS EVALUATION AND TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "French 120 is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, but only because I took it with Candace Skorupa, who is without a doubt the best professor I've had at Yale. You'll learn a lot of French in 120 no matter who your professor is, but if you can, take it with Skorupa - she's funny, warm, lively, compassionate, friendly, etc., etc., etc. Too many good things to say about her. I think it's telling that the majority of our class started crying on our last day of class with her."
