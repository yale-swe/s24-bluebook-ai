    "This course provided insight into both the discussion of architecture through an art-historical lens and a specific historical genealogy that connected a variety of media to architectural production. It provided me with new terminology, theoretical sources, and methods that will be invaluable moving forward.",
    "I developed a better appreciation for the role of architectural spaces in the history of film as well as the role of moving images in design practices."

  {
   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course dealt with a broad historical and geographic range. There were many through-lines of analysis that were discussed at length and which connected the weekly readings to content that was brought in via class discussions. The course was fundamentally structured around a research question which was both a strength and a weakness. It allowed the course do be sufficiently open ended, but at the same time left some weeks feeling very tangential or tenuously connected to the arguments that had been made previously.",
    "I enjoyed a lot of the reading selections, especially in the first half of the semester. I think the class meetings worked best when Craig or a student presented images of a building or object associated with the readings."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. This course provided a space for a diverse set of fields, beyond the art historical and architectural to engage in relevant historical material, media theory, and methods of analysis that benefit interdisciplinary approaches and lead to rich discussions. In both content and form, the course provoked many insights and questions.",
    "Yes, I thought that a lot of the readings were good, and the subject matter was relevant to students from many disciplines."
