    "basic japanese - conversational, hiragana, katagana, basic kanji",
    "I can use simple Japanese to deal with daily life issues.",
    "Elementary Japanese is a very rigorous course designed to facilitate effective and rapid learning. My vocabulary, intonation, conversational skills, writing skills, speaking skills, and kanji knowledge have definitely improved. This course also requires the development of healthy continuous study habits.",
    "Reading, writing, speaking in basic conversation",
    "I learned how to write and read hiragana, katakana, and a variety of kanji. I also learned how to have basic conversations in Japanese relating to travel, desire, purchases, family, and counting.",
    "Ability to communicate in Japanese; basic reading and writing",
    "Intonation skills, speaking skills, writing, basic knowledge of Japanese",
    "I learned the fundamentals of Japanese grammar and vocabulary--enough to get me around Japan!",
    "I learned the Japanese language and Japanese etiquette.",
    "I have a basic understanding of the Japanese language, and I can read\/converse simply in Japanese.",
    "I must allocate my time differently than in high school. For my Japanese class in particular, much of the learning and memorization happened on my own time outside of class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "very intense, high workload, high daily turnaround, daily morning class, bi-weekly tests\/kanji tests",
    "The strengths is that we can learn and practice Japanese on a daily basis. The weakness is that we need to learn most of the grammar by ourselves, sometimes it's not efficient.",
    "The only weakness of the course may be some relatively ineffective materials, such as certain songs used for homework media assignments. However, even these are not a downfall, as they added texture to class materials. A distinct strength of the course is the environment, created by passionate sensees and hardworking students.",
    "The course moves way too fast. It was to the point where my classmates had no idea what was going on some days because we were still trying to learn the information just given to us. This inhibited my ability to speak because I was never able to fully grasp some concepts. I also didn't like the rotating teachers. It made it hard to get used to a style of learning because they were all so different I enjoyed the exercises in class and the daily homework was engaging. The course is very comprehensive and I was impressed by what I was able to learn in the amount of time we had.",
    "I think all of the teachers are very good in their teaching methods, however I would at least prefer we were notified that we would constantly be switching professors beforehand. I was caught off guard, not understanding if my professor was just sick, or what was happening for the first few times they were gone.",
    "I was hoping we could switch teachers less often; but besides that this was a very engaging class",
    "Strengths: meets everyday so it allows practice of speaking and writing Japanese very frequently, great teachers, great curriculum",
    "My intonation skills still need work but my strengths were in Kanji and overall grammar structure.",
    "The class is very fast-paced but all of the Japanese teachers are very good.",
    "A strength is the quality of teaching. The course was taught very well, and the professors are very good. I cannot think of any weaknesses at the moment.",
    "The course picks up speed quite quickly, and for me, it proved to be a bit overwhelming."

   "comments": [
    "would be great for someone who can commit to 1 hour\/day classroom time + 2 hours\/day study time for a language. it's coursework heavy for me, and i'm a graduate student.",
    "Yes. If they are interested to learn about Japanese culture and language.",
    "Definitely! If you want to learn a great amount of material about a fascinating and beautiful language, the work will be worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in learning the language at some point because it is a great setting to learn a difficult language in.",
    "If you legitimately want to learn Japanese I would recommend. The professors are very good and I definitely have enjoyed the experience. If you just want to fulfill a language requirement however, Japanese is a difficult language to learn and requires a lot of work, so I would recommend you only take it if you are passionate. The enthusiasm will certainly help the work feel better.",
    "Yes. Its an amazing language class and I learned so much.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the least about Japanese, please take it. You will not regret it. The East Asian language department shines in their presentation of material.",
    "Yes--not only is Japanese a fun language to learn, the Japanese faculty make it 10 times more worth it. Their passion for teaching Japanese is unparalleled and I am so glad to have them as mentors and to be able to have worked with them everyday this semester!",
    "Yes! Would recommend!",
    "I learned so much more Japanese than I thought I could in just a few months. Even though the workload is high, it is a necessary challenge for learning the language, and the course was still fun and engaging.",
    "Yes. I am amazed at how much I have learned from L1 already. The class is quite intensive and demanding of time and effort, but it is extremely worth it, just based off how much I have learned."
