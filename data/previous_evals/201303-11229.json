   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it. If you want to be familiar with the big names of Western Lit canon from Ancient Greece to Medieval Italy, take this class. It's rigorous but so worth it.",
    "DS Lit is a survey course of the development of Western Literature from Homer to the Middle Ages. It is demanding, fast-paced, and very compelling. I would highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in literature, even if they plan to major elsewhere, since it provides a great intellectual foundation. Duval is a terrific professor, too.",
    "I would absolutely recommend DS Lit. It was my favorite of the three DS classes this first semester. While it's fine if you skim H\/P or Philosophy readings a bit, if you have time to do just one of the readings thoroughly, really read the lit books. You'll be doing yourself a huge favor- these are amazing books, from the very start of the western canon with the Greeks, up to Dante- while you go at a really fast pace, it's definitely do-able, and it's worth it when you end the first semester having read many of the major works of the western canon and have a great basis for future study.",
    "Absolutely take this course, with Duval if you can.",
    "We cover alot of material but it really gave me a new way of reading literature and of writing essays. I highly recommend it.",
    "It's a lot of reading great books and writing about them, which is exactly what they tell you it is. If you like that, then it's a great class.",
    "If you want to take DS Literature with the best professor available, take it with Professor Duval. He is challenging but also immensely rewarding. He provides detailed comments about how to improve your writing, and I'm sure every person in my class grew as a writer because of it. He is tough, but don't let that shy you away. You will leave with powerful tools that will serve you for the rest of your Yale career.",
    "This is an intensive study of major works of literature of the western canon. It is exactly what one would expect from a Directed Studies course, and of all the the professors to take it with, Duval is probably the best. Highly recommended."
