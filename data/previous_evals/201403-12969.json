    "Each week is a different way to analyze art (one is social history, one is feminism, one is iconology, etc.) It's a requirement for HA majors but even if it wasn't, I would definitely recommend! Very interesting and useful for organizing\/putting in perspective what we've learned by taking classes in the major.",
    "Take this course as early as you can in your art history career at Yale. You will be thankful you did because it will change your way of thinking, enrich all future classes you take at Yale and the engagement you have with art (and the aesthetic world). The course itself is rich, but take it with Sears if possible-- she manages to create a supportive and exciting environment in which to discuss these ideas.",
    "Every Art and Art History Major HAS to take the class to get their degree so you should take it with an awesome Professor aka Sears. She is actually extremely fantastic and her focus on non-Western Art always makes it a constant learning experience. The material can get exhausting because the readings happen to be a little dense BUT the opportunity to dissect and talk about them make this a really good seminar. I was lucky to have a class where everyone was super engaged, the presentations were fantastic, and the atmosphere was more of fun\/friendly learning which I think was the best.",
    "Absolutely yes to those in the major, but people outside the major might have a tougher time with it.",
    "HSAR majors should definitely take it with Professor Sears.",
    "For Art History majors, this changes everything, you have to take it so I don't need to sell it but I would recommend taking it earlier rather than later. This course is truly inspirational and if you can take it from Professor Sears, do it!"
