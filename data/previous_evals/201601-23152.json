   "comments": [
    "A fantastic course in general; professor Garfinkel is extremely knowledgeable and accessible, and provides useful feedback on the papers. I got a lot more out of the class by doing the readings and submitting papers at regular intervals during the semester.",
    "Great class! Very interesting examination of the law with a great professor. The Judge is fantastic. More law-oriented than education-oriented, so be prepared for that.",
    "Amazing experience, would highly recommend to anyone interested in education or law.",
    "Great course for all interested in law. It is heavy on case law and reading of the text. You will learn how to solve legal problems and might meet some very interesting guests along the way. Also, Garfinkel is a gem.",
    "Yes! But only if you are on top of your work and pace out the papers so you don't have 25 pages to write at the end of the semester.",
    "Great class if you're interested in education policy or the law in general (or both). Education law is a pretty interesting field of law because constitutional law has a different level of rigor in school settings. You also run into fascinating questions and thought experiments that often don't have an easy answer. Prof. Garfinkel is also an excellent instructor and the most caring and benevolent person. Definitely take this class.",
    "Structure of the class\/Topic - Each week we talk about a different topic related to Education Law, discussing the cases we read and doing a few problems in the casebook. The assignment was simply to write 25 pages by the end of the semester. I enjoyed being able to write about a topic when inspiration hit or when I had time. Professor Garfinkel: Professor Garfinkel was a wonderful professor for 2 main reasons: 1. He is so knowledgeable and give perspective from many years working in the legal field. He makes class worth going to because we talk about the readings but also about related topics that he is knowledgeable about. 2. He is approachable. Even though he doesn't have an office on campus, his attitude makes it easy for students to approach him about meeting outside of class, even to just eat dinner with him. Take the class if you get in! It's worth it :)",
    "Take this class if it is offered, amazing.",
    "If you're into education or law, take this. It may not be challenging enough for those who have already taken many law classes but I learned a lot from it since it was my first law class.",
    "This course deserves its sterling reputation as well, unfortunately, as its long wait-list. I would strongly encourage anyone interested in education policy, law or even politics more generally to take this course. The subject is fascinating and relevant, and Dr. Garfinkel is one of the finest instructors I have encountered in my time at Yale. As an afterthought, it is worth noting that Dr. Garfinkel allows his students to turn in assignments on a very flexible schedule, which is a definite plus. I wholeheartedly and unreservedly recommend this class.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you're interested in education or law. The readings can be dense, but it's a rewarding class. Not a bad workload if you manage your time well, though there's a decent amount of reading every week.",
    "Great overview of the seminal cases in education law. I'm almost certainly not going to be involved in education law, or probably even law school, but it was a great experience getting familiar with case law and understanding what cases have helped create our current state of public education. I would definitely recommend the class to you if education law (or either of its constituents) interests you.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in schools and school policy. Even if you don't want to be a lawyer, you will probably find the questions this class deals with very interesting. Professor Garfinkel is warm, funny, and a lovely class leader; he also grades fairly and gives you great feedback on papers. The workload is very manageable (50-100 pages a week), so you should do it! You won't get much out of class sessions if you skip the reading that week. This is definitely a class where you have to be self-motivated, since you turn in writing whenever you want over the semester and since Professor Garfinkel is pretty chill. But I found the issues really fascinating and the reading\/writing fairly enjoyable, and the relaxed atmosphere was pretty nice for a Thursday evening class. Professor Garfinkel has a lot of experience dealing with school law as a judge, and he brings in guests with equal expertise, so it's a really cool way to get a sense of how the words in your textbook apply to people's lives.",
    "EDST 230 is a basic foray into education law, with an excellent Judge who helps you through the legal lingo and frameworks to a deep understanding of the recent past' history of education issues. A must-take class for anyone interested in how the legal system interacts with issues of race, class, gender, religion, among others in the field of education."
