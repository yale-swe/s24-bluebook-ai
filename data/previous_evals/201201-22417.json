    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. This is literally the most boring class I have ever taken. By the end of this year I will have taken 53 classes at Yale and this was by far the MOST boring in ANY department, and this includes regular pre-med intro lectures. Also, seriously, what science lecture requires you to go to class?! I WOULD LITERALLY RATHER BE RUN OVER BY A CAR THAN TAKE THIS COURSE. I STILL HAVE NIGHTMARES ABOUT THE FIRST LECTURE.But to be fair the professors were fine. Especially Prof. Irish who is really sweet and seems to genuinely care.",
    "MCDB 210 was probably the most boring I've ever had to suffer through. I took it expecting much more on modern regenerative biology techniques and therapeutic applications. However, I often felt that I was merely memorizing a ton of details to regurgitate on the exams. Stay away unless you're an MCDB major, in which case it's probably not as bad as cell bio.",
    "This course is an introduction to the basic theories and techniques underlying developmental biology. Professor Irish is an especially wonderful teacher, and I really enjoyed her lectures. It was a bit memorization-heavy at times, but I enjoyed the experimentally-based curriculum because it made the information in the field feel more accessible and showed the value of basic experiments. The emphasis on thinking and experimental design was apparent in the quizzes, but the exams were more focused on memorizing facts and processes. A good course to take.",
    "Take it if you're not worried about arbitrary grading. Not too difficult",
    "Developmental Bio is a very specific topic. Make sure that you are interested in it before you sign up to take it, or you will be very bored. Weekly quizzes are helpful for making sure that you stay on top of the material. All of this being said, if you haven't taken Bio of Reproduction, I would take that instead because it is a little less focused on one subject matter and, because of that, is more interesting.",
    "While the lectures on stem cells and genetic engineering were fascinating, I found the rest of the course to be a bit dull. This was not helped by the fact that every class consisted of a slide show and lecture. The weeklyquizzes are a bit stressful, but they are not graded too harshly.",
    "Course about developmental embryogenesis. Focuses a lot on experiments",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. I didn't enjoy it at all.",
    "no. horrible curve.",
    "This class is a rigorous overview of developmental biology. You will walk in knowing about hox genes and a few developmental processes. You will walk out knowing integral stages of development including gastrulation, embryogenesis and neurulation, how nature operates to pattern these processes and how these events are conserved across organisms.",
    "This class was probably a lot nicer than cell bio would have been. The lecturers were all pretty clear, though your degree of interest in the content will also factor into how much you enjoy the course. Study a lot for the exams--the quizzes really don't count for much of your grade (hoping that will change in the future). Other pros include: late morning time slot, central campus location, no final.",
    "A fantastic class! As an MCDB major, I decided to take Dev Bio instead of Cell Bio, and I couldn't be happier with that choice. Really interesting material, really engaging professors. A nice amount of work, but not too much. Be prepared for hard grading on the exams, but there's a curve at the end.",
    "It will make you love the world, and appreciate life in a whole new way. Lectures are great, and topic is amazing. Grades suck, though - expect to get of for random things.",
    "Quizzes are really variable. Tests are guaranteed to be comprehensive and hard. You will learn a lot about developmental biology. It's a small class so you will feel a closer connection to the professors. Definitely take it - it will challenge you conceptually without making you do a lot of busy work.",
    "I would recommend it. The material isn't too hard and if you keep up with the weekly quizzes, reviewing for the exams is a breeze.",
    "Don't be scared. Weekly quizzes actually help you out in the end since you only spend one day studying for the final exam. Just your standard bio course.",
    "Developmental Biology is a survey on the ways signaling and movement among cells leads to the development of plants, flies, and vertebrate. It is a great course for anyone who is interested in development on a cellular and genetic level. It also does a very good job of explaining the experiments that were performed in order to obtain all this information. If you are deciding between this class and Cell Biology, this class is definitely more relaxed but Cell Biology teaches you a lot more information about the cell at a much more detailed level.All the lecturers were great. The quizes and tests follow the lecture material well. There is not that much need to read the textbook other than to solidify your knowledge of the lecture material. This semester around 12% of students got A's and about 20% got A-'s.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student because cell biology is a better choice. I came away from this course not learning much of anything, and wishing that I had taken Reproductive Biology instead. Not worth it. The lectures are dry and boring (the only good one was the stem cell one). Many students dropped it throughout the semester.",
    "Dev is usually pretty interesting, although the class can drag on. The TFs are wonderful, along with most of the professors. (Kankel can be hard to follow at times). There are weekly quizzes (Th) and 3 midterms, but no final!Watch Out for the grade distribution, though - there doesn't seem to be a curve, and a significant amount of the class got C's."
