    "The seminars are interesting. I thought there were more memorable ones last semester, but they were OK this time around too. It's not really an issue of the speakers - most of the speakers that come in are clearly experts in their field and are able to talk about some interesting things they do. But I yearn to more stimulated by these talks. I think there should be a greater diversity of issues brought to the table, and possibly bring in some people who aren't doing research, but rather who are out in the field affecting change. They're both critical, but I think there's a lacking of the latter.",
    "It's fine. Nothing gained, nothing lost. I appreciate that it's only a few talks.",
    "A semester of interesting and engaging speakers!",
    "Its strengths are that we learned about a range of research going on in the social and behavioral sciences field. The weakness was that sometimes the speaker's work was not relevant or pertinent to students interests (obviously this depends on the student). I think it also could be helpful to distribute some readings\/publications from the person speaking that day so that students could get a sense of their work.",
    "I liked it! The guest speakers were good and there was FREE FOOD! I would have liked to have seen more diverse groups of speakers, though. All of the speakers this semester presented only on their research. I would have loved to have seen guest speakers who are doing practice-based work and not solely research.",
    "Strength - it provides a variety of research professors in social and behavioral sciences and epidemiology Weakness - it does not include many professionals outside of academia Ways to improve - bring public health practitioners who are not in academia",
    "I really enjoyed the seminar series, but I wish we had a space to discuss the presentations we saw more. Also, sometimes there wasn't enough vegetarian food.",
    "The speakers were a great mix of public health people with different research interests, which I really appreciated. I think the seminar could be improved by inviting a greater variety of speakers, especially by including those who might not be working in academia, as many SBS students are not interested in going into research.",
    "Really interesting speakers and yummy lunch! Would like to have public health professionals as well as academics for speakers."

    "Interesting seminar series that lets you hear about a lot of current research"
