   "comments": [
    "The course examined the way historical, political and social contexts shape life in the Caribbean, and challenges students to think about everyday life as an average English-speaking West Indian. To make it more interesting, our professor is from Barbados and teaches like a typical West Indian professor. It's a fun culture course, and it's probably the closest you can get to taking a trip to the non-tourist like areas of the Caribbean and experiencing it for yourself. I'd recommend if you're at all interested in exploring life in the Caribbean, but be prepared for the professor's teaching style. He can be very blunt, but you shouldn't take offense. He's a great guy!",
    "This class is great if you are interested in learning more about Caribbean life. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "A survey of the complex world of the Caribbean. The course explores the experiences of the English-Speaking Caribbean through literature, nonfiction works, book reviews, and essays. The amount of work is fair- more than average (a two page paper is due each week along with approx. 150-200 pages a week). The class concludes with a final 15 page paper, which actually is a lot of fun to write.I would recommend this class. However, I strongly suggest that you take this class credit\/d. The best decision I have made at Yale.",
    "I would recommend Caribbean Lives to others students. It is a fun and lively class where we discuss various books by Caribbean writers."
