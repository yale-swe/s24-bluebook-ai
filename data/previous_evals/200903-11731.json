    "Portuguese 150 is much more of a material-based class than a grammar class. It's mostly about Brazilian culture and history during the period of the dictatorship, and includes movies and some popular songs from the era. You do very little formal grammar, just some review of main points that you should have learned in lower levels, and focus on learning through the texts. The amount of work is not excessive, just make sure that you space out the essays properly or you will have a ton of stuff to hand in during the last week of class. When you choose the book that you want to present about, make sure that you find it interesting because you will spend a lot of time reading it.",
    "Take this class if you're really interested in learning about contemporary Brazilian history. If you've been to Rio, you'll love it",
    "Yes, the course does a good job of presenting advanced material in an interesting manner. It was like taking a short course in modern Brazilian literature and history."
