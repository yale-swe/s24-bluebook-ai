   "comments": [
    "I really liked being in a freshman seminar for the first semester. I met some great people and had a lot of fun! I also enjoyed the subject matter and learned a lot about art.",
    "great books, not too much reading, good class discussion, knowledgeable and fair professor, decent amount of writin. be prepared to always be doing something for this course-there are a lot of short writing assignments-but opportunities for revision are plentiful which makes these not too high stress. be prepared to do some formal analysis (analyzing paintings) but this is fun and a nice change from typical literary analysis. i recommend this course, especially if you like expressing your opinions in class and having class discussion.",
    "Fun, but don't romanticize too much. The title explains it all, perhaps with painting in parentheses though. If you love Russian literature you will (probably) love the class!",
    "We read The Idiot by Dostoevsky and Anna Karenina by Tolstoy as our two major readings. We also read some \"short\" stories(which are like 100 pages each) by each of them. A midterm paper from 6 to 8 pages and a final research paper from 10-12 pages with weekly 2 page long assignments. The work isn't too arduous and its on interesting subjects. I would definately recommend this course if you enjoy thinking about good literature.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend it. It is a seminar that teaches how to read and write well on a college level, and Molly is a great professor to have. There is a lot of reading, but it is all really interesting if you like really good novels.The course is an extremely thorough introduction to both the Russian literature of the 19th century and to art history. In terms of the literature, we read two great novels, \"The Idiot\" and \"Anna Karenina,\" and we studied them in death. By bringing in secondary readings including literary criticism, historical contexts, and short stories by the authors, we were able to go into the novels on multiple levels, including small detail levels and big picture levels. We also wrote a lot, and Molly compiled writing tips throughout the semester that helped improve my writing. I wish that we were able to spend more time examining individual moments in the text rather than so many big picture questions, but both are worthwhile.In terms of art history, we were able to look at a lot of art that related to the literature, and Molly taught us how to look at art and analyze it. We were pushed to look at art that we could see in person which enabled me to explore the resources at Yale.Molly was a great teacher. She was extremely accessible during office hours. She gave each student personalized attention by being willing to sit down and discuss writing or by providing each of us different resources that were appropriate to our individual research projects. She also provided interesting questions for us to ponder during class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they wanted to take this as one of their centerpiece classes for the semester. It was a lot of work, but if you have the time to commit to it, it is very rewarding. I would not recommend this course to a student wishing to improve his writing, rather one who enjoys literary writing.",
    "If you have the slightest interest in literature or art, TAKE THIS CLASS. Molly (as she likes to be called) is an AMAZING young professor. She is eloquent and articulate, and her ideas are fascinating. While the reading is, how should we say, plentiful, you will enjoy it because it is russian literature and not dry academic papers. It's a writing credit, but it didn't feel like I did tons of writing. I had always hated writing before, but I absolutely enjoyed doing my final paper. She'll likely be offering this as a graduate seminar in the future, but if it is a freshman seminar again, you won't regret signing up---it's a great way to be acquainted to Yale and its resources.",
    "This class offers an in depth look at Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. Very interesting. Make sure you keep up with the reading! I would certainly recommend it because these are books you really should read, and Professor Brunson is very insightful.",
    "Great course. Definitely take it if you are remotely interested in the writing of Dostoevsky and, especially, Tolstoy.",
    "In this class you read Dostoevsky's The Idiot and Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, along with a bunch of short stories and outside sources. You also get to analyze Russian art and other works at the Yale Center for British Art. All of this combines to be a great in-depth study of the two novels and Russian society of the eras inwhich they take place. Molly is a wonderful teacher who knows how to direct the discussions in class and has a knack for articulately expressing exactly what you feel. I would definitely recommend this class as long as the student has any interest in Russian literature, and is willing to read the novels fully and completely and be an active class participant!"
