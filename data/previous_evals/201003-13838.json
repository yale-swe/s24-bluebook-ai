   "comments": [
    "This course is always taught by a graduate student, and this year's instructor this year was uninspiring, out-of-touch, and not very knowledgeable. This is a literature course, and would be improved greatly if an expert outside of the history department (a scientist or economist ideally) could shed some light on present realities of environmentalism. Look elsewhere - it's courses like these that give American Studies a bad name.",
    "This was an awesome class! You write three short papers (which are all fun and include a movie review, reading response, and natural history essay), as well as an extended research paper on a topic of your choosing. The readings give you a great survey of wilderness thought in the U.S. It's also very current. There's a field trip component, which is really fun. It is a fair amount of reading and you have to attend several movie screenings, but it often didn't feel like work since the material is so interesting. Helen was a fantastic instructor! The character of the class is bound to change depending on instructor and the students in the seminar.",
    "This class is something of a historical survey of the thoughts and policies about wilderness, from colonial times to the modern day. It asks interesting questions and exposes you to many works of important American writers, but the ultimate value of the course depends entirely on the instructor.",
    "I think this is a great seminar if the student is interested in learning about wilderness and its history and repercussions. Some of the readings seem to repeat themselves and become tedious, but the class only meets once a week and it is amazing how quickly the time goes by while in discussion. Definitely a good class if you are compelled by the material."
