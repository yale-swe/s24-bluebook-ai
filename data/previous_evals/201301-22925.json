    "I had no photography background before taking it. It was my first Art class and it is the best class I have taken until now (and it'll stay like this for a while). Pretty time consuming, the dark room action is tedious, but if you're into it you will definitely enjoy the spent time. And also make some good friends :)",
    "Definitely take it if you can. Lots of work (if you want it to be) but totally worth it.",
    "This class is awesome if you're willing to spend the time. I tended to procrastinate with my prints, so I'd spend probably 7 hours the day before each crit printing stuff. But it was amazing. Yale has great darkroom facilities and you should take advantage of them if you're at all interested in photography.",
    "yes I would definitely recommend it, it is a lot of work but is indispensable in a liberal arts education as it develops a critical and inspired\/conscious\/subjective\/... vision.plus as most of us did, you will probably find yourself asking for more"
