   "comments": [
    "a lot of reading... I'd have preferred reading more the primary articles rather than books...",
    "Covered a lot of material over the semester- it would have been nice to have more discussion in class versus being lectured to.",
    "information was presented in a cogent way; made me think about things outside of class and public health; saw relevance to current public health policy\/political climate; not a lot of class discussion but it might have been the make-up of the class",
    "It would have been better if it had been conducted as a seminar rather than a really small lecture. More class participation would have added value.",
    "Strengths:--an average introduction to ethics.--the topics were sometimes interestingWeaknesses:--it was hard to focus for many people, many of us were often browsing the internet or doing other mindless work.--it was easy to be in class and not actually listen to anything that was said",
    "This course had very interesting class material however it was a lecture and not interactive at all",
    "Everything was great. Professor's lectures were very informative.",
    "There is a clear layout of the course material. Visual cues such as PPT are very helpful in the understanding of the material as well.",
    "Great course! It very well established a theoretical basis for public health ethics and helped us think critically about interesting questions of policy. Writing the first paper on Hard Times was a really interesting task since it required us to thing more deeply and read between the lines of the novel for the deeper message that the author was trying to carry across.I wish that fir both papers there was a bit more of an instruction regarding what the professor was really looking for. Soon enough though I understood that the professor wanted to give as the liberty to reflect on the material in the way that seemed most appropriate to u."

    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0Knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0He wanted us to be more discussion based but rarely stopped talking in order to let students get involved.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0very kind, open to many viewpoints, engaging",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0He cares deeply about the subject matter.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0Open to having discussions about the most interesting questions during class-time, very helpful and responsive outside of class. Clearly very knowledgeable and well-read in the field, very good at outlining political philosophy and basic ethics concepts in a clear and straightforward way.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0He is nice and he really cares for the material. He did the best he could in teaching ethics, but many of us just had no interest.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0The instructor is very knowledgable but often students would have to raise their hand for several minutes to be acknowledged or called on",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0Great professor, really knows how to explain ethics without being overwhelming.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0Professor Jennings is an approachable instructor and is easily accessible. He provided a lot of guidance throughout the semester.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0Amazing professor! Instigated discussion in the class. Helped us understand deeply the basic concepts. Very encouraging and knowledgeable!"

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in the framework of ethics, this is recommended.",
    "Covers a broad spectrum of ethical issues in public health ethics. Recommended only if you are interested in policy related ethics.",
    "It is an excellent overview course and the books are great, but there is not a lot of opportunity for participation in discussions.",
    "The material was really interesting and Prof. Jennings was great at facilitating discussion - unfortunately there wasn't always a lot of discussion because many people didn't speak up very often. There are two paper assignments - one is 10 pages and the other is about 13 - and not a lot of direction for these two assignments, but Prof. Jennings is very helpful outside of class if you want to meet with him to discuss your papers.",
    "Maybe because I don't like ethics, but the class is very boring. The teacher is nice and really goes out of his way to explain ethics. I found the class to be average at best.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone.",
    "Focused the ethical issues in public health and used online discussion forums to reinforce ideas as well as exploring other related topics.",
    "Take this course especially if you have already taken a course in bioethics and want to challenge what seems as an established and shared ethical foundation. Public health ethics will instigate troubling questions that have no obvious answers and this is very intriguing."
