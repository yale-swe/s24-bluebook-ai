    "I would offer two suggestions for improvement:1. First, the feedback I received on my poster presentation was unacceptably weak. I really received nothing out of the evaluation process, particularly since one of the three evaluations was very negative in some areas. With negative scores, I would have expected at least some critical feedback.2. Second, the fact that there were not enough oral presentation sessions to go around was not really fair. Some of the oral presenters clearly hadn't done much analysis at all on their research, and I felt slighted that I had been relegated to the poster session.",
    "Not all responsibilities were shared by all participating students. Only the students who showed up to the initial meeting were put on a committee. Thus only 25% of students were on a committee and did the work for it. And out of the 25% of students on committees, only 1% did a majority of the work, so overall, only a few students organized the whole thing. This is unbalanced and unfair and those who did not help in organizing should not get credit for it.",
