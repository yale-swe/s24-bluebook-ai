    "The course structure. I thought Brad, Mark, and Caitlin did a great job in conceptualizing how the course would progress and build upon itself.",

    "Interdisciplinary work. Working on a timely, relevant question. Great field trip.",
    "Meeting and learning for all of the industry experts in MA, CT, NY and WA was the most valuable part of the course.",
    "The professors did just enough teaching and allowed\/facilitated discussions very effectively. The field trip to Seattle was excellent, very well organized and designed, and added alot to the class. The panel discussions with experts in the field were great.",
    "Great question was asked, and we spent the entire class pursuing it - definitely a worthwhile endeavor."

   "comments": [
    "The course will be different every year as the topic will change, but overall, this semester the topic just seemed to be a bit too far out into the future. The more we explored the ways that water utilities are trying to quantify the benefits of source water protection programs, the more we realized that no one has really tried it. This made it difficult for us to come up with good recommendations as to how to do it. A topic that is a bit more well developed might make for a better course next time.",
    "None.",
    "More deadlines and initial feedback for big paper (e.g. lit cited, outline)",
    "The schedule for the spring break trip needs to be less structured.",
    "Not much. Good class.",
    "Perhaps a bit more background reading, and the very outset, would have been useful. Our question was open-ended, but I felt like some papers and others materials had addressed it before, or at least aspects of it. It might have been useful if we had all discussed a few ideas, right or wrong, before diving into our own research. Although maybe the profs wanted to keep things very open-ended in order to keep us from putting any constraints on our own research\/conclusions, which is also valid."

By bringing people with different expertise together and give us space to communicate, the class expose us to a situation we all need to deal with once graduated: try to communicate and work with people with different background and interests. I learnt a lot from just working in my group about communication and how to align different people's interests.",
    "What is there to say? Like any group work, some people make it a priority and some people push it to a back-burner. It's something we will all have to get used to in the real world.",

    "Learned from colleagues. Difficult to schedule.",

This is what the professional world is like - tough\/challenging problems with no clear answer that requires lots of teamwork, abstract thinking, and synthesis of disparate subjects, ideas, concepts, and innovative thinking."
