    "Cool language, amazing professor, small classes - you learn a lot without being overwhelmed with busywork like other language classes.",
    "Absolutely recommend this course.Learn a new language and have fun.",
    "If you want to learn a new language, but you don't want the intense and stressful environment of French and Chinese, Polish is a great language. The class is very relaxed but you learn so much every day. Although it is a difficult language, it's worth it.",
    "This course greatly improved my Polish reading, writing, and speaking abilities. I would recommend it to anyone with Polish heritage, or who is otherwise interested in the language."
