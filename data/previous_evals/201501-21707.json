   "comments": [
    "One of the better labs; take it if you need to; won't kill you",
    "Yes, take it. Not too bad--much better than Gen Chem Lab. Labs take two hoursish, and are straightforward and somewhat interesting.",
    "Interesting and well-taught lab course, highly recommended (of course, also required for a lot of majors)",
    "This is a fairly straightforward lab course. You never have to write a full lab report, which is nice in terms of workload. The course packet explains very clearly everything that needs to be done in the lab, and for anyone with experience in a chem lab, it's very easy to do. The exit exam wasn't difficult either. People who took CHEM 220 before taking the lab seemed to have an advantage when it came to understanding concepts, but it's nothing that you can't overcome taking it concurrently.",
    "Take it if you take organic chem lecture.",
    "Not a particularly fun class to take, but if it's required, it's relatively painless. The workload is far less demanding than it is in GenChem and the class is organized much better.",
    "Much better than gen chem lab. This is still a lab course though, so I would not take it unless it is a requirement for your major.",
    "Chem 222L was a solid lab course that, in my opinion, successfully introduces students to important lab techniques used in organic chemistry. The experiments conducted in lab generally line up pretty well with the material being covered in class, Chem 220, and therefore these two classes complement each other well. A nice thing about this lab course is that you are not specifically graded on the success of your experiments, but more upon your ability to explain why or why not the experiment was successful . I would recommend only taking this class if it is required for your major, but know that it is not too bad if you do have to take it.",
    "Standard lab if you're taking organic chemistry. Not that hard or that much work. In lab it's pretty relaxed and there's time to get everything done each session. Take it if you're doing orgo.",
    "Simple and fun!",
    "The lab for organic chemistry is a significant amount of work but I enjoyed it much more than general chemistry lab.",
    "Would recommend to students taking organic chemistry I. It's a great lab experience for anyone who is interested in taking a lab class, but most people take it to satisfy requirements.",
    "I'd recommend the class if you need the credit.",
    "CHEM 222L is a solid lab course. It teaches you important techniques for chemistry laboratory and also does a lot of organic synthesis. The labs are also easy to do and end fairly quickly, so you don't often take up the whole lab period. Overall, CHEM 222L is pretty good.",
    "Chem 222L was a good course as far as labs go. The work was not too demanding but you leave feeling as though you actually understand the purpose behind each of the labs.",
    "A lot of work for a half-credit course, but also fun. It's basic stuff that we need to master, and it is well taught. Again, it's full-credit worth of work though.",
    "Orgo I lab is a fun, moderately chill and interesting lab-as someone who's a non-STEM premed (and took this class as the first lab class in her entire life), I can say that I definitely enjoyed it.",
    "Yes it is a great lab to take.",
    "An organic chemistry lab that teaches the basic organic chemistry techniques. I would recommend this class if you plan to go into the major or pre-med.",
    "Necessary and not so bad for a lab class. When I was successful in the longer synthesis labs, it was actually quite satisfying.",
    "I highly recommend CHEM 222L. Labs are well-paced (not rushed), and the workload is manageable. The material corresponds well with CHEM 220. Students become comfortable with common organic chemistry lab procedure.",
    "This course is nicely-paced, connects well with Orgo I, and is challenging but not overwhelming.",
    "Having a lab that is this cool, minimally stresful, and actually fomenting learning is always nice when Orgo class is completely the opposite. The labs usually don't take that long and compared to Gen Chem labs, you will find that you will learn just as much but in much more relaxing environment.",
    "A pretty great lab, much better than gen chem because there are no weekly quizzes. Take the reports seriously...there are only 3-4. Ask questions!! Thats the only way you can get correct answers and clarify tricky details.",
    "I enjoyed this lab much more than I did the labs for General Chemistry. I thought the atmosphere relaxed and manageable, and the course packet was easy to understand; all materials were very accessible.",
    "It's a fun lab! The content is great and you enjoy at least 1\/2 of the experiments. It is also a very good balance between intense experiments (~3.5 hours) and very chill days (~1 hour). You learn a very wide range of techniques and are never really challenged too much. And I say that in a good way - expectations tend to be reasonable. The final and post-lab assignments are poorly planned and are the main components of your grade. But if you do them collaboratively with other students and do them early and read Mohrig, you should be fine. Even though I didn't get one (probably), the class is an easy A. There is also one week at the end kept for bad weather so no lab that day! You use that to prepare for the lab exam the next week.",
    "Not bad",
    "I'd take it again. It was a really good course.",
    "It is a lab that you have to take for either premed or major requirements. You can get through it.",
    "I enjoyed the lab. It was long some days, but that is to be expected in an orgo lab. Everything was organized, and there were never any surprises. Directions were clear cut.",
    "This lab is definitely an improvement from 117. The lab equipment is so much more beautiful and the techniques are so much more interesting. The concepts you learn in organic chemistry apply to the experiments you do . Usually, the lab does not take as long as you think and yet you still get satisfaction of having learned something by the end.",
    "Only take this lab if you are interested in majoring in Chemistry or another major that requires it because the time commitment for the lab, both in the lab room itself and in the assignments that had to be completed. Overall, the class is tough, but I thought that it was reasonably fair, although I only had finished the first semester of organic chemistry when I took the lab and there were sections that I felt that I didn't understand the concepts because the class hadn't covered it yet. Some students were in the second semester of organic chemistry or higher, and seemed to be much more comfortable in the lab. It was a good challenge for my experience, and I do believe that it is doable if you put in the effort, but it demands time and studying to ensure a good grade in the class."
