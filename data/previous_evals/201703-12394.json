    "The class exposes you to a lot of Hollywood movies and texts you may not otherwise watch or read. However, it is not always easy to engage with these works to the extent needed for an in depth discussion if you do not have an understanding of Hollywoods key participants throughout the twentieth century. It would be helpful to establish specific themes or narratives for students to pay attention to starting in the very first class, because the movies and texts can sometimes seem surface level if you do not enter the class without background knowledge."

   "comments": [
    "If the student is interested particularly in the development of the narrative of Hollywood - not just Hollywood movies but actually the way Hollywood represents itself. The beginning of the course is heavy on silent films, and the syllabus does not include some of the expected classics. The discussions can wander a bit and do not always feel targeted. Students should go to class with certain discussion ideas."
