   "comments": [
    "This class was a lot of fun. Astronomy is such a fascinating subject, and you learn a lot. I highly recommend this class.",
    "The course title is a bit misleading; don't expect to be discussing the intricacies of Star Wars, the appearance of little green men, or the latest ideas for interstellar travel. That said, I really enjoyed the class. It's mostly about habitability, with some more specific discussion (Mars, Europa, SETI, etc.) towards the end. If you're interested in the subject, definitely take it.",
    "Take it only if you're interested in the material at first glance. The course is exactly what the syllabus promises: the series of events (coincidences or not? you will have to decide by the end) that led to Earth as we know it and intelligent life. This is NOT about UFO's and \"little green men\". The course is interesting throughout since you get a non-scientific exploration of cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, biology and a bit of sociology all at the same time. But the last part about SETI is definitely the most interesting.",
    "An effective introduction to astronomy, including star and planet formation, how life began, are planets hospitable, etc. It is not just talking about aliens, but there is a theme of searching for extra-terrestrial life. The workload consists of a solid amount of reading, reading posts for each class, and a problem set a week. The problem sets can get tedious and some are pretty difficult, but the workload is manageable. One midterm and a final paper. Class on the first day had twenty-five people and we ended up with ten, maybe because they were expecting a gut, which the class is not.",
    "This is not a class I would recommend. It's not too difficult, but it's probably not worth your time to take - and not worth the frustration of the erratic grading. The material can be interesting, yeah, but go ahead and subscribe to Scientific American on your own time and take something else.",
    "While this class is perfect for someone pursing a non-science major, one should be wary of the course's professor and tedious assignments."
