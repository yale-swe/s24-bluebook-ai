    "The. course is insanely fast paced and there's a lot of work. If you're willing to put in the work, you will get a lot out of the course and be miles ahead of other students learning different foreign languages because the Japanese instructors cover a lot of material in one year. The professors are great people and they're willing to help out after class. I would definitely recommend Japanese.",
    "I loved this class! Japanese has been my favorite class all year. Strengths include the format of the class: super small, super engaging, and all of our activities with speaking the whole class time helped solidify grammar structures and made me feel much more comfortable using the language and trying things out. Weaknesses: it's definitely an intense class and an intense workload. A couple of times I started feeling really burnt out from doing homework every night and trying to remember so much vocabulary and grammar, but it was definitely worth it. Highly recommend trying this class if you have any interest at all in Japanese language.",
    "If you \/want\/ to learn Japanese, take this program through L5 and you will learn Japanese. If you want to fulfill your language requirement but have no fascination with Japanese, and would rather spend your time growing in other spheres of Yale, do not take this class. If you are a literate reader in Chinese, you will understand most if not all of the kanji, and will only have to learn new ways of reading the characters themselves. If you are not a literate reader of Chinese, be prepared to literally learn a new way of conceptualizing symbols and writing; kanji is deceptively simple.",
    "If you are even just remotely considering taking Japanese, absolutely do it at Yale. It has been the best choice I have made all year. The senseis are the most dedicated and inspiring teachers I have ever met. They dedicate so many hours beyond class time to your success and are always available for help, which really paid off considering how much Japanese we learnt in just a year. The grammar structures we were studying in L2 are much more advanced than what most languages at Yale get to in a year. The course is so well planned out, engaging and the end result is so rewarding. Absolutely take this class!",
    "Hard--but fun. You know what you're getting yourself into. Lots of grammar, vocab, and memorization.",
    "It is very intense but I have learned a lot"
