    "CPLT 536 is a graduate-level, comparative literature course that uses Franz Kafka\u0092s oeuvre as a starting point to understanding both his work and similar authors. The most important question of the course was, \u0093What makes Kafka\u0092s imaginary so powerful that so many other authors have been inspired by him?\u0094I would recommend the course, because I learned whatI wanted to learn: about Kafka and surrounding others, and because I learned things I didn\u0092t expect.",
    "I would recommend the course to any student interested in 20th century culture. It is much more than literature.",
    "A unconventional approach to teaching Kafka and his influence on other writers and artists - I would highly recommend it as I never learned more about Kafka in any other course about him.",
    "I would recommend the course. Please see my answer above."

   "comments": [
    "I didn\u0092t know much about Comparative Literature and am not a graduate student in literature or the arts\u0085 it helped me understand the field better. I was very uncomfortable in the course for much of the time, because I didn\u0092t know nearly as much as the other students, but I believe I learned as much as anyone else, but my starting point was a bit further back.",
    "Thanks to this course I became acquaitned with many new literary and theoretical writers and improved my skills in linking different texts and traditions. Also, I found the discussions in class very inspiring and I feel now more encouraged to take part in them in the future."
