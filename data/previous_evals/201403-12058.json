   "comments": [
    "I really liked BENG 480. The lectures were really good, in my opinion, but they were heavily weighted towards imaging (which I like, but may not be up everyones alley). There are four papers and two presentations, so you learn a lot by doing your own research too, even though the work may seem tedious at times. You learn how to write a good research paper and how to write a grant proposal, if you havent already learned. If youre looking at this class, you probably have to take it, but you shouldnt feel bad about doing so.",
    "If you're a BME senior you have to take this class, so I'm sorry. Once upon a time the course may have been good (when class sizes were a lot smaller) but now its a random collection of unrelated assignments and group projects, none of which the students really engaged with. It felt like a lot of busywork, with little to no actual learning.",
    "If you're reading this, you have to take the class. It's not a very fun or interesting class. It is not particularly hard, but there is a lot of work. 3 presentation, 3 short papers (6-7 pages) and one long grant proposal (15 pages or so). Keep on top of the short papers, and try to get them done sooner rather than later since there a number of presentations and a pretty extensive final report you have to write. Focus all of your energy on the papers as they are your grade. Everything else is \"negative credit\", meaning you lose points for not doing it but this has not happened to anyone for like 8 years.",
    "This class is a lot more work than I initially expected at the beginning of the term. If you're taking it, your a BME major, so you don't really have a choice. But just know that even though this course meets once a week, you will be doing a lot of work outside of class.",
    "This class is a ton of busy work, and work outside of class too. And a lot of the time the speaker wasn't really talking about something you were interested in. Still it did make me much faster at writing papers. Besides it's required for the BME major.",
    "You have to take it. Hopefully they restructure the class in the next year, because the organization just doesn't make sense for a 40+ person BME class (it makes sense for a 15 person class, which is what the BME class size used to be.)",
    "You will take this class because you are a senior in BME. Try to clarify things as much as possible with the instructors right away. It is not supposed to be a hard class but some crucial unclear points can give you a lot of headache!",
    "If you're reading this, you probably have to take this course as a BME senior, so I'll take this time to give you an idea of what you'll be in for. Every week will have two professors talk about their research for an hour each. Aside from a few exceptions, these can get monumentally dull. If you happen to be one of the BME seniors who has no idea what to do for your senior project (nothing wrong with that), one of these might be helpful. Otherwise, look forward to spending your Tuesday afternoons sitting in a dark room being talked at by professors. Be prepared for a lot of busy work (two hour-long group presentations, three short papers (~2 pages single spaced), and a final 5 page paper as an extension of one of the short papers). All of these will require mandatory time scheduled outside of class for peer reviews, group work, presenting and watching other people's presentations. Grading will be based almost entirely on these papers, save for any especial deductions based on poor attendance, etc. On the positive, you will get feedback and guides on how to present clearly and write clearly, but this will pale in comparison to the sheer amount of time spent on busywork. Overall, the workload isn't bad, you just might find yourself questioning the point of all the work. But once you're done, congratulations! You are (probably) done with all the mandatory courses for the major. Celebrate!",
    "You have to take it as a BME student. You'll put in a LOT of extra time... some of it was worth it. For example, the peer reviews was actually pretty helpful, but the PowerPoint presentations, not as much. The guest lectures were pretty cool.",
    "This is a solid class, and if you're taking it you're definitely a BME first semester senior, so you should make the best of the opportunity to participate in this seminar. The lectures are really interesting and you should stop yourself from bringing your laptop and doing other work-- just take a few notes in your notebook. Notes aren't necessary either way because you aren't directly tested on lecture material, but you do need to write two papers based on the lecture material, still, just don't bring a laptop. Papers were graded fairly and really helped me develop my scientific writing skills, especially with respect to literature searches and organizing a solid background\/introduction section. Peer review sections were actually pretty enjoyable and a nice view into the process of submitting papers to real scientific journals, which many of us will be doing in the coming years as we graduate. Just put your best foot forward and you'll get a lot out of this class.",
    "This class is an absurd amount of work and honestly not very useful to the major (although lectures are very interesting). There are three 2-page papers, two presentations (though you give the first presentation twice), and a final 5.5 page paper, and also readings + questions you prepare on those readings. It doesn't seem too bad until you realize that the papers are single-space with HALF INCH margins, so in reality they're a LOT longer. Overall the lectures were extremely interesting, and I felt I learned a lot from those.",
    "BENG 480 is a required course for the BME major. However, it isn't too much of a pain. Be advised that it does meet outside of the scheduled 1 time per week usually for presentations or peer review, so be flexible. Professor XP and Nina are both great and help a lot through out the semester.",
    "For a required class in the BME major, it's pretty chill and straightforward. The multiple papers might be a nuisance, but the grading is fair and you'll be thanking the professor come finals period because you'll already have the final paper draft finished. My advice: pay attention to lectures if you're interested in the material, and choose topics you'd like to learn more about when deciding on what to write.",
    "If you're taking this class, you probably have to. It's honestly not bad at all and pretty interesting -- for two hours a week, you listen to two professors talk about their research. There are three short papers (~5 pages double spaced), two presentations, and one final paper (~10 pages double spaced, but the work is spread out over a few assignments); a lot of the assignments are \"negative credit,\" i.e. as long as you put in the effort you'll get an A for them. Overall, a pretty relaxing and interesting class.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to (which you will if you are a Biomedical Engineering major). Lots of hand holding by the instructors with presentations and short papers. Lots of time waste preparing for and sitting through presentations for \"negative credit.\"",
    "The class requires scheduling sessions outside of class time, which is frustrating if you don't have a very flexible schedule. Overall, it's very time consuming but does help you improve your writing. Make sure you clearly understand the expectations for the assignments."
