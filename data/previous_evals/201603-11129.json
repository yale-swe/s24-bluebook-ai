   "comments": [
    "It is a survey course over different intellectual circles in history, from Founding Brothers to Georgetown Set, Supreme Court and the circle around Socrates and Plato. We understand the basic philosophies of those thinkers and the dynamics in their circles.",
    "I gained a more complete understanding of history, both in depth and breadth, in this course; the exact kind of historical understanding that one imagines learning at Yale. The reading might be rigorous at times, but that helped me to develop an understanding of what is expected at the college level and in a seminar it also developed my ability to critically engage with a text. The interpersonal nature of the course is central to its success had it not been for the motivation and intellectual curiosity of my fellow classmates, the class would not have been what it was. In that respect, I gained an appreciation of the cooperative nature of the seminar format.",
    "Immense amount of knowledge about the world.",
    "This course pushed me to learn how to manage long readings. Because we were often asked to read entire novels within a week, I had to devise a weekly reading schedule and learn how to extract important concepts from a large work.",
    "How to think more deeply about the intricate connections between different events and ideas in the world, as well as an excellent foray into the dynamics of revolutionary moments.",
    "I got an absolutely wonderful introduction to the importance of the humanities in a modern education, regardless of what I am majoring in. I also got a great introduction to college-level seminar discussion.",
    "The course offered a really expansive history of various times and ideas. I feel a lot more confident speaking on and understanding discussion on a very wide range of topics, from Freud to Stalin to the Beat Generation. I also improved my discussion and group analysis skills.",
    "This course helped me learn how to keep up with the pace of reading for a college seminar and made me more comfortable debating with my classmates in an academic setting.",
    "I learned to think critically about the readings and about what my classmates were saying. I learned how to pick out main ideas in a single work and connect them to larger themes across many works. I learned how to ask questions and worked on honing my discussion skills. I picked up so many ideas, had new insights, and expanded my knowledge I don't know where I'd begin describing them. But in general I learned that it is the intellectual group that drives the world not the individual. The success of an intellectual group leads to the success of their ideas. I also learned the importance of the humanities and why we should continue to study and acquaint ourselves with theology, history, and religion, even in this growing secular and scientific age.",
    "Rather than any single theory or idea, this course filled in many different important plot points in intellectual history.",
    "Throughout this course, we engaged in interesting readings and discussions across multiple fields of study, where I believe I developed greater analytical skills as well as different approaches to viewing things."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This is a superb course with intense discussion!",
    "As stated above, the reading is at times rigorous, but that is far from a criticism had it not been for the varied texts that were sometimes a bit hard to push through, I would not have left the course feeling that I had truly been through a transformative process which I do feel now. The pace of the course is neither too fast nor slow, with a book week being a fine expectation of students in a text-based seminar. Discussion being central to the course's success, even the most timid of students will find that by the end of the course they are eagerly waiting to throw in their interpretation to the conversation and engage with their classmates.",
    "One of the strengths of this class was that it really allowed student voices and opinions to shine through. While Professor Hill occasionally lectured the entire class, many times he lectured for a part of the class and then opened up the remainder of the time for student discussion. Many times the discussions led to new insights and passionate debates. Also, the class covered a very wide range of topics, so each participating members gained more awareness of different intellectual circles throughout the span of history. One weakness was that the grading of the class was ambiguous, and there was no communication through Canvas or Classes V2 at all. We really only received one graded assignment before the final paper, which was a short midterm paper given to us two days before its due date, again with an ambiguous task.",
    "Strengths: Assigned material, level of discussion, background knowledge provided by the professor, level of analysis Weaknesses: lack of name-introductions\/bonding for the group; there was an expectation set that the small class would become its own intellectual circle, and that potential was not fully tapped; also, the focus was almost entirely on America, Europe and Russia, which while important for American civilization, left other possible areas of intellectual exploration untouched",
    "The strengths of the course are that it is very discussion oriented and with that very engaging, and that the course manages to cover to much ground in one semester. The course could be improved with more manageable readings so that students even when slammed can stay involved in discussion.",
    "The course was an exciting survey of western history covering a great many topics and people, so it is a wonderful means of becoming conversational at a basic level on a wide range of subjects, as well as the trends among them. The course is based around reading selections for each week and classroom discussions or lectures. It is a good course for developing those skills, but there is hardly any assessment in the course, so it does not teach writing.",
    "I think the organization of the course was strong. I liked the format of reading about a different circle each week and having one student lead each discussion. The teaching was also strong. The only weakness in my mind is that sometimes there was too much reading to finish in time. There were some books that I found really interesting, like the Georgetown Set, but that were too long to finish. There were also certain specific books, like the ones about Freud's and Stalin's circle, that simply didn't interest me much.",
    "One of the strengths is that it offers such a multitude of different topics and that much of what we learn is from each other through discussions. A weakness may be that there is a little too much reading and some topics deserve a little more focus."

   "comments": [
    "You should take this course! It is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. It is so stimulating and inspiring!",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this course to any student even mildly interested in humanities I'd go so far as to say even the student with no interest in humanities has much to gain from this course. Professor Hill has a wealth of knowledge and his insights are enough to warrant a student's attention to the course, but beyond that the level of understanding one gains of history, the shape that begins to form in one's mind with each successive text, is an amazing experience to have. I assert that this course imparts exactly the kind of education one expects to gain from attending Yale. Fascinating subject, huge range of texts, stimulating discussion, fantastic professor definitely a superb course.",
    "Yes!",
    "This course is the highlight of my freshman year and I would whole-heartedly recommend it to any other student who seeks intellectual challenge, multi-disciplinary thinking and want to have a wonderful book list by the end of freshman fall!",
    "I would recommend taking this class to any student that likes to read and critically analyze historical figures. The class is about a book in less than a week each week, so it is not for the faint of heart. Also students should expect to be on top of their game, as the almost debate-like seminar style can be intimidating and is not very lighthearted but rather very academic and prepared.",
    "Absolutely. Intellectual circles are an under-explored part of history, society and humanity in general. The wide variety of circles explored and the intensity as well as diversity of what is explored is very exciting.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student that has an interest in study for study's sake.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. I think Professor Hill's insights on the humanities and their place at Yale are relevant to every member of the community, and the historical content of the class is compelling and diverse.",
    "I loved this course and would recommend it to every incoming freshman. As a new college student, stepping onto campus can be overwhelming. Going from small classes to large lecture halls tends to alienate freshman from their professors and engaging in class, whether it be by asking questions or attending office hours. The freshman seminar system as a whole allows new students the opportunity to experience and learn in a more intimate less daunting atmosphere. I always felt encouraged to speak and discuss around Prof. Hill's table and enjoyed connecting with other enthusiastic freshman. This class in particular is wonderful because it introduces students to a wide array of philosophers, historians, scientists, writers, and politicians. The scope of the course is wide, going from Plato to the Supreme Court, yet it never sacrifices depth. Each subject is thoroughly dissected in a student-lead discussion with Prof. Hill pulling together thoughts and giving insightful and wise comments. In my opinion, the readings were fascinating and the discussion enlightening. But what I found most surprising and most interesting about this course, it that it brought up many important ideas and raised questions that I think every college student should spend time thinking about. What is the importance of humanities? The limits of science? The original purpose of theology? What shapes a college curriculum? How has the way we think change? What do we want to do in life? This class and Prof. Hill has made me seriously consider a major in intellectual history or the humanities. He taught me that history and the humanities is anything but outdated and trivial in a world that is increasingly leaning on science.",
    "Yes, I think this is a perfect course for Freshman fall.",
    "Absolutely, there is probably no other course like it where you feel so enlightened after every discussion."
