    "I think in general the opportunity to learn English from native speakers is great, because we are Ph.D. students and so our friends are busy to teach us the pronunciation and vocabulary. Also, they would think language is of second order importance compared to the research. But indeed this is of first order importance for us. So this class offered a great opportunity, and this is the strength. The weakness is that this class does not offer the credit. This might have reduced students' engagement."

    "This depends on what workload you have in the semester. This class definitely offers you important insights about English communication, but this also takes time and potentially makes you stressed. Also, this is not a required course, so if you do not commit to engage, you will end up losing your precious time without learning a lot."
