   "comments": [
    "I learned plenty of financial concepts and how to do a large amount of financial calculations.",
    "I feel like I understand theories behind finance when before I didn't even really know there were theories behind finance.",
    "We learned about several different financial models: financial equilibrium & associated competitive equilibrium, hedging, Sharpe ratios, CAPM, etc.",
    "Learned how to think using models even if those models are not done by hand anymore",
    "present value!",
    "I learned how to model general equilibrium and financial equilibrium in the market, with different scenarios like social security, patience, and different financial assets. I learned about the benefits and costs of social security in each generation. We also learned about bond pricing, black Scholes, and game theory.",
    "I learned a little about financial theory I guess",
    "I learned about a lot of concepts in financial economics",
    "Basic accounting, financial equilibrium, simplified option pricing stuff etc.",
    "Introduction to finance (learn about discounting\/time value of money, bonds, options pricing, mortgages, hedging\/arbitrage)",
    "Learn about stock and bond pricing, uncertainty in economies, mortgages, and financial pricing",
    "I learned how the financial economy works. There are a limited number of resources and people consume based on their endowments to maximize agents' utility functions. Also, the concept of arrow securities and how you can purchase a commodity independent of possible states of the world. When added together it just equals the market value of the whole commodity. Not to forget, present value\/discounting.",
    "Introductory finance",
    "General equilibrium, CAPM, binomial option pricing, time value of money. Basic stuff you would expect to see in an intro finance course",
    "I learned about the basics and fundamentals of the theory of modern finance, as expected for this class. I also gained experience in solving concrete numerical problems regarding the subject.",
    "I learned a lot about mathematical finance.",
    "The course covers the topics necessary to understand ideal asset pricing both with and without risk, and shows how much of the behavior of financial markets can be understood from this base. The quantitative approach provides practice translating real-world scenarios into solvable mathematical models."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Improve all of the lecture notes, or start using a textbook. The course is horrendous in its present form.",
    "The class was well organized and they give you all the opportunities to succeed, however lectures are somewhat confusing.",
    "Strengths of the course are that John is a great teacher who cares about his kids. He's a polarizing guy tbh but he's pretty funny. Could be improved by not being at 9am.",
    "Strengths: really interesting material and the connection between them is pretty cool, good lecture notes, midterms are straightforward Weaknesses: slightly disorganized, not much feedback on problem sets",
    "Lectures very engaging and funny, notes are good, practice material good",
    "The course did a good job at emphasizing certain important themes in the course, namely competitive equilibrium. The notes were comprehensive guide to the material covered in lecture and the sets. The weakness is pace of the course. If notes were not read beforehand, everything else was confusing for me. It can be improved by focusing less on particular material in the notes.",
    "A much better organization of the material is necessary to facilitate student learning. The incongruences between the notes and the problem sets made it challenging to gauge what to focus on for exams.",
    "Strengths: The material can be interesting, but it is hard stuff that need to be explained properly",
    "The weakness of the course is that the material is all created by the professor and its hard to get outside resources to clarify some of the topics.",
    "John made a lot of effort simplifying the math and making the class accessible to people without much formal training in mathematics. However this has at times obscured the idea behind a lot of things we were doing (eg replicating portfolio). He had, however, written super detailed notes which you can read to complement the lack of mathematical insight in lectures. Also for people who had zero background in econ\/finance, his lectures could be difficult to follow since key jargons were not properly defined but assumed in most lectures.",
    "Strengths were Geanakoplos is a legend and big hitter in the hedge fund world and in economics. He engineered a lot of the techniques and findings that we literally learn about in the class (i.e. Yale endowment spending, social security, etc.). Ahyan is a fantastic TA and going to section is both fun and really informative. I just wish we had covered default as I find that kind of stuff super interesting, and it's a huge real factor to incorporate in these theoretical models.",
    "The lectures are not posted online. Only course notes are. The course notes are incredibly informative, but having the notes from class would be helpful for review, though the notes do a good job of it. However they contain more superfluous information. The TAs were incredible and it isn't too hard to understand the material",
    "The course lectures are very difficult to follow and sometimes have little to do with the problem types on the problem sets and exams. It could be improved if it were more focused. Either explain financial theory in more general terms without the math, or teach how exactly to do the math. Lecture felt like a mix of both that ended up just confusing both sides.",
    "The strengths of this class are the overall concepts that help understand how investment decisions are made. The weakness was that it was at 9 am and the complex application. Also, there wasn't a textbook so I felt like he was talking off the top of his head sometimes.",
    "The class is interesting and feels applicable to the real world. Heavy on math which can be good or bad depending in the interests of the student",
    "The lectures and notes were a bit confusing and overcomplicated simple concepts. I think part of the problem was that there was so much notation that didn't reall",
    "The course was overall very effective. The course expectations were clear and the problem sets were useful. The practice problems were very similar to the exams, as one would hope. I would only improve the organization and conciseness of the lectures and lecture notes, which often rambled on but could have been condensed to the important information.",
    "The class is too focused on solving very specific problems instead of learning more theory. The homework was usually pretty tedious. I think the class would be much more interesting if there was more math and was possibly proof-based. Also, I think that the slides used in the first half of the course was good, but John G went too quickly through them. In the second half, when he wrote on the board, it was difficult to read his handwriting. I also think some of the grading on the tests was unfair, which resulted because some questions were somewhat ambiguous, and John G only clarified in the middle of the test if you were listening. I do think the concepts I learned in the course were very interesting, and my favorite part of the course was John G's stories. I also liked that he uploaded very detailed notes on Canvas.",
    "The connections between topics in this course and between the theoretical content and the real-world examples are particularly strong. Lectures are engaging, thanks largely to Prof. Geanakoplos' interactive style. Problem sets are well designed to show how the lecture content translates into applications. Sections often felt redundant with the combination of lectures and problem sets -- in their current format, sections were more like study halls providing additional help with problem-solving."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "No. Not with Prof. Geanakoplos at least.",
    "Yes, out of the two lower level finance classes at Yale, this is certainly the one to take. The lectures are sometimes confusing, but they prepare you to succeed in the class which encourages further learning.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. If you are expecting to take this course and have it directly help you with finance jobs or in interviews, it's not going to do that. I do think, though, that understanding theories in finance are important to grasping the bigger picture of the industry, which will pay dividends down the line.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, but do not expect to come out ready to work in finance",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is genuinely interested in a theoretical understanding of finance with mathematical models. Else, no.",
    "No- John G was one of the worst professors I have ever had at Yale. So many people didn't go to lecture because you would legitimately leave having learned nothing. He overcomplicates simple topics and goes on tangents constantly. The only place you learn is in your section.",
    "I would only recommend this class to individuals who are REALLY interested in the theory behind finance concepts. If only moderately interested, I would recommend you credit d this class. The material is interesting, but extremely difficult and confusing to grasp without at least a little background knowledge of finance",
    "Yes if you are at all interested in finance or understanding how financial instruments work (which will be a part of your life no matter what)!",
    "Even to non-econ majors, this course is fantastic. This course was really interesting, John G is super cool, and it isn't hard to grasp the material and succeed. Take the class and read the lecture notes and you'll learn an amazing amount of information not taught in any other class",
    "I would not recommend this course.",
    "Yes, if they want to put in the work and learn why financial decisions are made.",
    "Only take this if you haven't taken a finance class before. It repeats a lot of the same stuff from intro to corporate finance, and at times the teaching made things seem unnecessarily complicated. If Ahyan is still a TA, the class might be worth taking because he's pretty great and explains things well.",
    "Yes, the course is interesting and decent overall. Professor Geanakoplos is great and has his own brand of humor and some very interesting stories. I'm not sure if he will teach this class again, but it's worth taking one of his classes.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who is interested in finance, particularly the more math side and how to value things.",
    "Yes, this course is a great opportunity to learn about financial instruments and the fundamentals of investment theory without much background in economics. Lectures are interactive and engaging, often connecting to real-world examples like Yale's budget, Social Security reform, and the professor's experience in mortgage trading. The course uses a highly quantitative approach, but doesn't require any math beyond differential calculus. Problem sets show the important applications without being too long, and the exams are very closely based on the practice material."
