   "comments": [
    "A balance of just war theory and its ethics, combined with case studies that supplement the first principle readings. A wonderful way to understand the ethics and theory behind war, while at the same time bolstering that understanding by looking at \"real world\" examples.",
    "I think this was a terrific course. CAPT Kemper and Professor Shapiro were a great team, and CAPT Kemper was an ebullient professor. It is designed to fulfill the NROTC requirements but is enriched by students not involved in the program!",
    "As a midshipmen, this class is the best of the naval science classes. For other Yale students, the class could be interesting. Captain Kemper won't be teaching it next year but Shapiro is an incredible professor. I would suggest shopping the class to get a feel for it - the workload is definitely not bad.",
    "I would say it's a class that teaches you about the justifications for starting war between states, the guidelines for conducting just wars, and the evolving frontier that the interstate system is entering, in terms of cyber, unlawful combatants, and other trends that illustrate a changing world."

   "comments": [
    "Undeclared major in the undergraduate college, but interested in applying to the Ethics, Politics & Economics program. Thought this course did a strong job introducing complex ethics in a graspable framework, then placing that into the particular discussion of war.",
    "The course forced me to consider ethical dilemmas important to consider, but previously unconsidered. I think it will make me a more thoughtful naval officer.",
    "I found this court to be essential for a future naval officer.",
    "The course definitely deepened my knowledge of the law, ethics and military operations. The case study format could be used more effectively, but its use put each principle of ethics in combat to the test. The modern context for many of these case studies gave me a new appreciation for precedent in the military world that I am about to enter."
