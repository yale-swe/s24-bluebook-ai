   "comments": [
    "good",
    "The was my least favorite class of the semester due to lack of intellectual stimulation, homework didn't seem to reflect what was covered in lecture, and a lack of enthusiasm from the professor.",
    "The course is useful in analyzing categorial data. However, no much assistance on the programming of SAS was introduced.",
    "Applicability of the materials is very poor. No feedback on homework assignments\/ lack of feedback look.",
    "It's a slow class, covering very basic mathematical knowledge. Problems sets are really helpful if you work really hard, but can be frustrating sometimes.",
    "I do learn a lot from this course regarding basic idea of generalized linear models and statistics.",
    "The material taught in the course is clearly very useful and important, and the professor was really excellent about being available to answer questions outside of class time, which greatly improved the learning experience. The only suggestion that I have is that there were a couple of problem sets in which the material covered in the problem set was presented in lecture after the problem set was due - ensuring that the problem sets closely follow lecture material might have been helpful.",
    "Interesting information and useful for someone with a research background\/future.",
    "It is a good course",
    "Poor teaching, did not learn a thing, self-taught myself literally everything. Not at all what I expected.",
    "Should have provide more support in coding",
    "I have learned a lot from the course.",
    "This course provides systematic knowledge about categorical data analysis, which is very useful in the epidemiological research. By taking this course, the students could obtain both theory and applied knowledge about categorical data analysis.",
    "I recommend that the lectures and lab sessions should be scheduled to be closer to each other. Lectures on Mondays and lab sessions on Fridays make it difficult to recall lecture contents in lab sessions, which causes less and less students to present in the lab sessions.",
    "Course was okay in the sense that the material was easy to understand. The homework took too much time because too many problems were given and the code was not taught adequately at the start of the semester. The course did not teach SAS to students who had not taken the pre-requesite at Yale, although the description indicated that no prior experience was needed. The final project was okay.",
    "Overall, the course was below average. Strengths: The course was strong in how it was laid out, with material building in a logically sequential manner. The professor and TAs were all approachable and helpful in one-on-one interaction. Homework assignments took a reasonable amount of time to complete. There was some effort to amend the class based on participant feedback. Weaknesses: There were unclear expectations as to the pre-requisites for students. It was not specified that prior SAS experience was required, and yet the course was structured as if all students were proficient. This should have been explicitly stated in the course description. The lectures were overly theoretical, with little application of concepts outside of the homework assignments. The lab sessions were often not useful outside of the slide deck, which contained the SAS code needed to complete homework assignments. Questions during class were not encouraged given the lack of clear responses and the tone of responses, which seemed to question why we did not know the answer already. Feedback on homework assignments were vague, often without any comments. Based on the comments above, I think the course could be improved in the following three ways: 1) Specify that prior SAS knowledge is a pre-requisite in the course description. 2) Provide more examples of application of concepts in class and in the lab sessions. 3) Provide more detailed feedback in graded homework assignments.",
    "Great course, and the knowledge is very useful for data analysis. Everything was taught systematically and clearly.",
    "TA was often not on time.",
    "The material is useful."

    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0nice professor",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Dr. Wang clearly was not interested in teaching the course, was not dynamic in lectures, did not provide relevant examples, was unresponsive to emails, and overall was not a good fit for the course material.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0She is being careful and organized.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The instructor is very responsive to emails and questions in general. Her teaching style was not easy to follow and makes things sound more complex that they are. Not enough emphasis on the actual implications of the biostatistical thinking",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0patient to take questions better if can explain things clearer in class",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Professor Wang is rigorous in academia.",

    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Dr. Wang is a really helpful and nice instructor. She always considers for the students. She is responsible and has tried her best to teach the students theory and applied knowledge about categorical data analysis.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0I did not like the instructor. She was difficult to understand and for someone not in Biostats, the concepts were not very applied to public health.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0I really appreciated Dr. Wang's attempts to alter the course based on student feedback. I also found her to be very helpful during office hours. That said, I think that her lecture style was often overly theoretical, leaving basic concepts unexplained. Additionally, there was a gap between these lectures and the practical application of the concepts we were expected to be able to do in homework assignments. I don't have nay additional feedback on how the teaching style can be improved aside from what was mentioned earlier.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Professor Wang has an insight into complex problems. She taught us not only the basic concepts, but their backgrounds too. She is good at connecting those concepts and shows important differences and similarities among them.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Great knowledge. Nice person.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The slides are well-organized and the instructor adds more detailed explanation during lecture."

This course provides systematic knowledge about categorical data analysis, which is very useful in the epidemiological research. By taking this course, the students could obtain both theory and applied knowledge about categorical data analysis.",
