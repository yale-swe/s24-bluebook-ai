    "CENG 315 is a challenging course on transport phenomena with difficult problem sets requiring a working understanding of differential equations. The textbook is borderline incomprehensible at times, so pay attention and ask questions in lecture. Though the problem sets are difficult, Prof. Loewenberg will give ample assistance if you run into trouble--the key is to start them early enough that you have time to ask questions. I would recommend it only if you're very interested in the subject or need it for your major.",
    "This was an amazing class.It exposed me to the rigor that engineering science can be. This was probably THE class that got me to stay onboard as a chemical engineering major. The problem sets were exquisite and really got us to think about the material, and working through them taught me a LOT.I've heard that this class can be taught in a variety of ways though. Professor Loewenberg teaches it very mathematically and theoretically, which was great for me but maybe not so much for others. I am very interested in how Professor Rosner teaches the class, and seeing how the material can be applied to practical problems.That said, Professor Loewenberg is great in person, but a little disorganized in class, which was frustrating at times, and my other classmates weren't very happy about it. I also would have liked to see a bit more overall course organization, and for professor Loewenberg to lay the groundwork a little better, to give the course a better overall coherence. Also, because of how theoretical the class was I don't think I developed as much physical intuition as I should have, but that's the trade off for working with things rigorously in math.Professor Loewenberg perhaps expects too much of his students, and he expects us to be smarter than we actually are. So he brushes over the groundwork and motivation a bit too fast, making it harder to appreciate all the intricacies and nuances that he tried to teach us (which is some very fun, educational stuff!). So the moral is, ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS! SPEAK UP! And you definitely get a lot more out of the class if you spend a lot of time working through the problem sets carefully.Transport is a hard class, but you can learn a lot.",
    "As taught by Dr. Loewenberg at least, this class is the most difficult in my time at Yale. The problem sets are extremely time-intensive and require group work to have a good shot at solving them. Get started early whenever possible. Lecture is often confusing, as equations are often put on the board without a great deal of explanation as to their importance or the overall direction in which a solution is proceeding. After a month or two you will get more accustomed to how the class is run and better be able to follow the lectures, which is important, for as the course goes on it corresponds less and less to anything helpful in the graduate student textbook used. The two exams were a relief in that they mirrored the problem sets closely, so they were doable to those who understood their homework.",
    "This course is difficult at first but with consistent effort doing the psets and getting help things will start to click and make sense. Professor Loewenberg is very helpful and certainly knows his stuff, don't hesistate to seek help if necessary. Overall a very good course."
