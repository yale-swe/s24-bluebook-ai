    "I recommend this class. It goes over the key philosophies of many thinkers from the Classical Arabic tradition. They discuss topics such as ethics, transcendence, and the creation of the world. Names include Farabi, Ibn Sina, and Ghazali.",
    "Classical arabic philosophy is a fascinating introduction into many of the major arabic philosophers who wrote between about the 9th to the 11th centuries. You end the class with a better understanding not only of what each individual philosopher's major ideas were, but how they all relate. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, it was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Professor is incredibly engaging and you leave the class knowing way more than you did at the beginning."
