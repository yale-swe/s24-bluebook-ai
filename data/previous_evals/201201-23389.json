    "good in theory, but execution could be better. it's basic water resources management, and not much more or less. the guest lectures were sometimes interesting, but often very dry and not that informative, and the 'discussion' seemed like a ploy to chew up class time, though occasionally it did raise some interesting questions.",
    "Having weekly quizzes made the course extremely intensive.",
    "Question 3: For the most part I felt that assignments were useful to learning, but some assignments felt like busy work. For example, response papers for speakers who presented mostly just factual information, and some parts of labs felt like busy work.Questions 4 and 6: I spent a lot of time both in this class and outside of class, the workload felt a bit heavy for a three credit class. Considering the amount of time spent in class, I think it might make sense to make this a four credit class.",

   "comments": [
    "the textbook \/ lectures - very clear and concise. you could probably understand all the lectures from reading the textbook though.",
    "The extensive amount of time Shimi put into the planning of the course to make it run smoothly. The bulleted sentences that fueled discussion, the coffee break post out-side speaker which allowed time for further questions and engagements if interested, the interesting course material taught by Shimi.",
    "You can tell that Shimi really cares about the students and expects that you submit work that is on par with your potential!",
    "It provides a good overview of the water sector with a more detailed focus for the student project. I liked the length limit for the final paper; useful for the real world.",
    "I liked that we met once a week for 4 hours. This allowed enough time to have a lecture related to our class readings, discussion, and host a guest speaker. The guest speakers covered a broad range of disciplines, and Shimi's lectures were, as usual, great.",
    "Shimi is a great instructor and always kept the class engaged despite the 4 hours.",
    "Working on the case study. It was an opportunity to dive into a topic of interest. The professor also provided very helpful feedback.",
    "Shimi did a great job making the 4-hour class go by, breaking it up into different segments. Quizzes and discussions helped maintain continuity of the course, since it only met once a week.",
    "In comparison to some other professors here, Shimi's obvious effort and preparation that went into the course made this class great. In addition, it was clear how much Shimi cared that we learned the concepts. I appreciated that Shimi took the time to explain any concepts we had questions on and helped us to understand the fundamental figures that professionals in this area are familiar with and work with on a day to day basis.",
    "A four hour class on a Wednesday afternoon seems like it would be hard to power through. The structure of the class, however, kept things interesting, engaging, and educational (of course). There was a nice balance between Shimi's lectures, guest lecturers, discussions and quizzes that helped to break up time and keep us on task.",
    "The instructor's enthusiasm and dedication to the course was the best part. The level of commentary he provided and the thought he put into developing the lectures really showed, and I felt more engaged in the class knowing that he was fully engaged. I also liked the way the class forced us to stay caught up through weekly quizzes and commentary -- another reason why I felt more engaged in this course than any of my other courses."

   "comments": [
    "fix the format. also, 4 hours is really long and unnecessary, even with a coffee break in the middle. guest lectures didn't add much and could be cut out.",
    "Too much busy work. Maybe a midterm, end of year exam would work better. While the commentaries often felt tedious, they encouraged better discussion.",
    "I think since the lecture was 4 hours, the course should be worth 4 credits.",
    "The last lecture (water-energy nexus) could use some improvement. Other than that, the course was well put together.",
    "Class discussions can be shorter.",
    "There could have been more detail. I feel like there was a lot of repeat from rivers processes and restoration and science to solutions.",
    "It would have been nice to have a field trip, since Shimi also doing so much cool field work.",
    "I often had trouble concentrating in the second half of this class. Spending four hours in any class feels quite arduous. I think this class would work better by splitting it into 2 2-hour sessions. In addition, I felt the course was a bit heavy on guest speakers. Not all speakers were of the same caliber. I would have preferred to have fewer speakers and have more time to focus on concepts covered in Shimi's lectures.Also, though I had plenty of work at the end of the semester, part of me wishes that there had been a final for this class to provide the motivation to meticulously review concepts learned and integrate them into the big picture.",
    "I would have enjoyed one or two field trips throughout the semester. Shimi did a great job of bringing practitioners to the classroom, and I think it would be valuable to organize a trip and see some of the people (and concepts) at work...If field trips are added, the course might be worthy of four credits.",
    "Time management -- it seemed a bit difficult to fit everything into one class, but all the different elements of discussion\/lecture\/quiz etc. helped break up the four hours very nicely."

    "Don't fall behind on readings!",
    "Stay on top of the readings and ask plenty of questions in class",
    "Study hard for the quizzes!",
    "My advice would be to always do the reading from Shimi's book. This will provide you with a fundamental understanding that will be elaborated on in Shimi's lectures. Also, most of the quiz material comes directly from the book. When time allows, also do as much of the extra readings as you can. Every time I sat down to do the extra reading Shimi had assigned I was pleasantly surprised by how useful these readings were. Shimi spends a lot of time crafting this class so extra readings tend to be very worthwhile.Also, for the term paper, take advantage of the fact that Shimi asks for a draft halfway through the semester. If possible, submit a complete draft at this time. If you do this, Shimi's feedback will help you to craft an excellent final product.",
