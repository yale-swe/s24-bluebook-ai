   "comments": [
    "German 150 is a class that is very dependent on whom the teacher is. A lot of it is class discussion, so your teacher really determines how that progresses. I don't think that it was grammar intensive enough, but it really is a good class to complete your education of the German language. I had Herr Patrick Wolf last semester and he was absolutely awesome. I would recommend him to any student because he really made learning german an enjoyable experience. The homework load is easily manageable and the syllabus changed this year many times to adapt to where we were as a class",
    "This is a good way to become a better speaker and writer of German. Take it if that's what you want! It's not a super hard class, but I come out feeling great about my ability to express myself in German. We also did a Skype-exchange with an English class in Germany, which was a lot of fun and a good way to get to know a German person.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're coming out of Intensive German. It's a good way to practice your conversational skills and learn about Germany without the pressure of speaking 100% correctly. (haha!)",
    "Lots of different assignments, and very end-heavy on the work - but not particularly challenging. You learn the most through the assignments, as the syllabus often insists on tasks in class that aren't particularly useful. Make sure you get a section with people who want to talk, and in which you like the instructor - I'd say definitely take it with Patrick Wolf if you can.",
    "Yes, if you want to keep your German up with not too much stress."
