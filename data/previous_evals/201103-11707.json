    "my only issue in the class was that the students were very much a bit arrogant and DS stereotypes. kapustin was amazing though.",
    "Weekly readings about all the important political questions. Philosophers who actually *did* something. Take it if you care about these things at all, the class is amazing",
    "Yes, definitely. It's not overwhelming from a work perspective but is incredibly rewarding from an intellectual one. That's rare I think. Also Prof. Kapustin is fantastic.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Great course and fulfills core requirements for EP&E.",
    "YES. This is easily one of the best and most thought-provoking courses I've taken at Yale. Prof. Kapustin has such a rare combination of brilliance and willingness to engage his students with complete sincerity. I have never seen a seminar leader command so much respect when speaking, and yet elicit so much enthusiastic participation from a group. The result was a deep, challenging, and satisfying engagement with the texts, and a strong class rapport. Absolutely take it.",
    "Highly recommended. Basically it's a discussion based analysis of the readings of people (either philosophers, political theorists or revolutionaries\/leaders themselves) who have in some way talked about the morality of certain things in politics (eg violence, when to disobey laws, etc)Because the class is so hard to get into, nearly everyone in the class has intelligent and thought provoking things to say, and the professor is INCREDIBLE at drawing out those comments while raising good ones himself. AND he is nice and a very fair\/nice grader. So basically, there is every reason to take this class if you can get into it",
    "If you like philosophy and\/or theoretical discussions, take it. Professor Kapustin is the best professor I've had at Yale, and I'm a senior.",
    "Take this class if you are passionate about learning and want a phenomenal professor. Do the reading, it's the least you could do for one of the most exciting and thoughtful professors at Yale. TAKE IT.",
    "Yes, but do keep up with the readings. The strength of the course lies in discussions.",
    "I would recommend another student take this, because I feel as though through this class I learned things (shocker!) about subjects and topics that really changed the way I look at a lot of things (I know, cliche). As for the class itself: every week you read about eighty pages of required material (although I always found it necessary, in order to participate intelligently in class discussions, to look up some of the recommended reading as well) and then you come to class and talk about it. The professor introduces the main questions at hand, the students have at it for a bit, and then the professor sums up our remarks and then adds some of his own points. Also, don't be too afraid of saying what you think before the professor and the class. I know he puts up this hard Soviet exterior, and seems very inspired and all, but seriously--if you're a college senior orjunior, the time has now come for you to mark your wits with the best of them. Don't take some measly little class where you never challenge yourself. This class, right here--this is how you'll be able to exit Yale College a thoroughly educated individual. Do it. Do it now.",
    "GREAT COURSE, must take.",
    "I would definitely recommend Moral Choices in Politics to any student interested politics broadly, be it an interest in theory or an interest in morepractical applications of theory or, particularly, both. This course exposes students to the thoughts of real, important, and famous political actors, and with Professor Kapustin\u0092s help, this class allows students to understand the philosophical underpinnings behind the theories of the given political actor. Indeed, this course is at the crossroads of theory and application. This course also has a philosophical component, which gives more theoretical tools to understand decisions in politics. Essentially, you will walk away with an understanding of the complexities surrounding the motivations and decisions of people whose actions affect their wider society. If this subject matter is at all interesting, then you should take this course.I would also recommend that students take this course to learn from Professor Kapustin. He is a brilliant, passionate, and kind professor. He brings such enthusiasm and energy to class that you will really enjoy class and love the material. He also gives students class time to discuss their own thoughts, which is always important. Finally, Professor Kapustin actually gives you tools to understand the subject matter, which will be important and helpful in future classes (or even when thinking about this material after college). In fact, Professor Kapustin does a great job of bringing out the philosophical underpinnings in every text you read. Do not expect an analytic philosophy class, though; Professor Kapustin is more a continental philosopher (e.g. does not break argument down into premise form, but notes general arguments)."
