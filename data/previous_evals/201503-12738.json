    "Arabic is not a language for the faint of heart. Learning even to make the sounds at first is difficult, and so you really have to be committed. Actually study for an hour a night. But on the other hand, it is a beautiful language and there is so much to be gained from knowing it. If you actually want to learn about the Arab world, Islam, etc., do not be scared of it. But if you are just looking to fulfill your language requirement, I would not recommend it."
