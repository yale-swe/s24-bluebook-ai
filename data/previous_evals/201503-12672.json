    "An excellent and easy social science\/humanities credit. The films chosen for the class are all very good and interesting, the lectures by Professor Kalyvas are fascinating and cover a wide range of topics from the political history of the 20th Century. Really good class, little work, fair midterm exam.",
    "Politics & Film is a pretty relaxed way to get a grip on the history of the 21st century and watch some very well selected films.",
    "Politics and Film is a remarkable course which I enjoyed tremendously. The ability to put film into the context of politics and politics into the context of film has revealed a lot of insights about politics since the creation of the film art form. I was incredibly impressed by this course and I recommend it highly.",
    "Don't take this class. I am interested in film and politics and took it credit-D because of how little work it is (easy midterm easy final)...and even so I totally regret wasting a Yale credit on this class. I learned absolutely nothing about either film or politics that I couldn't have gotten just from watching the movies. The lectures dragged on and literally just like recounted the most obvious facts about the film (there are three main characters, the narrative structure is complex, it is about modernization...etc). Truly truly a depressing waste of time :(",
    "This class was fun but I dont think I learned that much. Take it for the films. They are interesting, beautiful, and give you a very strong sense for what life is like in a particular time and place. Lectures were delivered in an interesting way (Professor Stathis is a funny and interesting person) but the content was so broad that I dont feel like I actually learned anything I didnt already know. This is very much an overview course you get a sweeping glimpse of complex and controversial events without really diving into the complexity or the controversy. Workload is very light for most of the semester (readings you can skim, easy midterm). Beware the take-home final though it is a 15 page essay.",
    "Professor Kalyvas is an exceptional professor and an especially engaging lecturer; he definitely has a point of view but you [undergraduate students] almost always feel smarter for having listened to it; great selection of films but an even better discussion of some of the political phenomenon they cover; would definitely recommend to future students",
    "An interesting approach to political science. Professor Kalyvas is great. The only downside is that Sunday night film screenings are a tad inconvenient.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in world history. As someone who only had a basic understanding of global politics in the 20th century, this course was a great way to explore history beyond a solely American perspective. Moreover, the majority of the films were very interesting and ones which I would never have had the initiative to see on my own.",
    "Engaging class for anyone who is interested in history and movies. You would never be able to see movies without noticing all the effects, themes, nuances in it. The course definitely makes you \"an educated movie viewer\".",
    "Interesting course; would recommend"
