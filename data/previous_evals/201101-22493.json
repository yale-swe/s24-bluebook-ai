   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Especially if you are interested in working with children\/adolescents or want a background in behavioral therapy.",
    "Definitely! This class was one of my favorites at Yale. You learn about therapy and psychology in a way completely different from any other class because you see how it works and the techniques to effect change. It's worth while for anyone who plans on working with other people as a teacher, therapist or parent. Professor Kazdin is hilarious and makes class fun. He's not easy but he's very clear and if you do the work you'll do well. In fact, it's one of the few times I've wanted to do the reading. Also, start the behavior change project early! You can get a lot out of it if you don't leave it until the end.",
    "Great great great senior seminar. Amazing professor-great lecturer and very helpful, clear, and friendly. The material is very practical and relevant to everyday life and clinical psychology practice. I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "yes, but only if the individual is not looking for a seminar",
    "You absolutely need to take this class. It will change your life. LITERALLY. I looked forward to class each week and saw the readings as personally enriching rather than a boring necessity. Professor Kazdin is the best professor I've ever had--he's so accomplished, yet he's always accessible and is one of the nicest and funniest people you'll ever meet. You learn aspects of behavior that you can apply in your own life with your family, friends, and more. The highlight was the behavior change project! If you don't take this class you are missing out on something truly amazing.",
    "Take. Take.",
    "This class is a little bit more work that a typical senior spring class, however it's definitely worth it. You learn a lot and the small class size allows for a lot of discussion.",
    "One of my favorite classes in my four years at Yale and probably one of the most useful for general life skills--influencing others' behavior sure does come in handy. Kazdin runs the course like a high school class in that he works really hard to keep your attention although the material is extremely intersting in its own right. there is a midterm and a final -thery're pretty difficult but Kazdin is quite generous so you don't do nearly as badly as you think you did. Study class notes and the vocab and applied questions at the end of each chapter. For the papers, you need to go above the specified criteria to do really well and the behavior change project is really fun. In the end, most ppl do great. It's a must-take if you can--especially for psych majors. A good amount of work but worth it.",
    "Kazdin is the man. You should take this class because of him. He's an adorable old man with a ton of corny jokes, but definitely a positive package overall. He's understanding and concerned about his students, and because he works with kids with behavior problems all day, he knows how to keep the attention of a classroom of Yale seniors well. The behavior change project was a little tedious to be honest, but learning all the other stuff was great.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a great course whether you are interested in cognitive behavior therapy or just interested in human behavior in a non-clinical sense.",
    "I would highly, highly, highly recommend this class for any Psychology senior major, even above Paul Bloom's class. It's the only psychology course in my 4 years where I was able to apply what I learned to actually change behavior. The project component asks you to help change someone's behavior, using the techniques that Kazdin talks about in class. There's an element of magic involved: because of my project (helping a friend lose weight), I actually looked forward to reading ahead and learning the material. Studying for the midterm and final was a breeze specifically because Kazdin provided the motivation to learn the techniques he was going to test us on.Finally, Kazdin is quite the professor. He cares about the students, and not only that, but he's funny, engaging, and genuinely cares about his work. Also, if you search him on Google Scholar, you'll see he has an research article with over 1800 citations. That's pretty good."
