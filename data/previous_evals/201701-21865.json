    "Strengths - very interesting, great professor, worthwhile classes Weaknesses - a lot of outside work for class, meaning having to go to museums, libraries etc. Though not a huge hinderance, but a lone weakness.",
    "The class covers a very interesting but broad topic - it looks as the appropriation of Egyptian motifs and ideas from prehistory to present. Due to the breadth of the time period, the class is more introductory than I thought, but the topic and discussions are really interesting!",
    "I liked all the independent work we got to do in this course.",
    "Really can't think of any weaknesses. Strength is definitely in the lectures, they were super engaging.",
    "The major themes in the class are very interesting, and the trips to the Beinecke and the Center for British Art were fun. The lectures, however, could be more structured and more engaging."

    "I would definitely recommend, the class material is very interesting.",
    "Yes, I think courses like this that examine and provide examples of the origins of so many contemporary designs and such should be required among art history classes and the like. Also just in general a very interesting subject to learn about.",
    "Yes it was a very enjoyable course.",
    "Yes! Cool subject matter, short assignments, awesome professor.",
    "Yes!!! Professor Darnell is amazing and the course is so fun and interesting. I had never taken a class in Egyptian art before and I'm so glad that I was able to my last semester. I loved it.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in Egypt, this is a good course to engage with some of the major themes of Egypt's afterlife."
