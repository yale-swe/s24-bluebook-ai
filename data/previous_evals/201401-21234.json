    "This class is a great way to learn about cinematography and British culture. Since it is a very small seminar, every student has always enough time to express his or her ideas. I took it as a WR requirement class and have never regretted it. Professor Biggs is amazing.",
    "Recommended as a film studies course; do not go into it expecting an English lit course--although there is a one-act play and two novellas on the syllabus, most of the homework is required film-watching.",
    "British Cinema is a very easy class. There is no reading. You must watch two films a week and show up to class for a very basic and usually boring discussion of the film. The films are okay.",
    "Unless you know Professor Biggs personally and he has approved your style of writing I suggest that you don't take this class."
