    "In this class, my translations skills were increased immeasurably. We moved through Hesiod, Theognis, and Solon swiftly. It was fast enough to be challenging, but never unmanageable. We had three quizzes, a midterm, and a final, and this forced us to review material as we progressed, so by the end we had a comprehensive understanding of the texts we covered.",

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this class include the immeasurable wisdom of Professor Bakker, the small class size, and relatively high standard of work and class participation. The weaknesses include a lack of clear context for the class. Many students came in with little to no knowledge of the subject material, and this limited certain class discussions.",
    "A strength was definitely that we were only a small group of students, which facilitated discussion. A weakness might have been the amount of text we were reading for each class meeting, as we sometimes did not have time to talk about it in the end."

    "Absolutely. Bakker is phenomenal, and Hesiod is incredible.",
    "Absolutely take this class. The reading list is incredible and is some of the most personally and academically stimulating material I've read at Yale. Do all of the reading, you definitely do not want to miss out. Professor Bakker is an amazing professor--he has a thoughtful way of exploring the theoretical and literary elements of the curriculum, as well as brilliant insights about the Greek language and Greek verse.",
    "Yes",
    "For any student at L5 Greek with some background in Homer, I would certainly recommend this course.",
    "Anyone interested in Ancient Greek poetry, especially Hesiod, should definitely take this class."
