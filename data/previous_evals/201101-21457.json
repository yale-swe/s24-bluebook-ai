   "comments": [
    "Yes- one may grow in Spanish skills.",
    "I would recommend it because it does help you to improve your language skills (especially, speaking).",
    "The class is a typical Yale language course - homework daily, an hour of class daily, and many class activities, day after day - but you will get better at the language. I do recommend Profesora Leon; she's wonderful and very helpful. Sometimes she comes across a little hard to understand, but it's not a big deal at all. My speaking and writing abilities definitely improved and became more automatic and natural.",
    "Yes I would recommend it as a necessary step to the higher classes. Also the material towards the end of the semester, like reading Las Batallas en el Desierto, was actually really fun and interesting.",
    "Awesome class.",
    "I would because I feel like my Spanish has improved a lot.",
    "Good class. A lot of work towards the end of the semester.",
    "Yeah, it's a good way to improve your Spanish skills. Grammar and Conversation class, the novel at the end is really interesting as are the conversations that you have about it.",
    "Great course. Professor Leon is a great teacher who continuously engages her students. I recommend this course for anyone wishing to study Spanish at a higher level.",
    "Spanish 140 is a good course to take if you must take it to fulfill your language requirement. The course definitely does help a student improve his\/her Spanish but I would not take it if you don't need to. Your Spanish will develop from L3 to L4 but I feel that a sufficient level has been established in L3. If you really want to improve your Spanish, Spanish 140 will certainly do the trick and the department is so strong that you can't go wrong with whichever professor you choose.",
    "This Spanish course was another valuable stepping stone on the way to speaking a foreign language fluently. Spanish Level 4 allowed me to sharpen my grammatical skills, expand my Spanish vocabulary, broaden my knowledge of Spanish and Latin American culture, and overall become a better Spanish speaker and reader. I would recommend this course to anyone who finds themselves at an intermediate level of Spanish and would like to eventually achieve fluency.",
    "I would recommend this class because it helps improve spoken and written. It is a moderately hard introductory course."
