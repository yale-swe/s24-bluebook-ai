    "Would absolutely recommend HSAR 314, especially if you have taken\/plan to take Professor Armstrong's course on 19th-century French art as well.",
    "HSAR 314 is a fairly good but difficult course detailing a fantastic century in art history. Take it for the love of this century's art--it's truly stunning, and having the opportunity to talk about it and admire it during lectures and sections is wonderful. However, know that a great deal of works of art spanning the entire century must be committed to memory. There are 2 papers, a midterm, and a final; both of the exams can be rather challenging simply due to the volume of material that needs to be memorized for them, and the papers are graded rather critically. There is a very large volume of reading required. Additionally, Professor Armstrong is deeply knowledgeable in this subject area, which is wonderful, but the quantity of \"ums\" and \"uhs\" she utters during her lectures can be very distracting. If you can get past this, the lectures are generally very well done.",
    "HSAR 314 is a comprehensive survey of 18th century art, with an emphasis on the aesthetic theories and philosophies which informed it. The class adds much-needed dimension to artistic \"movements\" (like Rococo and Neoclassicism) and challenges the conception of a monolithic Enlightenment. I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "Don't. Not with Professor Armstrong teaching it, not the way I took it. Maybe with another professor, but it would be an entirely different course so I can't speak to that.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who wish to learn more about 18th century history and painting in Europe."
