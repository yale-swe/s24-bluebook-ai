   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this course.",
    "Absolutely take it if you get in. It will be one of, if not the best class you take here. It's a lot of work but you will actually want to do it. Professor Starr is a teacher who actually pays attention to teaching and as a result the class is fantastic.",
    "If you can take this class, do it. The case study method is a great way to learn about the different levers for political change, and Prof. Starr is an excellent teacher. The seminar is almost entirely small group discussions. There is a lot of work, but it is absolutely worth it.",
    "Take it if you can -- great alternative to the traditional seminar.",
    "This class takes several political levers that can be used to affect change in public schools, and analyzes them one by one in case studies throughout the country. The reading can be a bit long, but it is usually manageable and interesting. The class periods are quite enjoyable, as they involve several small discussion groups that really let you learn from other students, and learn from yourself and the professor in the process. I would recommend this to anyone interested in public schools, or politics, or who would just like to take a class from an amazing professor.",
    "A survey of political levers and their influences on education policy.",
    "PLSC 260 is fantastic, as I'm sure every other review will say. Definitely only take the course if you are interested in the material and don't believe all the hype about how hard it is to get in-- just keep on applying if you don't get in the first time. It's a great class and totally worth the persistence.",
    "This is the seminar that puts all other seminars to shame. Professor Starr cares deeply about this class, and it's evident in everything he does. He has personally assembled the course's ten casebooks, so you know that not one page of what you're reading is wasted (unlike other Poli Sci courses, where professors randomly assign entire books that no one reads). This means that in PLSC 260, everyone does the reading, and the class discussions are consequently amazing. Each week JBS prepares a classroom protocol - a detailed spreadsheet that includes the topics for several rounds of discussion during class and specifies the small subgroups that the topics will be discussed in. This seminar, as a result, has the perfect balance of small-group and full-seminar discussions, and you'll really get to know each of your classmates throughout the semester. This course represents everything that a Yale Political Science seminar should be. You must take it.",
    "Yes, yes, yes. If you're not really up-to-date on education issues, this class might seem a little daunting at first because of the work involved and the type of kids that apply. But fear not, it's really more accessible than it seems. It's also wholly rewarding.JBS takes so much time to plan this class out, and it really shows. The readings, the assignments, the small-group activities during seminar are all the result of hours of his tinkering. It pays off. This is easily the best seminar I've taken at Yale. I've also never had a professor that pays so much attention to the methodology of teaching the class. He is constantly soliciting feedback and making small changes to the course in order to ensure that it is the best educational experience it can possible be.",
    "I am (now) a second-semester senior in Yale College. I have taken plenty of great, interesting, fascinating courses. PLSC 260 is the best course I have taken at Yale.Make no mistake: the workload is not light, and the course is not easy. However, you will never feel that your time is wasted, and it is such an enjoyable experience that you will not regret spending the extra time.",
    "YES! Take this class if you can get it in - it will change your life!",
    "Yes! it is a lot of work, but it is the course I gained the most from at Yale.",
    "This is one of the best classes that I've taken at Yale. I highly recommend it, but be aware of the high workload before you apply. If you don't have the time to dedicate to this class, you shouldn't take it.",
    "Of course this is fantastic, so I'll focus on a couple other things. I'd recommend taking PLSC240 - the spring version of Prof Starr's class - first, if you can. Policy is just more interesting than politics, at least to me, and it was great to have a background in the policies before discussing the political processes through which the policies came into being. Plus, then you won't take the two versions consecutively, and you'll get a bit of a break from the intense workload.Long casebooks, mandatory study groups, weekly 2-page reading responses, clarifying questions, and classroom protocols all make this a rigorous class that expects more from you than most other Yale courses. But that's why the class is worth taking - you learn, and your fellow students are actually going to be serious about the subject. Fantastic.",
    "Fantastic. Highly recommended. Professor works his butt off, study groups are fun and productive. Topics are interesting and students are engaged and well-informed. Classes run through a variety of small group exercises that make the time fly by. Lots of work, but totally worth it and fairly graded. Encourage group work on the final paper. Take it take it take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend Public Schools&Politics to another student. Great, great class. Class I learned the most in, most fun class to go to. Significant work, but definitely not too much. Prof. Starr is wonderful."
