    "I would recommend it. I enjoyed my research experience.",
    "Start doing independent research as soon as you can. No, seriously. None of the EEB professors bite (and if you're not right for their lab, they'll tell you very nicely), and in fact most of them are thrilled to have undergrads interested in their work. There's a huge variety of types of projects, both in terms of material and in terms of supervision (do you want to have your own personal project that you design from scratch? do you want to work closely with a grad student? do you want to be in a big lab? a small lab? be there all night every night? have lots of field work?), so ask around (EARLY!) and find what's right for you.",
    "If you're taking this, you probably have to! Good luck on your thesis.",
    "You research things and write a paper.",
    "I recommend it. It's sort of fun to be working on a project all semester, and it's not too much work.",
    "it's fun and independent"
