    "This is a refreshingly rigorous course, which I enjoyed very much. This wasn't my first exposure to statistical thermodynamics, so most of the concepts were review but this time the concepts seemed to be much more palpable.",
    "Learnt so much about Thermodynamics of various processes and had a great experience with Stat thermo.",

   "comments": [
    "Personally I found the rigor to be very exciting and consider it to be one of its strengths. It did seem however that most lectures were just regurgitations of the textbook. It would have been nice to delve into deep detail.",
    "The class was as comprehensive as it could be in one semester. I wish there had been more partial credit on exams. It would have been helpful to have a grading rubric for the project, as well.",
    "I loved the part where thermo was applied to practical aspects. Mostly had trouble in the complex derivations of stat thermo where it was difficult to follow.",
    "I think it would be more convenient if the course better aligned with the textbook, or if the course itself better related to the textbook, as some of these very complicated topics did not have resources to improve outstanding outside of class. I also found it a little difficult to conceptualize how I would apply many of these topics to my research; it felt like most of the examples provided applied to polymers, an area I have no familiarity with. Perhaps this is just the nature of the course, but I often felt like we jumped around between equations and mathematical relations so quickly that I never got a chance to really absorb what was happening. The homework always felt very long, often confusing, and the exams were fairly difficult. It seemed that each exam required some degree of memorizing equations, even if we were told we would be given everything we needed. I can understand that for very basic equations that we used often, but they felt seldom-used or complex.",
    "Some parts of the statistical stuff was too fast. I got a good intuition about classical thermodynamics which has been useful for my research."

   "comments": [
    "It is a required course, but I do think it was helpful for getting us familiar with thermo so that we are not scared away by it as much when we encounter it in our research.",
    "Absolutely. If you are in Chemical Engineering, this course is great for the future.",
    "I would recommend this course if they were required to take it. Else, I'm not entirely sure why they would choose to take it, unless their research needed an introduction to statistical mechanics.",
    "Highly recommended, Chinedum Osuji is a brilliant professor, and while he teaches lecture rather quickly, you come out of the class knowing so much about the principles of thermodynamics, thermodynamics models, and various ways to apply the knowledge to a multitude of different systems, from polymer systems to magnetic systems. Great course",
    "If someone needs some classical dynamics knowledge, I would."
