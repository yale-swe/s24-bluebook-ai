If I continue my Chinese study I will have a wonderful foundation. I hope to use it in the future even if I don't keep doing Chinese at Yale."

    "Strengths: Sun Laoshi",
    "The daily quizzes and dictations are wonderful and do a great job of addressing different aspects of the dialogue from each week. Sun also uses each minute of class time to the utmost. The essays and oral presentations are also helpful to keep up writing ability. And the tests seem catered to what we are learning. This is an extremely difficult course, which is to be expected from a 1.5 credit language. That said, keeping up with the (very intensive) work of the class is possible, and if you do so, then you can do well and learn so much. The Quia is difficult, and I think it should be worth less in the class. But it is helpful for reading and listening, which we don't do enough of in class."

    "I wrote this last semester, but it is the same for Chinese 140: I would recommend this course to a serious student of Chinese. The workload is extremely intense and not for someone who does not really enjoy studying Chinese. It also requires a lot of in-class participation; for an hour every morning, Chinese 130 students have to be prepared to really focus, pay attention, listen, and speak. This is not a casual class but it is a very rewarding one."
