    "I am in awe of this class. It was engaging, fun, challenging, and interesting. I looked forward to it every week. The topic is fascinating, but Professor Scholl is an extraordinary professor who goes above and beyond anything expected of a Yale class. I adore this class. If you have taken psychology classes before and enjoy thinking critically about papers (and finding their weaknesses, which is something that many classes do not actively encourage), you should absolutely take this class. Professor Scholl is one of the best professors at Yale. He is an exceptional person and really cares about his students, both academically and personally. TAKE THIS CLASS!!",
    "Take this course. Brian Scholl is Brian Scholl, and he will be the somewhat-idiosyncratic perception guy, but he cares a lot about this work and consequently knows a ton about it. He is very responsive to feedback in the course, and will likely give a lecture or two at the end about whatever the class ends up interested in. Grad students seem to know that it's worth taking, as I think more than half our class was grad or professional school students (more than I've seen or heard of in other psych senior sems); take this as you will (it may be that Scholl lets more in than other profs, but I suspect not). Assuming you get in, don't bring up neuroscience (\u201cNo!\u201d \u201cbut...\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d \u201c...\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d), and be discerning in how you evaluate the readings. They may not be as solid findings as you suspect, but he's assigned them to demonstrate something. Workload is reading responses + final paper + discussion; standard fare.",
    "This is an all-around dynamite class. I was lucky enough to get into the class as a sophomore (not super common, so don't count on it, but it is worth a shot if you're passionate about the material) and I learned so much from both my peers and Professor Scholl. The class usually has a good chunk of grad students (around half were graduate this semester), which I actually found to be a huge positive. They had a higher level of understanding of the material we were engaging and pushed me to think on that plane as well. The readings are 100% journal articles or lit reviews that have been published in journals, so if you aren't a fan of reading academic journal articles you probably shouldn't by a psych or cogsci major anyway, so you definitely wouldn't be taking this class. The reading responses are straightforward, and in addition to the usual, \"react to this week's readings,\" Professor Scholl will have you go out and find another article of your own that is relevant to the topic. Really helped me engage with the material week to week. All in all, the discussions tended to flow really well, as Scholl is a fantastic facilitator and a genuinely nice and funny guy. He's great about answering questions, responding to emails, and all that other jazz that a professor is supposed to do. Final paper is kind of a grind (15-20 pages) but if you pick something you're interested in, it'll be super easy because theres just so much to talk about with this class. In sum, highly recommend to anyone who is seriously interested in vision and social psychology. Not a class to take as a casual 5th, but definitely a good one to take.",
    "Social Perception is a great course. There is a clear thesis to the course, and all of the readings relate to that thesis. Professor Scholl is really fun and passionate about the material, which makes the seminar enjoyable. Be prepared for a lot of primary psychology papers and a big final paper at the end of the course. I highly recommend this course!",
    "This is a good course to take for the psychology senior seminar. The topics are varied, and besides a weekly response (which just helps you keep on your game for seminar discussion) there is not a ton of work, which allows you to appreciate the material for what it is. Plus, I found it nice having a balance of undergrad and grad students."
