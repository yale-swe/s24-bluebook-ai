    "Topics on social insurance and intergenerational inequality transmission.",
    "Learned a lot about topics of PF, details of life-cycle modeling, general info about being a grad student\/picking research topics.",
    "I found a great reserach idea! Also I learned about structural programming first hand and the pitfalls coming with it.",
    "Learned a lot about social insurance, building a lifecycle model, and reading papers with structural models in general.",
    "I learned a great deal about social insurance, inequality, and life cycle models. The course was also a great comparison to the sufficient statistics approach applied during the Fall Semester.",
    "I in particular developed skills in how to read about, code up and think about structural models and their use, as well as how to think more generally about lifecycle aspects of economic problems.",
    "life cycle models; especially the coding weeks were extremely useful great overview of the field"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this course covers a narrow set of topics, but it covers them very well. One way to improve this course would be to give a general overview of the different social insurance schemes present in the US and other western European countries.",
    "Really good mix of papers (empirical vs. theoretical, different techniques), helpful to walk through them in moderate detail in class with extra context about the topic. Detailed dive into lifecycle modeling code was really useful. Problem sets were good opportunities to apply Hard to stay engaged for 3 hours of class--would prefer splitting it into 2 lectures.",
    "Hardly any weakness except the room: Too hot to stay focused for three straight hours--> Fix the AC in there please! Strengths: Great slides and selection of topics. Also, the computational part was very helpful: Learning about structural estimation and how it works in detail was very important to me. Also applying it to our own project really helped me understanding it better as well as understanding the software and its weaknesses better. Workload was also fine and Cormac is a fair instructor.",
    "Very good format and well organized. I liked that we did a few classes on programming. Good spacing of assignments. Could have covered a broader range of topics.",
    "This course was a great introduction to life cycle models. I also found the problem sets to be engaging and instructive. I wish we had covered a few more substantive topics, e.g., health insurance, but I am glad we focused on the computational methods.",
    "Cormac was a very good lecturer, I really appreciated in particular how seriously he engaged with all of our comments and turned it into a discussion. I also thought our weeks on life cycle model programming were incredibly useful. If it werent more work for Cormac, I would probably recommend to Truman that all incoming first years go through this coding camp with him!",
    "strengths: good combination of empirical and structural work, and also great at showing the links; Also, I appreciated Cormac's personal research tips\/insights along the way, and especially in the week when he presented his job market paper to us."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. This course is very useful for students who want to work in topics in social insurance in public economics, and even those students who want to work in fields like labor where the knowledge of these social insurance schemes is very important and could be intersected with topics in labor.",
    "Yes--if interested in either the topics or the methodology.",
    "Yes, definitely. The course gets you involved and teaches you about computational methods and structural estimation in an applied setting. Even if you do not want to work in this area, it helps you greatly to follow someone's presentation if they rely on structural estimation.",
    "Yes. Cormac is a great instructor.",
    "Yes. Especially helpful to learn about building a lifecycle model. Well organized.",
    "Yes. Cormac's teaching and focus on structural modeling is a perfect complement to Joe's focus on sufficient statistics in the Fall. Together, the two classes give a great overview of the substance and methods of public finance.",
    "Definitely, an excellent course!",
    "Definitely highly recommended!"
