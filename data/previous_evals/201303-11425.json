   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Prof. Carby is a terrific professor, discussions were fascinating, and the course material is fun to read every week. It's a surprising amount of work, though so be ready for that, but that's mostly because your peers are so engaged that you have to be too.",
    "I would take this class if you're interested in reading some cool science fiction and talking about it! I've never taken an American studies or WGSS course before, so honestly I can't say if it will defy or disappoint expectations, but I can say that if you want to read some awesome books and spend about two hours talking about them each week, then this course is for you. The workload felt very fair throughout the semester, and I've left the class with a much more nuanced understanding of what ideas\/visions of the future might mean for the past, the present, and of course the actual future.",
    "If you are okay with an absolute lack of structure go for it. I wouldn't take it again.",
    "This was a GREAT class! It was first seminar I've taken that I felt was really discussion-based; Professor Carby let us take the conversation where wanted but was ready to jump in with her own analysis and\/or questions when we started to run out of things to say.The books were off the beaten path, intellectually stimulating, and worth reading, and the focus on female writers and writers of color was particularly refreshing. Obviously the perfect class for someone who loves science fiction, but I think the class would also change your mind about SciFi if you dislike it. So much to talk about; the class really demonstrated that authors can get at some big questions and themes through science fiction. The workload was big \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0a novel a week with a 500 word reading response \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0but I thought well worth it.",
    "This is a really fun class. The books are awesome, and our discussion was quite good. If you'd like to take this class, I'd make sure you have decent close reading skills. A background in the history of colonization, feminist or queer theory, and racial theory would make this class more enjoyable, but aren't necessary. Look at the reading list before you begin (it's awesome, but if you're looking for Clark, Philip K. Dick, Asimov etc you won't find them here).",
    "This is a wonderful class! It's a lot of work, though, and you will definitely think about fiction very differently after it. Take it if you like the reading list (lots of depressing dystopias) and are able to put in the time to have thoughtful, nuanced opinions of them every week.",
    "This class covered an interesting range of books and topics - take it if the books on the syllabus seem like books you want to read and talk about. The course was definitely about discussion, and reaching into your experience to form connections to the books and share those with the class, rather than about \/learning\/ new things."
