   "comments": [
    "Yes I will recommend it as a class to practice speech writing and public speaking although there is much to be desired around the theory.",
    "A class that should be extended to far more students on this campus. Oratory remains a crucial skill for leadership in all sectors. It was a fantastic opportunity to hone that craft for future endeavors.",
    "A phenomenal speech class. Take it.",
    "A great senior year class--or any year class, really. A hands on practicum in public speaking. Professor Roach is an excellent professor and wise teacher of oratory, and he will succeed in making you better. He is critical, but not strenuous to receive critique from. If you are an unconfortable speaker--some of us were--your improvement will be truly remarkable. If you are a practiced and skilled speaker--I'd say most of us were--he will make you even better, and truly will push you to develop your style and arrangement in writing until your speeches are unforgettable. The workload is what you make of it: tiny if you want to coast, larger if you want to be changed by the course. The group of students who takes the class makes a big difference. If the students seems eclectic and talented, would 100% recommend.",
    "An exceptional course taught by one of the finest instructors this school has to offer, Joseph Roach. Take it before you graduate and be sure to make it the focus of your semester.",
    "An excellent course in rhetorical forms and great practice for speaking in front of anyone. Goes through three ungraded speeches and then gets into the graded ones. The low points of this course are obviously the seminar style sessions discussing readings. If the class is run again, we should have more speech writing and no readings. Professor Roach should be willing to give more criticism. It's unfortunate that most of the time that the worst speakers are allowed to just continue in their faults. Still. Super fun.",
    "This is a wonderful class. You will grow very close to the other students. Professor Roach is a spectacular educator, and you will learn so much from him. Take it!!",
    "This was a special course. In the process of pursuing strength, vulnerability, and transparency as public speakers, the students in this class revealed so much about themselves and became increasingly close. Everyone put a ton into their work, and Professor Roach was thoughtful, caring, and precise in his feedback. This kind of course is honestly a must-take for Yale students. It will benefit you so much more in the long run than just about any other class you can take at Yale. Definitely be prepared for tough grading, but don't shy away from the challenge!"
