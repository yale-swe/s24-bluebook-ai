   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It would be improved by spreading the content of the course out over the semester. Additionally, changing the syllabus fewer times would be helpful in order to plan out how to get the work done. Group work was really hard for me to do because of being in the school of nursing and having clinical hours, which made it difficult to meet with group members because of the inflexibility of my schedule.",
    "strengths: much practise to help student improve skills of literature review, presentation, and logistic thinking.weaknesses: some topics of student led presentatations were not interesting enough and could not help arise the hot discussion.The instructor could give more help on that.",
    "Weaknesses:1) The workload was incredibly unbalanced, with much more of the burden towards the end of the semester, ESPECIALLY for student groups presenting at the same time that they are writing the short paper, responding to online forums, and preparing for the final. I was unhappy with how the workload was distributed.2) The student presentations were interesting, but took up too much of the class time. I would have rather learned about some of those topics from Kaveh. Either have bigger groups or restrict the class size.3) Due dates never corresponded to the syllabus and were often unclear. For example, the short papers were supposed to be due in September and October, but ended up being assigned many weeks later, adding to the burden described above.Overall the course was interesting and covered a range of topics, but it didn't have the \"wow\" factor I was hoping for.",
    "Excellent course - some busy work - I would recommend bringing in more concrete examples (i.e. case studies)",
    "The final group project should either be a poster presentation or an essay. Having to do both was redundant and created unnecessary busy work.The class presentations were very informative and engaging. It was fun and a great exercise.The 2 short papers were of appropriate length.",
    "Very good coverage of the epidemiology of AIDS. Would have benefited from a greater discussion of the social and political context of AIDS - since these factors have shaped the epidemic from its beginning to this day.Too much class time was devoted to student presentations.",
    "The course provided an overall background about HIV that is good for students with no prior knowledge; however, students who have taken prior courses can get bored with the early material. I would have preferred more in-depth coverage of certain topics, such as recent prevention developments like microbicides or detailed discussion of vaccine candidates and why they haven't worked. Class readings, instead of basic backgrounds\/reviews of the topics, could be more geared toward recent developments. I would have appreciated a class that focused more on the issues that were present in the news, as they came up.The second half of the course was dedicated to student-led class time, which presented some interesting topics, but did not contribute significantly to my knowledge of HIV or ideas as to how to address the major challenges. This time could have been better spent with more structured discussions - the format of the student presentations facilitated participation but not involved interest in the topics, which I think could have been averted if it was structured differently.And lastly, the group projects have been quite difficult. It was not clear to me that the main goal was to present a new direction for future work, and so my group and I spent the bulk of our time examining the current state of our chosen topic and finding a lot of background. More periodic structured guidance along the way and more detail given in class about the expectations would have been helpful. In addition, I felt that the presentations and the group projects detracted from each other, and both could have been more engaging and meaningful without attention being split.",
    "This was a fantastic course, but definitely is a class that will be whatever you make of it. Most of the learning was through individual research (both group presentations and a final group paper) that let you really dive into which area of HIV you were passionate about, which was great, but fairly unstructured. The lectures themselves were interesting and probed some difficult questions, and Kaveh did a great job at facilitating good discussions. I liked the group presentations, but I thought they took away from time that we could have been having other lectures, since I would have liked to hear more from Kaveh as a teacher.",
    "I thought the course was very great for a beginning HIV\/AIDS class. It did a good job not only focusing on the disease itself, but also on the implications for other social and political issues.",
    "I very much enjoyed the class. Although this is not a weakness, I think it would be beneficial for students to only work on one group assignment. Group projects can become difficult because people are working on different schedules. I think this made it more stressful for me and coordinating meetings became counter productive at times. There is a lot of material in the course that I would like to go into more depth. Perhaps a term paper or research project would make a good substitution.",
    "One strength was that the course was student-driven and allowed students the opportunity to focus topics of their choosing in the field of HIV\/AIDS. However, there may have been too much focus on the student work, given that entire second half of the semester was student presentations.One weakness was an overload of assignments and presentations. I felt unable to put my best work and effort behind any one paper and presentation. The paper topics were interesting, but I felt it would be helpful to give out the topics with more than 6 days before they are due. Though relatively short papers, the topics were complex and required more time to think about and research adequately.I understood the reasoning behind having weekly reading summary assignments due, but again, two weekly summary responses per week were not feasible given other coursework. It was also unfair to students to introduce these assignments halfway through the semester without including them on the syllabus.Given that students already prepared and completed an hour-long presentation, it would have been helpful to limit the final project to a paper only, instead including an additional presentation.",
    "I enjoyed the mid-semester presentations and group projects. But having two group projects for one class was a bit too much. There were a lot of issues arranging meeting times and presenting. Also the weekly responses for everyone's presentation took a lot of time and did not seem to be so useful.",
    "very good",
    "I really like the way that Kaveh designed the course to start out with an intro to AIDS and then allow students to present specific topics within the HIV epidemic that are often controversial.",
    "I loved this class. I think we covered a huge amount of information in the semester, but it never felt like anything was crammed in, or as though we were loaded down with too much work. I also think this balanced well between introductory material and more advanced stuff, so people of varying backgrounds were able to learn a lot. I do think the final project could use some tinkering, but I'm also not very fond of group projects, so I think I'm biased there. One issue with it was that I think the presentation format was problematic. Also, I think ending the class with two sets of projects left out some of Kaveh's insights- I would like to hear what topics he's most interested in as someone with a lot of experience in this field.",
    "The Global HIV\/AIDS course overall provides a good exposure to the social and economic aspects of HIV\/AIDS. The initial classes with presentations on specific topics were informative. However, the student presentations needs to be greatly modified in order to be effective. Firstly, these presentations took up half of the course and most of them were neither informative nor did they elicit productive discussion. This is not necessarily due to the instructors, but also due to the types of topics students choose. It would be more effective in the future to decrease emphasis on this portion of the course and perhaps have 15 minutes presentations. Otherwise, stricter rules can be applied and clearer goals\/guidelines provided in order to enhance the quality of student work.",
    "This class has a lot of weekly work and the presentations take a lot of preparation.... a lot more than other classes. This class was a very interesting class, however assignments were very unclear through out the entire semester. It was unclear what exactly was required on a weekly basis and what was required for preparation for the group projects. Thus I wish things were laid out more clearly.",
    "Strengths: excellent material, accommodating\/supportive\/open instructor, engaging lecturesAreas of improvement: majority of the work for the class occurred towards end of the class. Maybe if the projects were more spread throughout the semester, the work would feel lighter and less distressful. Having had 2 groups projects was a bit tough because it was hard to coordinate time between the groups."

    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Knowledgeable about the subject; very approachable",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh is a great lecturer. He strikes a casual yet academic tone with the class. He provided excellent feedback for both group projects and encouraged students to move beyond the simple summarization of information to more analytical work.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Excellent coverage of the epidemiology, great lecturer. Teaching could be improved if less time was spent with students presenting.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Class activities can be be structured and distributed through the semester, instead of clustering them at the very end.More information, esp. about HIV\/AIDS outside New Haven, could be covered in the lectures.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh has an incredible background in HIV and it is evident that he is well-versed in all of the current issues. However, I did not often feel like his knowledge was coming through for the students. I do not feel that the structure of the class facilitated learning as much as I could about HIV this semester, and that the class was less about instruction and more about coming up with cursory responses to questions posed during student presentations that used little background knowledge and were often more about acting than focusing on brainstorming real solutions to critical issues.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh is a fantastic professor - he is really engaged and excited about the subject material, so it's difficult not to be excited about the class. The introductory lectures that he gave provided a good framework for the rest of the class, but I wish he had lectured more throughout the class just because he has such a great knowledge aboutthe subject material. He definitely expects a lot from his students and is always pushing them to go further, but does a great job in keeping the class interesting and tailored towards the students in the class.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Dr. Khoshnood is a great professors. His experience studying\/working with HIV\/AIDS made the class so much more interesting.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Excellent professor! Enjoyed his lectures very much. They were informative and inspired very good conversations.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Very knowledgeable about the subject. Very helpful and willing to assist students with their projects.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Instructor was knowledgeable and engaging during the first part of the semester. It would have been great to have a few more lectures during the second part of the course as well.",

    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh is awesome- one of the best professors at YSPH. He's a great lecturer, and I really appreciated the amount of time he put into evaluating students. For example, I always felt that he gave really detailed comments on our papers, which were helpful not only in expanding our thought processes, but also made our writing better. He was approachable and helpful in general, and I felt like he respects his students- it was nice that he gave us a 5 minute stretch break in class, for instance. It was cool to have a teacher who has so much experience in this area as well.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Professor Khoshnood is a wonderful professor. He is highly knowledgable about HIV\/AIDS and truly challenges students to think beyond the basics and comprehend the complexities of reducing this global burden. He is, however, too laxwith students and should encourage them to engender greater caliber of work, by providing clearer guidelines about expectations.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Very helpful and passionate about the subject.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh is such an open, accommodating professor. He is so humble and I learned a lot even from just his demeanor (he is a role model). His lectures were full of information and I learned a lot from them as well."

    "Yes. It gives students good chances of thinking of the many ethical, moral dilemmas in AIDS field and it help to broaden the eyesight.",
    "I would tentatively recommend it. It would be valuable to someone who doesn't know very much about HIV\/AIDS and is interested in learning more, and who likes the idea of a more self-directed learning experience.",
    "A survey course of HIV\/AIDS-related themes.",
    "Highly recommended to second year MPH students. Applicable to EMD, SBS, CDE, HPA students.",

Too much time devoted to student presentations, not enough time spent by professor lecturing.Group project: I found the group project annoying and ineffective. This course could have benefited from more individual work and less group-based projects.",
    "It was not what I had expectedand was hoping for. At this point, I would not really recommend it for most students, but I would make it clear how the class went and if other students are looking for that style of course, it could be effective. If however, some changes are made, I could certainly recommend the class. It does bring up important issues to consider about HIV, I just did not feel that it facilitated critical thinking about those topics as effectively as it could have.",
    "Definitely take this class - the lessons learned from HIV\/AIDS can be applied to many public health issues across the school, and the rate of research is such that there is always something new to talk about. It's a fun, engaging class!",
    "If someone is interested at all in HIV\/AIDS, I would recommend this course to them. I really learned a lot!",
    "It's a great class to take. I would definitely recommend it, especially if you're looking for a well rounded discussion\/study of HIV.",
    "This class is a great way to learn more about and focus on relevant issues about HIV\/AIDS, but could benefit from improved organization and clarity of assignments and student expectations, as well as a somewhat reduced workload with less busy work. It's also important to note that unless students choose to present on non-domestic HIV\/AIDS topics, there is very little global focus to the course.",
    "I liked the subject and the class but wish it would have been better organize.",
    "excellent course",
    "It is an overview of topics related to HIV\/AIDS globally. The topics vary with class but all fit into the reality that HIV\/AIDS is a complex, multi-faceted issue.",
    "This class is a very in depth look into AIDS\/HIV history and current information. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with an interest in the subject, even someone with limited background. The only caution I have is that there are a lot of group projects, so if that's not your cup of tea, maybe pick something else.",
    "This class is overall worth taking. Anyone without any previous HIV knowledge and with a lot of HIV knowledge will enjoy this class. I recommend it, but would say that great attention to directions is required as well as much clarification from the professor and TA."
