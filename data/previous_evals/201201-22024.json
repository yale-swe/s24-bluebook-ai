   "comments": [
    "If you're even remotely interested in photo, take this course.",
    "Expect to live your life in the darkroom, but you won't regret it. Definitely my favorite art class I've taken so far.",
    "Great class. Be prepared to put in the work. If you're taking it CREDIT\/D, then you can enjoy the class learning for learning's sake. Otherwise, you will need to go out of your way to produce artful pictures.",
    "I would recommend this class, but only if you really have the time to take it seriously. It's seriously brilliant as long as you can put the time into development etc. The problem isn't that you won't get the work done, but that you won't get as much out of it.",
    "Absolutely take the class, but only if you are really excited about doing the work--which you should be. I had an amazing experience, and I wish I had taken it earlier in my Yale career.",
    "A good and necessary introduction to the darkroom. Take it if you have an interest in photography of any kind, just the exposure to more photographers and making your own work will give you a better understanding of the medium. Highly recommended.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. This is the best course I have taken at Yale and I think this should be taken before digital photography. If you have any inclination towards photography, you should take this and do it with Lisa because she is excellent.",
    "Great class. Not a huge amount of work in terms of mental effort or quantity, but a -lot- of time, simply due to chemical processes that you have to watch over. I was personally frustrated by the time spent in each step to change something.In saying that, you either want to learn to shoot and print analogue photography or you don't. You learn every step in the process and it is fun, but I wouldn't recommend taking it as a \"gut\" for an otherwise heavy workload, as some people do. As a fourth class on a lighter schedule, or if you're a senior and are only taking 3 or so credits it's a really fun time."
