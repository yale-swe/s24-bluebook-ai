   "comments": [
    "Yes highly recommend especially if you are a history of art major.",
    "There's an intense amount of information to cover, but if you're down for that you can learn a lot about both Rome and Roman art.",
    "You learn basic info about important Roman sculptures from about 400 BCE to 400 CE, including date of creation, place of creation, and title\/ artist. You analyze the works based on formal qualities (i.e. color, shape, texture), contextual qualities (where\/ when\/ why it was made), and iconographic qualities (what is shown and why). You take 2 midterms and write 1 paper, with no final.I would highly recommend this course. It's an interesting an enjoyable break from other courses. It gives you a good chance to delve into a specific topic while learning analysis skills that can be applied to art of any time period. The tests are manageable if you start memorizing the works early on, memorizing the facts little by little starting about two weeks or a week and a half before the tests.",
    "I would, but only if you really like sculpture. If you are good at memorizing material you will do well.",
    "I never thought I would enjoy looking at marble portraits of Caligula. But now I do - really. TAKE THIS CLASS - Even if you have never been to Italy or taken an art history class before, this a great class. Professor Kleiner is amazing and her enthusiasm for the subject really shows. Take the class - great professor, great lectures, not a ton of work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if you are interested in art or classical civilization (or both, then you've hit the jackpot). You will leave with a great appreciation of the contributions the Romans made to not only the art world, but to modern civilization in general. The workload is also very manageable. Overall its a great course, taught by a knowledgeable professor.",
    "It was an interesting class. The lectures and readings were generally engaging (even with the early lecture time), the video clips were fun, and the online section was surprisingly good. It did seem like the grading on the exams was a bit harsh, and the single points off of individual questions can add up quickly, so I ended up with a bit of a lower grade than I liked. Consider taking it for credit.",
    "This class drove me crazy. At times (right before the midterms, when you were required to know the name and date of ~ 170 works of art) it was stressful and I didn't like it. However, looking back, I am glad I took the course because now I know much more about the ancient Roman Empire- something I never studied in detail before this class. No final, 1 paper (8pgs), and 2 midterms that actually are not as intense as you make them out to be.",
    "ARCG 170 was a good class to take for a basic yet very thorough introduction to Roman Art. If you don't like lots of memorization, however, this class is not for you.",
    "Roman Art was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. It was clear and extremely engaging. The paper was actually fun to write. Take it! You'll never regret it!",
    "I'd recommend it as a relatively painless way to fulfill a HU credit. Be prepared to study a lot for the exams though.",
    "This class is a great survey of Roman art from the Republican era through Constantine the Great. I would recommend it to anyone to whom it sounds even remotely interesting. It far exceeded my expectations, and I really learned a lot about Roman art, even though I hadn't taken a history of art class before.",
    "Yes, take this class if you like Roman history! The subject matter can be dry at times and repetitive but I don't regret taking the class! Besides the two big exams (have to study a lot for them!!), the workload is also very manageable. Diana Kleiner is great, though. Funny and smart professor!",
    "No section, and no final, but having notes for all of the lectures is a must. I recommend taking the class with a couple of friends to make sure you have good notes. Just three grades the whole semester. The two tests are 90% memorization and you will be asked to give the title, date, and some sort of explanation to about 175 monuments in both tests. However this is much easier than it sounds. The essay is also a breeze and should present no problem as long as you don't procrastinate (which is always my weakness).",
    "It's a good introduction to art, especially for those who are unfamiliar with the topic. I knew nearly nothing about Roman Art at the beginning but I truly feel as though I have learned a lot. Plus, it provides a good background in the history of Rome that corresponds to the material.",
    "I didnt find this class particularly engaging but this might just be because i didnt find the material inherently interesting. THe class is well taught and the exams are graded hard but fairly.",
    "Amazing professor that does teach exactly what the course says.",
    "It's an intro course to Roman Sculpture. You learn a lot, whether you have a great art history background or none at all, and the class is really enjoyable. I never missed a class, which is weird because it is held at 9 am. Kleiner is an excellent lecturer, the TAs were solid, and the material is pretty amazing. Fully recommend it.",
    "If you're genuinely interested in Rome's history, then you'll probably enjoy this course. I feel like it's one of the classes that, if you're only remotely interested in, will make you suffer. There are many dates, names, titles etc to learn, on top of the more general historical backgrounds. To learn everything to the extent that it needs to be learnt, make sure you are genuinely interested in learning it before you take it. Personally, I wouldn't recommend the course. I found the subject matter boring and the exam studying was grueling, dull and painful. It's a lot of memorization, on top of having to understand the lives of each emperor. If you're interested in it, you'll like it. If not, it will be the most course you'll have to do.",
    "Yes, history was very interesting great way to get a sense of art during classical period",
    "I'm not particularly interested in Roman art, but I enjoyed Roman Art& Society. It is entertaining to learn about the Roman emperors along with the art, and the web portal is helpful (with a monument list for each lecture) and has fun things like movie clips, too. Professor Kleiner is a good lecturer and clearly likes what she is talking about. Just make sure to start memorizing the slides early!",
    "A survey of important sculpture in Roman art. I would not recommend it unless you need to learn this material for something else. The material never really came alive to me. It mostly felt like a lot of memorization. Of course, the class timing didn't help."
