    "Class covering the history of modern Western involvement in Iraq, with an emphasis on the 2003 Iraq War.",
    "Def",
    "Highly recommended. Even if you are not EP&E or Global Affairs. I am neither.",
    "yes. Yes",
    "An excellent class- would definitely recommend. Beware that most seats are filled in pre-registration since the class is cross listed in 2 or 3 departments. Howorth is a wonderful seminar leader and lecturer. Howorth is very European-focused, so expect a critical view on the war, and from this different perspective. The work is the most reasonable of any seminar I've taken. In a day or dedicated afternoon you can usually cover all of the material. Most people did most of the readings and you have to do discussion points 4 times that encourage you to. Great class, great discussions, take it!",
    "Take it.",
    "If you can get in, please take this course. The material is captivating--the Iraq War was tragic, and we must learn from it and the ways the entire free world can be so easily mobilized. Howorth is amazing. Can't say enough good things. Just take this course.",
    "Absolutely. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I'm not even super into Iraq\/the Middle East, but Howorth is such an amazing seminar leader that it's tough not to get excited about the material. This class taught me so much about the post-1980 history of Iraq, and made me think about foreign policy in a completely different way."
