    "If you wanna learn hebrew take it.",
    "This is a truly enjoyable class, and if you put the work in, you'll finish the semester with significantly improved Hebrew. A large portion of class time (at least with Dina) was devoted to speaking in Hebrew about various topics that spontaneously arose. This helps with oral and auditory skills. Since the L3 class only meets twice a week, the work load is time-consuming but definitely not unmanageable. Dina is a fantastic professor!! Very understanding, and always listens to the educational wants and needs of her students within reason. This class was the highlight of my semester, and made me want to continue learning the language.",
    "It's a Hebrew class! You learn Hebrew. I like Dina: she expects a lot, but she also puts a lot of effort into her teaching. Not the best 5th class, but it's doable to take 5 with Hebrew 130. Don't take this class if you don't want to turn work in on Fridays. Also, you will be expected to learn how to type in Hebrew, which is actually less painful than it sounds."
