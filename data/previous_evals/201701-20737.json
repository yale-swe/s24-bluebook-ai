   "comments": [
    "I learned a ton about the Corsican Revolution, the Swedish Age of Liberty, the Polish Commonwealth, the Falklands Crisis, and Jamaicas and Indias experience during the Revolution. I learned a lot about working with primary sources and writing a historiography paper.",
    "Ability to read, analyze, and synthesize primary and secondary sources more effectively.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about how to craft a research question that was respectful of the existing historiography, but tried to find a new answer. The historiography paper was something that I had never written before, but I know that it will be a a valuable skill for my senior thesis. This class really taught me how to do good primary source research.",
    "This was the first class at Yale where I really interacted heavily and pretty much solely with primary sources. I gained a number of skills in that area, both in finding documents and learning how to read and analyze them. I also enjoyed the perspective the class took, by taking a global look at the period surrounding the outbreak and fighting of the American Revolution, I saw many connections and similarities that had never been considered on other occasions when I studied this period."

   "comments": [
    "WOW I can honestly say that I learned a tremendous amount in this courseparticularly about the global experience during the Revolution. I also learned a lot about analyzing primary sources and combing through large amounts of material and how to write a historiography paper. I think the amount of reading at times could be quite a lot though. While they seemed disconnected when I was reading them before class, Pincus did a wonderful job at finding important elements in them that made them super relevantI just wished at times I could have made those connections on my own. In the beginning of the course Prof Pincus had questions to guide us and I would recommend keeping those questions going throughout the course.",
    "Very wide and diverse array of readings are a strength, connection back to main theme a potential weakness.",
    "I think one of the strengths of this course is that it is functionally a one-semester thesis project. It taught me how to write a good research paper without having to resort to secondary sources for my argument. I think the only weakness is that the reading load at time wasn't super manageable, and frequently I had to go to outside sources to understand the nuances of some pamphlets.",
    "This course was very strong, I enjoyed the primary documents and class discussions, and the wide variety of regions they covered. I also enjoyed the process of researching and writing the research paper, and Professor Pincus structured the assignments and papers so that the final product became much less daunting than it seemed at the beginning of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, with the warning that a basic knowledge of American Revolution history is not going to be sufficient. I would recommend taking this course after studying this time period more in depthI would recommend taking American Revolution and\/or British Empire beforehand. Other than that, this a fantastic seminar that will make you think deeply and flip your understanding of the uniqueness of the Revolution. Pincus is absolutely brilliant and does a nice job focusing on the writing process.",
    "Definitely. It was a superb course.",
    "Yes absolutely a great course if the student is looking to learn how to do a full research project.",
    "I would recommend this as a good junior seminar for a history major who wants to prepare themselves for their senior thesis.",
    "Yes, absolutely."
