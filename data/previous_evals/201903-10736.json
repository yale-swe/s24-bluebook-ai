    "I gained a lot of Chinese writing and reading ability, as I had come in with a fairly strong sense of speaking and listening ability.",
    "I learned basic Chinese in a very short amount of time. I started not knowing how to read or write Chinese at all and left knowing hundreds of characters. I grew as a Chinese speaker, writer, and reader; I was leaps and bound from where I started.",
    "I learned how to proficiently speak, write, read, and listen to Chinese.",
    "Learned how to read and write in Chinese as well as speak with greater fluency and tonal accuracy",
    "I have learned how to time manage and develop better study skills. This class had taught me over 500 characters in the mere span of a semester and it allowed me to realize the terms by which I am able to learn the best upon.",
    "I learned how to read and write several hundred Chinese words and their proper pronunciations. I also learned various sentence structures and Chinese grammar.",
    "Writing, speaking, and reading Chinese. I improved a lot!",
    "I learned how to balance the heavy daily workload into my schedule. I also made tremendous improvements in my speaking, writing, and reading ability in Chinese.",
    "In this course, I learned to improve my Chinese pronunciation and expand my writing and reading abilities.",
    "Learned pinyin, how to write characters, pronunciation, culture",
    "I learned how to read basic pinyin and hanzi, as well as how to speak and listen in Chinese.",
    "This course has been a really fun one. As someone who has always wanted to learn Chinese in an academic setting, this course has met my expectations. This has a lot to do with how the course is structured, in that it keeps the learner engaged with the content and vocabulary, yet also expects us to learn at a fast enough pace so that we feel as though we have left the course with a significant improvement in both proficiency and coherence. I have learned to be more consistent with my homework, given the way this class' homework is structured, and I think this is an incredibly valuable skill.",
    "CHNS 112 was a rigorous course that helped me to gain far greater writing and reading capabilities in Chinese."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I felt that I learned a lot in the time I had. However, as quickly as I learned it, I forgot it, as the class was very fast paced and I felt I had to use all my time to keep up with the class and did not have enough time to review older material.",
    "The class moves very quickly, but that's because it takes into account that students have some previous background with the language. It is a big time commitment, as there are tutorials (basically individual section) and it meets daily, but it is necessary in order to learn a language. It is taught very well and there are lot of resources if you want extra help.",
    "While this class does have a lot of \"busy work\", this kind of work is important in order to help develop one's intuition of a language. Overall, I think that this course is very good as is.",
    "Strengths: reviewed material very clearly, classes were engaging and fun, learned a lot of material every day, Professor also made herself very available to helping out Weaknesses: none",
    "The course was extremely amazing in learning characters and the homework always felt like it was applicable to the class. The class had taught me a lot, however, sometimes being in class the class had felt redundant and the grammar points would often be repeated.",
    "Strengths: The projects, presentations and writing assignments are fun and engaging and the class is very participatory. Weaknesses: Large class size",
    "Strength: lots of daily practice, good format with weekly TA Weakness: had 2 teachers, which led to repetition of lessons. Lots of work.",
    "Strengths: daily class structure and frequent regular quizzes forced student to really internalize and remember class material over time. Weaknesses: None.",
    "I thought that this course was amazing, and especially the heritage class included an amazing community of people.",
    "Strengths: Entertaining and committed professor :)))), interesting content Weaknesses: grade distribution, the way new vocabulary is taught It can often feel disheartening knowing that a lot of effort has to be put into work that only makes up a small percentage of our grade and doesn't even necessarily aid in improving our Chinese. Also, I think it would be far more useful if we could be taught the vocabulary prior to when we are quizzed on it. I think this would be far more useful so that we can learn the stroke order, the pinyin and even the meaning of the characters, instead of the way we are forced to simply remember and recognize the characters in preparation for the daily quizzes.",
    "The main weakness of the course was the structure in which the MWF classes would be taught by our TA every other week to effectively divide the class into two sections. This layout was ineffective as we would often review the material we learned during these classes during the larger Tuesday\/Thursday classes."

   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "I can't believe how much I learned. In a semester, I learned about as much as my friends did in four years of Chinese in high school (e.g. same amount of characters, 400). I'm so excited to continue learning Chinese at Yale.",
    "Yes, if you want to begin learning Chinese. It is a great primer for future classes, but make sure that you are willing to put in the time. Don't shy away even if you have no experience with reading or writing characters.",
    "Yes, as it is a great experience to learn Mandarin, and it is also taught in an extremely well manner.",
    "Yes! Especially good for students who are heritage but may not have grown up speaking it at home (but are familiar with Mandarin). I feel as though my speaking abilities have improved immensely, and I think even though we do go through a lot of characters a day, it is at a very fair and doable pace.",
    "Yes, this class teaches so much and the teachers are so great.",
    "Yes, it is structured to make learning very enjoyable although the pace of material is brisk.",
    "Yes, especially if this is your first time learning Chinese.",
    "Yes. For a heritage student looking to strengthen all aspects of their Chinese ability, the Chinese language classes here are second to none.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially at the heritage level. The class was such a great group of people, and the course itself was very well-taught.",
    "Yes, learned a lot of Chinese in short period of time",
    "Yes, especially if they already know Chinese but have very limited skills in working with Chinese characters, speaking, and listening.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in learning Chinese and are from a Chinese background (no matter how strong a background) but don't necessarily speak or read much, this would be great class to take!",
    "I would recommend this course to any low-level heritage speaker."
