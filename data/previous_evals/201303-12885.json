   "comments": [
    "Introduction to genetics from a graduate standpoint. It is little less biomedically focused than other classes, which I think is good.",
    "My interest does not lie greatly with genetics, but if someone wished to enter the field, I would recommend the class to give them a review.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Very helpful!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Although it has its flaws and perhaps doesn't cover the next-gen methods as well as it could, it still was a very interesting course where I felt like I learned a fair amount without being swamped by work.",
    "We can learn basic concepts in traditional and modern genetics in this course. I will recommend this course to those student with not much background in genetics, but want to know more about it.",
    "a must take for one to learn all the fun and power of genetics!",
    "Very good course to learn the basics of genetics. Would recommend to any student.",
    "great",
    "It will cover genetics topics from the 1970s on. More importantly, it will teach you to think like a geneticist. I would recommend it.",
    "No. Material isn't challenging",
    "I would recommend to another student because it covers a lot of topics that are very useful.",
    "Recommend.Really helpful for thinking and problem solving.",
    "This is a good introduction to genetics *techniques.* Some background in the subject material is required."

   "comments": [
    "Did not really apply to my research.",
    "significantly, greatly.",
    "We learned a lot of methods which will be useful for us in our own research. And we also get trained about critical thinking and how to think practically to solve a scientific problem.",
    "This course gave a good review and new understanding of genetic-based techniques. However, the problem sets were not as helpful as I wanted them to be. They required a lot of work, but I did not feel that they benefited me greatly. I would like like to have a good review of breeding schemes early in the course to set a foundation for the rest of the lectures.",
    "Yes. It definitely deepened my knowledge in Genetics.",
    "I think it contributed some to my knowledge of my discipline, especially the earlier lectures. In my undergrad I'd taken a very computationally\/next gen sequencing era slanted route to my major so I felt like I already had a better sense of many of the topics covered by the last two lecturers than I was actually given through this course, but the earlier lectures on the more hands-on, organism-based side of genetics was very useful.",
    "This course provides me with the biological backgrounds in my thesis project.",
    "great",
    "It taught me how geneticists think, and that I don't think that way. I came into the graduate program not knowing what department I should join, and I now think I should join cell bio, in part because of this course.",
    "Not at all",
    "Helped a lot in understanding science and how to solve problems."
