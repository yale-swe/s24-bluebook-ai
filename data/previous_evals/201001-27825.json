    "Bien s\u00fbr. L'experience \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s utile. Si je n'avais pas suis cette cours, je n'aurais pas pu parler fran\u00e7ais. Je ferai des erreurs, sans doute, mais je pense que cette cours m'a donn\u00e9 un excellente fondement de parler fran\u00e7ais.",
    "Personally, I could have taken only a semester of the language I took in highschool but I really wanted to learn a spoken language especially french. For that reason the work load didn't bother me. You'll probably hear how french is the hardest L1\/L2 language to take but if you do the work I am pretty sure you'll do well in the class. I would definitely recommend it. The French in Action method is fun and allows you to get to know your classmates. Out all my classes I felt more close to the students in my french class.",
    "French 120 is a lot of work, with a quiz and test every week, and compositions due every week as well. I would recommend the course only if the student truly wants to learn French, otherwise all of the work might not seem worth it."
