    "Cell Biology was a demanding course. The lectures are fairly boring and dry, the textbook is dense, and the quizzes are intense. Nevertheless, Professor Pollard's notes\/handouts are incredibly helpful.This is a good class if you are looking for a VERY in depth look at cellular processes. Be prepared for a lot of memorization and a lot of things that you simply won't understand until three weeks later. The class may be confusing, but stick to Pollard's notes and the diagrams from the textbook. Don't attempt to read it. It will just be a waste of time.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. I took AP bio, and was stuck between this and bio 200. As a bio major and premed, I decided to take this class, andI am happy I did.You learn a LOT of material at a VERY fast pace, but by the end, when you can say you know the whole 40something chapter textbook, you realize how worth it this class was.The weekly quizes seem scary at 1st, but after one or two, you notice a pattern to them, learn how to study, and realize 3 of 12 are dropped, and they become pretty lax and doable.Overall, my favorite course yet. If you like bio, or feel like you want to truly learn a lot, take it.",
    "Take the course because you really do learn a lot of information. Make sure to devote a lot of time to the course though.",
    "An in depth look at a lot of cellular components and processes. This is the best bio class ive taken here and id definitely recommend it requires some pretty heavy studying for the quizes but is pretty managable and you learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this class for students whoare interested in biology and at the beginning of their science requirements. This was the last class that I needed to take and I found it to be fairly boring and memorization-based when compared to upper level science classes. However, I think it is, for the most part, well taught and informative for someone who hasn't seen most of the information before. Any complaints that I have about this course are entirely my own fault.",
    "Plenty of work, plenty to learn. You know what you're getting into, but the payoff is phenomenal.",
    "Not for non-majors.",
    "Yes, just keep of with the reading and know the lecture notes really well and you'll do fine. The class is really rewarding.",
    "Take it\u0097you probably have to. But be ready for hardcore studying.",
    "MCDB 205 is a great semi-advanced course. It covers a lot of material, but by the end you really feel you have learned a lot of cell bio and that you start to understand what is happening in the cellular world around you. No more living in ignorance. Prof. Pollard is fantastic at making the material interesting and easy to understand, so I highly recommend taking this course.",
    "I would recommend the course to students who love Biology as I do. Without this love, the workload can be a little much.",
    "lot of reading but you learn a lot",
    "Take it if you're pre-med. Otherwise, the amount of work and stress of weekly quizzes isn't worth it.",
    "Very hard but very worth-while",
    "9 am lecture sucks, but powerpoints, and sometimes audio, is posted. Material can be very interesting (presenting some very cool experiments and techniques) or very dry (such as going over 20 types of membrane channels). Lots of stuff to memorize however you are mostly tested on conceptual stuff.Quiz format is very easy: look over the notes and understand the powerpoint slides every monday night.",
    "Cell Bio was wonderful!I love the topic, how it was presented, and I even feel like a have a strong grasp on biology in general after taking this class.My favorite part of the class is the number of resources we have.Lectures, lecture slides, the book (which correlates quite well), handouts, and sections (which I think were used quite well). If you put the time and effort into it, you can definitely learn SO MUCH.The quizzes take some getting used to, and they're usually methods-based. But it's not too hard to get a knack for them.",
    "It is a comprehensive look at cellular activity and function. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know how our bodies work at the cellular level. It is a very challenging course, and if you do not put the proper amount of work into it(including going to lecture, taking good notes, doing the readings, and studying for the weekly quizzes) you will not do well and also will most likely not get anything out of it. Doing the work is hard, but now that the class is over I am really grateful for everything that I learned. There is so much information, and a lot of it is really applicable to modern health issues.",
    "This class is really interesting. I am not pre-med or a bio major--I took the class just for fun--and I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you do the reading and go to lecture you will learn an immense amount of information. The grading is harsh just because the class is competitive, but everything isvery straightforward--nothing tricky.",
    "This class is a ton of memorization and honestly I didn\u0092t find it as interesting or fascinating as some other people. I didn\u0092t see what was so great about it. I\u0092m pretty sure the curve is pretty annoying with all of the premeds in the class and it was definitely not as cool as biochemistry.In guess the class is ok.",
    "Yes. This is a difficult class. You will spend a very long time studying for each quiz (for me, 10+ hours a week). It does get easier as the class goes on. And when the final comes around, it is really nice that you had weekly quizzes! The class is very manageable, especially if you don't have any other REALLY difficult classes (ex: Orgo) at the same time. The final is fair. You will be surprised at how much you learned. The material is pretty interesting, but it's hard to pay attention at 9am. I would choose this class again over Developmental Bio to fulfill major requirements because I learned so much.",
    "I took this course in my freshman year having only AP\/IB Biology as my background. I would say that if you are willing to put in the work and effort, AP Biology is enough of a background - you do not have to take MCDB 200 first.MCDB 205 is an extremely rigorous course which covers a lot of material in a short time period. The weekly 10 minute quizzes are a pain but a good thing when it comes to learning the material. Cramming is nearly impossible in this course. Make sure you keep up with the lectures. If you do everything they tell you to do to learn the material, you will do great in this course. That being said, I barely used the textbook and based my studying on the provided lecture notes and was fine. I would highly recommend forming a study group with friends to go over the material.The quizzes are pretty difficult. Knowing the material is not always enough. You have to be able to propose experiments\/ways to to test a hypothesis, determine the effects of a mutation, etc. DON'T FREAK OUT if you do badly on the first few quizzes. I can't stress this enough. You will get the hang of how to attack them as the course progresses. Also, you get to drop 3 quizzes which is great.The final was basically 7 quizzes stapled together.Overall I found the course to be extremely rewarding. You come out of it feeling that you have learned a lot. The material was very interesting and the lectures were great. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "The class is interesting, but a lot of material. It wouldn't be interesting to someone who liked EEB type stuff; I'd really only recommend to those who have interest in cells. Although the quizzes can be tough, they are helpful for breaking down material into chunks. Studying for the exam is also easier because of the quizzes. The grades in the class are pretty high (it is a bunch of really hard working premeds) and I'm not actually sure about the curve. It's good to take freshman year before you take orgo because it's something you'll want to make a priority during exam week.",
    "Great class, comprehensive view of biologyLectures were a bit too detailed for them to be of practical use",
    "This is a great class if you are interested in how life works at the cellular level. Even if the lectures are a bit dry at times, you come out of it knowing so much! The textbook is a nice supplement, but you don't really need to do all the readings if you pay attention in lecture and have a good TA. I'd recommend it!",
    "Overall great class. The weekly quizzes are very doable and do not require hours and hours of study. However, the final is semi-detail oriented, so start studying early. You learn a lot of information but all the processes tie together and it is really cool.",
    "I heard a lot of great things about cell bio coming into it, but honestly, I didn't like this class as much as I thought I would. I felt like there was a premium placed on cramming as much information in as possible over learning things well. Yes, I did learn a lot. However, this class didn't inspire a love of science in me like other classes how, and it didn't make me marvel at the world (which to me, is much of the appeal of science). The quizzes were stressful to prepare for at first, and monotonous by the end. Also, Professor Crews was the only truly superb professor, but he only taught 6 lectures. Pollard was very knowledgeable, but a dry lecturer. Horsley was just not good at explaining things well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you have the time to put into it. There is a lot of reading and a lot of studying involved but if you are willing to do it then it can be very rewarding.",
    "Yes, take this class. You will learn cell biology which is a good thing. Do not take MCDB 200 because you will look ridiculous. There's really no need to do the huge amounts of dense reading, though--just go to class (if you can), study the handouts, and GO TO SECTION. ESPECIALLY IF YOU CAN GET ANDREA STAVOE.",
    "This class provided a good overview of cell biology. The lectures, were fast-paced, covering a huge amount of material in a short amount of time.",
    "Certainly one of the most demanding classes you will take at Yale, but if you really push through it and work hard, you will be rewarded SO MUCH. I was a bit scared about taking this class as a freshman, but I am so so so glad I did. Not only did I learn a huge amount about cell biology, but the course also created an interest in me for science in general. Now I'm watching science podcasts and reading research papers on my own, and I really love it because this class definitely gave me the background to actually understand most of the stuff that's going on.Also, I promise this class is not just rote memorization. The quiz questions alone teach you to think like a researcher. As opposed to AP Bio where it was simply draw this structure or explain this mechanism. Cell Bio puts you in the shoes of a researcher and asks you to create drugs or to predict the effects of certain mutations and hypothesize about how you would fix them. I hate memorizing things, and I loved this class because, as the syllabus says, learning in this course is about immersion, not memorization.Also, a note about AP Bio -- you can totally take this class if you did well in AP Bio. Don't worry about having to take Molecular Bio (MCDB 200) beforehand (plus I heard that class is pretty bad anyway). I hadn't touched bio since AP Bio in junior year and I didn't feel disadvantaged at all in this class.A last thing to note is that this is not your average intro course -- many of the people in the class are Bio majors or ambitious pre-meds, but DON'T LET THAT SCARE YOU (especially because you may be at least one of those two anyway). You are perfectly capable of doing well in this class, I promise.",
    "Cell Bio was a pretty great class in that we learned a lot in a very structured and well-organized manner. The amount of cell bio knowledge out there is overwhelming, but I think that Pollard has managed to extract most of the most useful and relevant stuff to leave us with a very good understanding of how cells operate (we covered pumps\/channels, chromosomes\/nucleus, receptors\/signal transduction, actin\/microtubules, motor proteins, adhesion proteins and the ECM, the cell cycle, etc...). The weekly quizzes can be a grind, but I think it's better than having massive midterms. And hey, the final wasn't that bad! Take this class. It's hard but not too hard, and you learn a ton of stuff that you will find incredibly useful in virtually every other area of biology.",
    "Definitely an overrated class. However, you do learn a lot, like everyone says. Keep in mind that the quiz averages are so ridiculously high. However, I actually would not say that this necessarily means you have to work really hard every time because the quizzes are also kinda unpredictable in terms of difficulty. Some times I would spend the entire week studying for hours and hours and get a 7 or 8 out of 10. Other weeks, I would only glance at the lecture handouts 2 hours before class, and get a perfect score. It depends on the professor and you're level of interest in the specific material I guess.",
    "I highly recommend this class to all students regardless of their major. The weekly quizzes really keep you on your toes but make the class easier because rather than cramming for 2 or 3 tests, the information is learned weekly and very well.",
    "If you have to take it, take it. Otherwise, do not, unless you have a fiery passion for cellular structure and function.",
    "If you don't have to, this would depend on your own preference. I like Orgo 2 A LOT BETTER, and this says something. This class is a lot of memorizations, seriously. Though it's logical memorization, that means it is not historical fact kind of memorization.",
    "If you have taken a Biology at Yale previous to this course I would not hesitate to recommend taking this course. The material is fascinating and the professors are wonderful. However, keep in mind that the pace is rapid and there are weekly quizzes. Also, if you do not like the material presented during reading week\/the first month or two of the course I would drop it. If you do not like the material, you will hate the course regardless of if you can handle it.If you have never taken a Biology at Yale previous to this course I do hesitate to recommend taking this course. The pace is rapid and there is very little recapping for stragglers. Everything is new and nothing was comparable to AP Biology (the last Biology I took) until the extracellular matrix. The course is very challenging and you will work\/study the hardest you ever have just to keep up. With that said, if you like the material do not be put off by low quiz scores at first. Get a tutor (mine was amazing!), talk to Professor Pollard, and push through. You will be happy that you did because you will learn so much and it will help in every Biology course for then on. I promise it is worth it.",
    "Very fast-paced and a lot of material. You'll be stressed every Monday night cramming for the Tuesday exams, but by the end of the semester, you'll realize you've learned A LOT about cell biology. Don't take this with other work-intensive classes though (i.e., Orgo or ENGL120), or your grades will suffer.",
    "Has an intimidating reputation, but if you read the text occasionally, pay attention in lecture, and study from the packets, you'll be fine.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in pursuing thorough scientific research as an undergraduate, or anyone generally interested in the subject matter. It is a lot of work and studying but you come away learning a lot.",
    "The course deluded me with information and forced me to pick out general principles. I did learn lots, but I wonder if it had to have been that difficult!The strength of the course was its requirement of weekly quizzes, which forced me to keep up with material.The weakness was that the lectures were early in the morning and presented information fast and in a way that did not necessarily explain how information related to each other.",
    "Cell Bio is a ton of work. More than any other class I've taken including orgo. How well you do all depends on how much work you put in, and how well you do on the quiz format. If you like bio you should take this class. If you're just looking for an interesting science class, you could save yourself a lot of studying and take something else.",
    "The class is a LOT of work, and it's easy to become complacent about the weekly quizzes (you keep thinking, \"oh, THIS is the one I'll drop\"). Some of the lectures got boring, but overall the lectures were better than in other science courses I've taken. I think the material itself was really fascinating though, which is what ultimately makes this a course worth taking.",
    "This course is a lot of work, but you learn so much interesting material. The weekly quizzes make sure that you stay on top of everything, and the final was also fairly manageable. This class was not nearly as bad as some of the stories I've heard about it. Definitely recommend taking it.",
    "Cell Biology is not an easy course, but it is not necessarily a difficult course either. The difficulty lies in the amount of material that the course covers, but the interesting professors and weekly quizzes help keep you on top of it all. I thoroughly enjoyed this class, so I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Personally, I did not enjoy this class. The weekly Tuesday quizzes were painful and most of the other students were overeager freshmen who weren't taking other hard science classes simultaneously, so the averages were always pretty high. You get to drop 3 quiz grades, but figure out early on what the quiz questions are like, or else you'll suffer. Reading is a waste of time - just study from the handouts.You learn a lot about the cell though, so if that's something you're interested in, then you'll probably enjoy the course.",
    "This is a very hard course. The amount of information you learn is vast. If you keep up with the reading and lectures, you will find that you have learned a lot by the time the final is over. But the semester is no easy task - one quiz every week covers two lectures (4-6 chapters in the textbook), and the quizzes count for 60% of your grade. The final is the other 40%. Take this course with caution - you will learn, but it will be grueling and I'm not sure if the knowledge I gained at the end was practically useful, or just drowning in useless details.",
    "This course covers a ton of information in a semester: an entire biology textbook. As a result, you'll have to put in a ton of time to actually learn the information for the long-run. The course is structured such that you take weekly quizzes instead of mid-terms, which is good so that you're forced to keep up with the course and can't fall horribly behind. I wasn't a big fan of having three different professors though; Horsely and Crews are great lecturers, but Pollard isn't the best. This made the course feel a little disjointed. Overall, it's an ok course, but you need to put in the time to get anything out of it. I'd really only take it if you absolutely have to, or intend to truly devote yourself to it.",
    "If you are interested in Biology I would definitely recommend this class. The lectures are okay but the material is very interesting and it is given to you in a vary organized fashion. This is probably the most organized class I have ever taken. There is a lot to memorize and there are 12 weakly quizzes (3 get dropped) and a final. Pollard is a great guy but he can be hard to hear. Horsley is an okay lecturer but Crews was amazing. If you take this class I suggest you form a study group to go through and process all the material that needs to be memorized. The quizes don't just ask you to regurgitate information they ask you to apply your knowledge in order to think of solutions to problems. After taking this class I feel like I know an incredible amount of information about the cell.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Undoubtedly it is an immense amount of work, but the material is so interesting that I did not mind it. The lecture notes are sufficient preparation for all the quizes and reading the book is useful if you have a deep interest in the material. I found reading the book enjoyable but not necessarily more helpful than the lecture notes for the quizes.If you form a study group and go over all the discussion questions and general material before the quizes, you should be fine.The class starts out a bit more difficult because you do not know the style of the questions yet. Always pay attention to experimental strategies and evolutionary origins. Many of the quiz questions will ask you to design an experiment or hypothesize about evolutionary relationships. Lastly, go over the practice final questions you are given at the beginning. Those are the main concepts tested in the class and if you find a question related to the section quizzed, it is highly likely that a similar question will show up on the quiz.",
    "take it if you have to... I took it because I needed it for MCDB, and also because it's good for pre-med. But there's so much information, the weekly quizzes are annoying (although not extremely difficult), and the final was impossible.",
    "This was a truly great class. The material is absolutely fascinating, and, although the quizzes are a pain to study for, they ensure that you will learn SO MUCH. A must-take for anyone with a serious interest in biology. (Only one caveat - the final sucked: I studied really hard, but the questions were totally random\/bizarre. I still think the class was more than worth it).",
    "Definitely take this class. It is a TON of work, but it is completely worth it. Extremely rewarding. Good Luck.",
    "You will definitely learn a lot in MCDB 205, so it's best to keep up with the workload.",
    "Overall, I definitely enjoyed this course. The course covers exactly what its name suggests, but it will do so at a very fast pace. If the first two weeks of classes during shopping period are intimidating, the course will get easier, and you will figure out ways to manage the workload. There is a quiz every week, and while the quizzes are often difficult, you drop 3 out of the 12 quizzes you take. During the semester, I hated this course (Monday nights were rough), but after having taken the final, I can say I feel very accomplished. When the pieces all come together when you review for the final, it is very rewarding.",
    "Cell Biology is a fast-paced thorough and detailed course encompassing all essential cellular biologial principles. It is no joke. but at the same time, if you come in with the right mindset, it can also be incredibly fun and interesting. you have to be curious and want to learn. It takes a while to find the right studying style. everyone is different. for me, the best way was to read the packets and then read the textbook for any sections that weren't clear int he packets. you should definitely read the textbook now and then, even though its difficult to read because it will help develop your science reading skills. Try to come fresh and alert every morning and you will learn a lot from lecture. Everyone says this course is incredibly time-consuming but by the end, I realized, You don't have to put a lot of time into the course if you do everything the right way. for instance, get up early and remain alert and animated for each lecture. Go to section with a purpose and make sure to already read the packet before you go. Finally, study the main concepts rather than little details because that is waht is mainly tested. Test yourself by answering the objective questions at the beginning of each packet. Don't be afraid to take this class with another difficult class such as organic chemistry. It will be a difficult semester but you will make it through. I certainly did. I would recommend this course, but make sure you are up to the task starting on day one. Believe in yourself and make light-hearted jokes about this course to your friends and you will have a lot of fun.",
    "Take it if your a bio major or have an interest in studying medicine.",
    "Cell bio is great! You learn so much information and it lays the foundation for many other bio courses. Just study the handouts they give you and go to class and section.",
    "awesome class, definitely take it even though it's a lot of work",
    "Its a very good course and I would definitely recommend it! Its a lot of work but very fun and the amount you learn is astonishing!",
    "In general this class is fine. Sure it sucks to have quizzes every Tuesday morning at 9, but in the end you'll realize how much it would have sucked to have 3 massive midterms instead. Overall I would still recommend this class toanyone interested because you realize in the end that you did learn a ton of really useful information. Seriously, don't be daunted by the quizzes every Tuesday, it's completely manageable.",
    "This course was definitely the most demanding of all my classes this semester. It's a comprehensive intro course to the biology of cells, but you cover a ton of material at a fairly fast pace, and you can't afford to fall behind or you're never going to catch up. It's intense, but it forces you to really learn the material since you have weekly quizzes in lieu of midterms. The quizzes require you to really understand the concepts since they're not direct questions most of the time. It's a good course, well-taught, and I can't deny I learned a lot. It's worth taking, but be prepared to put in the work because it's definitely not easy and it's not just rote memorization.",
    "You learn an incredible amount of information about the cell. The process is work-intensive but surprisingly enjoyable. Weekly quiz format is actually helpful.",
    "It's a pretty tough bio course, but it's not overwhelming, even with the weekly quizzes. To quote Pollard, you dont need to know everything but you do need to know something. I would recommend this over Developmental Bio.",
    "This is a wonderful class! You may hear people complaining about it from time to time because it eats a fair bit of time, but that work is completely repaid in the sheer quantity that you learn. Each Tuesday, you will have a quiz over two lectures. It helps to space out your studying and form a group to go over discussion questions (so, so much.)The strategy of the course is to learn about \"hardware\" first--the macromolecules at play in each process and the actual components of the system--and then you see how everything works together physiologically. It's all very well-thought-out, and you will learn TONS by the end.",
    "Very hard but rewarding course. It's tough but if you stick with it you won't be disappointed by the results.",
    "If you plan to major in biology or follow a pre-medical track I recommend that the student take this course. It is an excellent overview of biology that all biology majors and pre-medical students should know. If you are not a science major, I suggest you take an easier course than this one.",
    "There is a lot of info to learn but most of the test and quiz questions require you to apply your knowledge and tests your ability to think outside the box to solving a problem or explaining a mechanism that would explain a disease. So although you don't have to memorize and know every detail because there the questions aren't based off of memory, you still have to know how mechanisms and processes work pretty well.",
    "It's a solid course on cell biology that will cover a lot of material throughout the semester. Fortunately, though, there are weekly quizzes, so you're forced to study in chunks, which is actually very helpful. They also drop your lowest three quiz grades, which is also nice although everyone seems to do pretty well, so I don't know what that'll mean in terms of the curve. Chances are that if you're taking this class, you have to, but it's certainly manageable and you'll at least come out with general knowledge of many cell bio topics."
