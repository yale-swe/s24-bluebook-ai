    "The group theory is a very interesting and useful class especially for students who study physics. I would strongly recommend it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. The workload is very low, and the class is very helpful for courses like QFT.",
    "I would say that it is a course that you can learn a lot from but you have to be willing to put in the work. You can probably do okay in the class without learning much but Professor Iachello will help you learn a lot if you are willing to put in the effort"

    "Group theory is useful in many physics fields. Although I'm not a theorist, learning group theory definitely helps me understand physics more deeply. It provides a \"higher\" angle of view to better understand many physical problems.",
    "This course gave me the foundations for my future work in theoretical or experimental particle physics."
