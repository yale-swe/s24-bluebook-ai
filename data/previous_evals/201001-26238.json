    "Strengths: 1) thorough survey of hospital epidemiology 2) excellent expert speakers 3) useful homework assignmentsWeaknesses: 1) some redundancy in lecture material 2) language can get overly technical at times",
    "Overall, I really enjoyed this class. I felt that the content flowed in a logic way and that the guest speakers were a valuable component of the class. It would have been nice to incorporate more of the readings from homework into class discussions or review by the instructor during class to reiterate the themes from the readings. I also would have enjoyed more small group in-class discussions because I think that served as a good forum for learning how to work through case studies. In the one situation where we did this, it worked very well. One other topic of the class that might serve as interesting to the students would be on how healthcare professionals deal with infection control in the third world. This would be interesting given that many students are interested in global health issues.",
    "the lessons were well organized and the information was very comprehensive. the guest lecturers also brought an interesting perspective to the course.",
    "I think that this was a great course. In particular, it was very important to be taught by an actual practitioner in the field. The readings were all relevant and useful. Even for items which made logical sense, the readings were still insightful."

    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Dr. Dembry was a great teacher both in and outside of the classroom. She went out of her way to make the class-room topics as interesting and relevant as possible.No weaknesses to report.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0I really enjoyed having this instructor this semester. Dr. Dembry was a very good lecturer and very amenable to structuring the class around the interests of the students. She graded fairly and required a reasonable amount of work from the students.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0The instructor was fantastic. She was incredibly versed and experienced in the subject.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0I think Dr. Dembry did a great job. Importantly, she was a no-nonsense professor in that if someone said something that was incorrect, she corrected them (nicely of course) such that the class would not suffer from misinformation. I think a lot of professors are hesitant to do that in fear of offending students, but it is of critical importance to the learning process."

    "I would definitely recommend the course to others. It was challenging, but extremely rewarding and informative.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as an overview of the issue and topics that concern an institution-based epidemiologist."
