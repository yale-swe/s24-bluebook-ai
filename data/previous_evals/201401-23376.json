    "This was a fantastic course. My favorite course at Yale. It was truly such a great and well thought out syllabus full of exciting texts that provided both original sources of the theory and supporting material to understand difficult concepts. The level of discussion brought forth by the graduate and undergraduate students was of the highest caliber I have encountered during my time here. Truly a treat.",
    "Lit 480 is a detailed introduction to the literary and clinical theory of psychoanalysis. It is ideal for Literature and Psychology majors, but I would recommend it to all students, regardless of major. This course is a true gem, and no student should miss it!",
    "LITR 480 is an EXPERIENCE. Psychoanalysis is hardly taught at Yale, despite its enormous and formative influence on psychology and many of our current attitudes towards the human mind. While the class is formally about Psychoanalysis \"In Lit and Film\", the focus of the course is actually on understanding Psychoanalysis in the first place (with an emphasis on Freudian and Lacanian texts, albeit sprinkled liberally with other important thinkers), with Lit and Film coming in rather as an added element (mostly as the subject of the midterm and final papers, but also with Thursday film screenings). The class composition is interesting, the most interesting and committed group of students I've had in any class at Yale: the normal undergraduate population being supplemented by grad students from the School of Art, the Classics department, and of course Comparative Literature. There is, of course, a lot of reading, but much of it is optional, eminently manageable, and it is all interesting. Though discussion formally ends after the allotted length (2 hours), and many people do leave at that time as usual, Professor Fradinger invariably stayed much later in order to talk with interested students. Two final points: Professor Fradinger is incredible, helpful, and knowledgeable, and can only be compared to a handful of other excellent professors I've met at Yale. Lastly, a note on the content itself: it is difficult or impossible to come out of this course without having been provoked into a deeper and more probing consideration of human behavior and problems of the mind. Whether you agree with many psychoanalytic hypotheses or not - though the course will provide you with compelling evidence - you will leave it with many more questions about the sources and motivations of behavior, and about many of the things we, in polite conversation, pass off as \"accidents\", or accept without explanation or investigation. Highly recommend.",
    "In a word: yes. This is a really excellent course. You will read a LOT of psychoanalysis (Freud for the first half, Lacan and commentators for most of the second), so be certain that's something you're interested in. But if you are, Moira is wonderful, brilliant, and dedicated. You'll learn a lot if you put in the work to understand the readings (which sometimes comes only partially and through class discussion; that's okay, psychoanalytic thought is not easy).",
    "Moira is a blessing in the form of a professor. Take this class if only to learn from the way she speaks about ideas. Take this class to see how a professor can at once genuine care for each of her students while maintaining a high academic standard for their work. Take this class to pick up a vocabulary that you'll utilize in your daily reflections. Take this class for the possibility of the amazing group of people you'll meet, the late night 5-hour long sessions in which you might exhaust yourself, the love you'll feel when it all comes to an end. Absolutely, absolutely, wholeheartedly, a thousand times I recommend this class."
