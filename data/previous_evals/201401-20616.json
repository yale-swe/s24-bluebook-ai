    "You learn through your own work. I felt like I didn't learn much from the actual class but more from the projects that we did outside of class. I didn't really like the class while I was in it but I'm glad I took it. I felt like I learned a lot about development of communities and the logistical things and people you need to talk to to make a project successful.",
    "Study of the City touches on really interesting issues, and takes a middle course in the discussion about urban issues such as Urban Renewal, New Urbanism, etc., making the material open to all. The games played are quite interesting, though strange, and different from the rest of Yale College. Professor Garvin is devoted to the class, and quick to answer emails, and gives you detailed feedback about your performance\u2014just with no actual grades, ever. Though he can go into autopilot sometimes, and refer you to his book, he is quite knowledgeable about urbanism, and is eager to connect you professionally if you so desire. Take this class either as introductory or in continuation with your urban studies curriculum\u2014you'll definitely get plenty out of it.",
    "If you are interested in urban studies, TAKE THIS CLASS. It is the only course with comprehensive real estate, public policy, and design components.",
    "If he\/she is interested in econ, then yes. If not, then absolutely not",
    "This class can be what you make of it. If you devote yourself to the \"games,\" which are basically simulations of real life situations, you will spend a lot of time on this class and learn a lot. Many aspects of the class were unclear, such as deadlines and grading, but this could be viewed as a weakness or a strength to some.",
    "The course was, overall, very enjoyable. It looks at \"the city\" through the lens of real estate, which is an approach that I've not seen used in other classes. It's a great fusion of American Studies and Architecture -- the main book is Garvin's own, but I found the readings pretty fascinating. The games are a lot of work at the last minute but I thought they were a great way to get to know other people in the class. Highly recommend it if it stays a seminar!",
    "This class is basically a few discussions strung together by four \"games.\" The games are role-playing games where the entire class is assigned characters and have to act, usually putting together proposals and then coming together in a class discussion. A few people got really into them, but most of the class was not at all and so they really just felt like a waste of time. However, if you can make it through the games, there isn't a lot of work outside of them. But because of that your grade depends on almost nothing.",
    "Take it! It's different than any class you'll take at Yale. Garvin is great--he's both world-famous and a good teacher, a rarity at Yale! Plus, he's eager to get to know everyone. He even takes sections of the class at a time out for a meal around midterms solely because he wants to know about you and your goals. Almost all of the work in the class is for the \"games\", in which you simulate a development in a city (e.g. developing a shopping center). It's very interactive and effective, and you learn a lot. And it isn't overwhelming: in the couple of days leading up to the game, you'll spend a lot of time on it, but most of that time is communicating with the other players so it is a lot less time consuming than studying for a midterm. What's also great about this class is it really facilitates friendships. You grow really close to everyone else in the class and bond with each other. Side note: You DON'T have to be an architecture major to take this class. I'm an Econ major with zero background in planning, architecture, or urban studies, and I did just fine."
