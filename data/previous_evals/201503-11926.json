   "comments": [
    "TAKE IT! If the student interest was anything like this semester, the class will be packed during shopping week, but stick it out, it's worth it!",
    "It's a fair amount of reading (a book a week) but the works are fun and interesting enough. Just be aware that this is not all Hunger Games type of dystopia.",
    "A great place to analyze the tropes in YA fiction as well as the structure of the works, which are very different than the classic English class. We also had the opportunity to do a creative assignment and a lit analysis on our own writing the way we might analyze a novel or a poem.",
    "If at all possible, you MUST take this course.",
    "Yes definitely, the readings are a ton of fun and it's cool to revisit the stuff you read as a teenager with a critical eye. Just be prepared for some great class discussions but also some frustrating class discussions",
    "YA is a fun, easy seminar. You'll read a lot of books you haven't read before (even though most people in the class had read their fair share of YA--Prof. Richards picks YA you likely haven't heard of). You certainly won't be at a disadvantage if you haven't read a ton of YA, and you won't have much of an advantage if you have. Though you don't get much time for each book, the books are simple enough that you won't feel like you're shortchanging them. Professor Richards is absolutely amazing and you should try to take a class with her! My only complaint about the class is I don't think I got much out of the readings. YA is a pretty shallow genre, rife with cliches. Taking this class was very interesting and rewarding in a lot of ways, but don't expect YA novels to suddenly start blowing your head off with their genius.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a student, especially to an English major looking to fill their American Lit or Junior Seminar requirement. The readings were a joy, Professor Richards is brilliant, and the discussions often went places I didn't expect. The only thing I would say is that we started focusing on theory toward the end of the course, and despite being a Junior English major, I felt like a lot of what we were learning was going over my head. Other than that though, thought it was a great class!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! It was really fun to read and think about YA novels more critically, and Professor Richards is great.",
    "A great class. If you're interested in social issues in America, Young Adult fiction, or literary theory, take this class!",
    "\"The Young Adult Dystopian Novel\" is a great course. During class, the discussion is fun and engaging, and the papers required are challenging but always interesting. Judging by the title you would think it only deals with new and not-so-great books, but the course explores the different definitions of dystopia, taking novels from different time periods and comparing them. I would definitely recommend this course, especially if you're aware of the huge influence teen lit has nowadays.",
    "This class is awesome. If you're interested in societal representations of adolescence and how they affect literature, you should definitely take it. Professor Richards is an incredible teacher. She's really smart, thoughtful, and engaged, especially given that YA literature is often dismissed as less valid than other kinds of literature. The class has a great mix of literature, sociology, and literary theory, so that the discussions are almost always interesting and balanced. 10\/10 would recommend"
