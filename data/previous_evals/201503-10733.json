   "comments": [
    "This class provides a great reading list for future projects in Latin American anthropology\/history.",
    "I would summarize the course as a \"Review of the biographies and works of 20th century anthropologists.\" I would of course recommend this to other students. This is the first time I took a class like this, and it offered me new insights on how to conduct research and engage with the discipline (or across-disciplines).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It provided an excellent and diverse understanding of important scholarship in Latin American anthropology during the 20th century while highlighting key themes that still largely affect academia today in Mexico and Peru.",
    "I would recommend this to any student studying cultural history, history, or anthropology in Latin America. The instructors are very accommodating and will tweak the class to your specific interests. However, if you are not ready to read large amounts of material in Spanish this class is not for you."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "As someone coming from another discipline, it deepened my knowledge of anthropology immensely.",
    "Before this class, I often did not engage with writings before the 1980s. This is often due to their availability on-line. It is through this course that I have been enchanted by early authors of anthropology not just the ones in this class, but also those studying in my area during the early 1900s. By reading these works, I have gained insights on research methodologies; I have read of old ideas that can become fresh; and I have been granted the opportunity to engage with scholarship in other areas that I would not have been able to otherwise.",
    "This course left me with a very valuable understanding of the 20th century history of archaeology in the region that I am most interested in academically. As such, it has contributed in a very positive way to my research by giving me a broader base of knowledge, a better understanding of the origins of key concepts and research agendas, and a view to how the discipline of archaeology in these regions is still following the paths first forged by these early scholars."
