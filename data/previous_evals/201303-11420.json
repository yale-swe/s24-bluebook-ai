    "TAKE IT!",
    "Yes, great Econ elective",
    "you're going to be spending a lot of time learning about things that you probably don't care about in a lot of ways, like division of labor in agrarian england during the 18th century. i ended up loving it. i think you will too",
    "Professor Guinnane is extremely knowledgable and patient.",
    "Take it!",
    "Yes!",
    "One of the best professors at Yale.",
    "I took this class credit\/d as a non major and I don't regret taking it. It doesn't have a huge amount of work, but sometimes the grading can be a little fiddly, so start it off credit\/d and see how you're going. The material is interesting and the professor is genuinely dedicated and enthusiastic about teaching. The problem sets were generally easy but you have to make sure that your explanations are good (rather than simply satisfactory). The papers were sometimes a little esoteric but I really enjoyed writing my last one. I think that the class would have clicked better with my strengths had it been a little more quantitative (it's very qualitative) but it was a pretty refreshing course to take. Overall, I'd recommend it if you're interested in economics, are looking for a class that doesn't involve a lot of math and has a great professor and a dedicated TA.",
    "Though there are a lot of rules in this class, they're all reasonable. The material isn't the most interesting, but Professor Guinnane is one of the best lecturers I've ever had. This is one of those classes where the professor makes the material better (unlike so many other Yale classes where it's the other way around). The workload is pretty evenly spread out: there's rarely a week where there isn't something to do for the class, but there's never a time when you're buried in this class' work.",
    "This was a fine course. I took it on a whim because I thought Professor Guinnane was engaging during shopping period and he remained so throughout the course. With that said, the topic is not particularly interesting and there seemed to be an inordinate amount of assignments (4 psets, 3 papers, a midterm and a final).",
    "As the courses title implies, Economics 186 is at the intersection of history and economics, although more emphasis is placed on economics. It's not your traditional economics class where you will go through a bunch of dry models though; instead, you focus on explaining historical events through economic models we've been introduced to in intro classes. The workload is manageable (variation of readings, problem sets, and short papers), and the exams are fair if you've been keeping up with assigned work in the course. Professor Guinnane's classes are some of my favorite in all of Yale because they really make you better at writing succinctly about technical topics and force you to think critically when applying economic models to real life. I highly recommend taking this class because you get a lot out of it and it's very interesting.",
    "It's the same ECON 187, except this class is focused on pre-industrialized Europe and Britain during the Industrialization. Professor Guinnane is very much a no-nonsense professor and it's definitely a class worth taking if you are interested in the subject. Though compared with ECON 187 a year ago, I'm somewhat disappointed with the readings assigned. I felt that they didn't really provide that much more information than the lectures.",
    "Interesting course. Unsure how I feel about the professor - he's sort of abrasive and takes attendance in lectures. Course is three papers, midterm, final, and homework. Later grades can cancel out earlier ones if you do better, which is nice. Tests were sort of hard - be careful on the IDs, they're REALLY obscure.",
    "A wonderful class for anyone interested in econ. Guinnane makes you see how those theoretical graphs can apply to real situations, which puts the meaning into otherwise boring econ!",
    "Yes. To anyone.",
    "Absolutely take it! Quite a few assignments (papers and psets), but the professor is an expert in the field and really passionate! You will learn a lot about both economics and history, a lot of stuff that will guide your thinking!",
    "Timmy G is the man. Very entertaining lecturer, cares deeply about teaching, and does it well. Three short papers (3-5 pages each), a midterm, and a final. Attendance is mandatory, but you wouldn't want to skip the lectures anyways.",
    "One of the best econ classes available at Yale. You get to apply economic concepts to actual history, which is so rare in theory-heavy classes that usually don't even use much academic research. Professor Guinnane is the best. He genuinely cares for his students and loves it when you come to his office hours. He likes to joke a lot, but he always means well. Just em laugh. Never be late to class, or he will glare you down likes no other. Easy grading , not much work, crystal clear lectures, and interesting material! Tf amanda was super approachable and knowledgeable.",
    "I took this class only because no other good economics classes were being offered in the semester and I needed an economics credit. I thought the class wouldn't be to my taste. But I shopped it anyway and really liked Prof. Guinnane's teaching style. His lectures were consistently good and so I decided to stick with it. I am glad I did. For one, I learnt that I was wrong about the class not being to my taste, for another, I finally found an economics class where not everything was black and white. This class wasn't about answering questions, it was about studying questions to learn why the questions themselves were wrong. It was a very good exercise.",
    "I would definitely take this course. It is a great elective for the economics major. You are going to have to go to class, but Guinnane will make it worth your while. You will want to learn about crop rotations and bills of credit because he will make them interesting.",
    "So here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the deal. The class involves a good mix of skills \u00e2\u0080\u0093 reading, writing, quantitative work, and qualitative analysis. The workload is quite a bit \u00e2\u0080\u0093 four problem sets, three papers, a midterm, and a final \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you will always be doing something or the other. The material is fascinating \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Europe (though mostly Britain) leading up to the Industrial Revolution \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with a good balance between historical facts and economic models \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a real application of theory. The reading can be frustratingly ambiguous at times. Studying for the exams can be difficult \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot to know, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re never sure what exactly you need to study. The lectures could have been a bit more organized. Professor Guinnane is great! He can explain concepts exceptionally well. He addresses specifics head on, and can answer any conceptual question satisfactorily. Also, he isn't as formidable as he makes himself out to be, and the things he says are often genuinely funny. You will grow to like him. Amanda Gregg (the TA) was an absolute delight! Very helpful, very approachable, a great instructor, and a careful grader. I wish that external graders were not used as much as they were, and that Professor Guinnane did some of the grading himself \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he always set very particular standards (all reasonable and worth working towards), and so I would have liked it if he had been more active in the grading. So, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re from the history side, from the economics side, or from somewhere in between (or if you simply like having attendance taken) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 take this class! But make sure that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested enough to actually listen to the lecture and do the readings \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for that will matter a lot in the end.",
    "Not a super hard Econ class but there were a lot of requirements (5 Psets, 3 papers, midterm and a final). None of these were particularly difficult but it felt like I had to do something for the class almost every week. Also, you get two unexcused absences and Guinnane does not tolerate tardiness, so you actually have to show up. The subject itself can be pretty dry. Take it if you're interested in history and would rather put in a lot of time than struggle with difficult material.",
    "A fair amount of work. We had four psets, three (short) papers, a midterm, and a final. But the class is super interesting and the assignments aren't overwhelming. Professor Guinnane is unlike most professors I had at Yale. He won't tiptoe around issues to be politically correct, will call out kids in class to answer questions, and isn't afraid to be a bit of a know-it-all. That said, he keeps the class interesting. I have no regrets about taking this course.",
    "I am so happy I took this course because now I know that economic history is really an area that interests me and I want to pursue it further. I liked the lecture organization in that each lecture covered a separate topic and was memorable by itself. The readings were dense but in a good way so that I felt like we really covered certain topics in depth. I also like the problem set\/essay structure because the 4 problem sets we did made sure we had a solid quantitive foundation and the 3 essays we wrote gave us good practice in writing economic history papers.",
    "a Yes, take this class. Even though the material might not seem very interesting (English agriculture in the 18th century, etc.), Professor Guinnane is an excellent lecturer who teaches very well and makes the material fun too. Every class is interesting, the exams are not too difficult, and the homework is a balance of readings, some psets, and 3 short papers that make it quite diverse.",
    "recommended because it provides students with a way to actually apply all the economic theory they've picked up in earlier courses to real-world events (albeit historic events)...very refreshing and a nice change of pace from other econ courses",
    "Great course for Econ majors. Be aware that lectures are mandatory.",
    "I would recommend this class to most students. The material is a bit specialized but extremely interesting.",
    "Decent class, but mainly focused on England, not on all of Europe. Not too much work.",
    "Econ 186 is a great class. It is like a history class with a tiny bit of applied econ. Prof Guinnane is kind of mean but really loves the subject and is an excellent lecturer. You should DEFINITELY take this, especially if you are an Econ major. The workload is totally manageable and fun.",
    "Definitely yes!",
    "This course is a great balance between structure and flexibility. Mr. Anand provides a detailed syllabus but is flexible to change when issues arise. The material is interesting but may not be appealing to all. The lectures are very engaging in class is always fun. The professor provides lecture notes online and the textbook is also available online. Class is a must as attendance is taken and the lectures discussed are very important. Overall the workload is manageable and always relatable to the material section is extremely helpful and the class is a fun class to take.",
    "European Economic History was by far my favorite class this semester. The lectures and the readings were very interesting and I'd always go to class with a lot of enthusiasm. Prof. Guinnane is a really good lecturer!! Having said that, ECON 186 was also a class where I struggled quite a bit and, paradoxically, this semester my favorite class will probably be the one to lower my gpa. I often felt like I doing my best yet achieved what I considered disappointing scores. One of the things that I really appreciated in this class is that after every exam, paper, or homework, the TA would send us detailed statistics with the min, max, and average score, as well as the SD (in points, not in letter grades). This gave me a pretty good idea of where I stand. Lastly, be prepared to see prof. Guinnane as a little bit harsh sometimes (Don't be late!!). Listen carefully to his remarks but don't take them too personally and don't take offense, because he is actually very sweet on the inside. All he wants is to teach us some punctuality together with the economic history.",
    "Take it because the professor is a good lecturer but the grading is harsh. If you lose 2 points in an essay, you can drop a letter grade so take the class credit D."
