    "German is a great program at Yale and I would highly recommend a future language student to take German.",
    "A swiftly moving course with reasonable classwork and homework. Useful information is imparted and the emphasis is on speaking. I would recommend the class since it was accommodating and relaxed enough so that most would feel comfortable in it."
