   "comments": [
    "If you're a good writer who has never tried writing a screenplay, this is perfect. You get a screenplay out of it.",
    "a great class, and if you're a fiction writer looking to try something different it's a GREAT way to break the mold. i find workshop classes inane and frustrating, no matter how bright the prof is, and i took this course over caz's fiction class not because caz isn't great but because it was a chance to talk about story differently. you're really pushed to think about the arc of the larger narrative in this course and that's useful. plus, your peers' work is almost always really fun to read.",
    "Highly recommended if you have any interest in the genre. Prof. Crowley is very knowledgeable about screen writing and movies in general, and though the class gets a bit lectur-y at the beginning, it's really fun to read and critique everyone's screenplays during the second half of the course.",
    "Wonderful! A great opportunity to write and rewrite a screenplay. We did so much in so little time. If you are really looking to commit yourself to becoming a better screenwriter, take it! On the other hand, if you are just looking for a fifth class or to try something out without putting much time in, this may not be the course for you, since you write 60 pages (120 if you want, and some did).",
    "Take it. You write a screenplay. You read (mostly) great screenplays by intelligent people. It's fun. You learn a lot about writing and about movies. Crowley is fantastic. Screenplays are fantastic. Go for it.",
    "Great. The work is very heavy at the end, though really light otherwise."
