   "comments": [
    "I learned how to write about science in an interesting manner and how to read scientific papers with lots of jargon and still get information from them.",
    "I learned more about environmental issues we face today and possible solutions to them. I had never gone so in-depth with the topics we covered in the class, though I had heard about most of them. This class helped me digest scientific papers better.",
    "I learned a lot about various environmental and ecological events and problems where I previously had minimal formal education.",
    "This course expanded my knowledge of the complex systems of the Earth. I learned how to analyze and understand scientific articles. Overall, this class gave me a deeper look into the environment as a whole.",
    "By taking this class, I was able to develop the skill of reading a scientific paper and extracting the important information from it. Further, I learned to use this information to develop my own hypothesis of the concept.",
    "I developed a wide variety of insights through the structure of the course. Hearing lectures from many visiting lecturers allowed me to grasp the concepts of each topic in different ways, and gain experience and understanding in broad areas of earth and energy sciences. The skills that I developed by taking this course were in reading and analyzing dense scientific papers, as well as in actively participating in seminar discussions.",
    "I learned how to read and analyze scientific papers. I gained many insights about a range of topics from class discussions and from lectures.",
    "I learned how to dissect research articles.",
    "I developed the skill of reading scientific papers that pertained to the environment and breaking it down in a way that I could understand and be able to transfer that knowledge to others in conversations.",
    "I learned about different aspects of the planet and environment that I wasn't previously familiar with.",
    "This course gave me the ability to better evaluate and understand current scientific literature. You learn how to comprehend articles in scientific journals by taking at recent topics being researched. Weekly discussions with your classmates and professor offer interesting perspectives on these topics being looked at.",
    "I felt like I gained a lot of knowledge about the current environmental problems the world faces today, as well as the relevant potential solutions and much of the different theories behind the inner workings of the earth, including plate tectonics. Also, I developed the ability to look at different view points and evaluate different ideas."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The main strength of this class was the structure. The lecture during one class and seminar discussion in the next class provided a great balance for the course. I felt that I learned a lot and also was able to interact with the material through the discussions.",
    "Strengths: The material was incredibly engaging. There was never a dull moment in the class and Professor Timmermans was very helpful and approachable. The format of the class, I think, was the best part. We got to read about the topic, hear about it from experts, then discuss it. Weaknesses: Perhaps class discussions could have been more organized. Though, this could even be counted as a strength because conversations were so free-flowing because of this.",
    "The professor is awesome and encourages great discussions. The class is very interesting and engaging and all homework and readings are pertinent to the subject. I would love to have more clarity on grading and how assignments are going to be graded.",
    "Strengths Got a lot of experience with scientific papers that I hadn't had before. I was able to get past jargon adn confusing concepts to really pull the important aspects from a wide array of different papers. I really enjoyed getting that skill. Also we had a lot of interesting conversations in this class. Weaknesses The class felt very repetitive. Although I knew it'd be like this it got a little frustrating towards the end and the conversations tended to get slightly cyclical. Also there wasn't as much directive with the final paper as I would have liked.",
    "Strengths: Conversational environment, workload, wide array of topics. Weaknesses: Not sure what my grades were",
    "Overall, this was an amazing course! The articles were challenging, but I appreciated that.",
    "The big strength of this course was the guest lecture format, which allowed you to directly engage with scientists in their fields of expertise. The weakness was the partner assignment each week. They were meant to \"facilitate communication between students\" which is a good goal, but usually we would just send google docs to each other. It would be better if it were a single person assignment.",
    "The strengths of this course include the structure of the class. By focusing on one area of the field per week and bringing in an expert in that area, the student is able to grasp the idea in a relatively short amount of time. They can then take this idea and develop their own hypothesis in the class discussions that are held every Thursday on the topic of the week.",
    "I think the greatest strength of this course lies in the scope of its contentit provides an exciting introduction to a wide variety of environmental concepts and issues in an engaging guest lecture format. The discussions are really interesting and enjoyable, and I greatly appreciated the degree of freedom that allowed us to explore our individual and class-wide interests through our discussions and research papers. However, while I think the guest lecture format is one of the classes, greatest strengths, I also think it weakens class engagement by allowing students to sort of check out for a week, because there isn't always a feeling of being accountable for learning the information or an incentive to fully dive into it. I understand that ideally an incentive other than curiosity and intellectual fulfillment ideally wouldn't be necessary, but realistically I think that this leeway to disengage weakens the class a bit. Not sure about the best way to address that, though.",
    "The broad subject matter of this course is a strength because it allowed us to gain a good understanding of each topic without necessitating prerequisite courses or background information in the sciences. Another strength of this course is the relevance, as much of our seminar discussions focused on current issues in the scientific topic of the week.",
    "This class was very interesting and engaging.",
    "Strengths of this course are an extremely informed professor, it allows students to take risks, it is very engaging, and the workload is manageable. A weakness of this class is not all students felt the need to fully participate.",
    "The fact that we cover a wide variety of material is cool. The course isn't too much work (though the reading responses are a tad busy-worky, but they aren't hard). Writing the two research papers was interesting. Professor Timmermans is really passionate about the material and about teaching, so it was always cool, though sometimes the discussions lost a bit of steam.",
    "Interesting lecturers and engaging class discussions were highlights of this course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes take this class. It is very light workload with some reading but nothing major. Really interesting topics and a gut class. Professor Timmermans is such an awesome professor too. Definitely take the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Professor Timmermans is so knowledgeable and also so kind. The workload is not too heavy, but if you really apply yourself and try to understand the readings you'll get so much out of the class.",
    "This course is the best course I've taken at my short time at Yale. The material was always engaging and class discussions were always vibrant. If you're interested in the the earth, resources, energy, and the environment, definitely take this class if you're lucky enough to get in. Professor Timmermans was amazing! She was very helpful, articulate, and funny. It was always a pleasure to be in her class. The workload is also very light as most of the learning happens through weekly guest-lectures and class discussions. This class could definitely serve as a 5th credit because of the nature of the class format: background reading => guest lecture to clarify the reading => weekly one-page write-up with a partner on the reading => classroom discussion on the topic and whatever else might come up. You also have 2 papers due that serve as a \"midterm\" and \"final\".",
    "Yes. Good introductory course for Freshmen and a great way to get a science credit. Professor is awesome and not too much work.",
    "I would completely recommend this course to anyone who is passionate about the topics. It was my favorite course of the semester.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend the class. Professor Timmermans is such an amazing professor and really cares about the students. The discussion aspect of this class really helped as well. If you're looking for a relatively easy and extremely interesting class, take this.",
    "I highly recommend this course to any freshman with the slightest interest in the environment. It was an easy science credit for a humanities person like me, but it was engaging material and discussion as well.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. This has been one of my favorite classes at Yale so far. The structure of the class is very well setup and the information that is taught is very intriguing.",
    "I would recommend this course to any other student, regardless of their interests, majors, or other courses they've taken. The compelling subject matter seems to me to be necessary to understand in order to have an intelligent or engaging discussion about current climate trends, or any environmental issues. The course involves enjoyable discussions of very relevant scientific topics.",
    "Yes--this class exposed me to a variety of different topics. It was interesting, engaging, and enjoyable.",
    "Yes! Take it if you don't have a lot of exposure to this type of science. Great introduction.",
    "Yes, the course is a lot of fun and it prepares you for future conversations you will have about the environment.",
    "It was a really nice freshman seminar. We studied a large amount of material, so it was interesting, but there wasn't too much work (only a weekly reading response, which never took long and a pair of papers). Professor Timmermans was really nice and passionate about the material, though sometimes the discussions lost steam if there weren't a lot of people contributing.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in understanding scientific research being made in recent years, this course would be for you.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It's a fantastic freshman seminar that is both intellectually stimulating and relatively manageable in terms of workload. Professor Timmermans does a great job of facilitating good productive discussion and encouraging freedom of thought through open-ended paper topics and the weekly reading analysis on an interesting environmental topic"
