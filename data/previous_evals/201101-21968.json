   "comments": [
    "I really did not enjoy this class. Maybe I'm just not a fan of sociology as a discipline, but I didn't enjoy the readings, which I found dense and uninteresting for the most part. The composition of our particular seminar was particularly problematic; discussions, much to my disappointment, were often simplistic and dull, with people rarely saying anything substantive (when they weren't saying things that were actually quiet sexist, ofcourse). I wouldn't recommend this class. If you're interested in this course because it's sociology, maybe take it; if you're interested in WGSS\/feminism\/critically thinking about gender and sexuality, stay far, far away.",
    "Good class to take. Readings are modern and not dry. Class discussions, if the class participates, are fun and engaging. Not heavy on the work load. Only two papers and blog post every week.",
    "Take this class if you are truly interested in the sociological aspects of sex and romance. I feel like this class had so much potential but managed to skirt away from the most interesting issues. The vast majority of the conversation revolves around gender construction and discrimination, not actual sex. Reading is average and workload is pretty light.",
    "A class about sex that actually doesn't talk about sex. Instead it is about the cults of femininity and masculinity, gender roles, etc. We even managed to sour the lecture about Twilight.",
    "I would definitely say take it. It's not much of a commitment (one midterm paper and one final paper) and the reading is FASCINATING.",
    "I would recommend this course (with some caution). The material is really interesting and the discussions can also be awesome, but you have to COMMIT. You have to be willing to say things that might evoke strong reactions (even if it can be embarrassing) because this class is based on an honest evaluation of adolescent sexuality, so honesty and openness are absolute necessities. Prof. Brueckner knows what she is doing. Ultimately (ESPECIALLY if you are SOCY or WGSS), you should take this class!",
    "Fun",
    "Great seminar to take if you are interested in sexuality",
    "If you're a WGSS major, there are better classes for you. I know the title of the class sounds glamorous and fun, but I found myself having hard time sitting through the two hours of seminar. Some of the readings are excellent--but you can do them on your own.",
    "Really interesting topic, really frustrating class. The readings were usually pretty good, especially if you're interested in sociological studies, but class discussion wavered between insipid and offensive. Professor Brueckner clearly knows her stuff and has done the most valuable and most reliable research on modern American adolescent sexuality, but she doesn't betray enough of her personal opinions to either provoke interesting conversation or police it from devolving into annoyingly sexist and heteronormative drivel. If you're a sociology major, you may well like this class just fine. It's not hard at all. If you're a WGSS major, I suggest you stay away.",
    "I would not recommend it to other students unless it is restructured and taught by a different teacher. Class was fairly miserable to sit through and consisted mostly of people rambling on about their opinions on sexism between men and women instead of discussing actual academic topics.",
    "it's a good course in that you get to discuss a lot of things and gather your thoughts, but bad in that it can very easily go off topic or nowhere at all.",
    "The reading material is interesting. The seminar itself was not. I did enjoy getting into massive arguments with my fellow classmates on the blog, but the in-class interactions were much less exciting."
