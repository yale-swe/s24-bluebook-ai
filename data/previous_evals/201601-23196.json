    "One of my absolute favorite classes at Yale. Take it if you can!! Only seniors got in this year, but it was so worth the stress during shopping period. Fun, hands-on way to learn all the bones (and a lot of the important muscles\/nerves) in the human body. Great for pre-med if you're on that route too.",
    "Great class - 10\/10 would recommend",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Very manageable workload and interesting material, especially if you're focus is archaeology or medicine",
    "Excellent course. It's really what you make of it. If you enjoy anatomy, this will be a blast. It's mainly made up of open lab where specimens are laid out for you to inspect and learn the features of.",
    "I highly highly recommend this class, but it is capped at 25. If you are not a senior or an anthropology major, it might not be worth trying to get into this class. This class is almost all lab-based with maybe 2 or 3 lectures. You will get a list of bone features that you need to know for the practical, so lab times are basically your time to identify the features and learn them.",
    "Highly recommended, especially if you are considering medicine as a career. The course is a gentle introduction to anatomy that helps lay down the foundations that you will build upon in future study.",
    "This class is dope! a lot of memorization but super manageable if you focus in lab. Also a great class to take credit d if you have one available. Sargis is great and will put in the time to help you out if you need it, thought the class is largely self directed.",
    "GREAT CLASS! Such a hidden gem. If you are interested in human osteology and like the show Bones, then the class is for you. Not too stressful, only two tests and two exams. Take if you get a spot!",
    "Good class",
    "This is an excellent opportunity to play with and examine the amazing collection of human specimens owned by the Department of Anthropology. Professor Sargis is amazing at explaining the intricacies of the human skeleton and how it interacts with muscles to produce movement.",
    "Listen up you shoppers: Human Osteology is the BOMB DOT COM. This class has EVERYTHING. You learn bones. You learn muscles. You learn nerves. You get real HANDS ON LAB EXPERIENCE. You get your own plastic study skeleton. That's right, YOU GET YOUR OWN GODDAMN SKELETON TO TAKE HOME AND LOVE (AND STUDY). But heads up, this is NOT a walk in the park. If you don't study, you WILL fail. You have to do the reading, you have to study the slides, you have to look at all the bones and ask questions and LEARN things. You have to side bones and sex bones and age bones and a whole bunch of other shit. DO THE WORK FAM. Also, a note to potential shoppers: if you're a freshman or a sophomore, you're not getting in this class. Accept it, move on, and try when you're an upperclassman. Don't waste your time coming and hoping for a spot - there are only 25 of them, and boy do they fill up fast. That said, same goes for juniors who AREN\"T archaeology\/anthropology majors. Try senior year. And senior non-majors? It's a toss-up. Maybe there'll be enough spots. Maybe there won't. FIGHT MY CHILDREN. FIGHT FOR YOUR SPOT. FIGHT FOR YOUR SKELETON.",
    "If you get in, you should totally take it. The class is amazing. I've always been kind of fascinated by the human structure, but taking this class was mind-blowing. The human skeleton is a crazy and amazing thing.",
    "SO much fun. Even if you're not into biology or anthropology, it's just a great class that teaches you supremely interesting information. Easy and really fun quizzes and tests. Take it if you can get in. It's amazing.",
    "You will memorize nearly every bone in the body. It's fun, but a lot to memorize. Take it credit\/D if you don't want to go crazy over it."
