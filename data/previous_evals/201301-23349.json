    "Definitely. If you're at all interested in the topic, you should take it. The readings are manageable and really fascinating. The professor is nice. You'll learn a tremendous amount about American history and be exposed to a lot of interesting ideas. As a senior I can say this was one of the best seminars I've taken at Yale.",
    "Take this course. Gives you a great overview of Religion's role in America.",
    "Yes absolutely!!",
    "I absolutely would. I learned an incredible amount and it has changed how I view American history.",
    "I would recommend the class, because it treats an important feature not only of history, but also of contemporary American politics."
