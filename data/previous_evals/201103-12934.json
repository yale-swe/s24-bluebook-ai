    "It wasn't too hard of a class and there wasn't a large amount of work compared to some of the other labs at Yale. If you're interested in astronomy and need a 1\/2 credit or a science credit definitely take this.",
    "The good thing about this class is that you get to use a 16\" telescope and do some professional astronomy, such as estimating the distances to stars and ages of star clusters. You also get to take pictures of galaxies and nebulae. That being said, you may often find yourself struggling to will yourself to go up to the observatory given both its distance (it's a mile from cross campus) and the fact that the TFs sometimes virtually did the entire lab for us (rather than taking the pains to explain how to operate the telescope). Doing the lab reports too was a pain. Still, some of the images you take (or estimates you make) might turn out to be really good, and this alone may be reason enough to take the class."
