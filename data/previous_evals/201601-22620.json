    "We live in an era of Big Data. This class will help you understand what can you do with Big Data, how it works and you will learn some tools to make sense of data sets. Very useful.",
    "Broadens your horizons, inspires creativity, lets (forces) you to tweet in class",
    "This was an excellent survey course of how technology is being used to change the way organizations are solving problems, from preventing high frequency trading fraud to thwarting sex trafficking. There were occasional in-class technological workshops, but given the lack of prerequisites for the class, they were not especially grueling. There is a good mix of guest speakers that were brought into the class to speak about how data is changing the way they do their work. The course's strength was also a weakness at times, in that including technical content for people with no background was a bit risky and occasionally quite time consuming. Additionally, much of the content was peer generated or guest speaker generated, meaning that if people didn't really want to be in the room (in future iterations of this class), the experience might not be as good.",
    "Big Data is the future for all industries; all students should take this class or the one alike.",
    "For someone willing to take on a new project and challenge, from different (and more real-world) perspectives, this course is a great opportunity. It would be less suitable for those looking for a directed and structured course looking at the issue of big data from an academic perspective.",
    "It overviews different tools to analyze big data, expects a lot of self-teaching, will have a heavy technical component rather than theoretical. There will be interesting speakers.",
    "It is a course where you'll learn about Big Data and its many applications to society. You'll be forced to think about they different ways that Big Data can be used to solve problems creatively, especially where traditional data collection is impossible or insufficient. You'll also learn a couple of technical skills that involved scraping data from the web, natural language processing, etc.",
    "I'd recommend but: Even if you come in with a project idea, you need to figure out how to execute that project yourself. Professor will not be very helpful. Promises at the beginning of class will probably not come to fruition by the end.",
    "Big Data is worth taking because it provides an introduction to a major shift occurring in society today."

   "comments": [
    "It contributed to my interest in media sociology. I want to work with digital data and methods and have found it difficult to find sociological courses, which provided theory and method in this area. The course has given me a lot of useful knowledge I'm sure will be helpful for future studies.",
    "It gave me a good overview of technical tools available and a few interesting areas of debate. However topics are very disconnected and that made it less engaging and sacrificed learning.",
    "I realized that big data can be used in any field."
