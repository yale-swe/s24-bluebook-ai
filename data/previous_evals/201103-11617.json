   "comments": [
    "A very well structured course. Would recommend, but takes quite a lot of time for reports and actual lab work.",
    "I would only recommend Chem117L to a Pre-Med because it is mandatory.",
    "It's a basic general chemistry lab that uses concepts learned in CHEM 115. Take it if you are interested in basic chemistry, or if you need to take it. Dr. G is nice.",
    "Overall it was an okay class. It would have been much better if the experiments went with CHEM115 more. I think the actually packet thoroughly explained every experiment but the lab reports were harshly graded. Only take it if you absolutely have to.",
    "Chemistry 117L 01 is a course that requires a major commitment of time and effort, yet the skills that are acquired are certainly worth the investment. To do well in this course, it is vital to form study groups with other students in order to discuss data and preparation for following labs. Considering Dr. Ganapathi's attention to detail in outlining lab procedure and clarifying lab results, I would certainly recommend this course.",
    "It is a required course, yes, but also an enjoyable one. Gives you the opportunity to expand on your lab skills and report-writing abilities. Make sure you read the experiment beforehand though, pre-lab quizzes are important.",
    "Only if you're considering premed or a science major. Otherwise this class takes too much time although it is worth it.",
    "Only if necessary. otherwise, no!",
    "I would recommend this class to other students. It's helpful to experience the hands-on part of chemistry and to make connections between laboratory experiments and material learned in class. My only warnings would be to study for the quizzes (they're not as easy as you would think) and to be prepared to spend multiple hours working on lab reports.",
    "Chemistry 117L is the second term of general chemistry lab, in which the topics covered in the lecture class are expounded upon through lab experience. I definitely recommend the lab, because it greatly enhances your understanding of the material. However, it is vital to get a good TA in order to have a very positive experience, and it requires a lot of time and meticulousness in order to do well. At times, the long hours of lab are exhausting and frustrating, so it is definitely a serious commitment. If you are willing to put in that effort, and you are already taking chemistry any way, for whatever reason, then I do recommend taking the lab.",
    "Chem 117 is mostly tedious, although there were a handful of enjoyable labs. Though time-consuming, especially for a half-credit course, it is not hard to do well if you put in the effort, and it supplements Chem 115 nicely. I would not take it for fun, but if you need to take a lab, it's not bad at all.",
    "It's a course that one has to take if one is taking Chemistry 115. There's not much choice.",
    "I would only take it if you have to",
    "The course was well organized in terms of experiment order and manual instructions. Lab instructions and background information were detailed andpertinent. They will give you a clear idea of what you will be doing and why. The course emphasized a nice balance between detail and broad conceptual understanding. I left with a better understanding of and appreciation for laboratory work, as well as a stronger foundation of many chemistry concepts. Grading was generally fair. One weakness was the long time it took for graded work to be returned. Both the professor and my TA were very supportive. They were almost always available to answer questions and were generally open and approachable. This course works very well as an introductory laboratory course. It guides students step by step through each experiment. It does not provide as much opportunity for creative thinking and problem solving, but provides a strong foundation for future lab work. I would recommend this course for students whose main focus is to improve on these fundamental skills.",
    "Chem 117L might seem like a horrible lab in the beginning of the semester, but it does improve from there. The experiments start to make more sense and appear to be more relevant to the Chem 115 class (do note that a lot of the experiments in the beginning do not coincide with the concepts covered in lecture, so make sure you're relatively comfortable with Chemistry ingeneral). Towards the end, the labs become easier to do and the lab reports become a manageable weekly task. However, the final is a bit difficult, but as long as you do well throughout the semester, the whole course is pretty good and not terrible. Either way, you'll probably have to take this course as a requirement for something. Just know it's not as bad as it first seems.",
    "I would only recommend it to them if they really like labs.",
    "You're probably taking this course because it's required. I wouldn't recommend it for fun, as it is a lot of unnecessary tedious work.",
    "I would definitely not recommend it unless you have to take it to meet a requirement. lab reports were very tedious and took lots of time",
    "Definitely take while enrolled in Chem 115 lecture. Might be confusing otherwise.",
    "I would recommend this course. While it is a lot more work than half a credit, I learned a lot and gained very practical experience in a lab.",
    "This class isn't too bad if you prepare for each lab. Everything is pretty straight forward. Plus, the chem 115 lecture course topics relate to the labs, which is really helpful.",
    "One word is all that is needed to summarize Chem 117. Tedious.",
    "This course requires quite a bit of time to prepare lab reports etc., so be prepared. Also, some experiments may be tedious. Overall, not bad.",
    "Chemistry 117L does involve doing many tedious tasks that take a very long time. This is not the lab course where you can leave after an hour or two. You usually have to stay the entire four hours to finish the task for the day. If you do not have to take this lab course to fulfill a requirement, I would say that you shouldn't take it. It does help you learn many basic techniques, but you would really only need this course if you are a science major or pre-med.",
    "Not very hard, but labs do take a lot of time. Most likely you are taking it for a major or pre-med so you don't have much choice.",
    "Very engaging and interesting.yes, I would recommend it."
