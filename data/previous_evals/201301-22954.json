    "I would recommend this class. It's interesting and the papers are fun to write :)",
    "Take it! Great readings and good lectures. Only 2 papers, weekly reading responses (takes 10 min), and a final.",
    "this is an easy course, maybe take it credit d as a fifth. you don't need to go to lecture and you barely need to do the readings. two 7-9 page papers, weekly reading responses, a final.",
    "Yea! It was an ok class that was interesting and a pretty light workload",
    "Shop discussion sections for a good TF. The class has some serious weaknesses in that it tries to do WAY too much. It tries to be a philosophy and psych class, but what it ends up being is neither because it lacks focus and exploration of material in depth.",
    "Eh. It seems a lot cooler than it actually is. The lectures are hit-or-miss (mostly miss), and section is usually pretty boring. Also, tons of repeat from Intro Psych. Just average, I don't particularly recommend it.",
    "This course dwells a lot on psychology and cognitive science relative to the philosophy, which was a little irritating for me. Otherwise, the course workload is near zero and the class itself is very easy.Also, Professor Knobe has an effect named after him. What a fucking badass",
    "I would highly recommend this course! Joshua Knobe is so cool!",
    "It was really fun! Definitely not work-heavy until the second half. Assessments are weirdly handled, but it's a fun and interesting class.",
    "This is an easy but highly enjoyable class, perfect for a fifth credit or as something a little lighter to balance out a heavy course load. I definitely recommend it to anyone, even people who aren't incredibly interested incogsci or philosophy to begin with. After reading some of the experiments and going through lecture, you could very well change your mind.",
    "If you are planning on continuing a PSYCHOLOGY career.",
    "Yes I'd recommend it - the material is super interesting.",
    "This class used psychological studies to prove or expand on philosophy. We had two readings a week that varied in density and length, a short reading response, two papers, and a final exam. I would recommend this course because it is relatively light and the paper topics are interesting. However, the lecturing style takes getting used to.",
    "I don't care who you are, just take this. Generally well taught but more importantly the most interesting subject matter ever.",
    "It's exactly what the course description says. There are a lot of perspectives on human nature presented in this course. If you want to think a lot about different topics in human nature, which I think most people do on their own at some point or another anyway, then definitely take this class. It's very thought and discussion provoking. I learned so much from this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The material was extremely engaging, lecture never dragged or went too quickly, and the workload was very manageable.",
    "Take it! Really was like a nice break in my day.",
    "This is a pretty good class. Each unit the professor presents philosophical arguments about a topic, and then goes on to to support\/ challenge these arguments with psych studies. The lectures are always interesting and the course work is rather light (2 papers, section, and a final). While not a mind blowing class, it is a definitely a solid course to round out a schedule!",
    "I would recommend this class! It was very interesting, and Professor Knobe is a good lecturer. We covered a lot of material, and it didn't always feel as if it all fit together, but at the end it was great to see everything click.",
    "Philosophy 182 is an interesting course for those interested in Philosophy and Psychology. Professor Knobe is brilliant and section was really interesting. However, I would not recommend the course for students with background in Psych, as the concepts are pretty basic and will either be review or learned very quickly. If you've never taken a psych course and want to learn about the field in light of questions drawn from philosophy, take it!",
    "I would not recommend this class. Maybe if I had done really well, I would have given it a good rating, but this definitely isn't one of those classes that you leave with a B and feel good about it because you learned a lot and tried your best. It's frustrating because the topics we discuss are so easy, but somehow it's still hard. The class is \"tricky\" and frustrating.This is basically how it works: first you read some classic philosophy on a particular topic--for example, happiness. Then you look at the modern psychological research on that topic. Perhaps you also look at some contrasting evidence from either philosophy or psychology.It's a neat idea, but in practice, terribly dull. For one thing, the lecture consists almost entirely of going over the readings from the night before. You feel punished for having actually done your homework. The essays are long and boring. The sections are full of annoying people saying annoying things, but it's so subjective that you have to take everyone seriously. This gets really bad when you talk about the cognitive basis for religion. The slides aren't posted and they're not very good anyway, and the final is hard (but at least not as arbitrary as the papers). At first I thought I would like the class, but as the semester dragged on, it became my least favorite.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. If you are looking for a class that is really interesting, but not too much work, this class is perfect for you. If you're interested in the course material the course is very easy and does not require too much work that you will not want to do.",
    "This is a broad based class that allows you to explore a bunch of topics (e.g. happiness, religion, altruism) from different perspectives. You come to understand the different debates\/controversies about human nature that have been going on since the time of Aristotle.take this if you like philosophy\/psychology. If you don't like writing papers, don't take this class because the papers are hard to do well on.",
    "a Yes take this class with Professor Knobe. He is amazing and the class covers fascinating topics. Go to Prof Knobe's office hours often to talk about the subjects seen in class and ask him for help with your essay if you need it.",
    "Wonderful course. I learned so much! So interesting!",
    "This is THE class to take if you want to get yourself exposed to the interesting intersection between psychology and philosophy. The readings are easy to handle and the lectures are easy to follow. I enjoyed this class a lot even if I'm not a major in psychology, philosophy or cognitive science.",
    "A truly interesting course in that it combines the important questions in philosophy and psychology and give you an ancient and modern view on philosophical questions. Enjoyed it a lot.",
    "PHIL 182 is a cool concept: coupling philosophical readings with psychological research. But it often feels like a crap shoot in practice--a few readings covering the same general topic but diverging wildly in the actual topics covered. If you're interested, definitely shop a few classes of it. It polarized everyone taking it--some people thrived. Many, like me, felt disillusioned by the wide changes in subject matter and the often unrelated readings. It -was- very interesting when I felt invested in the readings, though.",
    "This was one of those rare cases in which at the end of every 50 minute class, I wished it would stretch on to 75 minutes. Professor Knobe was wonderfully engaging and passionate about the topics, and the material straddled an infinitely interesting boundary between psychology and philosophy. Professor Knobe is arguably the best professor I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had at Yale so far; he is kind and intelligent, and his genuine enthusiasm for cognitive science is contagious. I found the lectures to be clear and logically organized; when I went back through my notes, I was surprised at how easily the concepts fell into place in my mind. The readings also connected seamlessly back to the lectures and papers, so I actually felt that I was working toward a tangible understanding of the material as I was going through them. If you are looking for a good intro philosophy class, a good intro psych class, a good intro cogsci class, or a darn good class in general, this is one of the very best out there, taught by one of the very best at Yale.",
    "This class is basically a conglomoration of different arguments on various controversial topics.",
    "A very accessible and comprehensive evaluation of a few topics in cognitive science and philosophy.",
    "I would recommend this course. It takes a very good approach to philosophy, using empirical work in social psychology to substantiate philosophical claims. Furthermore, the workload is very reasonable. The reading is do-able and worthwhile, even with a heavy workload. Often, the readings are very closely related\u00e2\u0080\u0093 sometimes a psychological paper and a direct philosophical response to that paper. As I studied for the final exam, it all blended into a fairly complete whole. I think I learned a lot from this course and enjoyed it immensely.",
    "It is a very interesting class. I wouldn't recommend taking it if religion is something you are uncomfortable discussing, since the last half of the semester focuses mainly on the topic of religion.",
    "AMAZING course. 70% of the time I felt like I was listening to a TED talk. I would forget to take notes because the lectures were so engaging and exciting. The final is slightly difficult, however. The reading is a lot, but also extremely interesting and worth reading. Felt like I learnt a great deal of deeply significant and controversial information that could be applied to everything. Often provoked completely new ways of looking at familiar aspects of human nature.",
    "probably one of the best intro level classes out there. ideal for anyone not too familiar with psych or philo or cog sci.",
    "Really interesting course--completely changed the way I think about some of the overarching themes (happiness, altruism, character, morality, and belief in god). And on that note, I'm very happy that the class was organized thematically. It created a level of cohesiveness that is very hard to come by when studying such a broad topic. Final exam was quite the curve ball though. We had no idea that there would be quote identification, and that proved to be very difficult.Overall, really good course. Knobe is clearly quite knowledgeable in addition to being an engaging, funny lecturer.",
    "Okay, wouldn't highly recommend it.",
    "Overall, the class was fine. I got sort of bored in lectures by the end, and didn't think the graded assignments were worthwhile. Shop the classand see how engaged you are by the lectures. I honestly wouldn't recommend the class.",
    "This class is fascinating blend between classical philosophy and modern scientific study of the human mind, if you're into that sort of thing. I would definitely recommend the class if that is what interests you.",
    "Yes! Take this class! It's focusing on five different aspects of philosophy with a cognitive science background, and it is so important to get to know how we as a people think!",
    "You should take this class. It's easy, it's entertaining, and you actually learn a lot. The professor is great and the TAs are helpful.",
    "A good lecture with barely any stress and little work.",
    "Take everything Josh Knobe teaches. He's an engaging and supportive professor, and the material he covers is thoroughly fascinating.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if you are more interested in the philosophy part of the course than psych\/cog sci.",
    "good intro to both psych and philosophy. BUT, this isn't really representative of a more higher-level philo OR psych class. Key word: INTRO",
    "I would recommend it for sure. Its a very interesting class that forces you to think deeply about topics you may have only briefly considered in the past. It will challenge your beliefs in the most positive sense, by asking you to think critically.",
    "Yes. take it and love it",
    "Basically you have short readings with responses plus a weekly section. There are two papers and one test. The papers are pretty open ended and the test is very fair.",
    "PHIL 182 is a very interesting course that challenges students to think about how the ideas discussed apply to their lives and how they act in accordance with the arguments put forth by the philosophers and psychologists. Reading the material is crucial to understanding what occurs in the class, as well as developing ones' own ideas of how human nature develops.",
    "Yes.",
    "This class is an awesome mix between philosophy and psychology. It puts Plato's and Aristotle's ideas to the test in the lab, which makes for a really interesting class. Professor Knobe is an excellent lecturer and the class is always fun to attend. The papers are interesting to write and the final exam is straightforward. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Take the class! It is a great mix of Philosophy and Psychology. The course is very well structured, not too hard, but not very easy either. You will learn a lot and the professor is great!",
    "This class is a general introduction to basic philosophical topics and is great if you just want to develop a foundation in this kind of material. Would certainly recommend it, it is a great intro class.",
    "I was really interested in Cognitive Science before this course. I took the intro classwith Scholl and this was my second class in the subject, and they both were a let down. They both cover too much material too broadly so it is more about memorization than in depth understanding. If you need this for some sort of humanities credit, it isn't too hard so I would recommend taking it (although the papers and the final are not fun) because it is easy to do well. But if you really want to learn about this material I would suggest a different course.",
    "If you've taken DS, Intro Cog Sci, and Intro Psych, you'll have covered almost all of the material in this course. This is a great course for people with little background, but it is more of a survey course than I expected.",
    "This course is really interesting. It's outlined really well and the reading material is pretty cool. The papers aren't that bad, but it probably would help to have some philosophy and psychology background.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is very interesting, and not overly time consuming with only weekly reading responses, 2 papers, and a final exam.",
    "Great course. Good mix of philosophy and psych if you like both and not too hard either. Do the readings if you can and pay attention in lecture and you'll learn a lot, have a good time, and hopefully get a goodgrade. Prof. Knobe is really cool too!",
    "Yeah, it's a good survey type philosophy class.",
    "Nice overview. Heavy workload."
