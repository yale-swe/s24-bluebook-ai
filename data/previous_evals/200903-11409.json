   "comments": [
    "Only take the class if you're 1) really interested in Biological Anthropology or 2) need a science credit. If you just want to study evolution, etc. I would recommend taking a smaller seminar that covers similar material.",
    "A good introduction to anthropology in general. You cover a lot in one semester, so staying on top of the material is key to a successful outcome. Also, the exams are more specific and difficult than expected- come prepared. I would definitely recommend this to another student as long as they are interested in biology along with anthropology. After all, the class is classified as a science, so don't just expect social or cultural anthropology to be covered (although it does make up a decent portion of the material).",
    "Definitely would not recommend the class. There is too much straight memorization\/ busy work. There are better classes to take to fulfill the science credit.",
    "Not a science gut. Don't take it. There must be easier options. I definitely learned a few interesting things from this course, but the many painful moments far outweigh the good ones.",
    "ANTH 116 was interesting but not painless. The material in lectures, quizzes, and labs seems very easy and simple to master, but these qualities aren't at all reflected on the exams. I also felt that the material was very repetitive and overlapping, but at the same time, it seems like the best way to get a science requirement out of the way; despite being annoyingly long, the lectures were mostly interesting. Just watch out for the exams, because they aren't easy.",
    "I'd recommend Anthro 116 to anyone looking for a science credit that they'll actually learn from. There is a lot of boring science-y stuff and a lot of problem sets you don't really care about, but every now and then you get a liberal arts moment when suddenly you feel like what you're learning is sort of relevant to your own major.",
    "Take it if you like fossils or want a B\/B+ for a science credit.",
    "Good science, not a gut but appropriate for those who don't want to major in science. I really enjoyed it.",
    "Best of all possible Science credits. Interesting material, simple to grasp, although there is a vast amount of memorization. Lots of primates.",
    "Yes- interesting intro to human evolution. A class every undergrad should take.",
    "I would recommend it in terms of fulfilling a science requirement. I think as far as Anthropology courses go, there are more interesting ones, but I thought that the majority of the information was interesting and engaging. So yes - and no, depending on what kind of student you are.",
    "*Not* a gut class. I'd recommend it if you have a real interest in evolution and early humans etc., or if you're planning to major in anthropology; otherwise, skip it. There's better ways to get a science credit.",
    "A very interesting science course approachable for non-science majors. This is a great way to get a science credit and learn a little bit about where we came from.",
    "If you are looking for an easy science credit do not take this class. It is an incredible amount of memorization and there are weekly problem set quizzes in section. It is interesting, but it is solely memorization of fact.",
    "It's fine for a science credit if you're more of a humanities person. If you're interested in human evolution, you actually will learn some cool stuff. The course seems really easy until you get to the midterm exam--be prepared to memorize a lot of fossil names.",
    "Interesting introductory human evolution class with very easy-to-manage labs and increasingly difficult tests. The tests have gotten harder in the past few years, and if the trend continues it might be very challenging to get the grade you want even if you like the material.",
    "YES! Fun, not hard.",
    "Tough class but small workload",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it, but only if you're interested in this subject",
    "This is a good class for non-science majors. The week-to-week work isn't too hard -- un-graded problem sets and lab reports and a one-question quiz drawn straight from the p-sets -- but the exams are tough. It's a good science credit, though, if you're willing to study hard for the midterm and final.",
    "Yes, its a good course to fill a science credit",
    "only take it if science credit is needed or sincerely interested in antrhopology.",
    "It's not a gut but it's not too hard to do fairly well. As somebody who took it just to get my science credit, I would say that if there's one concept that everybody should be exposed to it's how evolution works, which is the central theme of the course.",
    "Don't take this class if you're just trying to get a science out of the way. It's boring and definitely not an easy A...at all.",
    "A good introduction to Human Evolution and the background that Human evolution entails (primate evolution, socioecology, genetics etc). Tries and more or less succeeds to do a lot but the amount of material can be pretty overwhelming. THe concepts are generally very easy (good for non Science-folk) but the material is just a lot.",
    "Take it if you need a science credit. Its actually interesting but the tests are hard.",
    "Not the gut that you may think it is. Overall, I enjoyed the material discussed in Intro Bio Anthro. However, the midterm\/final were very hard and always included really random obscure details that I do not believe really test what you learn. I think the questions should have been more general b\/c the amount of notes for the class is pretty extensive. Lab was fine, not too much of a pain. but the tests are KILLER.",
    "The class was a way to show the connection between older species and more recent species. I would recommend this class to someone that wants to learn more about things as far as anthropology. It is a way to connect with older species through evolution.",
    "Good class!Not too bad of a science if you put the time in to study.Interesting Stuff, too!Yes I'd recommend if you need a science.Fix the discrepancies between slides and book though!",
    "One of the better Science credits at Yale, but by no means a gut. Those tests were nooo joke.",
    "I would recommend for seriously interested anthropology students",
    "Not a gut class. You may think it is, but its not.",
    "This class was based on a topic that I think was very interesting and which could be interesting to anyone, not matter what their fundamental interests. It's about evolution basically, which is incredibly fascinating and I think everyone should understand. That being said lecturewas very hit or miss. Sometimes it would be great but often it would be like the professor was just throwing random information at us, very hard to follow. But overall, yes I would recommend it, especially if you are a non-science person who needs a science credit (it's not really very sciency at all except a few topics)",
    "Tells you everything you could want to know about human evolution. Not only will you learn about humans, you will learn about primates, mammals, and evolution in general. Gives you a solid base for higher level courses. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Overall, this is a good class. It's not absolutely fantastic, and lecture can be a bit long and disorganized sometimes, but it's usually fairly interesting. Grading is reasonable, and you do learn a lot. It is a ton of information you're responsible, though, and sometimes it's hard to know what all to study.",
    "I would not recommend it at all unless you like looking at bones without really understanding the implications. Aside from a really superficial deconstruction of race from a biological perspective, I don't think we got much exposure to much else then 'there was this australopithecus and it had these features that were derived, oh and then wehave this creature but we don't know whether or not they are direct descendants...'AWFUL",
    "Good class. Lots of information to memorize but very interesting concepts applicable to a number of fields (and everyday life!). Not a bad way to earn a science credit.",
    "I would recommend this course but it involves a lot of memorization. It's a good science credit, but somewhat work intensive with a midterm, final, weekly problem sets, and a weekly quiz that is one of the questions from the problem set (nothing to worry about though, trust me). In the beginning of the course, you feel as though you are taking a high school bio course, but then things quickly pick up pace and you dive into the world of Australopithecines and Homo species. The bulk of the course is focused on the evolution of humans and on why primitive human societies live the way they do. I enjoyed the course but it is not a gut.",
    "For anyone interested in the Anthro major, this perfectly solidifies your bio anthro requirement. Apart from that though...can't very well say I'd take this course for much other reason than to satisfy one's science or social science requirement...",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you are really interested in the topic (meaning how we evolved- and not the regular Darwin evolution stuff because you go through that stuff in a week but like specific hominin species and fossils and characteristics of each species). It's not a gut, not an easy way to fulfill a science requirement, and there is no curve.",
    "Yes, if you need a science credit and are at all interested in learning about primate evolution and sociology.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for someone who needs an SC credit or someone who is interested in human evolution. I took this course for a combination of those two reasons and I loved it. If you do the work, it is a very easy course, but not the type of gut in which you feel like you learn nothing. A great course, for what it's worth.",
    "The first and last parts of the course are very interesting. However, there is a long period in the middle of fossils that was pretty mind-numbing. I'd recommend this course if you like evo bio, primates, or anthropology.",
    "Yes. Take this for a science credit.",
    "Pretty easy course - weekly problem set quizzes, a midterm, and a final. Lectures were interesting, but also posted online so it wasn't too bad if you missed class. The midterm and final were a little challenging - MC and short answer - but definitely manageable. I would recommend this class for an easy science credit. Most of what we learned dealt with large concepts of evolution that are pretty intuitive. Good 5th class.",
    "This course is an interesting introduction into the evolution of the human species, and I learned a lot. However, it requires a lot of memorization and a lot of individual work. I found it difficult to grasp the material simply by attending lecture. The class is not a gut by any means!",
    "For those who need a science credit, definitely. For hardcore evolutionary biologists, probably a little too basic.",
    "NOT AN EASY SCIENCE. Survey course with a ton of information -- too much to ever remember. Kind of scattershot.",
    "if you need a science I guess this might be the unfortunate best route but this class is tough",
    "Don't take it unless you need a science credit. It gets really boring and its basically just nomenclature&memorization...ugh. But, its just 2 tests&a 50min section once a week so its pretty much 0 work except for studying for the final&midterm.",
    "Take it if you want an interesting\/pretty easy science course. Lots to memorize but whatever. If you're and anthro major definitely use it as one of the intro requirements.",
    "It's a survey of some of the major ideas in biological anthropology, which includes primate and human evolution, sociology and life history. I would recommend it with reservation \u0097 there are probably more engaging science lectures out there, and there was quite a bit of memorization.",
    "If I'm perfectly honest, I took this for the Science credit, but it was certainly an interesting class, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning about the primate and human evolution. You get to learn little bits an pieces about various interesting related scientific subjects: genetics, human and primate behavior, the evolution of language, the evolution of culture. The workload is not bad at all: one problem set a week which you do not need to turn in; instead you're quizzed with one question from the problem set. The midterm and final can be rather brutal, though, as there is a lot of memorization, and anything goes on the subject matter.",
    "I would recommend ANTH116 if you are looking for a science credit, or if you are interested in the evolution of humans. A lot of what I learned in this class, I had a slight idea of, but never really understood the details. The assessments in the class, however, are largely based on memorization, rather than on basic understanding of a topic.",
    "Yeah I guess I would recommend this course for another student. The information is interesting, but it isn't easy so only take it if you are actually interested in evolutionary theory and primate evolution",
    "I would recommend Anthro 116 for another student because it is a very interesting class and bribiescas is a great lecturer.",
    "Looking at human and primate behavior from an evolutionary perspective is really cool. Unfortunately, this is only about 15-20 percent of the course. Mostly you learn about the search for human ancestors. If that interests you take it, but personally I wish I had just sucked it up and taken a physics or chem course for my science credit.",
    "It's a good class -- can sometimes get boring or technical, but overall interesting, and checking out fossils in section is cool. Midterm, final, and section quizzes are the only grades. Good class overall.",
    "This is not an easy science, so do not take it if that is what you are looking for. However, this is a very different science than something you would have taken in high school and therefore might be interesting for the non-science major who is still wants to learn something new.",
    "Biological Anthropology is a survey course of primate and hominid evolution, in order to explain the evolutionary imperatives behind human physiology and behavior.The most boring parts of the class were the descriptions of specific human ancestors and their physiology. Other parts of it, like the fundamentals of genetics, primate behavior, and human intelligence, were fascinating.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student because it acts as an antidote to the great poison of the time which people love to call by the fancy name of 'faith'. A course that provides us with a more scientific world view, so that we can live our life to the full instead of honoring what is false.",
    "THIS IS NOT A GUT COURSE! It starts our really interesting and you think the information is \"intuitive\" but then it gets dry so fast and you find yourself memorizing HUGE volumes of information about the classification of primates which, unless you decide to become a anthro major, is so useless. The midterm was really hard and the average was a B- and he does not curve because there are people who for whatever reason get 99% on the test. If you are not an anthro major this is a great class to work really hard and learn information that you will never use again and before the final you will hear students complaining very loudly about this course. He is an engaging lecturer but I think the nature of the material is a deterrent enough. There are easier science\/ social science credits offered. Only take this course if you really want to know about fossils and apes and look at the syllabus and lectures before making a final decision. I wish I had looked ahead at the lectures because I know that after seeing them I would not want to stay in the course.",
    "I would say that Anth 116 helped us to understand how our species came to be, and the steps along the way. It helped me understand about our ancestors, understand why we act the way we do, and to appreciate each adaptation which helped our species to be the strong, successful, and independent primate we are today. I would recommend this class in a heart beat.",
    "Yep, take it. Being able to recite the entire evolutionary history of mankind is actually pretty cool.",
    "I would only recommend this course if they are interested in the subject matter or if it is their major. Otherwise this course can be very difficult. It is a lot to memorize something you aren't very interested in.",
    "A course on human evolution in which you will learn a lot. I would definitely recommend it to another student, just because the subject matter is so interesting. Just be sure to pay attention to the slide shows, cause that's what you'll be tested on.",
    "This class was an introduction to biological anthropology beginning with basic principles of biology, such as natural selection and genetics, and moving to primate biology, human evolution, and finally the development of culture and how it is intertwined with biological factors. This is as good class for anyone who wants a science credit that is good general knowledge without being too specific or technical.",
    "ANTH 116 is an introduction to the major topics in biological anthropology, basically focusing on how modern humans evolved. Be warned that there is a LOT of material to cover in this class, and it is not curved. It\u0092s easy to get almost a 100% on your section quizzes, which are 30% of the grade, assuming you actually do the problem sets carefully and memorize your answers every week. The midterm and the final are trickier but doable IF you know what to expect. Definitely talk to someone who\u0092s taken the course before you study for the tests. There is a lot of memorizing involved. Professor Bribiescas is a pretty interesting lecturer, and my TF was good. All in all, definitely worth it--a science credit that won\u0092t kill your GPA if you put a decent amount of effort in, and not boring.",
    "It is a good overview of Biological Anthropology for anyone who may pursue the subject. It does go into some detail but overall, it provides a solid foundation. I would recommend this class if a student is considering the major or would like an introduction into human evolution.",
    "This class was apparently a gut. It wasnt. Yes everyone has the notes and the study guides and the lab portion is easy but the midterm was impossible - I dont think anyone got higher than an 80. Going to class is very boring.",
    "Yes if you are actually interested in anthropology. Some think its a gut although it is a very difficult class and tests require a lot of studying. No curves.",
    "If you need a science credit for non-science majors, take it.",
    "NO. DO NOT TAKE THIS UNLESS YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT MATTER. THIS IS NOT THE CLASS WHERE YOU SHOULD GET YOUR NON SCIENCE MAJOR CREDIT. NO NO NO.",
    "A gut that's not so terrifically easy to do well in. The grade is divided between section\/hw, a midterm and an exam. The midterms and exams are mostly multiple choice and the wording is horrendous and confusing, with double negative (which of the following is NOT true:...), etc... so it's very easy to get a so-so grade even by cramming and studying a lot for the midterms and exams.The material is mostly early human evolution - which is kind of interesting but gets very very tedious, and primate socioecology in the last 4 lectures, which is interesting. The 1st 2 lectures are totally misleading.",
    "Anthropology 116 is not a gut science anymore, if it ever was.Take this class if you want a non-quantitative science class and are willing to put in some work.The mandatory section meets on Science Hill and has a weekly quiz.",
    "This is an interesting course with a manageable workload, and it will serve to challenge your understanding of humans' history and humble you. The workload is fair: you are given reading every week and 5-10 questions on the reading\/info in lectures. In section, you are asked to write one of the answers for a lab quiz. This was an easy A. The lectures themselves provide much of this information, though you should do the reading. The material itself was not too challenging, though there was a good amount to memorize.The midterm and final were challenging because the material they had questions about was very specific. Also, there was nocurve, which was upsetting.I would recommend this course if you are interested in evolution and to better understand our world. Also, this class is not a lot of work, which is why people think it is a gut. I would say that it is not an easy A though because the midterm and final are hard + there is no curve.",
    "You study human evolution, involves lots of bones and monkeys.",
    "If you have a photographic memory and are fine with memorizing a lot of info then it's a good science credit",
    "It\u00b4s a good science credit for non-science majors. there is only a final and a midterm along with weekly quizzes (which are relatively easy). It is not a lot of work but it is important to do well on the midterm.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Bribiescas is pretty interesting to listen to and though the course material is not terribly exciting if you are not interested in primate evolution- Bribiescas tries to make it exciting. That is probably the best part. It is a good science credit but make sure to take it seriously. If you study hard you'll reap the benefits.",
    "It is fairly interesting, and its good information to know. Unfortunately, it is pretty hard. Even if you are prepped for the midterm it is rough and he doesn't curve anything.",
    "NO. NOT A GUT. DON'T TAKE.",
    "Only if you're willing to do a lot of work and only if you're really interested in the subject matter. The midterm and final are both really hard...",
    "After describing the pitfalls and origins of evolution, the course goes over the theories regarding human lineage. It then highlights the behavioral and physical consequences of all those evolutions, compared to other animals, mammals, and primates.I would recommend the class for students who don't mind memorizing a little.",
    "I would recommend Anth. 116 but they would need to be prepared to study more than they expected and review the material often. Expect the midterm to be worse than you think.",
    "ANTH 116 is a good class to choose to get that science credit out of the way, but do not be fooled, you will have to do a fair amount of work, basically lots of memorization. It won't work to have just a surface familiarity with the material for the exams, it's all recall. Memorize Prof B's slides and spit out the info on the exams. I did all of the reading for the class, I'm not sure it really helped as much as going to lecture and memorizing the lecture slides did, especially towards the end of the term when Prof B started to get more and more away from the textbook in his lectures. A good thing to know is that Prof B loves graphs, be familiar with them all. On the exams you will be asked to draw some of them. Anything Prof Bgets nerdily excited about in lecture will be on the exams, memorize it all.",
    "Anthro 116 is a great course if you are interested in human history and behavior from an evolutionary standpoint. It has a strong interest in both primatology and fossil evidence, which makes it a diverse course information-wise. I would suggest this course to anyone interested in combining evolution and social science. It makes a very nice science credit, although it involves plenty of memorization.",
    "It's a hard gut. If you do poorly on the midterm, stick it out because the lab helps you out and the final generally isn't as tough.",
    "Decent non-science class. Tough tests though.",
    "As a non-science major, I found this to be an interesting and relevant class to take for a SC credit \u0097 it's a pretty comprehensive overview of the history of human evolution. There is a lot of material covered and the midterm and final were not easy. A lot of the hardest work wasn't understanding concepts, but merely memorizing a lot of information (dates, places, facts, names, etc.). Lectures could be really dynamic or really, really, really boring, depending on the topic. But they're important. As is section \u0097 it's a big part of your grade and it's also really helpful. Anything covered in lecture or the textbook that's confusing can be answered by the TAs, who are all very knowledgeable and down-to-earth.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It's not too difficult while also providing a great overview of human evolutionary biology.",
    "This is a great science credit. The class is easy and interesting. If you have any interest at all in humans (which you should, since you are one), this is a great class.",
    "Pros:Almost no work week to weekPretty easy if you study for the midterm\/finalPretty interesting material...stuff you should knowCons:Studying for midterm\/finals SUCKS...pretty tough questionsReally BORING\/DISJOINTED lectures...hard and painful to follow\"Lab\" (50 minutes) is all the way up on science hillConclusion:I think this is a pretty solid class for non-science majors looking for a science credit.How you should navigate this class:Don't bother reading\/buying the book. It doesn't help much and you can easily get an A without it. Go to EVERY lecture and take good notes. Go to EVERY lab and take good notes. There is a problem set each week that doesn't need to be handed in. However, in \"lab\" each week there's a graded quiz question that comes straight off of the problem set, so you have to do the problem set (it's really easy). Study A LOT for the midterm\/final because that's pretty much your whole grade and there's a fair amount of detail (although nothingthat's only found in the book is on the test...hence you needn't read the book). Test questions come about 80-90% from the lecture and 10-20% from lab.",
    "This course offered scientific explanations of human behavior and morphology, such as race, mating behaviors, and lifespan based on evolutionary, behavioral, and comparative (with other primates) evidence. I would highly recommend this course, as it has many practical applications, it offers interesting insights into our species and our relationship to other organisms, and it's understandable science!",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. The lectures and subject material were very interesting, and Professor Bribiescas was fun to listen to.",
    "yes because there is not too much work, however there is also no curve. Overall, a good class though",
    "Yes, take it for a good science credit.",
    "This is a really interesting class and great if you are looking for a science credit. It is not too hard but engaging and I felt I learned a lot of new information.",
    "The class is divided in three major sections: the first describes the evolutionary theories such as Darwin, genetics etc. The second goes into the details of the different branches of human evolution; the third discusses the future of human diversity.",
    "This is NOT a gut. (Whoops, me). It is, however, really interesting -- if you're willing to put the time in and maybe have your GPA drop slightly, it's honestly a good science class. I definitely feel like a learned a lot. Grading can be frustrating because there's no curve.",
    "If you're at all interested in human evolution, take this course. Actually, even if you aren't, I'd still recommend this course. Professor Bribiescas is great. He's very fair, and you pretty much know what to expect on tests because the lectures, problem sets, and sections focus on what you need to know. The workload is pretty light, although you'll definitely need to study for the tests. It's definitely worth it to read the book and supplemental reading. If you can, definitely at least shop this course and skim through the book, and if you think any of it might interest you, take this course!",
    "Bio Anthro is a very interesting class but it is more difficult than it may seem. There is a lot of material that is covered that one will need to know for the test.",
    "take it for the science credit. there's basically no science. you need to memorize a lot for the midterm and final but the info is very straight forward",
    "A good class, especially if you need a science credit. It's something different and interesting, especially the parts on the fossilrecord. The midterm and final are multiple choice, and are usually about minute details, so sometimes arbitrary. But the class as a whole is interesting and a good way to earn that science credit.",
    "If you are interested in the subject then yes, if not, then it will be a pain.",
    "yes, absolutely take it!! this class was extremely interesting and you learn a lot. you start out with theoretical stuff about evolution and natural selection, then do human lineage, then move on to primate socioecology, intelligence, and life history. the midterm and the final are a lot of memorization if that's your thing. each week you have a problem set due for section, but instead of turning it in the TF picks one question and quizzes you on it. those were fairly easy. i definitely recommend stephen chester as a TF. also, i'm not entirely sure doing the readings in the textbook were really necessary if you go to lecture.",
    "It covers the classification, evolution, and behaviors of all primates, with an emphasis on the great apes and early hominins.I would not recommend it because it has no depth. It is mostly memorizing isolated facts about different primates. Labs are not particularly helpful preparation for the tests.",
    "Dont know what other science classes are out there but this is painful. Lectures are long. Exams are awful and it brings down your GPA",
    "Seems easy, but requires knowing an enormous amount of stuff you wouldn't think you need to know. Beware.",
    "STAY AWAY. this class is decievingly easy during the term, but there's only 1 midterm and a final, which means if you bomb either one you're screwed. he doesn't give any sort of study guide for any of the tests, so he literally just says \"know everything. k cool, ready go\". it's ridiculous. i ended up having to re-teach myself everything when it came time to studying because he didn't tie anything together during lecture",
    "It's not terribly difficult, even if it may seem so just before the midterm. A lot of the themes repeat themselves and if you have an inkling of interest in the subject you'll enjoy it.",
    "Anthropology 116 is a survey class on Human Evolution. The work is very manageable, however it is necessary to put a lot of work into studying for the midterm and final as they are substantially harder than the rest of the class (not to mention the vast majority of your grade)."
