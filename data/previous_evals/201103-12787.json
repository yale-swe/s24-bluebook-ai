    "Anne's big thing is to write what only you can write, and so I feel a little bad that what I'm saying about this class is completely redundant and unoriginal, but it's just an undeniable fact that this is the best class I've ever taken at Yale. It's the best class at Yale, and Anne is the best professor. She's incredibly dedicated and unbelievably passionate, and she cares so much about this course, and about you, that it shows in everything - the detailed syllabus, the 3-hour-long classes that feel like they're 20 minutes, the one-on-one conferences you have. It doesn't matter how good you are, you will leave this class a much, much better writer (and almost certainly a better person) than you were when you came in. You would have to be crazy not to take this if you can get in.",
    "If you get in and don't take this class, you're doing the wrong thing. Try to get into this class, keep applying, and find your way here because it's WORTH it. English469 is designed with attention and care to the progress it moves you through, carefully teaching you to think about place and all the complexity it entails. The readings are, for the most part, excellent and they feel like pleasure reading. The work produced by your classmates is just as good as some of the professional stuff you're reading sometimes. You leave the class with a new eye for detail, for words and sentences, and you'll be able to be a much better editor of your own work. This is a class that changes lives. Anne gets to know you as a person and encourages you to use who you are to become a better writer. It's impossible to leave this class without a better sense of who you are and what that means for your work. You learn, in Anne's words, to write what only you can write. It's not just coming up with a \"voice\" or a \"point of view\" that works for you--this class really walks you through a complex process of self reflection. It begins with three short 1,000 word pieces: one on a place on Yale's campus, one on your house\/home, and one on an object. Then it culminates in a large profile piece, where you write a 3,500 word piece on someone with an interesting job in the New Haven area. I entered the class thinking about reporting as a digging-up process, and with a lot of personal doubts about whether I could be a journalist--or if it's what I wanted. Anne's class helped me see that writing and reporting are about finding out what it means to be with and care for other people. She'll make you fall in love.",
    "I don't think you need my recommendation; this class is so hyped that you're probably going to take it if you get in, no matter what. The only thing I caution against is putting too much stock in the course; while it will improve your writing (both on a micro and macro scale) and force you to be more conscious of the decisions you make as a writer, it is not the be-all, end-all of your writing career, nor is Anne an infallible superhuman of a teacher. She's good, don't get me wrong; if nothing else, she forces you to pay attention to everything you write, and you'll learn a lot from that. However, at first I was afraid to disagree with her comments or even talk that much in class, and I think being so intimidated by the reputation of the professor and the course made my writing suffer a bit, especially at the beginning. Also, the class is, as Anne will proudly declare, a lot of work, and even if you take it Credit\/D\/Fail as she recommends, you'll end up doing much more than you anticipated, either because you don't want to disappoint her or because you're more interested in this work than that of any other course.",
    "If you get in, take this class. This is the first writing workshop I've taken in which I didn't feel stifled by competition among students. I learned very concrete tips on how to improve and revise my writing. I always felt engaged throughout our three hours of class, and I value the conferences I had with Anne above any other advising sessions I had at Yale.",
    "If you get in (I tried almost every semester, so don't get discouraged), totally take it. Anne Fadiman will improve you writing in ways you never even thought of. Take it.",
    "English 469 has an impressive syllabus of writing assignments, readings, and author visits. Everything ties together very well, and the class coheres in a lasting and enjoyable way. My writing improved noticeably, and I'm much more confident when going about it because of the little lessons that were included in each class. Anne is great at leading a section, as well as great to work with one-on-one for editing. The lessons about writing that she gave are indispensable, as well as the picture of a life of a writer that she painted for us; even just learning about Roget's Thesaurus was a leap for me as a writer. She can seem as though she's not listening to you sometimes, but she also is always very, very encouraging. She's also very organized, which is a great help in getting the maximum benefit out of the class.",
    "This is young writer's Valhalla. Just do it.",
    "Take it, duh! Professor Fadiman is so wise and good! Both the quality of your writing and your passion for the craft in general will skyrocket! You still may use words like skyrocket, but honestly, this is a wonderful course that will stick with you.",
    "If you are admitted to this course, know you are lucky. Anne Fadiman likes your writing. If you are admitted to English 469, you have to take it. It is the best class at Yale University. It is much like Thanksgiving \u0097 every good food (author\/assignment) in the world, crammed into one meal (course). 469's syllabus is to die for. You read a very manageable amount of one or two authors' work each week \u0097 Adam Gopnik, Joan Didion, John McPhee, and their cohorts \u0097 and open the class with a discussion of the week's reading. Five of our authors actually visited the class (Gay Talese came one week and everyone squealed a lot) and the rest were kind enough to take our questions viaemail. The second half of each 469 session moves into a close examination of one student's writing (every student's work gets discussed once in the semester). This sounds scary, and it is, but it turns out to be a totally pleasant and affirming experience because 1) Anne only picks pieces that are good and 2) everyone gets lovey-dovey and is super nice. The class requires three 1,000 word essays \u0097 one reported \u0097 in addition to one long-form reported piece centered around an individual you find in the Greater New Haven Yellow Pages. What else can I say? It's a terrific course that will improve your writing tremendously, and you should absolutely take it because Anne Fadiman will completely change how you think about writing. She did for me, anyway.",
    "Engl 469 is a high-level nonfiction class with a brilliant teacher and classmates whom you'll grow fond of. It's much more than a workshop; you'll also engage in close reading for craft and discussion of reporting and writing techniques. Anne has this class planned down to the very last detail, and it benefits hugely from the care and organization she lavishes on it. You'll also go over the nuts and bolts of your prose in individual conferences with her, which is really fun!Recommendations -- Take this class, not Anne's spring class, if you are more interested in reportage than memoir; take this class, not Journalism, if you care more about learning to write than being a Yale Journalism Scholar. The main differences between this and Prof. Strebeigh's class are that Engl 469 contains some memoir writing and Prof. Strebeigh's is strictly reportage, and that Engl 469 involves much more basic training in the reporting process for new reporters."
