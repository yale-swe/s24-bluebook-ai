    "Very disorganized. There were four homework assignments the entire year. The guest speakers were excellent. Overall, the lack of work is not worth the trouble of constantly changing specifications. This class had so much potential, but it went downhill very quickly.",
    "It was Slade's first semester teaching this class, but as it stands this is as close to a CS gut as you'll get. Only 3 assignments, each of which shouldn't take more than 45 minutes to an hour max. The midterm was slightly difficult only because the class was advertised as \"not a programming course\" but a course on decision systems whereas the midterm was purely Python and R syntax questions.",
    "You learn a lot of real-world skills if you put the time into it.",
    "Might be better in future years once they figure out how this course is supposed to work, but it was kind of a joke this time around. A couple of easy homework assignments in R and Python and a midterm that was entirely on R and Python syntax despite the assertion at the beginning of the semester that this was not a class about R and Python, plus a final project. Homework spec was incredibly vague and changed sometimes up until the due date. Content in lecture, homework, and midterm were 3 completely separate things so I guess this is a class to take if you want an easy course you don't need to ever attend, but you won't learn anything.",
    "Well, this course probably won't be offered again. If it in, just take it for kicks",
    "You could probably learn everything taught in this course in about one day of moderate studying. It is nice that they let you have a credit towards the CS major for that though.",
    "The course was understandably disorganized because it was the first year it was being taught and because enrollment was much larger than anticipated. The problem sets had the potential to be much more interesting than they ended up being, although one or two were thought-provoking.",
    "If you want an easy elective, go for it. You won't learn that much, though.",
    "I thought the subject matter was interesting, but we barely scratched the surface of anything in class. Lectures where 30% administrivia, 30% content, and 40% very slow examples and explanations and stories. There were quite a few guest lecturers from various companies including Facebook, which were the more interesting lecturers, but the whole class was not very well tied together. There was a lot of potential for an interesting class, but the content was just not there! The midterm was on minutae of R and Python and other than being the languages we used had nothing to do with the class. The homeworks were interesting, but were poorly defined, and there were only ... 4? The final project was the only really interesting thing, because you could make it as interesting as you wanted.",
    "I really didn't feel like I got a lot out of this class. It seemed at first like it would cover a lot of interesting topics, but it didn't actually materialize. I did get a lot better at R and Python, but keep in mind that neither is taught in the class if you don't already know them, you'll have to learn them yourself. It's very little work, though, so if you're looking for a low-effort CS elective to balance your courseload, this might be a good option for you.",
    "This course had no work. I stopped going to class during the second week because there was so little actual material to it. The final project emphasized originality but students were given bonus points for doing the project the professor suggested. There was an additional homework that could replace the lowest pset grade but we only had four psets in the first place, whereas we were supposed to have at least 9. The only thing I learned in this class were the concepts in my final project, unrelated to the rest of the class, R, and random econ concepts.",
    "If you are a Computer Science major this is probably not the class you are looking for (unless you are looking for a fifth). Otherwise, probably a good class for you.",
    "Had the potential to be an awesome class but fell short. Very disorganized. Did not learn very much. At least it was a gut though: 4 psets, a midterm, and final project. However, I did enjoy the guest lectures, some of them were really cool.",
    "You wont learn too many new technologies or cs concepts. Topics covered: programing in R, programming in Python, capital budgeting calculations, Monte Carlo simulations, linear regression. You will, however, learn some stuff about the world of finance and some portfolio management techniques. The class was also about 50% guest lectures, none of which was testable and therefore few people came. Low attendance with Professor Slade lectured as well because the lecture notes were easily available and lecture material was not relevant to the midterm and barely relevant to the homework. Granted, some of the guest lecturers were really interesting and about half of them came from finance and the other half from traditional tech companies. 4 homework assignments, midterm, and a self defined final project thats just Build an Automated Decision System. Take the class if youre trying to cruise or have an area that you want to explore on your own.",
    "Would not recommend, unless you're looking for a gutty CS elective. Lectures often felt off-topic and went into technical detail on non-CS topics (like finance) without going into much technical detail on CS topics. Slade had an ideology with assignments that they should be more open-ended and not heavily specified (like 323), but this didn't translate well to a large lecture where assignments were being auto-graded by TAs who did not share this ideology and wound up needing to write a real spec for each one. The final project was fun, but that was because we could pretty much do whatever we wanted. The course has potential if Slade makes some real changes, but I would not recommend it as is.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class unless you absolutely need a cs credit. This class is poorly organized, doesn't teach you anything, and doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The class was poorly specified psets that didn't really teach you anything and guest lectures from random people. When Slade was lecturing, he just read of the slides in a boring manner. And that was when he wasn't spending multiple lectures philosophizing on decision making. The saving grace of this class was that you didn't have to go and it wasn't that much work. Still a waste of a Yale credit.",
    "Yes",
    "Awful class, should not be offered again. The class has almost no material. I know that sounds like a ridiculous statement but it is absolutely true. Two thirds of the lectures in the later part of the class were random guest lecturers, and there was absolutely no reason to attend--the material wasn't tested in any way or a part of the hw. And in the few lectures that aren't random guests, almost nothing is taught. At the beginning I would sit there poised to take notes about the things Prof Slade was saying, but I wouldn't ended up writing down like 10 words in an hour, because Slade would not ever say anything relevant to anything. The psets were all very dumb--like very stupid spread sheet calculations or \"decision-making algorithms\" that taught you absolutely nothing. The midterm was entirely on knowledge of R and python syntax--it had nothing to do with the topic of the class, and none of the material tested on the midterm was actually presented or discussed in class. You were expected to just learn it on your own. I learned 0 things from this course--not one piece of information was learned by me. I honestly have no idea how a course like this was allowed to be taught at Yale. Its as though no one else in the CS department knew what was going on in this class and they just assumed it was a legitimate course. Well, it isn't. This is not a legitimate course. To reiterate, I hope that no future students ever read this review, because this class should not be taught at Yale ever again.",
    "Do not take this class. It is the worst class I have taken in the CS department. This is a finance class disguised as a CS course on decision systems. I learned nothing about decision systems. Slade is the worst. He refuses to answer questions, reads off lecture slides in the worst monotone possible, and does not actually teach anything related to the course topic. Do not be fooled by the syllabus. None of that information will be covered. The work load is light, but it is more stressful than such a low work load should be because expectations are incredibly unclear. You cannot do your psets as soon as they are assigned, because you can be sure that the specification will be changed repeatedly until the due date. No one, including the TA's, has any idea what is expected. Do not take this class.",
    "Ah, where do I begin-- this was a useless course that I ended up taking only to get a CS elective. I genuinely thought the course content would be interesting, and there was one problem set (the Monte Carlo blackjack simulator) that genuinely was, and everything else was just \"write code that does x\", where you basically hard-coded x as some decision system whose criteria were straightforward and trivial to implement in code. Like \"write code to calculate this sum\", with no room for creativity or really even any intellectual challenge. The lecture notes were posted online word for word, which totally killed students' motivation to attend class. The midterm exam was on content irrelevant to the course, the prof and TAs showed some of the worst organization\/synchronization I've seen at Yale, and I would argue that overall, this course was a waste of my time. Some of the guest lectures-- perhaps the 2 out of 15 that didn't focus on finance-- were somewhat interesting though too high-level for us to get much of value out of it. Is there anything redeeming about this class? I dunno, the final project maybe, but you don't have to have attended a single lecture of this course to have completed it. Find another course to take-- and this is coming from someone very interested in machine learning (which, though mentioned on the syllabus, was never actually covered in class, whoops!). I guess at least it's a low time commitment though, excluding the final project depending on what you come up with.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, and liked that it branched out into more domains than other CS electives. I also really enjoyed the open-endedness of the final project, which allowed me to pursue my own interests.",
    "lots of guest speakers, not many psets or work, project at end to do what you want. low-key, don't learn too much, but good chill CS course. Learn python and R.",
    "In the end, I didn't learn anything about \"decision systems\". Do not take it if 1) Stephen Slade is teaching it, and 2) There are more than 10 people signed up for it. If either (1) or (2) is not true, then MAYBE consider taking it.",
    "Interesting, but Professor Slade needs to structure his lectures. The course also needs many, many more TFs.",
    "This class had literally no direction at all. It ended up being a finance class and not a good one at that. Ended up being pretty easy but very frustrating because of the lack of direction with assignments. Would not recommend until the problems are solved.",
    "Easy (and somewhat interesting) but unclear assignments (I usually waited until a few days before the assignment was due so that most of the confusion was cleared up. Did not learn anything.",
    "CS 458 seemed interesting from the description, syllabus and instructor's background, but the class was utterly disappointing starting at about the third class. Just about half the lectures turned out to be guest lectures (only a few of which were interesting and gave new information), and in the end I learned just about nothing other than some R and Python. If you already know anything about probability and Monte Carlo methods, this class will be pretty useless for you. The grading, too, is frustrating as the assignments were incredibly easy but graded on an arbitrary test script. The midterm was then an exam on R and Python after the instructor informed us that the class would not be a class on R and Python.",
    "In its current iteration I would not recommend it. The course was a little disappointing since it did not cover that much material.",
    "DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT take this class. Do not be drawn in by its seductive syllabus. Do not think to yourself, \"eh, Slade seems like a dull lecturer, but half of the lectures will be guest lectures anyways.\" Do not believe that this class will help you practice some useful programming languages by doing assignments in R and Python. These are all mistakes I made, and I paid for them dearly. I spent hours reading through endless piazza posts trying to figure out what on earth I was supposed to do to complete nebulously defined (and hopelessly uninteresting) assignments. I struggled to combat sleep while being talked at for a couple hours every week as Slade read directly from his HTML document of full-sentence lecture notes. And at the end, I had zero knowledge to show for it.",
    "Slade is way better at writing course descriptions than he is at teaching the class. I honestly can't say I learned much about automated decision systems. I highly recommend you don't take this class.",
    "The problem sets are interesting, but this class is really poorly organized and you'll mostly likely be scrambling at the last minute to figure out what you're supposed to be learning.",
    "Little work, you will learn nothing.",
    "Automated Decision Systems was an interesting class; we looked at problems in both Python and R to solve the mysteries of everyday life. Topics covered were Monte-Carlo simulations, blackjack, net present value, and stock portfolios. Using backtesting for the stock simulation was useful in learning how to manipulate different datasets in a new programming language.",
    "I would recommend the course to someone who is interested in applying computer science in finance.",
    "This class will probably be different the next time it is offered, but it was kind of odd this time around. There were a lot of guest lectures, and much of the early class was about finance, but that seemed to be fine with a lot of students. Professor Slade is funny, and has worked on a lot of interesting stuff, so it's nice to have him teaching a class.",
    "A highly disorganized, ineffective course. The material is presented haphazardly, the assignments are trivially easy, and a lot of the lectures are random guests. I honestly feel like I learned very little overall. I really wouldn't recommend taking it unless you hear that the course is going to change drastically or if you desperately need an easy CS credit.",
    "I think this class was mostly a waste of a credit. I have pretty much never said that before about a class, but I don't think I learned much that I could actually point to, and I definitely learned much less than I had hoped to coming into the class. The expectations were set that we would be discussing how computers make decisions about some pretty interesting things, and that the problem sets would be teaching us how to make computers make smarter or faster decisions. However, the lectures ended up being very dry (though some of the guest lecturers were okay) and the psets basic. I would really not recommend this class, unless you're super into finance and want to learn some basic NPV calculations.",
    "This class is pretty disorganized. Initially he said there would be a pset a week but we just had 4 and they were pretty easy. everyone got 100% on them. The midterm tested how well you knew r and Python which was stupid because you can just google these things. The final project was a joke. Maybe he'll improve it next year.",
    "The class's goals were ambitious and the material could be interesting. Hopefully future versions are more focused. Beware a constantly evolving problem set spec. However, there are a lot of interesting guest speakers who get invited, and it's a good chance to get familiar with R and Python.",
    "This class is not tailored for people with advanced knowledge in CS, and this was never stated during the class (or shopping period). Do not take if you are a senior or junior, as you will not learn anything. Additionally, the work of the class is painful enough that it is not worth it as a gut class. Additionally, the class is severely understaffed.",
    "Do not take this course. It was extremely disorganized, and no material was taught. Better off taking STAT 230, 238 or 358. Not much work on assignments, but the inconsistent and unclear grading made it difficult for even knowledgeable students to do well (for a low workload, easy course). The midterm was a test of python\/R knowledge, which is ridiculous for a 400-level course, and an admission by the teaching staff that they had barely taught anything. The syllabus sounds incredibly interesting, it's unfortunate that it was so poorly executed, as the field of Automated Decisions (i.e machine learning) is exploding, and Yale CS is definitely lacking in courses addressing this material. Slade is a funny guy, and I believe has good intentions, but did not give the course enough attention to make it worthwhile. Lectures consisted of mostly note\/slide reading. Unless this course is significantly better organized next fall, I do not think it should be offered again.",
    "'Overall a disappointing course. The material offered a lot of promise, but was covered superficially or incoherently. It's hard to stay engaged when lectures are read off of a script, with little student engagement. A very weak learning experience. Unfortunately, the curriculum for the course was severely underdeveloped-- it veered to the one domain of finance when we were supposed to be learning more general algorithms\/architectures for decision-making. I don't feel any stronger in this area than when beginning the course. Definitely not worth it for the CS elective credit.",
    "It's a well intended course, but the execution is very, very poor. There was not much work but I didn't learn too much either. Perhaps some of the organizational issues will get resolved in future iterations.",
    "Automated decision systems was, unfortunately, a joke of a class. I had high expectations for it, but was largely disappointed over the course of the semester. That being said, it might just be the perfect CS elective ;) I had to spend very little time working on the assignments. We had \"weekly\" problem sets, but there were only 3 over the course of the whole semester and they took about and hour and a half each. The midterm was incredibly easy and the final project was also a joke. I hoped to learn something about automated decision making in this class, but it turned out to be just a refresher course for my R and python programming ability, both of which I was good at before taking this course.",
    "This class was not at all what I expected from the course description. Don't expect to really get anything out of it about how to use neural nets, linear regression, etc. to make decisions. It is basically just a series of guest lectures by various companies that want you to hire them. It is sort of like \"here is how you can make unreasonable amounts of money by coding for a hedge fund.\" Don't expect at all to be intellectually or academically stimulated. I am not a person who skips classes. Before this semester I had literally only skipped one class ever, and it was because I had an exam at the same time. But this class was the first time that I honestly felt that I was losing literally zero utility in my life from not going sometimes. This usually happened if there was a guest speaker talking about something that didn't interest me at all (like Wall Street).",
    "Do not take this class. The material is occasionally interesting but the assignments are an exercise in mind-reading, at best. I'm not really sure what I was supposed to take away from the class, other than \"Decison making is vague and there are lots of approaches\".",
    "It's not entirely clear if 458 is a computer science course or a finance course. You really just don't learn that much about computers. Serves as a sort of introduction to R, I guess, but little else.",
    "Yes! take this for the amazing guest speakers from palantir, google, aqr, and many more!",
    "In its current state, I would not recommend CPSC 458 to a fellow student. Although the subject is truly a fascinating one, Professor Slade skipped through the interesting details! We skimmed through numerous topics at too abstract a level for any learning to actually take place. The lectures consisted of Professor Slade reading off the course website he had thrown together. The assessment method for this course also leaves a lot of room for improvement. There were four problem sets, each with poorly written specifications. The hardest part was often deciphering exactly what the staff was looking for. The midterm consisted of memorizing various facets of R and Python. The only saving grace was the final project, where we were asked to construct a decision system. The specification was open enough that you could really tackle whatever you wanted. In short, I do not recommend this course in its current state. Although the material has the potential to be fascinating, too many pieces need to be fixed for it to be worth taking.",
    "I would not recommend this class. The material sounds very exciting, but it is very poorly taught. Plus you have to deal with problems sets with incredibly vague specifications that change over the course of the week and deal with the Professor and TAs having different grading standards for the psets.",
    "All CS electives are terrible. Don't expect to learn much from this course. That said, the final project is a great opportunity.",
    "If you want CS elective that is very little work, take this. Otherwise, please don't. The class is not taught well, and you will spend 10x more time being frustrated with the class and how it is taught than you will be with the problem sets of the course. Nobody goes to lecture because there is never an incentive to do so."
