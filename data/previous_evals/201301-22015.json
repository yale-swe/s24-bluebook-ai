   "comments": [
    "It's a continuation of Italian 110, but less grammar-focused and more culturally inclined--more films, a book, and opera. Recommended to anyone who took Italian 110.",
    "120 builds on the course material learned in 110, beginning with the last four chapters of the Parliamo Italiano book. After the book is finished, we go over culture in-depth, watching movies, analyzing poems, and the like. You'll be surprised to see how much you've really learned by the semester's end.",
    "This course focuses on culture much more than Italian 110 did, and by about halfway through the semester you are done studying grammar. I would definitely recommend this class to someone interested in getting closer to fluency in the Italian language. Great continuation of Italian language study!!",
    "Take this class if you want to learn Italian. The course is very straightforward and forces you to engage with the language in an efficient and productive manner.",
    "Italian 120 is a good extension of Italian 110 that moves at a bit slower pace. Hard tests though.",
    "It's a good class, not a GUT but also not too difficult. Take it if you enjoy the culture and actually want to learn Italian.",
    "The italian department as a whole is really fun! This is a good class for students interested in a fun language with a rich culture."
