   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommend. Working with Daniel is really rewarding and instructive as a performer.",
    "This course helped me to step outside of my comfort zones and grow as an actor. I strongly recommend taking the course with Larlham, as it is structured brilliantly, focusing on both kinetics\/movement and scene study.",
    "Yes take this course, it's required for the THST major. It's different from other courses. MEMORIZE YOUR LINES!",
    "This is an excellent course. If you enjoy approaching theatre from a movement and impulse based area, this is the course for you. And even if you don't enjoy that, you should probably take this course, because you should and if you were to enjoy it with anyone it would be with Daniel.",
    "Definitely take it. Take it with Daniel. He will really help you to grow as a performer in your scene study. It will be hard but amazing.",
    "I would totally recommend Theater Studies 210 to another student. You'll love it and you'll leave feeling more confident in your ideas about the practice of theater and having discovered new ones.",
    "If you're a theater studies major, you have to take it. If you're not, I'm not sure why you'd take it; go do Sudler shows instead, where you can work on real projects instead of doing the unconventional, abstract theater activities in this course (which comprise the grand majority of the semester.) As a theater major, I found the class very valuable, but I'm not sure it would have made sense for me to take it otherwise."
