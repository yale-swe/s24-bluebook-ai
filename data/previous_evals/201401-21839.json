    "Art 369 was an excellent course. I learned so much -- both design techniques and technical skills (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Adobe Creative Suite). I entered the class having never coded in my life before and can now design aesthetically beautiful and functional websites, responsive for both mobile and large screens. I can not emphasize enough how good an experience this class was, how much it has changed how I think about design and building effective websites, and how valuable the coding background I gained will be for me as I embark on future computer science study and coding work. Laurel Schwulst was an excellent instructor across the board. I learned so much from her. If we needed extra help or wanted to learn more outside of the scope of the class, she responded immediately, went out of her way to help us, and always encouraged us with enthusiasm. Laurel prepared creative and engaging assignments so that the class time and homework time was always well spent. She had us learn by DOING, which was so much more effective than other classes I have taken on similar topics. I highly recommend Interactive Design and Laurel as an instructor to any Yale student interested in learning a lot about this subject and being challenged to create original and interesting work in the process.",
    "Highly recommend. If you want a fairly chill class where you will earn HTML and CSS, this is it.",
    "Definitely take this class! You learn a lot technically, if you have never coded before it's a well paced introduction. If you have, it's a fantastic place to start thinking about design and online work conceptually. Laurel is great!",
    "Definitely take if interested!",
    "Interactive Design focuses on creating art using the internet as a medium. I learned a lot from this class even though (maybe especially because) I already had some of the technical skills in HTML and CSS to build on, but didn't have much of a design background. The assignments really pushed me to think about design and function in different ways, which was also helpful.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It was a lot of work, especially due to the learning curve if you've never dealt with html or css before, but I got a lot out of it. Laurel is always available for specific questions and often has a solution. The internet truly is a creative medium, and this class allowed me to explore it as such.",
    "In summary, it is a web design course that will take you from nothing to the ability to build an interactive website. Highly recommended if you are interested in learning HTML\/CSS."
