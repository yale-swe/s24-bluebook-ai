    "very interesting course. an essential course for anyone who would be engaging in patient care and public health.",
    "Great",
    "some topics are too professional",
    "Guidelines for midterm essay should more clear. Also there is no feedback on the essay. I don't know where to improve.",
    "The class time was a negative.",
    "The pop quizes seem a bit silly and are remind me a bit of middle school. Some of the lecturers were dynamic and interesting. Would have been much less painful if the class was not at 8AM. Very little guidance for midterm exam (compare\/contrast two papers) with no clear expectations and therefore questionable grading scheme.",
    "Strengths: Interesting course materialWeaknesses: Time of day, lecture styles, poor attendance of students in a small classWays to improve: Change the time of day of the course (aka not at 8 AM), or be more assertive about students being on time; people coming in 30 minutes late to a very small classroom every single week must have been very frustrating to the instructors; I've never seen a class before where that was the norm.For the actual class, I think more case-based classes (like we did for the last lecture) would be much more engaging than lectures every week. The quiz should be planned, not a pop-quiz; none of us had studied the material at all at that point. I felt the midterm was completely irrelevant to the course material (compare and contrast two articles), and I would have preferred it be based on the lectures. I was also slightly frustrated that we weren't given our midterms back, only told our grade; I tried to ask for it but never got it. The final exam was very fair.",
    "Useful as an introductory course",
    "excellant",
    "Great course - given the type of course, I found it excellent. Learned a ton.",
    "It's a good course and provides a lot of information in a practical manner, bringing everything back to the actual field work and application of the concepts.",
    "Strenghts:- Not very labor intensive. If you are taking several course with heavy loads then this may balance it out- If you are a physician or med student you will learn things in class that will help you as a clinician.Weaknesses- Class was at 8 am on Tuesday.How to improve:- More class interaction is needed. For a morning class, where everyone tends to be very tired a non interactive lecturer will put people to sleep."

   "comments": [
    "highly recommended",
    "Recommend",
    "many interesting topics",
    "This course provides a wide overview of the areas of Occupational and Environmental health. So I would recommend it as a introductory course if one is interested but has no background in the area",
    "Overall not an incredibly demanding course butthe timing and pop quizes are less than ideal. The grading is confusing, and little to no guidance was provided for the midterm paper. The material may be interesting to some, but I found it a bit dry (although clearly important from a public health\/medical perspective).",
    "This is a course on exactly its title - the different aspects of environmental and occupational medicine.I would ONLY suggest this course to students already in medicine or interested in medical school. Some of the material will be too technical for those without a medical background, but you won't be tested on it.",
    "Good",
    "Highly recommend the course - very enjoyable, and I learned a ton. Perhaps my favorite class of the semester.",
    "This is good overall course that will familiarize you with the subject matter and you will finish it with a good understanding of occupational and environmental medicine. The hour is early and it's hard to wake up for, but if you want working knowledge of the subject matter for future reference, this class is perfect.",
    "The term I took this class the mark was divided as follows- 1 pop quiz- midterm was a comparitive essay on 2 disease-exposure papers- final exam was in class. Closed book. Typed your responses on computer to hand wrote them onpaper."
