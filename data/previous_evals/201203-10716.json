   "comments": [
    "yeah go for it. you learn a lot of neat stuff.",
    "Absolutely. It's very good for students to know more about physics in biology.",
    "This was a fantastic course. I came in with a physics background and greatly enjoyed the opportunity to apply physical intuition to polymers, cells, diffusion, etc... Tying the course to matlab was a great idea. I had never used it for serious work before, and after the extensive practice from this class, I feel much more proficient and comfortable with the program. The four modules, each with a teacher expert in that area, were well structured and kept the class on its toes.",
    "Provide a good perspective to understand biological phenomena.",
    "I thought it was good to have the class uniting students and professors of different backgrounds, although it sometimes seemed to be more weighted towards physics and math than the actual biological context. I would recommend the class if the student has a pretty good background in math and physics.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, this class is one of the only class to deal with problems between physics, biology proposed at the grad level.",
    "Biological Physics is a computationally-based course that is designed to show the application of fundamental physics laws to the field of cell and molecular biology. In general, the course had many different topics covered throughout the course of the semester and the course load was manageable. One of the only negative aspects of the course is the fact that it sometimes felt disjointed due to the different professors teaching the course (each with different teaching \/ assignment style). Overall, I would recommend the course to a fellow student.",
    "It was a very good course that covered a lot of material and many important topics. I would recommend this course, but also warn the student that there will be a lot of work to do in this class.",
    "Great course and helpful!",
    "Biological Physics is a good introduction to its topic. Since it's a mezzanine course catering to both bio students and physics\/engineering students, it may at times feel closer to an undergraduate course, as it has to cover many different levels of knowledge. It almost feels like it's meant for physics undergrads and bio grads, and it's excellent for both. However, I'd certainly recommend it to physics and engineering grads as well, if you have little background in biophysics and would like to learn some of its basics with a strong physics grounding.",
    "I would...but with some reservation.I'm not so sure if so much time should be spent on polymer physics. The polymer physics problem sets were WELL written but the simulations quickly felt very repetitive."

   "comments": [
    "This course is like an overview of how physics can have an influence on biology. It helps broaden my horizon and is related to my research.",
    "Wendell's Evaluation.I really can't thank Wendell enough. Of all the TA's I've had through three years at Yale, he was undoubtedly the best and the most generous with his time. Despite what was clearly a full load of his own work, he always made time for me and the other students, well above and beyond his stated office hours. His depth of knowledge and proficiency with the material on psets was incredibly impressive. His teaching\/helping style was quite effective, in that he never gave us the answers but knew just how to guide us to figure it out for ourselves. His help with matlab was invaluable, and his thoughtful explanations have helped me reach a point where I am confident using matlab for analyses beyond this class. I honestly can't recommend Wendell highly enough, and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.",
    "I learned a lot of principles and ideas and how to approach problems from a physical perspective. I don't know how much will relate to my research. I did learn how to program in Matlab, which will be useful.",
    "Although the course did not provide many direct implications for my dissertation research, it did deepen my understanding of physics (i.e., statistical mechanics and its direct applications) and how it can be applied in a biological system. Overall, the course provided a foundation for probability theory, statistical mechanics, and polymer physics that can be useful tools with research",
    "One of the best parts of this course was the broadness of topics. It touched on a number of topics that are relevant to my field, and some that were not. The ones that were not relevant still deepened my understanding of the field, as well as exposed me to other branches of research.",
    "This course informed my knowledge of my discipline to a relatively large degree - before, I knew almost nothing about biophysics, and now I understand some of what work exists in the field and I know how to learn more about it.",
    "this course basically taught me how integrated scientists are thinking. It wasnt just about learning catch phrases or lingo, but rather the derivation of concepts common place in biology."
