    "Instructor: Paul Berne Burow \u00a0Paul was very helpful in articulating the concepts from class, and brainstorming for the final paper. I enjoyed his lecture on the last day very much.",
    "Instructor: Paul Berne Burow \u00a0Paul is clearly extremely knowledgeable and very smart. I felt comfortable with him and think he did a great job in the class. When we met with Paul in our groups I really appreciated the interactions with him. However, during the final course that Paul taught it felt too much like a lecture at a conference rather than suited for the class at hand. Maybe in part because it felt like a different style than Carol normally teaches but it felt a little too scripted and a little \"too academic\". I was able to grasp what Paul was communicating best during the Q & A or when he wasn't reading off his notes.",
    "Instructor: Paul Berne Burow \u00a0Paul was very helpful and responsive to requests for help--sometimes I did feel like he was sort of giving us the cheat sheet for how Carol likes to see things. Which was helpful, but also kind of odd.",
    "Instructor: Paul Berne Burow \u00a0Paul was excellent, he worked well with us and was always available to help especially when we were writing our term paper.",
    "Instructor: Paul Berne Burow \u00a0He is very accessible and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Paul Berne Burow \u00a0I thought the TA was an extremely valuable member of the class. His lecture at the end of the semester was quite good. He also made insightful comments during the weekly class discussions. If anything, I would have liked to hear more of his comments. I am not exactly sure why we had to meet with him before leading discussions. I found these meetings of limited use."

   "comments": [
    "There was incredibly too much reading in this course.",
    "I think that every single FES student that plans to go into development or conservation fields should be required to take this course.",
    "Professor Carpenter is excellent, and I think more FES students need this critical lens. However, sometimes lectures were difficult to get through. Perhaps if the material was presented more clearly (rather than jumping from one author to another and back), and also if she didn't just read dense notes, it might be more engaging. More of a summary of key ideas in conversation would be useful. I liked that our reading responses were thesis sentences.",
    "Lectures could perhaps be somewhat shorter in length, and class discussion could be better moderated by student discussants. In other classes, student discussants would present a quick 10 minute response of key points and discussion would follow - this might be one way of encouraging deeper participation\/discussion following the lectures.",
    "I thought the course content was incredibly valuable, but its delivery was somewhat difficult. Sometimes the reading was very dense and difficult to get through (I would sometimes spend half of my weekend getting through assigned reading for this class). In addition, the lecture delivery was really tough to sit through. Carol has interesting content to provide, but she reads her lectures from typed notes, sometimes verbatim, and that makes for a really long initial hour and a half of class.",
    "Question 14: I am impressed with this course because of my interest in International and rural development. It exposed me to interesting literature and shaped the way i think about development aid and conservation. I am very impressed with the interrelatedness and the connection between each week's reading and the previous and how it all addressed and exposed issue relating to development and conservation.",
    "I think this is a critical course for any FESer. The ideas covered in the course are SO important. I think the professor got off on tangents too much. This was a bit distracting. Also, it was a bit hard to follow the professor when she reads off of her notes. A quick note about reading the class: when students aren't asking questions and nobody is commenting, this is generally an indicator that people are confused. The teacher would often ask the class if there were any questions and people would be quiet, for the most part. This is not a great sign. Even if people say they have no questions, they may be so confused that they don't know how to even being formulating a question."

    "I think the practice of writing thesis statements is an extremely useful exercise. I think it would be helpful if the professor continued to post her own thesis statements throughout the semester. I'm not sure why she stops posting them so early in the semester. Having examples to work off of is never a bad thing. The readings for this course are also really great. At times, I felt I had to rush through the readings, but that is sometimes unavoidable. I felt the responsibility of leading class discussions was super valuable."

    "Lectures",
    "A more stimulating structure of student discussion would be useful - perhaps alternative formats could be tested? Alternately, it might be interesting if students gave the initial lecture and the lecturer acted as a respondent.",

    "Individual guidance for what is expected in final papers and thesis sentences",
    "I felt a little bit lost during lecture so may be focusing it on a more dynamic way would help.",
    "The class periods are really long, and sometimes it felt overwhelming to do the readings, have a lecture on the readings, and then discuss the readings - there were times that I wished there were some new topics\/case studies that were introduced in class that went beyond the readings.",
    "I think the class discussions need to be more effectively managed. That is not to say that the professor needs to be more involved in the discussions. While it is nice to hear the professor's thoughts on a topic, the discussions should be a time for the students to talk about the readings. Sometimes I felt that the professor interjected too much. Another area of improvement for the course is the final term paper. I don't think there was enough guidance for the final term paper. I would also like if we were able to read some papers that were more like the papers we were asked to write in the end. So few classes do that. So few classes have the students read writing that is similar to the writing the students are asked to do. I would have liked to see examples from previous years of great papers."

Some of my favorite readings were about TEK, wilderness, environmental management, economics, and participation. I felt these topics related well to all student interests. That being said, obviously the lessons learned from the more forestry-oriented articles can be abstracted and are applicable to all students.

The course will challenge your assumptions and helps students become more imaginative thinkers and more critical problem solvers.
