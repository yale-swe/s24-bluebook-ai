   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course if you are at all interested in going into finance. These are great things to learn that will likely be applicable in some aspect of your future work. I thought that the material was presented well and that the professor and teaching fellows were eager to help and made themselves available to students.",
    "Honestly, don't take it. The professor is terrible and regurgitates the textbook. He also has an extremely strong Spanish? accent that I had a hard time getting used to. The subject material is uninteresting. It's kind of a lot of work, and the TFs and Professor aren't particularly accommodating. It was frustrating and boring. Also, no one comes to class. In the first couple lectures, people were sitting in the aisles in SSS 114; in the last week, there were probably like 20 people in the whole classroom. I really regret putting this class in my schedule--my time at Yale is limited and there are so many more intellectually stimulating courses than Corporate Finance.",
    "If you secretly hate the whole liberal arts idea and think Yale is just a stepping stone to McKinsey, et. al., then this is your class. It's pretty easy, so there's that going for it.",
    "bad. a lot of work, the lectures DID not prepare you for the psets well and some of the grading and leniency to make changes to grading was quite poor. the psets will take you a LONG time. the professor was unable to make the lecture interesting and basically drew everything from the book. his latino accent also isn't very fun to try to understand and learn the material at the same time. this course need a LOT of work, especially because literally 1\/2 of yale intends to take it due to their interest in finance. extremely naive of the professor to think only 40 yalies would originally take the class. you can learn a good amount of stuff pertinent to finance from the book. no real point in the lectures.",
    "If you are taking this because you are going into finance, it's not worth it. You can teach yourself all of this stuff, and your time would be better spent taking an SOM class if you really want to get more training for job\/internship.",
    "Great way to be introduced to finance.",
    "Boring lecture, can learn the material on your own via lecture slides, but if you are interested in finance then decent class. Recommendation is to take corporate finance at the SOM instead!",
    "This class is awful and poorly taught, although the material is interesting and useful, so go figure.",
    "If you want to work in the finance industry after graduation, but have little to no background knowledge in the subject matter, this class is a great place to start. Straightforward course with 4 problem sets, a midterm, and a final.",
    "Take this Cr\/D if you want to learn it for your career. Lecture is really dull and psets are very hard.",
    "Cool class where you learn some pretty useful information.",
    "The lectures and weekly quizzes were very organized, but the problem sets and final were a bit of a mess. Professor Espin-Sanchez read out of the slides every single lecture, so going to class was very useless. I got more out of reading the slides on my own than attending. Then, the problem sets were a complete mess. Literally you would have to beg TAs to explain why to use one formula over another, without understanding really why. That happened towards the end, which made studying for the final very difficult. Overall, I did learn stuff but I am not sure it was worth it.",
    "Pretty good course to take because it's useful, but class is pretty difficult to sit through since the professor just reads from the slides",
    "Hmm. More useful than nearly all other classes but still not the type of questions you'll get in finance interviews. The midterm was very easy which meant you couldn't make a single mistake (and they were partial-credit Nazis), and then the final was very challenging, so who knows. 4 problems sets (only 3 count) and weekly online quizzes. There was also basically no point in going to lectures if you keep up on your own.",
    "Do it but remember: if you want to work at the goldman sachs you will need to get an A in this - not easy to explain anything less to a banking employer",
    "People will take Intro finance whether its taught well or not. This one in particular is not - very dry lecture and pretty dry material, but it's a must for anyone heading into finance.",
    "Does as promised, but be prepared for total stupefying boredom. Really hope somebody else teaches this next year and tries to revamp it. Generally it's just embarrassing that this is Yale College's first corporate finance course, and it was executed so poorly.",
    "Take it if you are mildly interested in finance. Helpful stuff that you'll be asked all the time in IBD interviews.",
    "I think this is a good class that students interested in business should take. It introduced us to a lot of different topics. It was maybe a little bit too broad because we didn't go too in-depth into anything (such as valuation) but that is the nature of an intro course. It was a decent amount of work with weekly quizzes and lengthy problem sets, but it wasn't too bad. The midterm was easy but the final was harder, so we'll see what the curve is like. Grading seemed similar to most econ courses though.",
    "don't take, not worth it.",
    "this was a pretty good class concept-wise, definitely interesting and important things to know for econ\/finance people (if you aren't into either of those things then this is not for you). however, espin-sanchez was not a good professor. he had a pretty thick accent which wasn't too bad to understand but he was just not a good teacher. take it maybe. i hope they offer it with someone else.",
    "This class was just as bad as about every other econ course at Yale and was miserable at times because of pset, exam and lecture mistakes....but you absolutely have to take this if you are going into finance. The topics are ones you will definitely encounter in the workplace and be happy you covered in class.",
    "Take it if you want a general overview on financial concepts.",
    "Take this class if you want a pretty basic understanding into finance. Problem sets are pretty lengthy. I would advise against this class if you're not really into finance.",
    "Easy to study for",
    "Textbook, syllabus, and material covered was exactly what you would expect and what should be taught in an intro finance course. Very easy class if you have background in finance (from other classes, clubs, internships, etc.). Could be difficult if you've had no exposure to finance. VERY few people attended lectures though (probably about 20 out of 300). Also about 100 people dropped throughout the semester, probably due to the way the class was taught during lecture. Very doable though by reading the textbook and going over the powerpoint slides, just don't get too behind. Only 4 psets, 3 of which are graded, plus a midterm and final.",
    "First time that the course was being taught. Not many students attended lecture because lecture seemed to be directly from the book. I didn't feel like the material was \"corp finance\"...it was more on selling\/buying assets. I was hoping there to be more analysis on cash flows.",
    "Not a great class. Lectures boring and hard to follow. Wasn't very well organized. Home works didn't reflect the material taught in lecture. Midterm was very straightforward and final was much more difficult. There are better econ classes to take",
    "Not a hard course, but kind of dull. Probably not as useful as it sounds. Financial Theory is more fun. Overall, an okay course. Getting an A is probably not hard if you study in a scheduled manner.",
    "Go for it. It's easy and you'll maybe learn some valuable stuff. But it's hideously boring, the quizzes are irritating, and the problem sets are behemoths that are usually too hard to be related to tests. So don't get too excited about it.",
    "Good",
    "Take it if you're interested. You'll have to work, but its worth it",
    "Useful but terrible.",
    "Don't take this course; read investopedia instead.",
    "Recommend this course but not with this professor nor these TFs; if you want to learn corporate finance, just read a textbook by yourself; but again it's a course that Yale should provide to students who are interested in finance in general.",
    "Terrible",
    "Useful for an IB interview, but not very well taught",
    "Don't take this class.",
    "ECON 255 was an okay class. I would only recommend taking this class if you want to commit to learning the material in a formal setting. The majority of the material was taken from the textbook so it'd be possible to read the textbook and learn it on your own, but the lectures were well-paced and pretty clear so I think they were beneficial. There was a decent amount of work for this class--four problem sets and time-consuming weekly quizzes--but this work helps you stay on top of the material.",
    "Yes most definitely. The problem sets are a grind but are well worth it.",
    "You won't very much new material in lecture, so you need to learn a lot of the material on your own. A decent intro to corporate finance though, and it's nice that you can take this for Econ credit.",
    "Meh. Very interesting material, lectures weren't engaging, by the end of the semester only a handful of people showed up for lecture that was help in SSS114. Overall not bad.",
    "ABSOLUTELY do not take it. Waste of a course, waste of time. Try to get an experience in the field in any other way - online, with a book, through an internship... All this course will teach you is a bunch of formulas and definitions. Even if you are an econ major, there is plenty of better classes out there, and you will learn this material eventually.",
    "Do not take this course. Definitely one of the worst classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "An overview of corporate finance and different financial securities. I would definitely recommend it to another student because I believe that these concepts are important for anyone who imagines themselves running a business or managing their finances in the future.",
    "This is a highly subscribed class with great teaching, but material that can be quite dry at times. Definitely not a gut class since the workload is very concentrated in four long psets and also since grades were very concentrated, you would often find yourself fighting for points. Nonetheless I would recommend this class.",
    "The information is something peoples should learn, but there are better ways to learn it. I wouldn't take this again.",
    "Harder than expected, but good information to know to go into finance. Make sure you keep up with the work.",
    "I learned a lot and liked the material but I learned most of it from the book. So although the lectures weren't great, it was still a valuable class. I would recommend it to someone who wants to learn the material.",
    "I would probably not recommend this class unless you're really interested in the course. The lectures are pointless since the prof just reads off the slides and the tests\/psets are really hard! that being said it's a manageable class (4 psets, midterm, final, weekly quizzes where you can google answers)",
    "Definitely take it if you are interested in finance or just want to know. the work load is not that bad.",
    "This class is worthwhile. You will probably need to know this material if you want to go into anything finance\/consulting related. Be careful, it gets harder after the midterm.",
    "I would summarize it as a class in which one can learn all about business, investment, and financing skills. A truly invaluable class.",
    "Standard issue intro course for corporate finance. You learn about how to evaluate business decisions, as well as calculate the value of various financial instruments such as stocks and bonds. Highly recommended if you plan on going into any type of financial sector job. The professor is a bit difficult to understand, but the textbook can easily make up for whatever you miss in lecture. Class was unorganized, but it was the first time this course was offered, so I expect it will be better in the future.",
    "I would not recommend this for other students until it is at least under new guidance.",
    "I was frankly embarrassed by the way Econ 255, aka \"Spanish Algebra,\" was taught. As the only relevant undergrad finance course at Yale, I would've hoped that the material could have been taught in a professional manner. Instead, I would have gotten the same skills from reading the textbook. Also, the final exam was unfairly difficult (especially relative to earlier assignments) and left students with no opportunity to demonstrate what they had learned.",
    "I hope they get new TAs or at least more competent ones for this course in the future. They couldn't figure out standard TA things like : how to hand in exams efficiently, how to hand back exams efficiently, how to grade problem sets in a way that is efficient for both students and TA, how to communicate with students... And don't get me started with how inaccurate the pset grading was. Even going through the final corrected versions of problem sets before the exam, I found so many errors (and I didn't even do well in the class). Check the problem sets and finals before you put them up\/print them. The final had so many typoes it wasn't even understandable. The expectation that we all write our section number down on every exam is ridiculous (no student knows that.) all in all, good useful class executed in the worst imaginable way.",
    "I wouldn't take it again -- there's nothing taught in the class that you can't really look up in a textbook.",
    "A shit ton of work but not intellectually challenging. Only take if you're personally interested in the subject. You learn the basics of a lot of finance concepts that actually are applicable in the real world, but there are weekly quizzes, biweekly psets, a midterm, and final. A LOT OF WORK. Psets took forever because it's a lot of busiwork.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS. DO NOT EVEN SHOP THIS. IN FACT I WONDER IF IT WILL EVEN BE OFFERED NEXT YEAR. The most disastrous class that I have ever taken in my life. Professor Sanchez might be the worst and disinterested teacher I have had since well... even beyind high school. Lectures were directly copying textbook content, he was a very poor lecturer in terms of explaining concepts, and ofcourse the TAs were SOM kids with the smallest inclination to teach. I had previous background in some of the things we did in this class, and yet I have to say that it's almost like Yale Econ Department\/Professor Sanchez is trolling Yalies who want to go into Finance by trying to show them that it's a really dry subject. There is an evident disinterest in teaching this class at all levels. Ridiculous!!",
    "there are definitely better Econ electives out there. worth your time, but could be better.",
    "Good overview and introduction to many things corporate finance; good either as a start or as a complementary course that gives you sufficient knowledge about the basics of CF.",
    "No, unless they change the structure and improve the teaching. It had a lot of potential but does not get a good review from me.",
    "Take it if you want to but it's such a poorly structured class. Hopefully it gets better in the following years.",
    "This is a useful class for an introduction to corporate finance.",
    "A rather boring introduction to a field that has a lot of potential. It centers exclusively around the textbook, and the material is generally quite easy. A medium amount of work.",
    "A ridiculously hard class with too much content and not enough support to grasp all the concepts well.",
    "Nah don't think you need it",
    "Very hard. A lot of work. Tangible information, however."
