   "comments": [
    "Fast-paced and interesting. The readings can be somewhat overwhelming. Professor De's lectures can sometimes be tiring because he speaks quickly and rarely pauses. The material taught is extremely interesting and Professor De clearly has a firm grasp on the content. He is also charismatic and kind, making the class a pleasant experience. If you can, get Ashish Mitter as your TA, his sections improved my understanding of the material substantially.",
    "Yes definitely take it. Not entirely comprehensive but it goes in depth into a lot of the major points and events.",
    "Yes! Everyone should take this course to understand the region, but also because of the quality of instruction provided by Professor De.",
    "Great class on complex subject",
    "HIST 396 covers nearly all aspects of Indian & Pakistani politics, cultures, societies, and life in the years following Independence and up until the present day. It is comprehensive and discusses a breadth of eras, regions, and ideas, but if you know little about the region or simply want to know more, I assure you that you will learn a great deal more than what you already know. Take this if you have any interest at all in the region, or in learning about how societies grow out of their colonial predecessors.",
    "Phenomenal introduction to Indian history with some Pakistan and Bangladesh on the side. Professor De is a uniquely gifted instructor who effectively uses multimedia, movies, and lecturing in order to produce an incredibly engaging classroom experience. He cares deeply about both the material he teaches and the students in his class, and was very accessible outside of the classroom for further discussion. The course itself covers a broad range of topics--economics, industrialization, culture, arts, militarism, politics, etc--and my only critique is that, in his effort to make this course as comprehensive as possible, Professor De could cram too much information into a given lecture or allow himself to get disorganized. Additionally, it was difficult to keep track of what time period we were in or how certain themes\/events in one country overlapped with themes\/events in the other country. I think the course would benefit from a clearer overall structure, more organized powerpoint presentations, and a clearer grading rubric (which was pretty harsh at times). Other than that, it was a phenomenal course.",
    "Best lecture that covers nearly all affairs of South Asia. Yes - take it.",
    "The class is so well taught! So interesting and great readings, although there are a lot of them. I truly enjoy how Prof De incorporates videos to make the lecture less dull. Although he does talk fast, but it's because he's so smart and has so much to say. He is a phenomenal professor. Section depends on the TA - my TA wasn't that good. The exams are doable, and the other writing assignments are quite small although they do have arbitrary grading.",
    "Very good class. Key history for a modern understand of the the world. Lectures could be more organized on the whole. Shop two classes and if you feel lost don't take it. If you don't, however, Prof. De is one of the most caring and accommodating professors I've ever had, so you'll have a great experience. I also liked most of the assignments and section was great.",
    "Dope lecture, probably one of the best in the history department. Rohit De is the best lecturer I've encountered so far -- and he actually cares about his students! Get to know him, he's a chiller",
    "I would say that this is a great overview course if you have any interest in the region at all and would definitely recommend taking it."
