    "A basic introduction to reading real Ancient Greek prose. The pace was a bit slow, but that depends on the class and the teacher. It was nice to read a variety of authors (Lysias, Plato, Herodotus) to begin to get a taste of all the different styles of writing.",
    "yess take it! It's a useful course; the readings are fun; it's not too stressful or hard, but I definitely did come out of it feeling like I had a much more solid grasp of Greek grammar than before.",
    "This is a great course, fun readings, and a crucial next step in Greek learning.",
    "A worthwhile deepening of our Attic reading and an enticing firstencounter with Ionic."
