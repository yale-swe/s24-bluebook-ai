   "comments": [
    "Yes, great lecture. Take it. It's relevant.",
    "Really interesting class - great overview of the health care industry. For someone who knew very little about the material going in, I never felt lost or confused. Great class. Exams are hard, a lot of material to study and they are pretty picky at grading.",
    "Only take for econ majors if u need a econ class.",
    "Overview of every economical aspect of the healthcare industry. a bit overwhelming",
    "Yes. Great class, lots of information. Despite harsh grading, there is a wealth of knowledge to be learned that you will be able to use later on, whether you are a citizen, physician, consultant, policymaker, or (not so much) an economist.",
    "Great class, more about policy\/current events than economics. Not too difficult.",
    "no, harsh grading and constant powerpoints that hammer down the point: healthcare is expensive.",
    "Great class! Definitely take it! Especially with the health reform going on right now, this is a class that everyone who wants to know more about our healthcare system should take. It's very immediately applicable too, like understanding how health insurance and drug plans are run. There really isn't a whole lot of economics in this class, it's very policy-oriented and definitely has a macro feel to it (so I don't really think the micro prereq is really relevant, as long as you know supply and demand).",
    "I took it as a premed without any economics experience. Some topics were interesting, some were not. The papers and tests are very straightforward, fitting into what I have learned thus far as a science major (aka studying slides from lectures).",
    "It's a great class - one of the best I've taken at Yale so far. Prof. Forman is a great lecturer and keeps you interested in the material. If you have any interest in how health care\/insurance works or if you just want to know what's going on in the news take this class.",
    "YES. Very interesting, and things most people who will graduate in a few years and have to deal with insurance and stuff should definitely know and think about.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in Health care. It was not one of the best classes I have taken, but not one of the worst either. Interesting and has real life implications, but going to class got kind of annoying.",
    "If you have a marginal interest in health policy, this will whip you into being extremely knowledgeable about certain statistics but leave you with a weak conceptual knowledge. Little work and reading, but I studied over 30 hours for the final and probably still got a B+.",
    "Great class, whether you are an econ major or not! Health Care is a really interesting topic, and it really needs to be viewed from an economics perspective to truly understand some of the forces at work. Professor Forman is really dedicated to the course, and it really pays off. Also, he has a very interesting background (he's a radiologist and also has a MBA)which adds a lot to the course. It's not very much work (no required readings, 1 5-7 pg. paper, midterm and final), although the lecturers do have a lot of material. The tests are not hard; you just need to memorize the slides.It's all qualitative (no math problems or graphs), but you should have at least a Microecon background to understand the concepts (ie. elasticity, monopsony, etc.).Take it!",
    "If you're intrigued by the healthcare system and how it works, take it.",
    "Take this class! Super interesting\/informative, also relatively easy! And obviously, mega-relevant!",
    "Great class. Take it if you are at all interested in health care or public policy.",
    "An interesting overview of the healthcare system, including Medicare, Medicaid, patents, the FDA, and health microecon. Definitely worth taking if you're interested in that kind of stuff. The lectures aren't super captivating, which is something to keep in mind. I took it pass\/fail, which was a good way to expose myself to the material but not have to worry too much.",
    "Econ 170 is literally a must for every pre-med student, regardless of if you've ever taken econ classes. The actual economics is pretty minimal, but you learn fascinating stuff about the way the health care system works (or doesn't) in this country. Professor Forman is great.There isn't a lot of work, but GO TO LECTURE to really understand what's going on - midterm and final are fair and straightforward tests if you went to class and studied the material, and the paper is actually really fun and interesting to write.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class if you are looking to learn more about the healthcare industry and the current issues facing it.",
    "Great class. Everyone should know the information that we learn. The exams are not too hard, and the T.A's help you prepare, although it is a lot of work and memorization in order to prepare.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course! A great course for any Economics major, for anyone considering a career in medicine, for anyone interested in government and policy, or for anyone who wishes to be a knowledgeable consumer of healthcare.",
    "This class is a survey of the confusing debacle that is healthcare in America. Obviously, with all the upheaval and proposed change going on in the system right now, it is incredibly pertinent. I have definitely come away with the kind of understanding of the system I expected\/desired at the beginning of the term. Take it!",
    "Yep, if you are interested in healthcare in the US",
    "Its a good overview of the subject and not difficult. Take it if you're interested!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was interesting and I will definitely the information I learned a lot. It was also extremely relevant to the political climate at this time.",
    "I would only take this if you are sure that you are interested in the subject. I took the class in hopes to understand the health care debate better and realized that I had no academic interest in hospitals, doctors or medicine. That being said, there is a lot you can take away from the class but be sure you're willing to sit through a semester's worth of lectures.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially if you're interested in learning about our nation's health care system. I came into this class knowing nothing about health care and now I feel like I can comfortably talk about anything ranging from Medicare, to organ donation to asymmetric information. There is a lot of material but the tests are definitely fair. Take this class.",
    "Good, comprehensive overview of the US health care system. I felt like this class really helped me understand what I read in the newspaper and see at the doctor's office. There isn't much reading, and the tests are tough but fair. It won't be the most fun and exciting class you've ever taken, but you'll learn lots of useful information - definitely worth it if you have any interest in health care.",
    "Econ 170 is an interesting course with a very light work load. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know a lot about how the health care system works. Unfortunately, I have a few major reservations with the class: the first is that the class tends to focus only on objective facts and avoid all the controversies, which often leads to a lot of numbers and graphs and acronyms and very little stimulating discussion. The second is that the midterms and the final exam are graded rubric-style, such that the TA\u0092s essentially just look for keywords and regurgitation. Studying is therefore quite tedious and does not test real conceptual understanding much of the time. Despite all of these reservations, I am (pretty) happy that I took this class, because it wasn\u0092t much work and I did learn a good deal.",
    "Great overview of the US health care system. Professor Forman is incredibly knowledgeable and it's definitely a good idea to get to know him outside of class. That said, the lectures got a bit dry sometimes, which is unfortunate, because just about everything you need to know for the midterm and final is based off of those lectures. In any case, if you're interested in health care, there is no one better to talk to than Howard Forman. Take the class.",
    "Great class if you want to understand the intricacies of the healthcare system. There are few other places where an MD would be up at the front of the room telling you about things that are going on today and things that have happened in the past. Don't be fooled--this class is not a \"gut\" and there will be a lot of material to cover for the two exams.",
    "An interesting course, with a lot of material. I would recommend it.",
    "It's a great course--I would highly recommend it! As a student without an econ background, it's definitely manageable.",
    "Yes; this course is very helpful in just understanding what is going on with Healthcare in the United States. Because it is so complicated, it's neat to be able to sort things out, and just be knowledgeable about this matter that affects all Americans.",
    "If you want a survey of how insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP, the pharmaceutical industry, etc. works, take this course.Not so much economics in here, despite being offered by the econ department. Don't be afraid to take it even if the last time you took econ was econ AP junior year of HS.If you're looking for an in-depth discussion of any of the above, look elsewhere. Good for future health professionals to understand health care delivery; if you take the course and you're pre-med, try to look at the whole picture of health care delivery in the US, rather than from the typical perspective of a doctor with patients, you'll get much more out of it.",
    "Definitely Yes",
    "Take it especially if you are an econ major",
    "Great course on a very relevant topic. Professor Forman is an interesting lecturer.",
    "Yes. Especially if you are interested in healthcare. After taking this course I understand what they are talking about with the healthcare reform. The tests are fair and as long as you study.",
    "This is a survey course of the healthcare system in the United States today. It would highly recommend it because you will be a more informed individual in society after taking this course. You can have a legitimate covnersation about healthcare.",
    "Take the class if you want a basic introduction to the way the US healthcare system works. It puts more emphasis on facts than theories."
