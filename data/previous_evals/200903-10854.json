    "I would suggest more information on the following topics:(1) resources that Yale has to offer graduate students and how to find out about these,e.g., grant-writing classes, other writing classes, workshops in SAS, R, ArcGIS.(2) applied organizational skills, e.g., any suggestions or software for organizing\/tracking the thousands of pdfs on my computer so I can access and cite them when I need them? Maybe current graduate students could talk about their coping skills?(3) other skills, e.g., role of literature search, guidelines for how to conduct a literature search and select relevant articles\/information.(4) thinking about the future: if a student is 100% committed to going into academia, maybe she has a different set of priorities in her graduate career than a student that is open to (or even prefers) options outside academia, such as government\/EPA, a thinktank, UN, etc. Publications may be much more important for getting an academic job than a government job, for example. I don't know if there are any useful suggestions here, but if there are I'd like to hear them.",
