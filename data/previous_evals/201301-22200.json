    "It's bizarro-econ... well basically a lot of Marxism.Makes you question your assumptions",
    "This class is pretty amazing. Some disclaimers: It's not a seminar \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not even a little bit \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and although that was initially a turn-off, it became amazing. Three papers and three-to-four problem sets that aren't really all that difficult. There's a surprisingly lot to rigorously and mathematically say about the topic of equality. I recommend this class unreservedly.",
    "Hard class, but absolutely worth it. My EP&E concentration is distributive justice, and this class was a worthy culmination of my four years at Yale. It also changed my mind on some key issues. Please take this class!A note on Professor Roemer: He comes from the self-proclaimed \"no-bullshit\" group of Marxists. He is not afraid to disagree with your arguments in class. But I think he is one of the most caring Professors at Yale. I've never taken a class with a professor who so clear enjoys and values his area of study.",
    "This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale - Professor Roemer is the real deal in many senses of the word. He was one of the founding members of the September Group of analytical Marxists, he led Berkeley student protesting against Vietnam, and he has a pretty deep background in math (having almost completed a math PhD). The result is a truly interdisciplinary class (not the usual EPE BS), with three intermediate micro psets and three political philosophy papers. Part of me wishes I had more formal math background, since some of the mathematical 'proofs' and models against philosophical theories were only discussed on a superficial level to cater to the undergrad level.Why should you take this class? You'll get a more critical view of the post-Rawlsian literature on distributive justice and really understand the nuanced debates between egalitarians about what the equalisandum should be, who ought be compensated, etc. I also enjoyed the brief discussion of analytical Marxism, framing leftist theories in the context of general equilibrium and political philosophy to better glean its premises. The classmates were also really good this semester, we had a many a good discussion out of class.A fair warning must be given re: class discussion: at least for the first few weeks, the class is really just a lecture in which the Professordiscusses the key tenets of various distributive theories and his problems with each of them - not really a 'seminar' in that sense. Discussion and student involvement increases in the second half of the semester, partly because I think we were better versed in the literature at that point and also because student groups were assigned to present\/teach a class for the last four weeks. Professor Roemer is also very amenable to discussion after class and during Office Hours, which is something many of us took advantage of.",
    "Equality is probably the most intellectually stimulating course I have taken at Yale. There is a fantastic reading list and a very engaged group of students. It was also really unique and interesting having a mix of papers and problem sets and seeing how the material looks in both contexts. The problem sets aren't too tricky as long as you've taken intermediate micro or just have decent math abilities. Professor Roemer is good, but not great. He is an interesting character and has been a major player in this field, so you get to read his own work and hear about his current research, which is quite interesting. He can be a bit awkward or unfriendly at times and doesn't do much to stimulate discussion or some cases critical thinking. Definitely take the classif you have an interest in economics, political philosophy, or just life and society in general.",
    "I would recommend taking this course if and only if you find the subject matter intrinsically interesting. Professor Roemer will not try to put on a show, and the course is not discussion-based, soif you are not interested in the material, you will not like it. That said, if you do like the material, as many very much do, this is a one-of-a-kind course in the way it mixes philosophy and economics with ease, making both disciplines relevant to the question at hand. It is not an easy course with the problem sets and papers, but I would nonetheless suggest taking it if you are a true \"EP&E\" major, ready to engage on both a quantitative and philosophical level with the issue of equality.",
    "This class attracts a certain kind of person - it's a self-selecting bunch - but it will be incredibly fulfilling if you are interested in equality and justice. Reading selection is great, and Professor Roemer is excellent (though if you don't ask questions it tends to be a bit more of a lecture). Also it is the epitome of EP&E classes; one of the most interdisciplinary approaches imaginable (if also demanding). It's a great idea to form discussion groups outside of class - helped us get much more out of the material.",
    "Honestly, this is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. At a time during which economic discourse more often than not forgets its philosophical roots and its moral purpose, this course stands for what social science can and should be. It reminds you that economics and political philosophy connect in a profound, but subtle way that should never be forgotten. I would actually encourage the economics department to invite Professor Roemer to guest lecture in Intro or Intermediate Micro to highlight this crucial connection, which is usually passed over. Taking this class and talking with him has restored my faith in economics as a discipline.Moreover, learning from Professor Roemer is a unique experience. His wealth of experience, knowledge, and opinions are invaluable and worth engaging even if one doesnot agree with him.On a practical level, this is the truest EP&E course that I can think of. Content-wise, look no further if you want a rigorous overview of the contemporary intellectual debate on equality in analytic philosophy and the contemporary economics of egalitarianism. It's very interdisciplinary, so be prepared to do political philosophy papers as well as psets.",
    "Really cool class. One of if not the only class at Yale -- even in EP&E proper -- where you get to do both microeconomic analysis in p-sets and political philosophy in papers. It's not much of a seminar -- really more of a lecture, he just sits and reads his notes -- but he's got enough interesting sidenotes and tangents on various nooks of research he's done\/knows about to keep things lively. (e.g. ask him about his stuff on measuring incentives towards occupational choice other than incomes proper.) So yeah, don't expect a lot of discussion, but the readings are very worth it, and his notes do illuminate a lot of things, bring up interesting critiques, etc., that, to my take, definitely make up for the lack of discussion.And don't be intimidated by his gruff exterior -- he's actually very open to undergraduates and quite enthusiastic in his own way, has a good sense of humor, etc.Last thing -- this year, we had a good core group who worked together on p-sets and talked out our ideas before papers, which was actually one of my favorite parts of the class. See if you can't get something similar going.",
    "This class is an excellent introduction to egalitarian \/ left thought, through understanding the fundamental issues of justice and equality and their implications. It is also a good mathematical introduction to alternative economic theories, and mind-opening to any Economics majors looking for an interesting elective."
