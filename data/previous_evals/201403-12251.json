    "A really interesting science class, great for non-science people and PSYC people alike.",
    "Human brain is very much a class about just that - the human brain. It's an intensely interesting course if you're interested in the brain and are willing to put in the time to become familiar with it. It's not a gut course and I don't know where people would get that impression. McCarthy is a great lecturer that gives lots of support to the students and gives really interesting lectures. The class has various reading responses, 2 midterms, and a final, from which your grades come. Make sure you study well for exams - if you know the information, the exams are relatively painless, but if you don't, you'll be having a heart attack.",
    "Be prepared to memorize a LOT of information!",
    "I would instantly recommend PSYC 160 to anyone who is all of the below: 1. used to thinking \"scientifically\" 2. has any sort of interest in human cognition 3. wants a \"fulfilling\" science credit (doesn't feel like a gut) without it being too strenuous I had a friend in this class with almost no science background (singer) who both seemed to really enjoy it and do very well in it, so, honestly, I would really just recommend this class for anyone in categories 2 and\/or 3 above: this class is great!",
    "Exams are formatted 20 free response questions, 5 points each, 100 points total. What that meant for me was that if I didn't get one question, boom that's 5 points off. People average 80% on these exams, so if you miss 4 questions you're at the B+ curve cutoff. If you are good at memorizing a LOT of extraneous information, this might be the course for you. This is the ideal class to Credit-D. The material is fascinating, McCarthy is engaging and puts so much TLC into every lecture. He even puts together a hand-written Word doc outline of every lecture, he's such a boss. But because of the format of the exams, this is one of the hardest courses for someone who doesn't memorize well.",
    "This course seems like it'd be fun to take since it is interesting, but it actually is difficult and takes a lot of study time.",
    "A good 4th or 5th class, one in which you will learn a lot by going to lecture and where there is no tedious\/pointless homework. An excellent overview of the brain and introduction to cognitive neuroscience.",
    "Definitely don't be fooled by the idea that this course is for non-science majors. This class is TOUGH. While super interesting, the tests are impossible. If you take it Credit \/ D \/ Fail, then you are probably fine, though.",
    "Sure if you're into neuroscience. If not don't just take it to take it because you'll get bored and fail.",
    "PSYC 160 is a good course, but you need to steadily manage your workload. If you fall behind once, it is too difficult to catch up. I would recommend this course to another student only if they're willing to commit their time to studying hard for this course.",
    "Difficult course but if you're interested in the human brain, you really should take it",
    "An absolute disaster and perhaps my worst decision as a Yale student. Are you a pre-med student or a big science student looking for an interesting class to count towards your major? This might be the class for you, as McCarthy is interesting and much of the material is pretty cool. However, if you're anything like me (non-science student looking to fulfill their distributional requirements) I have but one word to say to you: RUN. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS BY ANY MEANS. DESPITE HOURS SPENT STUDYING FOR EVERY TEST MY GPA IS IN SHAMBLES. TRUST ME, THIS IS NOT A CLASS A SINGLE NON-SCIENCE MAJOR SHOULD EVER TAKE. I CAN'T SAVE MYSELF (OR MY GPA) BUT I CAN SAVE YOU. TAKE SOMETHING ELSE.",
    "It takes a lot of work to do well, but you learn a lot and it's really rewarding!",
    "It's an interesting course, although very memorization heavy and dry. I'd say take it if you are genuinely interested in a very detailed, science-heavy approach to the human brain. Be prepared to invest a lot of time into the course, or on the other hand, Credit-D it if you are just genuinely interested in the brain but don't want to be bogged down by information\/stress of learning many words, brain regions, loops\/physiological concepts etc. etc.",
    "McCarthy is terrific! Fascinating material and engaging lectures. I'm really glad I took this class.",
    "pretty good course, take it if you're interested in the material.",
    "Tough course, but interesting stuff if you like science.",
    "Cognitive neuroscience is a fascinating field. We are all gifted with such an intricate organ that allows us to function every day, and I think that it is worth having some knowledge of how it works on the neural level. You will spend many hours before the exams studying, but you will most certainly come out of this class with a greater appreciation for the human brain.",
    "A good, solid intro neuroscience course. I think it would be difficult for people who have no psychology experience whatsoever, and a strong interest in psychology and\/or the brain is definitely a prerequisite. I would definitely recommend the class to those who are interested and willing to put in effort to keep up. If you let yourself fall behind you will be miserable and likely not do very well. Forming a study group is probably a good idea, as is going to your TA's office hours with questions.",
    "Intro to the human brain. Lots of memorizing details and understanding how obscure areas of the brain interact, etc. Very interesting if you have the time (and interest).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student, but only if he or she were sincerely committed to learning about the brain. Do not take this class for an easy science credit because it is certainly not an easy class. You need to actively listen in lectures to understand the nuances of the topic, but Prof. McCarthy does post comprehensive notes for every lecture, which help to supplement material you may have missed, but probably won't make sense if you didn't pay attention in lecture. The expectations are very straightforward and the coursework (when you don't have exams) is relatively light. If you want to do well, the professor and TFs make it very easy to do so, as long as you put forward the effort. Prof. McCarthy is not the most engaging lecturer, but he explains the topics very well and applies the appropriate amount of humor (which is relatively rare, but funny). There are also weekly review sessions, although I never went to any, so I can't really speak to their value so much, except to say that he will answer any question you may have.",
    "This is a tough class. You have to go to lecture and study really hard to do well on the midterms. There are weekly reading responses, two midterms, and a third test (during finals period, unlike a lot of other psych classes) that is basically a third midterm plus a cumulative portion. The reading responses are easy, but the midterms are somewhat difficult. But if you study, use the notes that Prof. McCarthy posts online, and go to the review sessions that he has throughout the semester, you can still do well. The curve also helps your grade. It's definitely an interesting class, but only take it if you need it, or take it Credit\/D.",
    "PSYC 160 is a very good and interesting class on the human brain. The material is fascinating, and Professor McCarthy is a really good lecturer. This is not a particularly easy course, and in order to do well it's important to do the readings, review Professor McCarthy's lecture slides and notes, and prepare for the tests a little in advance. Overall though, I found the class to be really enjoyable and I have a much more profound knowledge of the brain and how it works.",
    "The course is very well suited for students not majoring in the sciences but who want to take an intensive SC course. Coming from that background I found the class challenging, as in it requires a lot of dedication and studying for the midterms\/final, and attending class is equally important. There are also reading responses due once a week which are very straightforward. By far the biggest strength of the class is the multiple support mechanisms which the professor provides: he sends notes and a ppt before each class, has review sessions every week, has office hours as do the TAs, there is also an online piazza forum to ask questions, etc. In this sense, the class may be a lot of material (as opposed to hard to understand) but if you give it the correct amount of time, the course provides you with the mechanisms to get the most out of it. Take it!!",
    "It's a good intro to the brain, understandable for non-majors.",
    "Too much information is thrown at us, but you have to keep in mind that you're only expected to understand the concepts without having to memorise absolutely everything. Definitely recommend it, except if you already have one class that'll take up a good amount of your time. This will keep you busy studying for it's 3 tests all throughout the semester.",
    "I would only recommend Psyc 160 to a student who is interested in Neuroscience. It's a fairly challenging course in regards to the amount of material that is presented, but you do learn a lot from it. I personally took the course Credit\/D because I was trying to gauge my interest in the subject, and I would definitely recommend that option to other people interested in being exposed to the material, but who may have a challenging course load. In terms of workload, you only need to submit one reading response every week. However, when it comes time to study for the tests, there is a lot of material to memorize and a lot of time needs to be devoted to that so try to make sure you're learning the material in a step-wise fashion or you'll have a bulk of material to memorize in a very short amount of time. One very useful studying tool is Professor McCarthy's Notes, which he uploads on Classesv2. They are extremely helpful to know what material is most important and what to focus on. USE THEM! Overall: Take this course if you're interested in the subject but do note that it's a lot of material, a lot of memorization and fairly challenging.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU ARE COMPLETELY COMMITTED TO IT. It is A LOT of very confusing information that is hard to piece together.",
    "PSYC 160 is a thorough introduction to neuroscience. Overall, it's a really great course. Even though it was A LOT of information to process (especially for a non-science person with no\/little exposure to anatomy and biology), I really enjoyed the class. Professor McCarthy is wonderful; he works REALLY hard and goes above and beyond to ensure his students are understanding the material, which was extremely helpful. I have to admit, the lectures can be a little fast-paced and filled with LOTS of information, but Professor McCarthy always made outlines for all of his lectures, highlighting the most important points. Aside from that, he also hosted weekly review sessions for students and thoroughly and quickly answered questions from students on Piazza. You can see his passion for studying the human brain during class; he's a dynamic speaker and draws some of the most intriguing phenomena that neuroscience seeks to explore. While the information is a LOT to digest, the workload itself is not too bad. We basically had weekly reading responses which were really straightforward and simple, two midterms, and a final exam. The exams, although sometimes detailed, were fairly reasonable if you thoroughly studied. For future PSYC 160 students: Study early, focus on the outlines, and get your questions answered early on through emailing your TF\/going to review sessions! It's a great class and I highly recommend it.",
    "As a non-STEM person, I found this class pretty interesting but I wish I could have taken it Credit\/D. Even though the tests are pretty fair, there's just a ton of material which makes studying for them really stressful if, like me, you don't absorb or understand the material right away. Also, the fact that there's so much material can make the lecture feel long. That said, Professor McCarthy is a really good lecturer -- he's clear, engaging, and funny. He uses a lot of interesting examples and you really will learn a lot of cool stuff. I'm glad I took the class, but it's definitely challenging for non-STEM people -- not impossible, but challenging.",
    "Difficult and DRY. Take advantage of how accessible Prof McCarthy makes himself.",
    "Interesting course, pretty straightforward in terms of what you need to know, but you will definitely need to put effort in to learn it. Very little reading each week and weekly reading responses, but if you really want to learn the material you'll probably want to go over the lecture notes in detail each week so you can keep up.",
    "A comprehensive course on the functions and composition of the human brain. By the end of the class you will have learned about the major functions of each portion of the brain as well as the neurons that make it up. While the course is a high-level overview, there is still a lot to study and the amount of material can be overwhelming if you fall behind. Luckily, there are slides and lecture notes posted online, as well as weekly review sessions and a piazza forum for you to get clarifications on tricky material. The weekly reading responses are not bad and the exams are fair. Take this class if you are interested in the brain and need a science credit!",
    "I recommend this course very strongly, but with the caveat that there is a tremendous amount of material covered. The professor is very well organized and proficient in his lectures. He is very fair in designing his two midterms and final but the exams were still very hard due to the amount of material and the many difficult concepts expected to be throughly understood.",
    "Really interesting class. You will learn a ton about the brain and it will change the way you think about information processing. But it is a lot of material and difficult if you are a non-science major. But I would recommend it because it challenges you to think differently.",
    "Way to much memorization. Professor McCarthy has forgotten what it is like not to know the entire brain.",
    "This class was awesome! It was challenging but the content is very enjoyable. Each lecture is jam packed with interesting information. Professor McCarthy moves fast, but he gives ample resources to understand the content. We did not use the textbook that much, but it was a good source to go to if concepts were confusing. The 2 midterms and final exam were hard but fair. You will have to put in a lot of study time to do well on exams. Take this class! You will learn so much!",
    "If you want a solid foundation in neuroscience, this class is for you. I came out of this class feeling as though I had a strong handle on the function of most neuroanatomical areas, and their connection to psychological phenomena. Be prepared, though, for a lot of memorization, which (at least to me) is not the most intellectually stimulating activity.",
    "Good introduction to the brain, not too hard and not too much work. I'd recommend this for anyone interested in the brain.",
    "In-depth intro into the human brain and its various functions.",
    "I would recommend. Hard but interesting.",
    "Human Brain was a great introduction to that complex organ up in your noggin. I have always puzzled about how the brain works, and how consciousness can live there, and I feel better equipped to answer those questions after taking this class. Professor McCarthy is a great lecturer, up there in skill and style with some of the better lecturers in the history department, which is something I didn't expect from a more science-y class like this. Topics ranged from as low-level as neurotransmitters and neuronal organization to the higher-level questions you might have had in Intro Psyc, but despite the wide range in technical and intuitive material, Professor McCarthy was able to teach it all with equal poise. The harder-to-intuit topics had follow-up questions on Piazza, which the professor answered in great, clarifying detail (the activity on Piazza put the icing on the cake for me). Almost every week there was a reading response on a paper or article (7-15 pages of reading, 1-3 paragraphs of writing). There were two midterms and a final, the final being cumulative with a focus on the last third of the course. The material was challenging for me, a CS major with no experience being tested on rote memorization, but not too bad. Overall, take this class if you want to get a handle on that hard, hard question - how can everything I am be contained in three pounds of meat?",
    "I would 100% recommend this class. It was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I'm not a psych major or premed or anything, and I still felt as though the class was extremely worthwhile. I came away from it feeling like I had learned a ton about the brain, and I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to put in a little bit of work.",
    "Definitely recommend his course of you are interested in the material!",
    "Definitely recommend! A lot of memorization but very manageable if you give yourself enough time. Tests are a good mixture of memorization and application. Professor McCarthy is a great professor.",
    "A good science course you learn a lot it, but you can't bullsh** your way to an A. The tests are fair but they require a lot of studying. Don't miss a lecture, and use his lecture notes. The textbook doesn't really help.",
    "This is an extremely hard class that you need to put the work in to learn the information. Professor does not explain things in-depth and makes assumptions that you already know a lot of the material. In no way an easy science credit",
    "This course was interesting but quite difficult. Each lecture contains a great deal of information that needs to be memorized. The textbook contains useful information but going to lecture is absolutely necessary in order to understand the material. Professor McCarthy is a good lecturer but his lecture could be better in terms of delivery, organization and presentation of necessary\/relevant background information. Sometimes I felt although there was prior knowledge assumed despite the fact that this is an intro course. There is not much work each week (just weekly reading responses) but the exams are difficult and require a great deal of studying time. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU WANT AS EASY SCIENCE CREDIT. It is very interesting and worthwhile if you are interested in the material but otherwise it would be torture. This course could benefit from assigning weekly problems sets rather than reading responses. I feel it would be helpful to have homework each week that forces students to review the material and practice the kind of critical thinking that was required for the exams, especially the final exam. Overall, a good, interesting class that needs improvement.",
    "I would recommend it to people who are more science oriented who want a psychology class,. I'm not sure if I would recommend it to someone who is more of a social science or humanities person, mainly because I like science so I do not personally know how they would like the class. I would summarize it as a psychology class that is focused on and structured around brain anatomy.",
    "Introductory neuroscience survey. Difficult, fast, heavy on memprization- but great if you love the subject",
    "The first part of this course is very boring - anatomy based. The second half is fascinating - especially if you like social neuroscience. Overall, the exams require a LOT of memorization. You need to know every detail of the specific studies he mentioned, not just the concepts. You can't get by with just a solid understanding of the material. You will be tested on specific lecture material.",
    "This class is definitely tough, but you learn a lot and the material is interesting. Don't skip lecture and go to the review sessions and you should be okay.",
    "If you're willing to rote memorize a LOT (a lot lot) and Google difficult concepts, you'll be ok. I didn't buy the textbook at all and was just fine (we needed it twice for homework - I borrowed someone else's, and didn't do any of the textbook readings). Going to lectures will help, review sessions too. Even if the material seems interesting (some of it was!), it will get old after studying it for the umpteenth hour.",
    "This is a good class. It's challenging, so don't treat it like a gut science. But if you're interested in neuroscience you'll enjoy it.",
    "Take it if you're interested in learning about the brain. Exams are short answer-McCarthy's notes and the piazza forum are helpful for studying.",
    "Human Brain is a phenomenal introduction to neuroscience\/neuropsych and is worth the time of science and humanities majors alike.",
    "I recommend this class if you are interested in the brain at all, or if you are considering being a neuroscience major. As a neuroscience major myself, I found this class to be extremely interesting and helpful and I was able to confirm my interest in neuroscience. If you aren't interested in the brain and are thinking of taking it just for a science credit, don't, because the workload for this class is relatively high and you won't learn as much if you don't put the right effort into it.",
    "Lots of work; interesting, I suppose, but ultimately pretty superficial. But that probably has more to do with cognitive science than with this course per se.",
    "An incredible science class for a non-science major. Not a gut but fairly easy and super interesting. Tests required studying but weren't impossible. Gregory McCarthy described himself in the first lecture as an overindulgent father who wants his kids to know everything about the brain that they can, and I definitely felt that care and eagerness to share during his lectures. An A+ of a class.",
    "I definitely would not recommend it unless it has a completely different instructor and structure than it did this year. I was excited to take the course and it turned into the most draining experience I've had at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to students. You will learn a lot, but you have to make sure you are prepared to put in the work in order to succeed.",
    "The class is not theoretically difficult, but involves learning enormous amounts of information, and details count!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning about the brain and to anyone who does not want a really scientific course."
