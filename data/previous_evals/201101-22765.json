   "comments": [
    "I would recommend DS Literature to students who want to read a lot of classic texts in one semester but would warn them that the course may not get as in depth as they would like.",
    "Great. Terrific books, substantially more reading than first semester, only worth it if you keep up with the readings. Grigoryan has students to a forum post for every section which is great. Three papers \/ semester. Final exam with passage memorization of 14 lines, IDs, and 1 essay.",
    "Really cool class. Literature is somewhat hard to pin down a canon for, but what this class does is introduce you to the evolution of certain big ideas in Western literature over time. As with all DS, the key here is being able to see changes occur - to see how texts relate to one another.",
    "You read selections from the Western Canon in literature and learn how multiple texts respond differently to common preoccupations and revise the tradition that precedes them. I would absolutely recommend it - I became a better writer and learned a lot about the Western tradition.",
    "Directed Studies is a powerful and challenging program. By the end your DS year, you wil be familiar with most or all of the quintessential theories of Western thought. For every aspiring leader, thinker, or writer, DS should be your beginning. However if you choose to do DS, I highly recommend that you focus upon it, and select only one extracurricular activity. DS should be enjoyed. With numerous extracurriculars, DS will become an incredibly stressful and less rewarding experience.",
    "Great, but the reading list was borderline ridiculous at times... start (and finish) War and Peace and Don Quixote during your breaks."
