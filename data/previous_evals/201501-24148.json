    "Take this course if you can speak in public without trying to sound like the smartest person around. Don't take this class if you think you're the smartest person around because you aren't. Take this class if you want to know what a seminar is - other Yale seminars aren't really seminars. Don't take this course if you want to make other people think you're intelligent during discussions. Take this course if you want to realize how smart the people around you are. Don't take this course if you're not ready to admit that Yale is so liberal and self-righteous that it can be stifling, even for a staunch liberal like myself. Take this course if you're ready to yell at a professor. Don't take this course if you think there are some things that can't be discussed in a classroom. Take this course if you want to regain faith in this university and its students. Don't take this course if you think getting an A is more important than actually finding your beliefs and opinions changing, which is what college should be all about. Take this course if you want to stand on the shoulders of a giant to see the world from a completely new perspective. Don't take this course if you like being right more than being challenged. Take this course if you want to be wrong. Don't take this course if the only reason you want to take it is because it's got an application process. Take this course if you want your ego to be questioned. Don't take this course if you think Yale is perfect as is. Take this course if bullshit has gotten you this far but you want one course to challenge that. Don't take this course if you're libertarian. Take this course if you've never wondered about whether or not the things your parents taught you are reasonable or not. Don't take this course if you're timid. Take this course if you care.",
    "BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN. TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU GET IN. It will be the most amazing academic experience of your life, I promise you. Life-changing. Stimulating. Exciting. Challenging. It's got all the ingredients of a superb class. I won't say anything more because the journey you take through this class is supposed to be made without a destination in mind.",
    "Absolutely recommended. This is the type of class that makes your time in college worthwhile. It not only provides deep insights into specific subjects but also into education and life in general.",
    "Wow. I don't know how he did it, but after every class I took this semester, Adam had me walking back to my room second guessing every decision and belief I've held in life. He's breadth of knowledge is incredible, and his class is unlike any other I have or probably ever will take.",
    "YES YES YES YES if you can get in. No questions asked. If you get easy offended don't take it. But you should so you get less sensitized to social norms. He adds perspective.",
    "Are you kidding me? If you have the opportunity, TAKE this course with Adam Glick. This is by far the best course I have ever taken at Yale, and likely the best course I ever will take, though it's also helped me get more out of all my seminars even just throughout this semester. This is one of those classes for me that I literally leave the class and the subsequent dinners, (also the professor goes to dinner after the class every week to continue talking about the issues so as to get more time to hear thoughts and debates and such) not wanting to go back to real life and the struggles and trials and tribulations of it. I just want to continue to be immersed in this world where you can wrestle with ideas and challenge the professor and your classmates, and you speak your mind without being judged for your opinions or worried about offending people. In terms of logistics, don't be too stressed about the requirements--there are few, if any. However, I would warn that although there is nothing too dire or pressing about this course, you should never miss a seminar and you should still do the readings and watch the hour long weekly video (especially if he sends them out in his weekly email) because you'll get a lot out of it (this is also maybe the only class in the history of my classes that I went to every single seminar). This is one of those classes you take just for the sheer thrill of having your ideas challenged, not for credit or because you have to or even just because it's easy. IN summation, TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "I don't know if this class is ever coming back to Yale, but if it does, TAKE IT. You will walk out of this 18 person seminar hungering for more out of your college education, out of your peers and professors, and out of yourself. GBI will be one of the best classes you will take. Ever.",
    "Hands down the best course I've taken. Adam Glick is truly brilliant, and it will change your life. I promise. Take it.",
    "IF YOU GET INTO THIS CLASS THEN TAKE IT. The class exposes you to a new subject and its strengths and faults every week. This class changed my entire perspective on an undergraduate education. Professor Glick is dynamic and will make you rethink everything you thought you took as true. I looked forward to sitting through two hours of class every Wednesday afternoon, and to the dinners that the class would get afterwards. I have nothing to say but good things about this class."
