    "Good to know the Database",
    "Sure",
    "It is very good for a student with little or no knowledge of database system because the course covered many aspects of the DB system. In addition, the assignments are very helpful for one to gain deeper grasp of how db systems work.",
    "Yes. Database is really helpful for students who want to study systems.",
    "Yes. It's useful for database magt",
    "It's a good overview of relational databases. I'd recommend it to anyone that hasn't worked much with them before, and even people that have worked with them informally would likely benefit from the more rigorous introduction that this course provides.",
    "Definitely take it. Its an easy class but you learn stuff. The only problem is in the starting, you don't have any work; but towards the end, you have two big assignments due which take up a lot of time and the assignments require a lot of reading and thinking. It is manageable though. The good thing was both the professor and the TA were flexible and understanding.",
    "If you haven't learned database before, it's really a good course. Otherwise, you might find it not as rewarding and interesting.",
    "I would recommend it to who is interested in relational database",
    "Yes",
    "Very useful topics."
