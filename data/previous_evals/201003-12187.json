   "comments": [
    "History of the rise of Islam until the fall of Baghdad to the Mongols. Focus on the first hundred years after Muhammad's death. Emphasis on religion. I would recommend it as an introduction to Islam\/its empire.",
    "NO!!!!!! I took this class because I thought it would be easy. It was, but I deeply regret it. The 75-minute class time (no section was the only good thing) is excruciating and half of it is usually taken up by blowhards who feel the need to ask questions about topics that are either completely trivial or so broad that the prof couldn't possibly offer a reasoned response. The professor's lecturing style is so disorganized and rambling that I feel like I barely learned anything, the 1-page weekly reading responses (useless) are just enough work to be a chore, and what passes for a textbook is outdated and soporific. This has the potential to be a great class about an interesting time period, but as it stands now it's essentially rote memorization of selective names and dates from political and military history. Trust me on this one. TRUST ME.",
    "The workload is minimal and not difficult, but there are plenty of other better things you could be doing with the two and a half hours a week that you spend taking this class.",
    "Stay away from this class. This is the worst history class I've taken at Yale. If you are looking for a rest of the world class, you can still do far better. The tests are both easy and the only other work is weekly one page reading responses, but the lectures are awful. The professor clearly does not seem to have prepared at all. He only \"lectures\" for about 30 minutes, doesn't say anything meaningful and then pretends to answer questions for the next 45 minutes. By the end of the semester, you realize all you learned was a few names and dates but if someone asked you a question like \"So what did this dynasty, which lasted 200+ years actually do?\" you would not be able to answer.",
    "Do not take this course, even if you have a strong interest in the time period. There are better ROW courses and better courses on the region. Professor Allouche is very disorganized and can enter into extended tangents and conveys very little substance to students in lecture. His expectations from students are also a bit unusual, and he does not explain assignments very clearly. The class really just isn't worth it, and you will regret having taken it.",
    "Great overview of the time period between Muhammad and the Mongol invasion of the Islamic Empire. Considering the time frame that this course focuses on, there weren't too many opportunities to study a certain time or event at great length; the course discusses different sections\/eras of the time period at their surfaces and you get a good sense of what was going on overall. It's great if you don't know anything about Islamic history, and the professor is pretty engaging. Also the workload isn't bad: no section (class is small enough to be its own), short book review, weekly reading responses, a midterm and a final with a moderate amount of reading.",
    "This course is not overly difficult and quite interesting if you are into the middle east to any extent. Overall the course load is very reasonable, particularly if you are good at both skimming articles and knowing when it is and is not okay to skim the given article. The one page responses for each weeks reading are pretty simple, although it is never overly clear what the professor is looking for in them. Also there was a book report both this year and last years class, but it wasn't too time intensive and the book is fairly interesting.",
    "If you want a general understanding of that history, then take this class.",
    "It's a pretty straightforward standard history lecture, and not much work. The background in the foundations of Islamic civilization is interesting and useful, but some of the material is rather dull.",
    "I would recommend the class, especially if you need a non-US or European history credit.",
    "Stay away. If you are looking for a rest of the world look elsewhere. One of the worst classes I've taken here. Not a lot of work but that's not a good enough reason to take it. Horrible lectures, pointless assignments.",
    "yes the material wasn't too difficult and the classes were amusing to say the least. Midterm and Finals were very straightforward.",
    "Sure, there were some great days, and others that were definitely on the boring size, but I would recommend this class. It\u0092s a good rest of the world class to fulfill the history major, it\u0092s a good class to balance your schedule with a junior history seminar, and the subject material is fascinating.",
    "An overview of the origins of the Islamic world from Muhammad to the rise of the Turks."
