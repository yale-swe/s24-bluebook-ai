    "I would recommend ENAS602 to any student that will deal with chemical reactors or has an interest in chemical kinetics. The course is well designed for students with engineering backgrounds.",
    "Since there aren't many graduate ChemE courses in the Spring, I think it's worthwhile to take the course. Very computationally heavy for the reactor analysis, but kinetics becomes a bit more theoretical. Not a bad course, but requires a lot of time.",
    "Yes. I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student"

   "question_id": "GS009",
   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "The course provides greater understanding of chemical reactions that occur in my research. The covered material will go a long way in designing a flow reactor that will become an integral part of my research\/dissertation.",
    "I don't really deal with kinetics, but it did make me think about kinetic details of my current research which I might pursue in the future. Not necessarily related to my research, but interesting to consider.",
    "While the reactor engineering material doesn't really impact by research all that much, it was still useful to learn about heat transfer and the complex behavior of some of these systems. More useful was the kinetics portion. Again, because I had never seen most of the material before and because much of my research is chemistry-based, actually being able to understand and apply some of the theory that I had only seen in passing was really invaluable. In fact, I really wish that the entire class was a kinetics course and that we were able to cover more and in greater depth, rather than having spent so much time on reactor design which we had also seen in undergrad.",
    "This course delved into many of the skills that should be in the standard toolkit for chemical engineers. By helping us understand mechanisms and the behavior of chemical reactors, it sets the foundation for understanding a huge number of chemical systems."
