   "comments": [
    "A lot of work, but if you are serious about learning the French language and putting the work into it, this course is unmatched.",
    "This is a great class for level two French (elementary to intermediate) students. It is a good transition from the most basic French learning to a more comprehensive level. In FREN 120 you will cover more grammars and will get much better in French speaking and listening.",
    "I would recommend FREN 120. There is definitely more work than FREN 110, but it was still an enjoyable class. As always, the French department expects you the work hard, but the results are worth it. I now feel prepared to study abroad this summer.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking FREN 120 with Catherine. She's incredibly friendly and also very funny in class, as well as being very easy to talk to. The FREN 120 classes are all pretty standardized, but I felt that I got a lot out of Catherine's class because she did a great job of making sure we all understood the material clearly. She also presented French music and poetry in class to supplement the material (e.g. grammar structures) we were working on, which definitely made the class more interesting and engaging. Overall, Catherine's humor and great teaching style definitely made FREN 120 very enjoyable (especially with the French in Action videos that the FREN 110 and 120 classes are taught will), and I felt that I learned a lot of French in the past semester in FREN 120 with Catherine!",
    "Good course. A lot of work, including a lot of busy work, which can be frustrating at times when you'd rather be doing something else. Lovely professor take it with Chiabaut if you get the chance."
