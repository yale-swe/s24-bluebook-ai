    "Formal Chinese used in news and various news\/social issues in Chinese.",
    "I highly improved my reading of real Chinese media, widening my passive vocabulary. I learned a lot about current issues in China, especially LGBT, wealth inequality and other issues.",
    "Learned chinese...",
    "I learned how to use more formal Chinese vocabulary and sentence structures, and got much faster at reading news articles in Chinese.",
    "How to write and speak in formal Chinese.",
    "I learned how to read Chinese articles (actual online ones) and had enlightening discussions with my peers in regards to many relevant topics from gay marriage to unemployment to education systems. It was a valuable class that definitely helped me improve my Chinese further!",
    "Formal spoken and written chinese",
    "This course gave me skills to read Chinese newspaper writing and other formal registers of modern Chinese. We also practiced compositions of short blurbs for many forms of news including art reviews, political event news writing, etc. By giving regular oral reports, this course allowed students to hone their skills around giving oral reports in Mandarin.",
    "I developed more knowledge on current affairs and got skills towards approaching news outlets in Chinese.",
    "I learned about Chinese current events and expanded my professional vocabulary.",
    "Greater awareness of current global issues."

   "comments": [
    "This is a course for higher level Chinese students, so it very much depends on how much work\/effort you want to put in it since the class itself is not very strict. Zhou laoshi was a good teacher and class was interesting, but your Chinese probably won't improve as much as it did in the regular L1-L5 Chinese courses because we don't go very in depth in the material we learn. I feel like the course could be improved by spending more time on the material instead of going very quickly through everything rather superficially.",
    "Strength: you learn to read real Chinese newspapers and practice writing short articles modeled after them. Discussions about lgbt issues and Chinese art were the most interesting and insightful! Weakness: it is easy not to speak much in class so your spoken level of Chinese can deteriorate if you dont make an active effort to practice.",
    "It's very easy to do well in this course without actually learning much. Zhou laoshi, I love you. But we only had one real in-class written exam the whole semester, and I feel like if we had more then we would have actually had to memorize vocab more. Without that, you can kinda just coast. Using words you already know in class without having to push yourself to learn more",
    "It's a nice balance of discussions and learning vocabulary. The units were very interesting, especially the one about Chinese artists. The vocabulary can be a bit dry at times, but it's important. Maybe find more recent articles for some of the units, but in general it was an instructive and educational course.",
    "I liked that the course was discussion-based and highly interactive, and that course material revolved on current affairs. A clearer directory for what assignments were due and when would be helpful, since Zhou Laoshi would often embed assignments at the bottom of documents uploaded on Canvas, and not everyone was aware.",
    "Strengths - it was a great class that kept me engaged, with a passionate instructor and hard working students! Weaknesses - none really.",
    "Biweekly presentations was an important task to make sure we are using our Chinese and incorporating the new vocabulary and grammar structures.",
    "More speaking practice",
    "The strength of this course is the interesting topics we learn and the power they have to engage students in intense conversation in Mandarin. A weakness of this course is that I feel like we learned so much that I'm not sure if I could reproduce all of the assignments we studied on my own, but this course seems much more interested in providing students tools to interact with Chinese media, and less focused on practicing individual writing skills.",
    "The only weakness is that it is a bit less organized because there is no textbook to look back to. Very good course!",
    "This course is great at introducing current affairs and advanced vocabulary.",
    "Fewer homework assignments would be great."

   "comments": [
    "It depends on what you're looking for. If you want a chill Chinese class where you learn some formal\/news Chinese in interesting contexts, then yes. If you really want to improve your Chinese in speaking\/writing\/learning characters, then maybe not. Keep in mind the class structure is very different than the L1-L5 courses.",
    "Yes, it is very cool to say that you can pick up a Chinese newspaper and read almost any article and discuss it. I highly recommend the class for professor Zhou and because you will learn about very interesting issues in China.",
    "It's a good class to speak chinese in and maintain a certain level. but what you get out of it really depends on what you put into it, and you aren't given any strong reasons to put much effort in it beyond your own desires",
    "Yes, it's that great combination of being enjoyable and educational. The skills taught are also nice to have.",
    "Yes. It gave a great insight to how formal Chinese is used -- which is markedly different from how conversational Chinese is structured.",
    "Yes! It is definitely an interesting class to take if you are interested in current affairs or just improving your Chinese! Having to give oral presentations and speaking in a less colloquial, more formal manner (in Chinese) is way harder than you think! Zhou Laoshi is also just an amazing professor who truly cares about his students and tries to mix things up and keep the class exciting!",
    "YES! Take this class with Zhou Laoshi and you will not regret it!",
    "Amazing class. Strongly recommend. William Zhou is amazing.",
    "Yes, great course and Professor!",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who has high spoken and reading proficiency in Chinese and wishes to pivot their skills to allow them to more easily read articles, blurbs, other forms of current events, etc. Because of the volume of articles we read for homework and in class, this class really allows a student to have lucrative opportunities to interact with authentic texts written in a high, formal, register. If you don't want to do the homework or read through all of the articles, you probably could get through the class but will learn substantially less, as so much of this class is sitting at the computer and pushing your way through the newspaper articles.",
    "Yes! Very good skills developed to read real news and discuss relevant topics with classmates.",
    "I would recommend this course as you learn a lot about current issues facing China.",
    "Yes, it's an exciting course"
