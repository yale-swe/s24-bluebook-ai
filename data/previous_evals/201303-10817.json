    "This course provided an excellent introduction to the canonical texts of the rich Chinese tradition, especially given that this was its first semester of existence. Coming out of Directed Studies, I found it to be a wonderful follow-up course, and I was able to make a number of interesting connections between the Western and Chinese traditions. Particularly in this age of China's reascent to the world stage, understanding the remarkable culture of over a billion of the world's people is imperative, and this class challenged some of my preconceived notions about China and \"Confucianism\" (which is a lot more of a nebulous term than you've probably been led to think).This course had many strengths. Its strengths lay in the breadth of readings; the unique combination of political and economy history, literature,and political and moral philosophy contained in those readings; and the innovative organization of the classes (two approximately 20 minute mini-lectures separated by a 10 to 15 minute discussion of a text that we had read). Professors Hunter and Lu both did a superlative job of explicating even the most complicated of topics, and they were a terrific duo. They were both very accessible and welcomed the opportunity to interact outside of class.The class's weaknesses were that it was sometimes unclear what we were supposed to be taking away from the lectures and discussion sections, and the guidelines for the short response papers that we wrote five of over the course of the semester were sometimes murky. The discussion sections were sometimes stellar and sometimes so-so.This is all understandable given that this was the test run of the class; some degree of improvisation was to be expected. I anticipate that this class will only improve with time. I loved Directed Studies, and calling this class the Chinese version of Directed Studies (although texts are in translation) is appropriate.Overall, this was an extremely enjoyable immersion into Chinese civilization, and I learned a great deal. I would recommend it to anyone interested in Chinese culture, history, and philosophy; it gave me an entirely new appreciation for the profundity (and, contrary to popular belief, the diversity) of the Chinese tradition.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for those looking to gain an introduction to Chinese intellectual thought. I would warn students, however, that it is definitely a literature course, and they should be prepared to write papers that way.",
    "I think the title of this course, the Chinese Tradition, summarizes it well: this class helped me understand the tradition of Chinese thought from a broad perspective, though in doing so it did not sacrifice fostering a more focused understanding of important eras within the tradition.I would definitely recommend this course to a friend. I'm very glad I took this course; in particular, I think this course is excellent for people with an interest in China\/East Asian history and thought, but without much prior knowledge in these areas. Even without strong interests in these areas, though, I think this course is still very valuable as a balance to many of the western-centric history or literature courses that one can take.",
    "A review of Chinese history from the early semi-mythical dynasties up to the May 4th revolutions. We accessed history through Chinese intellectual thought, including literature, political science, and philosophy. It really was the \"Chinese directed studies.\""
