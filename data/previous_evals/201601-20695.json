    "Probably one of the most valuable, applicable, and enjoyable courses I have taken at Yale. Caution, though, not a gut.",
    "Antle is an excellent professor who really cares about his students learning the fundamentals of accounting and will go to great lengths to ensure that they do. He changed the syllabus up for us, but what you're probably going to see is a short (or long) assignment due every class and 2-3 longer problem sets. The material will seem easy at first with NPVs and discounting, but blink and you'll quickly fall behind once you get to balance sheets and cash flow statements. Fortunately, you have a great professor to back you up. This was by far the most practical class I've taken at Yale, and I highly recommend it.",
    "Absolutely one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Antle is a fantastic lecturer, and makes what could be dry material very interesting and fun. Starts out perhaps a little slow, but definitely a must for anyone who wants to go into business after Yale.",
    "Great intro to accounting. Definitely take it if you have any interest in business what so ever.",
    "would recommend if you want to gain a broad overview of what accounting is all about, gain familiarity with terms, gain general understanding of different types of financial statements, but not if you really want an in-depth understanding. I also probably could have put more work into the course, so take these comments with a grain of salt",
    "If you are interested in finance or how the business world works, take this class. If you can, take it pass\/fail.",
    "Highly suggest taking this course. Don't take it Credit\/D\/Fail, put some effort into this class and go all in. It'll payoff for you both in terms of knowledge and your grade. Don't be scared off in the first week but other people who may seem to already know the material. If you work through the problems and homework you will be fine too.",
    "Good class. Good Professor. First half of semester is not too intensive (just PV, NPV, FV, etc). Second half of the semester becomes more work intensive when you begin actual accountancy related work.",
    "Professor Antle provides the optimal environment for his students to learn. What absolutely amazed me was how accommodating he was to his students. He didn't simply follow the syllabus as ishe would adjust it, spending more time on topics that weren't so easy to grasp, and perhaps less time on topics we understood more quickly. He really cares that you are learning, and will answer any questions you have after class or through email. Coming out of this class, you get a very firm understanding of income statements, balance sheets, cash flows, and journal entries."
