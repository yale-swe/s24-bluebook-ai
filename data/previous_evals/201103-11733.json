   "comments": [
    "Shop for this seminar and do the first week's homework. If you enjoyed both, then this class is for you.",
    "Yes, take it! Just for the awesomeness that is Andrew Ehrgood:1) Andrew whips you into shape while sincerely loving your writing.2) He cares. Actually.3) If you have ever had a fleeting, fool's dream of going into law, take this class.Caveat: This class is time-consuming so you might need to clear out the rest of your schedule for it. Twice-weekly homework assignments can be tough.This course teaches you to write and think clearly.",
    "Great class. If you have the opportunity to take it with Ehrgood, don't pass up the opportunity!",
    "A GREAT class to take if you want to become a better writer and have any slight interest in the law (even a slight interest will suffice, since Ehrgood makes it all so interesting and entertaining). This is really one of the best classes I have taken at Yale, and has had a tremendous impact on my writing abilities.",
    "This is one of the best classes that I've taken at Yale, and Professor Ehrgood is one of the best professors that I've had! There's a lot of work involved, so it's not an easy writing credit, but it's worth taking if you're willing to put in the work.",
    "I highly recommend this class if you are at all interested in the law and if you want to improve your writing. You will have fascinating discussions about justice and the legal system, and your writing will improve. It is a lot of work, but for me, it was worth it.",
    "This is a great writing course that I recommend to any student.",
    "If you're at all interested in the law, take this class. The readings and discussions are great. The class is also great for improving the clarity of your writing.",
    "I would recommend this class. Professor Ehrgood really takes the time to make a relationship with you and schedule one-on-one conferences. The daily assignments were a nice way to keep you writing, and he always tried to make the workload manageable when he thought it was getting too much. I really enjoyed the main essays I wrote for the class, too. Beware of the style tests--you do have to study for them, which can be tedious."
