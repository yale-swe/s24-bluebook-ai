    "Solidification of physics concepts in the experimental space.",
    "How particle accelerators work, novelty of superconductivity, + other physics topics obviously",
    "I learned how to use a variety of tools still used in modern physics experiments. I learned how some important physics experiments of the 19th and 20th century were conducted by recreating them",
    "I learned how to operate new equipment, including an electron tube, DC power supply, acoustic network analyzer, particle accelerator, and a Tel-X-Ometer. I was also briefly exposed to physics topics not often seen in the classroom, including superconductivity, nuclear reactions, and digital logic.",
    "I learned how to be a better physical experimentalist. I learned how to take better measurements and apply my knowledge of physics (especially second semester physics aka E&M) to the experimental world. NOTE: you get to choose 9 of 25 experiments, and therefore each group will learn something different.",
    "I gained a better appreciation for certain phenomena like the photoelectric effect and superconductivity as well as a better awareness for various lab equipment.",
    "Great introduction to some famous experiments and notorious physical principles. I also learned to write a detailed and effective experiment report.",

   "comments": [
    "I liked the experiments; we had a small lab group, so we had a lot of fun. Some of the labs were frustrating - I think specifically our OpAmps lab didn't go well and the polarization of light writeup was really long. It would be nice if the TF's could recap the concepts at the beginning of the session, but I also like the freedom that the course gives us to learn. The lab reports took me a really long time every week - this lab should definitely be a full credit. In general I thought it was great.",
    "strengths -my TF (Arina!), the projects are super cool weaknesses - this is definitely the best lab course I've taken at Yale, yet I do wish it counted for a full credit because some of the lab reports took 20ish hours to write.",
    "The strength of the class is the way the work is structured so that we do our own research on the topic before lab starts and then afterwards we write a lab report. I like this structure because it teaches us the kind of pre-lab work necessary without us having to do mandatory assignments. I think the main weakness of this course is that not all the labs take the same amount of time. A lot of the weeks me and my lab partner had to stay overtime for up to 45 min due to the experiments taking a while to finish even when we are doing work at the same pace week to week. This led to rushed experiments and an overall unpleasant experience when did this occur.",
    "It's clear that the instructors of this course have noticed the veritable exponential decay in enrollment in 205 and 206 over the last few years, and based on both personal experience and copious anecdotal evidence from other students who've taken one or both of those courses, one main reason behind the steep decline in enrollment is that both courses require far too much work to justify their being worth only half a credit. I know I'm not alone in having spent more time on 205 and 206 than I spent many of my full-credit classes (that is, until I started prioritizing my other classes and got behind in lab). I also know that making these courses worth a full credit is mostly outside the control of the instructors, but that's not to say that there's nothing they could do. One idea that comes to mind is that all the lab reports could be cooperative, in that each group of two or three students only turns in one lab report for their group, as opposed to two or three students all writing small variations of the same report, which isn't a productive use of anyone's time. It seems like that works perfectly well in 382 (though I have slightly less anecdotal evidence to back up that claim).",
    "The largest strength of this course is being able to choose your labs and decide how you should design the experiments. However, the lab manuals are consistently poorly written and unclear, resulting in me and my partner meeting with Paul Noel or Stephen Irons multiple times to figure out how exactly the data should be analyzed. This could be improved by rewriting the lab manuals to pinpoint every step needed to be taken to analyze the data and give approximate correct results; for example, in the nuclear reactions lab, Paul had to show us in person there is a website that gave the necessary parameters needed to perform some complex calculations, and we had to check each calculated value for collision masses with him to move forwards. This could all be resolved if more direction and guidance was given in the lab manuals, as the X-ray diffraction lab manual was useless in figuring out which n's corresponded to which peaks and how to determine the lattice spacing in NaCl.",
    "One strength of this course is being able to choose the experiments that most interest us. Another strength is the teaching staff, especially Paul Noel. Weaknesses of this course include the difficulty of the lab reports for nearly all of the chemistry-related labs, especially electron diffraction, and the amount of time required to complete the lab reports. The understanding required for electron diffraction seemed too complex for me to understand, and that lab report was one of the worst ones I completed. It was still a cool lab though. The amount of time to complete these lab reports took at least 4 hours, and sometimes took over 10 hours to complete: completing a lab report each week was an immense undertaking if they took 10 hours to complete. This amount of work outside the lab warrants this class to be a full credit, although almost nobody would be able to take it since it would put them over the edge in course credits per semester. Perhaps lessening the difficulty of the chemistry-related labs, or providing some sort of pre-lab lecture to accompany the hand out would be nice. One way to improve the lab reports would be to perhaps not involve so much in the write-up of the lab, like Miller Indices. Also, perhaps a lecture on Miller Indices alone (I still do not know how to calculate them).",
    "The labs themselves are so much fun! So many great and varied options. However, there is very little guidance when it comes to the lab reports. Would be so much better if the lab reports were graded on a rubric or something. Seemed inconsistent.",
    "The labs were fun, and given that we only had one group in our section we got a lot of great attention. The class teaches you to write more than anything else, which would have been fine if we'd had more support in that area and had come in with that expectation. As it was, it took several lab reports for me to get the hang of writing it. Some of the content for the labs was above physics courses I've taken, so writing those lab reports required essentially self-teaching those subjects. Overall, the lab course was alright, but most of the work was not in the actual lab conducting the experiment which weighed heavily on my schedule and on my ability to satisfactorily complete the labs."

    "I liked this course a lot - the experiments were a lot of fun and I had a great lab group and TA. It's a lot of work, and a lot more intellectually challenging than the lower-level physics lab. If you're willing to put in (much) more work than the lower-level lab, you'll gain so much more and get to play with cool instruments like the particle accelerator. Some of the experiments are much more difficult than others - the particle accelerator labs are great, I liked the superconductors lab, and digital logic was awesome. There's a lot of support if things go wrong too.",
    "Yes!!! However I would recommend that you take this after the physics introductory sequence (even if you took AP Physics in HS). Also be prepared--the lab reports take FOREVER to write because you'll have to calculate all the data + uncertainties outside of lab. Some labs didn't take that long to write however. Time spent on lab reports: superconductivity- 4-5 hours; electron diffraction- 20+ (lost track after awhile), millikan oil drop- 15-20; and the rest took about 8-12hrs to write.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class to another student unless they are a physics major because it is a lot of work and plenty of frustration with an average amount of learning and excitement behind it.",
    "The only setting in which I'd recommend this class to another student if they didn't need to take it for their major would be if I thought they needed an intense crash course in time management skills.",
    "If you have to take this for the major, then you do what you have to do. Otherwise, this course is not worth the weekly ~10 page reports you must write based on poorly written lab guides and unhelpful instructors. In particular, there were three labs my partner and I did in which we either had to demand the instructors to tell us how to analyze the data or scour through multiple online resources to figure out what the lab was even about: acoustic resonance, nuclear reactions, and x-ray diffraction. My best advice is to ask students who have previously taken 206L to see which labs are the most beneficial and organized - my recommendations are charge-to-mass ratio, electric field plotting, superconductivity, and digital logic.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, and actually over the PHYS 166L course. This course is SOOOO much better in terms of freedom: you get to choose which experiments to do! Also, the TA's this semester were amazing, so hopefully that trend continues. This course is amazing to truly understand the experimental side of physics, as well as complete the pre-med requirement of physics lab. Why not have fun in the lab while also getting requirements out of the way? Heck, take this class for the fun of it if you have time!",
    "Yes, but only if you are willing to put in the work. There is a lot of busy work and formatting needed."
