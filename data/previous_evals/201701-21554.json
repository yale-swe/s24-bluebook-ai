   "comments": [
    "I think Physics 166L paired nicely with Phys 181, although sometimes was a little ahead in material. I learned a lot about electromagnetism.",
    "By taking the class, I learned how to us several pieces of equipment relating to the field of electricity and magnetism. I felt as though my lab skills and intuition improved as a result of taking this course.",
    "This course helped me realize the importance of reading class material ahead of time in order to come in to the class with an understanding of the material being taught. I learned how simple circuits work and how to draw them, as well as how to operate numerous electronic devices such as oscilloscopes and function generators.",
    "Learning real-life applications was the best part!",
    "Useless waste of my time. This has EXTREMELY little relevancy to and overlap with being a doctor, the MCDB major, indepedent research in a lab at KBT or the Med School, biotech, etc. Literally ask 99% of other students. If you want to decrease student depression and anxiety in the STEM field, you can start by cutting back the 2 terms of required physics labs for MCDB majors. It's absolutely pointless and the department prioritizes the physics labs' teachers' feelings of possibly being offended over STUDENT's anxiety, well-being, and college career. Honestly, what student majoring MCDB or MB&B wants to take 2-4 terms of chemistry lab, 2 terms biology labs, 2 terms physics labs, etc. It's so extraneous. Being swamped with labs each year is so tiring detracts from learning stuff in other non-STEM subjects. Additionally, the lab write-ups ARE NOT HELPFUL AT ALL. They are so pointless. Most students who take PHYS 165L\/166L forget everything they did as soon as they turn in the write-up. Contrast this to the MCDB labs class MCDB 344L\/345L, where there is no homework or lab write-ups -- just in class experiments and dedicating time in class to TRULY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE DOING and appreciate its relevancy to medicine, research, your future career field, etc. Making sure students understand what they are doing in class is a so much more valuable use of time than making them spend hours on writing lab write-ups.",
    "I got a little better at hooking up wires. I now know how to use the most basic functions of an oscilloscope, which might be useful.",
    "-A great sense of humor (courtesy of whoever wrote the lab packets-- thank you for keeping lab readings fun) -How to not kill the patient, or Harvey, for that matter -How to (sometimes) use an oscilloscope correctly -How to trigger",
    "Learned how to use equipment such as oscilloscope for measurement and data collection. The labs were designed well to truly walk students through the most important theoretical points of each topic.",
    "This course was a general introduction to circuits, resonance, ray optics, and some other topics. Each lab was effective in demonstrating a particular principle, since interactive activities can often illustrate scientific principles more vividly than lectures.",

    "I didn't gain anything from taking this course, except for increased frustration with Yale's introductory courses.",
    "This course did a decent job of teaching me some basic methods in a few different areas of interest within physics, including optics and simple harmonic motion. The weekly lab reports taught me how to summarize my work clearly and efficiently, although sometimes I felt that they were so formulaic as to be without value after the 20th iteration.",

    "I was able to visualize the concepts in physics that we had seen in lecture. In addition, I learned to use basic physics equipment (multimeter, oscilloscope, etc.).",

    "This class was a very good supplement to second semester physics. I would not have understood a lot of the concepts had I not done the lab.",

    "Moves faster than the lecture. Made it really hard to keep up.",
    "This class was actually a nice compliment to the course material in 171, and helped me understand some of the concepts covered in lecture.",

    "This course was a good physical compliment to the lecture course that helped us understand the topics on a new level.",

    "This course followed the knowledge that we learned in Physics 181.",
    "I learned to apply physics concepts to real life.",
    "You definitely get used to thinking on your feet and not just \"running through the motions\" in lab. You really apply stuff you've learned in lecture and get a better understanding of it out of lab.",
    "This course was a good supplement to the intro Physics courses, and helped reinforce a lot of the material that was learned in that course.",
    "I liked the hands on approach of the Lab and the fact that I took it along the lecture (Phys 181). I would recommend students in doing the same. Also, I believe it helped to understand better concepts we were studying in the lecture."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The weaknesses were sometimes how the course was a bit ahead of what we were learning in physics lecture. The strength is that it really reinforced ideas of physics that we ultimately learned. It was an organized course which was appreciated and also a true half credit course with just the right amount of workload.",
    "There are several ways that PHYS 166L needs to be improved. To begin with, the lab doesn't follow lecture at all (at least PHYS 181 lecture). The material being asked on the midterm and final exam had not been, or is never, covered in PHYS 181. I think this is quite unfair to PHYS 181 students, and makes lab a waste of time. Shouldn't the purpose of lab be to reinforce concepts covered in lecture? With lab ofter weeks ahead of lecture in terms of material, labs were far less useful than they should have been, and often ended up wasting students, TAs, and even instructors time. Another major change that the course needs is clearer lab report expectations. At several points during the semester, points were taken off lab reports by the TAs because their grading rubric required something that was either not mentioned, or not emphasized enough in the lab handout.",
    "This course does a good job of making the lecture material much more accessible through the hands-on approach. However, the grading on the notebooks seems a little random and inconsistent at times.",
    "The grading of the labs should not be relative to other students' work, but to a set rubric. It just doesn't make sense.",
    "Change the head of the labs course. Sean Barret is irresponsible and not fit to head the lab course.",
    "The course could have a better outline for how grading works (even after two semesters, the \"insight\" grading felt like a number was drawn out of a hat - fortunately a small portion). It also could have explained the gravity-wave experiment better.",
    "It seemed that much of the lab was catered toward the PHYS 171 curriculum. Many of the PHYS 181 students were frustrated because the labs did not coincide with the lectures at all. It's also stressful for students to attempt to learn about a topic that they had not even discussed in lecture (ie. induction). Often times, I came out of lab not understanding any part of the lab I did-- it was only until the topic came up in lecture that it made sense, but as a result, preparing for the labs were incredibly and unnecessarily stressful. There is also the issue of grading. Points are taken off almost arbitrarily-- even though the general rubric was posted on Canvas, the rubric is very vague, and is not specific for every lab. It would be great if we were given specific rubrics because otherwise it is not fair to be deducted points simply because the rubric or the lab packet didn't even mention it.",
    "I would prefer more labs that are relevant to the tested material on the midterm and final practicals, and less of the unrelated ones (like the final biologic lab). Fewer but more in-depth labs would serve as better review material.",
    "I think this course is quite strong in that it demands a just amount from students, so students are more prone to be engaged. There is more than enough time to complete the experiments in the time allotted and the reports are very manageable. I actually cannot think of any weaknesses of the course.",
    "Grading between the TAs should be more consistent",
    "Weaknesses: Most of the experiments done in this course come way ahead of when the material is learned in lecture. Therefore, most people have no clue what's going on, which makes it hard to understand what we are doing. Nobody learns anything from that, because often the TAs and professors don't do a good job of explaining either. Also, the only feedback I ever got on my reports was that I did not include \"insight\", which was something very ill-defined and seemingly impossible to achieve, no matter what I wrote.",
    "The course is to a large degree the simple process of reading (the lab manual) and following the instructions blindly. I think many students, such as myself, come away from the class thinking they have not so much learned physics as done a bunch of busy-work that happens to be physics-related. I would have appreciated a greater theoretical context surrounding the experiments we were undertaking, perhaps in the form of a brief (10-minute) lecture from the section TA. At the same time, this course does strike a happy balance between all the different competing groups who take it, from pre-meds to science majors to engineers. As a pre-med, it did not feel overwhelmingly theoretical, nor did it feel like there was an assumed starting point in terms of physics background. Engineers most likely were not very stimulated by this course.",
    "Pros: Low work-load, easy-to-understand concepts; physics lab reports are graded quite leniently. TAs are quite invested in your learning. Cons: Walk up to science hill quite long -- I recommend the afternoon bus. Also, the lab midterms and finals are timed, unlike the regular labs, putting extreme stress on you as you attempt to complete each without running out of time.",
    "For an introductory physics lab, it's just fine. My TA was great and was willing to help. However, the class could be improved by being clearer on what was expected of us in our write-ups (so that we could earn the points more effectively) and also to line up the labs more loosely similarly to the lectures--or, at least, omitting the labs that we had zero exposure to in lecture.",
    "Strengths: interesting, concise labs; great TAs Weaknesses: midterms and finals were still more difficult (for me) than any lab we did in class. Would have liked to have had more time to practice with oscilloscopes! They were so crucial to doing well in the course and we just didn't use them as much as I would have liked.",
    "Weaknesses: -some of the directions just aren't in depth enough to know how to do the experiment the day of without asking the TA. like how are we supposed to know what to do -midterm\/final are disproportionately hard compared to weekly labs because we're not allowed to ask from help from TAs but during the week we are.",
    "The only weakness is that the lab did not always follow the flow of the physics class, so some labs I was supposed to be applying the knowledge that I learned in class in the lab, but we hadn't discussed that topic in class yet. Also, the TAs vary greatly in quality and knowledge of the lab techniques\/materials. I found myself waiting for Simon or Professor Cahn to come by to ask my questions than asking my TA who never seemed to know what was going on.",
    "This course is taught well. The only tip I have is to possibly offer more lab times that don't interfere with its lecture counterpart.",
    "The coordination with the lecture material could definitely be improved--certain topics would appear weeks apart in one course vs. the other. I also feel as if the quizzes did not test our knowledge of the material, and had questions that were either extremely intuitive or unknowably hard (the latter category representing a small but existent minority of questions). Also the category of \"insight points\" should probably be clarified a bit more (in advance) so that we know what to be doing for that in the lab reports.",
    "It needs to align better with the lecture courses.",
    "The class did not do a good job presenting all students with the tools necessary to succeed on exams. Some students were more comfortable than others because they had previously been exposed to that information through another physics course. This made final exams - which have slightly new material - easier for them.",
    "The course was organized into individual labs each week, which was nice because it allowed us to focus in on one area every week. The lab instructions, however, were not always clear and sometimes covered information that we had not yet covered in lecture. This might be due to the fact that both PHYS 181 and PHYS 171 students take the lab at the same time and the lectures are not synced.",
    "The course is accessible and manageable, while still teaching a lot of skills and material. I understand that it is a requirement for pre-meds and thus many of the labs were written with a slant to biological applications. However, as someone who is not a pre-med, these felt unnecessary and I wish there were more connections to pure engineering\/physics applications.",
    "The course material doesn't quite line up with the material in PHYS181, but it does a good job of being self-contained. It would help to have greater TA instruction prior to the lab so that we had a better understanding of what exactly we were supposed to be learning beforehand. I came out of the class with a greater understanding of how to use the specific equipment we used, but not necessarily the concepts behind them.",
    "I really struggled in this course because I had no background with electricity and magnetism and there weren't really resources available to help students like me. I found it difficult because I was expected to know how to use certain equipment and I was expected to know how to set up certain experiments and I didn't and couldn't really learn and therefore was unsuccessful during exams. The practice sessions for the final were very helpful but I wish there had been something like that for the midterm as well.",
    "Class is very well put together. I found no flaws with the course.",
    "The course was very interactive and help me strengthen many new skills.",
    "The three hour class was long and some of the experiments were confusing. I felt like there could have been more practical instructions. I really enjoyed the humor in the lab instructions.",
    "The class is not well coordinated with the physics lectures. It's very confusing to do one experiment only to understand the physics behind it weeks later.",
    "Well organized, good professors leading the course The addition of a midterm exam was very helpful in preparing us for the final exam.",
    "I felt this course tried too hard to push premed or esoteric tie-ins of applications of concepts rather than trying to make us truly understand the fundamentals of the science. I really didn't end up learning much about physics, which I felt was a little disappointing as I definitely felt like the course has the potential to do that.",
    "The lab instructions are often confusing. A bunch of students will try to go around seeing what to do which can be pretty frustrating. If some key points in the lab handouts could be better explained, it would improve the class.",
    "Material was not really taught as much as it should have been, had to learn all yourself.",
    "I enjoyed this course much more than 166L because it focused more on the experiments\/ knowledge than error calculations.",
    "The course is well-organized and the professors are very helpful, but some portions of the final exam were unclear.",
    "A solid, basic physics lab class One weakness was that some the topics covered in lab (especially the lenses lab) were not at all covered in physics lecture",
    "Pretty good overview of E & M labs, did not really correspond to what we were learning in lecture but still interesting. The labs themselves were engaging and mostly well explained. Unfortunately the final seemed a little unfair, in the future it would be very helpful to make sure students are aware of ALL possible equipment that may show up on the final, so they can be better prepared for the exam.",
    "I wish this course corresponded with the actual physics course better. It was hard to understand what I was doing lab without having learned the concepts in class.",
    "Strengths: the concepts strengthen the theoretical background we get in the main course. We understand the concepts better because of the lab. Weaknesses: the lab handouts can be very unclear -- labs end up taking a long time to complete not because they are complicated but because we don't understand the handouts. Also, topics studied in lab tend not to fall in the same order as in the main course.",
    "I think this lab was preferable to first semesters.",
    "The strengths of the course were that the labs were really interesting and doable in the allotted time frame. You could tell that the instructors had put a lot of effort into designing the experiments and writing the lab manuals. I also really liked how supportive the class was in terms of student learning (ie. allowing us to redo parts of the midterm that we had originally gotten wrong, having multiple practice sessions for the final). I would say that one of the weaknesses of the course was that it sometimes tried to appeal to biology majors by trying to draw comparisons between the two subjects ; however, as someone who is not well-versed in biology some of the analogies were difficult to understand and made it harder to understand the physics that it was trying to relate to.",
    "The strengths are that it makes you think in a way you would never have before, its weaknesses is that this can often be frustrating when the content in physics lab doesn't match up with the content from lecture. It is hard to figure out something you've never learned before.",
    "The course is straightforward enough but very dry and mostly independently learned material. It's not very interesting or in deptj.",
    "Physics lab is pretty straightforward in that you just follow a procedure, I think the strength is that the procedure is usually well written so that it is easy to follow. The only weakness was during the last week, with the biophysic lab, which very few people understood!",
    "The material taught in the course did not follow what we were learning in Phys 181, and it was hard to understand the theoretical background for the labs without having prior practice in class.",
    "This course is VERY frustrating because it does NOT line up with the content being taught in the PHYS 171 or 181, making it much less informative than it otherwise would have. Without having a firm grasp of the concepts, it is very hard to understand what is going on in the lab and the backgrounds provided in the lab handouts were not sufficient enough.",
    "The strength of the course is that it does just what it needs to do: teach how to conduct physical experiments.",
    "The course supplemented teaching from Phys 171 well.",
    "My main problem with this course was that it did not follow along well with the PHYS 181 curriculum. I understand that there are some differences in how PHYS 171 and 181 are taught, but it was hard to really get a lot out of the labs as a PHYS 181 student when we were working with concepts that I hadn't yet learned about. It would probably be best to adjust the order of labs so that both PHYS 171 and 181 students can go into the lab with a solid understanding of the material - I feel like that really would have enhanced my experience in this class.",
    "The experiments are interesting, if not a little bit tedious. The background reading doesn't help much with the actual experiment.",
    "some times students are expected to have background knowledge in a topic that they have never encountered - the pre-lab handout attempts to remedy this but sometimes it is not actually written in a very approachable way (probably for the sake of brevity) - the result is that students need things explained to them in a kind of \"by-the-way\" manner, which feels sloppy and incomplete",
    "The strength of this course was the breadth of experiments that the students could do. One weakness was that some of the experiments were extremely short (some experiments could be finished by the entire section in less than one hour out of a three hour session). I think some of the experiments could be expanded to include more concepts or phenomenon.",
    "Maybe keep same lab partner",
    "Interesting labs, but they were sometimes more wordy than necessary",
    "the lab instructions could have been clearer towards the end",
    "It would be nice if the labs better correlated in order with the topics presented in lecture. Also, I feel as though we did the same lab just slightly varied for most of the semester (just like different types of circuits).",
    "Strengths are the availability of help from Professor Mochrie and TA's. Weaknesses are that using the oscilloscope was tricky and the lab write-ups can be tedious.",
    "Good course, enjoyed it more than the first semester lab course. Very difficult practical final though.",
    "This course is a good introduction to practical applications of E&M physics. I think each experiment does a good job of addressing a specific topic and teaching students about its importance. I think one weakness is the amount of time dedicated to the oscilloscope. It is used in very few experiments but is then required on both practical exams. I think more exposure to the equipment would benefit students on the exams.",
    "The lab reports were concise and we learned a good amount.",
    "I felt the quality of this course actually declined from last semester, as everything I felt was a problem actually got worse. While labs were generally simpler this semester, the lab manuals were harder to read (especially the lens lab that was 14 pages). Hokeyness was added at the expense of clarity, and in general they were less organized. Last semester, I felt expectations were unclear- even simple stuff, like if we had to turn our notebooks in at the end of lab. This semester, the syllabus got even less clear, such as the bit about scanning your reports that confused all the TFs as well.",
    "Very hands on, some concepts are hard to understand if the TF is not able to articulate them well.",
    "This course had a midterm which I feel was an excellent way into prepare for the final practical exam. This helped me to succeed in the course.",
    "Labs were generally interesting and not too lengthy, and the following write-up was not unreasonably burdensome either. The midterm assessment was a good test trial for the final. I wish the last one or two weeks of class were devoted to lab final practice instead of short diffraction labs.",
    "it actually is fairly interesting",
    "Very fair expectations and grading for the level of the course. I had no prior knowledge of electricity, magnetism, and optics but was able to complete the expected level of coursework and labs with the provided information and help from the TA's.",
    "The class was very structured, so that made the expectations very straightforward, but it was not very interesting. Most people aren't taking a physics lab for fun (almost entirely made up of pre-meds), and the concepts are much more difficult than the ones students work with in PHYS 180, but the professors and TFs were relatively helpful.",
    "This course seemed like it got pretty out of sync with the PHYS 181 lecture very quickly. As a result, we were doing experiments about topics that we hadn't even begun to discuss in lecture. I think I might have gotten more out of the lab if I had some background about what we were doing. I understand that it's difficult to keep pace with the lecture exactly, but maybe the optics material could be moved to the beginning of the lab (since that's never discussed in PHYS 181 anyway), and by the time the lab got to circuits, we would have discussed them at least a bit more in PHYS 181.",
    "This lab is lind of boring but the professors do their best to make it interesting and approachable to all students.",
    "Strengths--great applicability to the real-world (engineering, medicine, etc.), very organized, grades reported in a timely manner Weaknesses--final practical",
    "Solid course. I wish sometimes the experiments could be more like the Harvey Lab. A little more fun to perform while still giving insight into the concepts.",
    "A great strength of the course is how it allows students to immediately engage in the practical (hands on) investigations of fundamental physical laws without having spent hours at a black board deriving theoretical expressions and relationships. Basically, the course has all of the fun of physics without most of the less exciting parts. There was an emphasis on learning by doing as opposed to the emphasis on learning by proving in lecture based courses.",
    "Strengths include immediate feedback from the teaching assistants during the lab. However, it did take a very long time to receive lab reports back which made it difficult to improve quickly.",
    "The professors for this course were great, esp. Simon. However, the TAs varied wildly in their teaching ability, willingness to help students, and evaluations of work. With the grading, even as I asked repeatedly for any criteria on which we would be graded, so that I could then prepare my written work accordingly, I consistently felt as though nothing I could do would affect my grade, reverting to a state of learned helplessness and subsequently losing motivation to actually apply myself to the course. Maybe my TA, Tae Kwan, was just particularly jaded from his lab courses at UChicago, but it often felt like he didn't think that we should be doing well, and that we should be struggling.",
    "While Phys166L is successful in encouraging true experimentation as students are left to find their own way through portions of labs, some gaps in instruction in lab handouts left us very confused. We were forced to rely on our TA relatively frequently for additional explanation\/directions.",
    "I often felt lost in the lab because there wasn't enough instruction before starting even though I had read the entire lab manual.",
    "Straight forward with short lab assignments. The insight portion was a little ambiguous.",
    "Strengths: the labs actually made you think, instead of just being a series of steps to follow (which I really appreciated). I learned more in this lab class than any of my intro chemistry labs, with half of the work. Weaknesses: was not on pace with PHYS 166 lecture; they did not complement each other in a way that lecture would have helped me to understand lab or vice versa",
    "I felt more prepared coming into 166L than I did in 165L. Professors are nice and resourceful.",
    "This course is TERRIBLE and I don't even know where to start. The problem isn't necessarily the difficulty level-- the labs are never too challenging and the write-ups are just a page of you just basically typing up the lab report with different words. The problem is that this class is SO boring (and I'm not premed-- I actually really like physics in general) and the grading is SO arbitrary. Throughout the entire semester, I got a total of no more than 5 points off for lack of understanding the material. Everything else was penalization for incorrect formatting or petty stylistic reasons or \"just because\".",
    "I don't think the final practical should be weighted as heavily as it is. The bulk of the work is done doing the labs and write ups throughout the semester. If the questions asked on the final exam do not click, your grade could change and not reflect the quality of the bulk of the work of the semester.",
    "It is well structured and very educative. I do think the prelab manuals could be more consistent - some were well written, and very clear, while others were less so.",
    "This course aligns well with Physics 180 and the experiments are easy to follow.",
    "I think the physics labs were accessible and well explained. Occasionally the lab handouts were long winded and included extraneous information.",
    "The instructions were clear, but sometimes the lab handouts were a little long-winded.",
    "PHYS 166L is more interesting than its fall component, in my opinion. It's pretty organized, and the TFs are great. The lab complements very well with PHYS 171 and lets you understand more thoroughly the concepts presented in lecture. My only complaint would be that the final wasn't really representative of what we had done in lab throughout the year.",
    "The course did its best to be relevant to different applications of Physics, ranging from more traditional ones to medical ones, which was a definite strength of the course and helped engagement. I think one of the areas the course could be improved would be to have the Professors be a bit more engaged with the students - they were always a great source of help, whether it be clarification or just information and expansion on the topics. Having them around more definitely would help both understanding and engagement with the course.",
    "Some of the lab instructions are not always the clearest and can lead to confusion with procedures. This is especially true with the very last lab where we were told to draw a circuit diagram but we were unable to do so since all the wiring lay beneath the cover of the breadbox.",
    "A strength of the course is the parallel with Phys 181 (or equivalent) and the grading system. I believe the fact that they added a midterm helped a lot of people preparing for the final. However, a weakness is that sometimes we see in the lab things we don't see in the lecture and, since we only have 3 hours a week, it is harder to understand and follow with the experiment.",
    "Some of the labs are more interesting than others, and some are taught better than others. I really didn't enjoy the fact that many times the lab went faster than the actual things we were doing in class, so the concepts felt very abstract. There were times when I had no idea what was going on, which was very frustrating. Sometimes, when that would happen, the whole class would gather around the TA or professor and watch it be done. You really need to get a good TA to make it a better experience (Luna is great). There is a practice midterm which is very helpful for the final and the final experiments are doable."

   "comments": [
    "If you're reading this, you almost definitely have to take this class. You're gonna have a bad time. Just do the work, it's not hard just super boring.",
    "Yes, if you are pre-med you have to take it and it really isn't too bad! Your TA can really help you in the course if they are good at explaining things.",
    "If you're taking this class, it's most likely not by choice. It's not extremely difficult, and at times it's actually useful, but be prepared to be very frustrated.",
    "Useless waste of my time. This has EXTREMELY little relevancy to and overlap with being a doctor, the MCDB major, indepedent research in a lab at KBT or the Med School, biotech, etc. Literally ask 99% of other students. If you want to decrease student depression and anxiety in the STEM field, you can start by cutting back the 2 terms of required physics labs for MCDB majors. It's absolutely pointless and the department prioritizes the physics labs' teachers' feelings of possibly being offended over STUDENT's anxiety, well-being, and college career. Honestly, what student majoring MCDB or MB&B wants to take 2-4 terms of chemistry lab, 2 terms biology labs, 2 terms physics labs, etc. It's so extraneous. Being swamped with labs each year is so tiring detracts from learning stuff in other non-STEM subjects. Additionally, the lab write-ups ARE NOT HELPFUL AT ALL. They are so pointless. Most students who take PHYS 165L\/166L forget everything they did as soon as they turn in the write-up. Contrast this to the MCDB labs class MCDB 344L\/345L, where there is no homework or lab write-ups -- just in class experiments and dedicating time in class to TRULY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE DOING and appreciate its relevancy to medicine, research, your future career field, etc. Making sure students understand what they are doing in class is a so much more valuable use of time than making them spend hours on writing lab write-ups.",
    "You basically have to take it, don't you? It's fine. Not particularly interesting, but it's at least not too much work.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, especially if the student is taking PHYS 181 because much of it is unnecessary stress.",
    "Relatively straightforward premed physics lab, same structure as PHYS 165.",
    "For a lab class, this course is great. Each lab is very interesting and provides plenty of opportunity for you to practice applying important E&M concepts in various contexts. It's not a ton of work, only one lab write-up due a week. There's a quiz every week, but those are easy if you've read the lab handout beforehand. Most people who take it have to for their major and\/or for premed requirements, but compared to other mandatory courses, this one is rather enjoyable for the most part.",
    "If you are taking this course it is likely because you have to take this for your major, or for pre-med requirements. that being said, it is nothing to dread. It is actually quite enjoyable and manageable. I would say there are \"better\" courses at Yale, but for an introductory physics lab I would highly recommend 166L.",
    "You're probably going to take this class for some req, like premed. It is much shorter and less painful than chemistry labs because there's no lengthy lab reports. It is easy to get a good grade without much engagement, but the best part is that it really will help you understand the concepts from the class (PHYS 171 or 181) better. The key is to get a TA who understands the experiments, so when they go wrong it won't be a tortuous waste of time, where you try to complete an assignment while no one know what's going on.",
    "This course is required for most pre-meds and STEM majors, so whether or not I recommend it is irrelevant. However, if you are thinking of taking this course for fun, don't. There is nothing you will gain that you think you would from a physics lab course.",
    "I would only recommend the course if it were a requirement that my peer needs to fulfill. It is required for a lot of paths in STEM, so I would recommend it as a starting point to anyone who wants to keep their options open. I would not recommend it for fun.",
    "Way less work than Phys 206L, so if you are choosing between the two and just need to get a requirement out of the way, I would recommend this class. The experiments are simple, but it is well run.",
    "Only take the physics and associated physics lab if required for your major. Otherwise, the concepts can easily be taught at another low-level science course.",
    "You likely have to take this course for a requirement--it is okay, not painful, but not super engaging either. It's worth half a credit and is pretty low-stress.",
    "I feel you only take this course because you need it for a requirement?...",
    "only if you have to",
    "yes! easy lab course",
    "Yes. The course was enough work to satisfy a half credit without ever being stressful. The course was fun and engaging because while it is intended to be paired with PHYS 171\/181, I took PHYS 201 and it seemed to stay in progression with my course than those. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to be pre-med or in the sciences but not for physics majors.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone. Pre-med students should take this along with PHYS 170\/171. The class is easy to follow, and the TAs are always present to help with any questions or concerns students may have.",
    "If you are premed or have to take it, yes.",
    "Yes because it is required for pre-medical students but it does not align well with the lecture courses for physics offered.",
    "Yes.",
    "If you have to take this lab, you can learn a lot but expect labs to be somewhat stressful; instructions and content are not always clear or intuitive.",
    "This is a pretty enjoyable lab. From what I've heard from other sections, all the TFs are helpful. It's a very manageable workload and you get to do some interesting experiments. Sometimes the lab material didn't always match up with lecture, but it's cool when you cover the concepts and applications together. For a class that most people take as a requirement, it's actually a solid class.",
    "Good course to learn the basics of Physics E&M.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to gain hands-on experience in a physics lab and learn about how concepts learned in lecture can be applied to real life scenarios.",
    "Only if they needed it for a major. Overall, I didn't learn that much besides how to use certain tools, which I probably will not need to use again.",
    "If you don't have to take it, don't. But if you're taking it, it's probably because you have to.",
    "Take it if you need to, it's not much work. Otherwise, don't.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it if you don't have to take it. It is one day a week for three hours which can get tiring. It isn't very much work since each week's lab only consists of a one page write up.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in physics and exploring the options of physics.",
    "PHYS 166L is a solid lab course that is well-structured and covers interesting material.",
    "If you need a basic physics lab, the workload is relatively light and concepts aren't too hard to grasp",
    "Yeah",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The labs were well run and interesting.",
    "Yeah if you have to take a physics lab, this one is a good one! It is not too demanding and you get to work with a lab partner every week.",
    "A more relaxed lab. I enjoyed the physicality of the experiments - you can often see the results. I also loved learning to use LoggerPro. As someone who did not use this program in high school, the learning curve was a little tough at the beginning but definitely a useful skill for future computer based analysis.",
    "The course shouldn't be taken unless required because it's not interesting or very in depth.",
    "Would recommend as a follow up to the first lab!",
    "I would only take this course if absolutely necessary.",
    "Yes, if it is a required lab.",
    "not for fun, only if you need it",
    "If you have to take this course, take it. If you don't, you probably won't need to take this lab, but it can be pretty interesting at times.",
    "Solid lab. Not too bad. Would take if lab necessary",
    "Yes; lab reports are not very strenuous, learn to use some important things like Fourier transforms",
    "straightforward, relatively easy course that teaches essential physics lab techniques",
    "It is probably the chillest lab you will have to take as a premed.",
    "PHYS 166L is fine. Experiments typically take no more than 2.5-3 hours, and the lab reports are straightforward and can be done in about an hour. Because E&M is, at least in my opinion, a little less intuitive than mechanics, it's useful to be familiar with the material before going in to lab.",
    "It is a requirement so I imagine students would have to take it.",
    "If you're taking this class it's probably because you have to, but having said that, it's actually a pretty good course that can help you better understand some of the material in lecture.",
    "You are probably only taking this lab if you have to. That being said, it's pretty painless and sometimes enjoyable. It's a very light workload; there is a one-page write-up due each week, and after writing a couple of them it becomes fairly easy to finish them. The practicals are a little bit more demanding than the experiments but you can get help on the midterm from your TAs and the exam gives you good experience for the final. All in all, this is a good class and not too stressful. It's definitely only 1\/2 a credit of work.",
    "If its required!",
    "You're probably taking this because it's required, it's not bad at all but you do want to spend some time on the concepts and check with TAs so you don't get blindsided by the final.",
    "Good introductory physics laboratory course. It is very well organized, and most of the topics are very useful or interesting.",
    "Better than 165, not too bad",
    "If you are pre med or a physics manor take this course.",
    "From the perspective of a MechE major: the course is geared towards freshman\/sophomore premed students and engineering students will probably find this course fairly easy and the biology examples in the lab to be a bit forced. Take this course if you want to focus more on other classes. Take 206L if you really want to expand your knowledge of physics.",
    "it's requried",
    "Yes, definitely! If you put in the work, you will end up doing well and understanding everything.",
    "All the labs were pretty straightforward and there were a few that ended early. Like 165L, it's pretty good as far as labs go.",
    "I mean if you need it for a major or for premed then sure, but you don't really learn a whole ton in terms of skills. It is nice to see theories in practice.",
    "This course is one of the most painless labs I've taken at Yale. Also, this semester, the course was graded on an absolute scale where 92% and above was an A, which was wonderful; in a lab where everyone does about the same, a curve would just be vicious.",
    "Only take it if you have to, but isn't as painful as some other labs.",
    "I would not recommend taking this course unless it's required. It's a fine course, but it's 3 hours a week for only half a credit, and it's not the most interesting thing I've ever done.",
    "Don't take this unless your interested in physics\/engineering. (Or premed lol)",
    "I thought that 166 was definitely more engaging than 165 (in terms of medical-based physics labs), but the concept of the \"final practical\" needs to end--not effective and most students agree.",
    "Solid course, not to be dreaded.",
    "To be honest, I wouldn't recommend any lab course to anyone who doesn't need to take one. Having said that, I would definitely recommend this course (or its related PHYS 165L course) over any other lab course if I absolutely had to make a recommendation.",
    "If you can get a good TA, then this course will be a breeze and you can learn a lot. However, the value of this class largely depends on the TA.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student seeking to gain hands-on physics experience.",
    "I wouldn't unless you have to take it.",
    "This is an okay lab class. I took this lab after taking 205 in the fall, and by comparison it was much, much easier. The reports are short, everything that needs to go in the lab notebook gets done in class, the brief quizzes at the beginning of each lab are generally pretty easy (multiple choice, based on the lab handouts and reference sheets). Overall a much lower time commitment than 205 and less stress. Experiments were pretty straightforward and we usually got done about an hour early (sometimes even earlier). If you have to take a physics lab, this one isn't a bad choice, and it won't be too much work or stress added on to other classes.*",
    "Great intro lab class! Material is interesting and engaging and the teaching staff is fantastic.",
    "Pretty much like PHYS 165L. I'd say the experiments are easier since you tend to get better data for them, which is nice. This year they added a \"practical midterm\" to help prepare for the final which i think overall was helpful. You probably gotta take it anyway so just get it done, it's not that bad.",
    "Pretty straightforward continuation of the 166L course.",
    "This course is similar in style to PHYS 165L but the labs are less straight-forward and the topic are conceptually more difficult. That being said if you took PHYS 165L you will be fine in this course. If you don't have to take this course for some kind of requirement then it's probably not worth it.",
    "yes! much better than the intro chemistry labs, both in terms of workload and the amount that you actually learn after the class is over.",
    "Take it if you have to. Some labs are interesting, others really aren't. Format similar to 165L.",
    "NO. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. THIS COURSE IS SO BORING AND SO AWFUL AND SO MISERABLE. YOU WILL LEARN LITTLE TO NOTHING.",
    "Yes, it is an interesting class, and it can be very fun!",
    "I would only take this course if you have to take it.",
    "This course is fine. I needed to take it for my major and it wasn't that bad. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone for whom the course is not required.",
    "This class was fine. I had to take it for my major and it wasn't that bad. I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone for whom it is not required.",
    "It's not a bad course--the concepts are pretty interesting and it's organized. Just ask a lot of questions on things you don't know, and pay attention in lab and you'll be ok.",
    "Chances are if you're taking this course, it's for a requirement. Could definitely be worse though! Ask your TAs and Professors for help when needed and it's very manageable.",
    "Only take this if you are pre-med. It is not as bad as the first part of physics lab because you get used to the format of the course, the actual class does not always take up the whole three and a half hours, and some of the experiments are interesting. The quizzes are short and doable but just be careful because there are so little questions that one wrong costs you a lot of points. This lab can be very frustrating when you are completely lost, but if you get a good TA, you'll be okay."
