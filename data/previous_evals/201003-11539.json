    "3&4: The workload for this class was just perfect. I enjoyed the readings each week (not too many, usually) and the one-page summary was helpful without being a hassle each week. I think the length and timing of the policy memo worked great; I was able to explore an issue in depth by just focusing on the basics and employing numbers\/tables\/figures. I appreciated the list of suggested memo topics too.5: I liked that the professor made it clear from the start that this class is discussion-based, and I feel like people felt free to critique and comment, and the professor handled that well. He was usually able to help clarify or provide a contrasting point of view, but was also honest when he didn't know something, which I appreciated. He would always look it up later and fill us in next time.7: the professor is very knowledgeable and was able to clearly articulate not only the main concepts, but also details of processes and patterns. He was really helpful in office hours, and very flexible, which I think everyone appreciated.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. There was a lot of work with commentaries each week, but it made me understand and appreciate the material that much more.",
    "The course was too general with lots of readings, which made it hard to grab concepts. Although the course was introductory, it should focus on a few things to match time.",
    "Readings were sometimes hard to understand, but the lectures were helpful to clarify.",
    "4. The course requires a lot of reading followed up by commentaries. Although it is a lot of work to complete the readings and the commentaries before the next class, I found that these requirements pushed me to read the materials. The class discussions helped develop my understanding of the readings even further.6. We covered a lot of difference concepts in a very short amount of time, so we didn't get to dig as deep as I expected.",
    "The course is a general survey of climate change. It is interesting, but very broad and lacks a cohesive narrative or perspective.",
    "This class was amazing\/",

    "The lectures were insightful and rich. A lot of material in each one.",
    "The best thing is that all the aspects of climate change, from economics to geoengineering were covered in the class.",
    "This course was able to cover many topics concerning climate change in one semester. It provided a great introduction to vulnerability, adaptation, and mitigation.I specifically liked how the course was broken down into lecture and discussion. The discussion encouraged student participation,which made the class much more engaging.",
    "the lectures",
    "Learning about all the different facets of climate change. I found that topics covered in this class helped me to understand and offer thoughtful insight during my discussions in other classes involving economics, water scarcity and business management.I also thought that the memo assignment offered practical experience that will be useful in my future career.",
    "The one-page reading responses due each week were very helpful to ensure that I analyzed the reading before class. The adaptation memo and final research paper were also excellent assignments to delve deeper into material that was interesting to me.",

    "the teaching methods are good. I thought it was very helpful to do commentaries after for the reading sets.",
    "This is probably the best course I've ever taken. The format makes you learn a lot. Readings that you definitely read since you have to post a commentary the day before class. Well presented lectures from the Professor or invited lecturers that condense a lot of knowledge. Well selected sources of information. Great discussion, which are also led by students. And a couple of papers, one of which is actually Memo, very useful. The lectures are uploaded just before class so you can make notes on it during class.",
    "Instructor, roundtable discussions, lectures",
    "Small-group class discussions when we were able to really get into the issues. The guest lectures were also great for providing some specialized perspective, and I found the use of case studies helpful for tying the big picture issues to on-the-ground impacts and solutions.",
    "the spread of topics covered in class",
    "Allowing the discussions to be open-format and conducted by small student groups allowed for creative and innovative discussion formats which were both interesting and entertaining."

    "Sometimes the discussion sessions following the lecture could be fragmented as it is difficult to get so many people to provide opinions. In similar classes I have seen instructors divide the class in two groups for discussion, which helps discussions be more focused and productive, which could be tried in this class as well.",
    "This class need to be better at timing lectures and discussion, and making sure we get out at the designated time. Too often, lecture ran long, leaving only 20 minutes or so for discussion, or the class went over time. But maybe I am the onlyone who had a problem with this because I had something scheduled right afterward that I was always running to.",
    "Because it is such a specfiic subject, the material got to be a little repetative toward the end of the semester.",
    "The selection of the guest speakers needs to be improved.",
    "Though I enjoyed the discussion section of the course, I think it would be best to limit discussion to 45 minutes per class. That would leave more time for lecture and more time to cover more topics.I also would have liked to see a more detailed discussion of mitigation towards the end of the course. Maybe describe the relationship among GtC, ppm, and temperature increases. (Not sure how feasible this would be in an intro course)",

    "This is a great overview course.",

    "Deeper Knowledge and different weights on sections.",
    "Some readings were outdated and didn't fit today's climate change debate",
    "the student led discussion were sometimes a little weak. Perhaps some time could be dedicated, or perhaps give a reading about go to facilitate good discussion.",
    "Readings should also include the view from the climate change skeptics! Otherwise we'll discuss just among \"believers\" without seeing the other point of views.",
    "I would have found it easier if lecture was a bit more structured and if Rob spoke a little slower.",
    "more instruction and supervision should be given to strengthen student presentations\/discussions to faciliate a better intellectual exchange on critical issues in climate change."
