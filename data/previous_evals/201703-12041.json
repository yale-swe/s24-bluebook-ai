    "amazing overview on IPE literature and methodology",

    "I learned an immense amount about substantive topics in IPE. I also benefited from the in-depth discussion about methodologies underpinning both contemporary and more foundational works in the subfield. The course presentations forced students to grapple with the nuances and particulars of each paper."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: very detailed discussion of papers, including methods; very engaged professor",
    "The course allowed students to present on select papers, which facilitated deep engagement with each paper, and to take a step back to synthesize the knowledge through reading response papers. The course was excellent for both content mastery and methodological learning. One thing I wished there was more of was Professor Queralt's take on matters, or lecture-style synopsis of the way he interprets the topic or question at hand.",
    "Strengths: -- intensive discussion regarding the articles and methods was particularly beneficial -- professor was quite engaging and provided extensive feedback on our criticisms\/comments on the course readings. It was quite clear that he came prepared to have an in-depth discussion of each reading. Weaknesses: -- the small class size made the regular student presentations a bit intense in the middle of the semester, but overall, that requirement was beneficial -- wish we'd engaged with more book-length scholarship on IPE to see how political scientists craft and explore questions in a more in-depth, lengthier format"
