   "comments": [
    "I don't like the way the class is structured around the videos and would have liked teaching more in class and then videos as supplemental help.",
    "Very clear about what we needed to know, and lots of resources available if you needed them. The instruction in-person was fine, and overall it was a decent course.",
    "Strength: online videos. Weaknesses: poorly structured. Not enough organization within the classroom. Never felt fully prepared for the exams. Disconnect between teacher's instruction and videos. Rigor of practice exams never matched our actual exams. Online Coursera problems hardly ever worked, I often had no way of knowing whether I was calculating the problem correctly. I did very well when I took this course in high school (scored a 5 on the AP exam), but I really struggled with this course due to its lack of structure and disorganized teaching style.",
    "The flipped classroom worked well for this material.",
    "Weaknesses: Coursera is glitchy and it's a bit obnoxious to take quizzes on material that we haven't been formally taught. Strengths: Pretty comprehensive overview on the second half or single variable calculus.",
    "No perceivable strengths. Weaknesses: poorly organized, flipped-classroom is awful, Cousera became a hindrance rather than a tool",
    "Teachers should come into class with a more organized curriculum. I understand that this was a \"flipped classroom\" and that most learning was to be done through videos, but a lot of the times when I came to class, my professor did not even know how to do the problems that were from the day's videos.",
    "This course absolutely seems tailored to students who already have some background in BC Calculus or an equivalent. If the assumption is that you could feasibly learn all you need to know just from the videos and homework practice with no background in calculus higher than AB, this class is largely a failure. I think that if you were lucky enough to have one of the few section instructors who was actually able to clearly articulate concepts this class was very successful, but from my experience and the experience of other students I spoke with the majority of the grad student instructors were unhelpful if not detrimental to learning. The only way I was able to make it through the class was by supplementing my learning with hours of outside study, looking to many other sources for help. It became evident immediately on the first day of class that my instructor was not going to be helpful to my learning, but so many people complained that I was unable to switch out of the section. This seems incredibly unfortunate and poorly organized. I know that I went into this class hoping to learn valuable knowledge that I need for the rest of my education and the rest of my professional life, but instead of focusing on the content itself I had to spend hours trying to sort through mixed messages and mistakes my instructor repeatedly led us through. Additionally, when I reached out for outside help, I was referred to a tutor who I am sure is very smart, but was even less articulate than my section instructor. I am not trying to cause any offense but the fact that there was a strong language barrier did not make my understanding any better. As an introductory math course, you have to assume people are coming from many different backgrounds and skill levels, and it seems like it would be MUCH better if either larger sections were taught by the overall class instructor, or even larger groups split between the few graduate students who have proven themselves to be good teachers, not just good mathematicians. I also think that some of the prep videos did not totally address the concepts needed for the prep problems, and having more detailed supplemental videos could be invaluable in evening out the instructor discrepancies.",
    "The flipped nature of this course was poorly executed; the videos to be viewed prior to class each day were helpful and explained the basic concept well, but the more complex and difficult version of the concept explained in class most often was explained poorly, incorrectly, or never explained in full, leading to confusion.",
    "I would prefer classroom-style learning instead of flip classroom. The videos did not always explain the topics in such a way for students to fully understand the material and apply the learning to problems they encountered.",
    "I think one of the strengths of this course is that the supplementary Coursera videos helped. The weaknesses included the availability of the videos, as well as the focus spent on physically teaching the course."

   "comments": [
    "I don't think so; it was not a particularly rewarding experience for me.",
    "Only if they have to take it.",
    "No. Overall the course was overly complicated due to technicalities, poor organization, and an unstructured teaching style. I would rather recommend the course I took at my public high school than the Math 115 courses at Yale.",
    "Overall, a decent course with fairly interesting material, a convenient QR credit if you're looking for one, since the content is so applicable to many fields. The midterms and final can be fairly tricky.",
    "Yes- good course on calculus and not overburdening",
    "Absolutely do not recommend this course, unless you absolutely need it for your career or future Yale classes. Even if you need it for future Yale classes, consider whether or not you really need Math 115 anyway. The flipped classroom is awfully implemented, the curriculum is not standardized across the classes, and the tests are much more difficult than the problem sets. Worst class I've taken at Yale by far.",
    "As long as the teacher is not Shaked, yes.",
    "I would recommend the course to the students wishing to get acquainted with calculus",
    "If a student is taking this class it is likely because they need to for their major, so there isn't really any way around it. That said, I would strongly urge them to research their prospective instructors heavily, because I had an incredibly rough time with a poorly spoken graduate instructor.",
    "Only if you plan to pursue STEM or need it for your major.",
    "I would recommend it only if it helps you build up towards the next math course, or to get prerequisites out of the way."
