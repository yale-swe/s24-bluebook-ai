    "There is a big focus on speaking which is helpful. A weakness of the course is that it moves through material very fast, sometimes at a pace at which it is difficult to incorporate what you have learned into speech because not very much time is spent on in. There is also a large amount of time spent on texts which are far too difficult for the course level.",
    "The strength of this course is that you have class every day and so are consistently building on and practising your Spanish. However, there is a quite a lot of homework (some weeks more than others)."
