    "Depends on what you're looking for. If you liked freshman\/sophomore organic and are looking for a follow-up, this isn't the right course. First of all, this is a PHYSICAL organic chemistry course, so it's definitely more quantitative. The majority of the course is a review of general chemistry or organic chemistry, with host-guest chemistry and pericyclic reactions crammed in at the end. So if you're looking to expand your horizons and learn a bunch of new chemistry, I wouldn't recommend this course.On the other hand, Jorgensen has a long history in research and has a lot of great stories he tells. If you're looking for a relatively easy course and a somewhat funny\/interesting(-ish...) lecturer, then this might be more up your alley.",
    "Dull class with little work where you examine an experimental outcome (I.e., different stabilities of 2 isomers), and do some hand-waving to rationalize it. Also, conformational analysis is a major part of the class (quantitatively determining substituent interactions on rings)...not fun. Jorgensen does have some really interesting stories, however, and it's cool studying huge molecules towards the end of the semester.4 problem sets (2 graded), fine midterm, killer final.",
    "Take it only if you need an upper level chem elective. I don't feel like I learned particularly much. The most interesting part of the course was molecular recognition, so if you're interested in that (biochem-y, pharma stuff), then this course might be worth it for you.",
    "It's pretty terrible. Jorgensen obviously has zero interest in teaching, and you spend most of the semester on boring, basic review topics. There is very little work, just the occasional pset and two exams, but as a result I didn't keep up with thematerial and didn't really learn too much. In the end I feel like this course taught me a few things (most important, I feel more comfortable talking like an organic chemist now) but for most of the semester I wondered why I was even taking this class."
