   "comments": [
    "This was a great course. We examined both analytical and literary texts (as well as movies and TV clips) to try to figure out how satire, irony, and parody work, how they are used, and how they are similar\/different to each other. We didn't necessarily answer any of these questions, but debating them and analyzing the materials together was a great way to dig deeper and come to understand the way that humor of different sorts has evolved, and how it is used in our society. The discussions were sometimes vague and kind of meta-intellectual, but that was because of the make-up of the class student-wise. Overall I really enjoyed it. There was relatively little work, and what work we did have was enjoyable. Also, Professor North is fantastic. He is not only obviously incredibly knowledgeable in his field (and generally well-read and brilliant). More importantly, he is kind, supportive, and creates a really open and friendly class environment, in which I felt comfortable and was encouraged to throw out any ideas and thoughts I might have, even if I wasn't sure that I was right. He helped me discover ideas I might never otherwise have had, and created a feeling of equal engagement among the students and professor that I think is really important in this kind of idea-based class. I really enjoyed learning from Professor North, and think that he is one of those rare academics that is also a wonderful teacher and mentor.",
    "I recommend the course. The material is unusual and does not fit neatly into any one department, and one needs some understanding of earnest and satirical (or ironic, or parodic) speech to survive. Good discussions, moderated properly by the instructor.",
    "Take this class!! Prof. North is a gem and this is absolutely one of the best classes I have taken. You will gain a much better understanding of humor and comedy, and will laugh a lot along the way.",
    "Certainly take this class if you can. Satire, Irony, and Parody was well-organized, insightful, and a great experience. As the name suggests, the class starts with the satire of the Greeks, works its way through the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and early 20th century as it transitions to irony, and then takes a look at contemporary parody. Each mode is considered from several different angles, in an attempt to gain a general idea of the form, which is a difficult thing to do seeing as they are not easily defined. Yet, along the way you learn a lot about hidden, and also not so subtle, meaning in coded language, and about the contexts in which this way of communicating can be more or less effective than speaking directly. There is a fair amount of reading at times, but it is all worth doing and incredibly interesting. The projects\/papers are not trivial, but doing them was more of a pleasure than a resentment (e.g., writing your own satire!). Overall, the class was wonderful, and I hope Professor North continues to teach it in the future.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It's not a lot of work, and the material incredibly fun.",
    "This class was excellent, one of the very best I have taken at Yale. At once humorous and intellectual, it was a pleasure to attend, and I feel I have gained much from it. Dr. North is a remarkable teacher and a deep thinker."
