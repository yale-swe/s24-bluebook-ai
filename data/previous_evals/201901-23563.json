    "If you are interested In Documentary filmmaking, self motivated, and can take criticism, then yes! This course is challenging in that you must put all of yourself into your project, be willing to devote as much a time and energy as it takes to succeed, and also to learn many things on your own as you go. The class is so rewarding though If you do do these things!! And you have much freedom in choosing a topic\/project interesting to you!"
