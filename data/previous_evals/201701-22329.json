   "comments": [
    "I learned about Jewish and Italian culture, history, literature, and film, from 1938 onward. I sharpened my skills of visual and literary analysis, and learned new insights and methods (mostly psychoanalytic and philosophical).",
    "I gained expansive historical knowledge of the Holocaust and its impact on Italy, especially in consideration of Fascism and anti-Semitism. I developed critical film interpretation skills, especially literary-film analysis, particularly in the study of the book The Garden of the Finzi-Contini's and its film counterpart. I also gained insight into the ethical concerns of Holocaust memory and representation.",
    "I came into the course with very little background on film, so I found it fascinating to think about how we can use cinema to represent tragedy. The course also forced me to think about larger questions: how should the world remember the Shoah? What are our duties in representing it? How can we move on from a tragedy, and how can we carry its lessons with us?",
    "One of the greatest classes I have ever taken at Yale. You will become a better thinker, more thoughtful speaker, and better human.",
    "Every class meeting introduced new and interesting ways to approach a text or film. I don't have a film studies background, and I learned so much from Prof Marcus and the other seminar participants in how to meaningfully discuss and evaluate a film."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Beautifully organized course. Switched from literature to film each week. Students were assigned discussion topics to ensure that there was deep, engaged conversation, and that there would be an ideal balance between Penny and the students speaking. It all worked beautifully. Weaknesses: There were too many discussion topics assigned each week, so class rarely ended on time. If Penny had taken off two topics each week, we could have ended at 5:20 each class, which is important because events frequently happen on Wednesday evenings at 5:30.",
    "The structure and syllabus of the class were very strong. All the books and films included were fruitful and the ordering of the works built on each other as the course progressed. It was a great idea to assign students to present on proposed questions in preparation for the next class; it guaranteed a productive class discussion. Professor Marcus' insights were invaluable and her knowledge unparalleled. Her passion for Italian film and literature was contagious! I would have preferred the film screenings to take place a little earlier on Monday nights, perhaps 7 p.m.",
    "The course's top strength is its professor, followed closely by the in-class discussions. I honestly can't think of how to make this course any better, besides perhaps a more cumulative final session.",
    "No weaknesses. All strength. Great film screenings and readings.",
    "There aren't any weaknesses - the comparative nature of the film\/text discussions generated some incredible classroom dialogue. This course was one of the few during my time at Yale where I feel that everyone was an enthusiastic participant. (This is likely due to Prof Marcus, who clearly cares so much for the subject matter and loves these works.)"

   "comments": [
    "I've been recommending this course, and Penny, since the first day of class. This course provides an excellent foundation in how to do literary and filmic analysis, partly because we concentrate on primary texts instead of secondary texts, which are always supplementary.",
    "I would most definitely recommend the class to other students. It was my favorite course this semester, and two works that we studied, the book The Sky Falls by Lorenza Mazzetti and the film Kapo, were invaluable to my understanding of the much overlooked role of women in the Holocaust.",
    "If you have the opportunity, definitely take this course. The subject matter and course number can seem daunting, but the workload was very manageable, and the class discussions were some of the best that I've had here so far. This isn't just a course about film or literature; instead, it's dives into broader questions about the legacy of the Shoah. The books, movies, and discussions don't just teach you about the Holocaust, the make you a better person, too.",
    "Yes yes definitely but only if you're willing to commit emotionally.",
    "I'd recommend this course without any hesitation (and did so to several friends). Prof Marcus designed the course to explore the themes and nuances of the Holocaust in Italy using comparative works, and the results were fascinating.",
    "Yes, Penny organized this course to be effective for all students, of different backgrounds and levels. She creates a very welcoming space where rigorous analysis is encouraged and explicitly modeled."
