    "If you are NOT A SPANISH SPEAKER, THINK ABOUT IT TWICE !Portuguese is a great language, I liked the class and I want to go on until L4. But if you don't speak Spanish, you will have to WORK A LOT if you want to catch up with the others and your GPA might suffer...",
    "This was a wonderful course. Thiago was an absolutely amazing instructor. I am so grateful to have taken this class with him. Learning Portuguese this semester was a pleasure.",
    "A fun and informative course, L1 will definitely get you speaking, writing, and understanding. Take this course for a relaxed language class (the workload is not overwhelming, but enough to reinforce material, as it should be). Taking L1 will also teach you some elements of Brazilian culture. For the writing and speaking assignments, you have quite a bit of freedom to talk about what you want.",
    "Not only is Portuguese an up and coming language because of Brazil ascending status as a \"super power country,\" the class is not harsh in what it demands. Unlike other languages taught at Yale, Portuguese does not require extra tutoring sessions or extra sections to take weekly exams. The class has an exam about every 2-2.5 weeks, three compositions, an oral presentation and an oral conversation with the professor and one other student. The class has ungraded homework assignments that are discussed the next day in class. The workload is never unreasonable or overwhelming and the professors are well above Yale average. I would suggest Portuguese to anyone who is remotely interested in Brazil, especially if they have previous experience in a romance language which makes learning Portuguese even easier.",
    "It's a pretty easy class but it can get hard if you already speak Spanish. The homework load is light and we get a lot of practice time in speaking in class.",
    "yes! take it take it take it! chill-est language class ever!",
    "Yes, definitely recommend. Thiago won't still be at Yale by the time you have to choose a section, but he's lovely, and it's a beautiful language.",
    "I recommend!",
    "I would recommend it for anyone wanting to learn a new language.",
    "Portuguese 110 is a pretty standard introductory language course, although it's probably one of the easiest if you're already familiar with a romance language (as opposed to learning something like Latin or Hindi). You meet every day of the week, and learn out of a textbook that's supplemented by outside activities and presentations. Minimal homework assignments, but they're still very helpful. Five tests, a few oral presentations. Definitely recommended if you're interested in languages or Brazil -- and even if you're not, its an easy way to learn about another culture and its super interesting.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. If you have any sort of Spanish background, it will prove to be VERY helpful. Overall, this class is a ton of fun, you learn a lot about Brazil, and it is definitely not a burden work-wise.",
    "Take this course if you have any interest in Portuguese, Brazil or Latin America in general! This course was the highlight of my semester and the workload was so manageable even though we learned a lot! What a wonderful class! The professors even planned a out-of-class meal for us with authentic Portuguese and Brazilian food."
