    "Engl 126 is great fun, but it is a lot of work. You have to spend a lot of time with the texts outside of class if you want to understand what's going on. The workload for this section is also substantial (4 essays, 2 exercises, 1 final), but it's all intended to make you a better writer, thinker, and reader. On a sidenote, Professor Glaser is great! He may be one of the younger Engl 126 professors, but he really knows his stuff--in other words, he's brilliant, and he transfers some of that brilliance to his students. He's also open to creative\/innovative ways to help students engage with the material (including bringing rap into the discussion and taking us to the YUAG). Finally, his comments on essays and during office hours are superbly helpful.",
    "English 126 is a pretty good survey of a few interesting poets. I don't know that I'd recommend it to someone who doesn't need to take it for the major, because Milton can be a lot of work to do just because you're interested, but Professor Glaser is great and creates a very close class atmosphere, so if you find the material interesting, it's not a ton of work and is probably worth your time.",
    "Requirement for the English Major. As my first ever poetry class it was hard at first but got easier. I would recommend it to better your understanding of poetry and reading skills, but not to better your writing skills.",
    "Yes, great course. You read wonderful things and discuss them thoughtfully with a bunch of other students who care about the material. The course really helps you to become a better close reader and a more thoughtful reader. (Also, I should add, I'm not at English major but took the course and found it totally useful for my other studies). I really like Professor Glaser. I've shopped many sections of Major English Poets and never ended up taking the course because I felt the professor to be too stuffy and unapproachable. Professor Glaser is not like that at all -- he can joke and level with his students while being very much a professor-figure at the same time. I think he creates an environment where people feel more at ease to express their ideas, which is really the mot important thing in an intro English seminar. Basically, I think he's a much-needed breath of fresh air in the English Dept. So take with him if you can (and especially if you've been deterred from taking the course in the past because of stuffy English profs).",
    "Take this class and 125 regardless of your major. As a chemistry major I found taking English classes with students who are actually interested in the discipline greatly improved the class quality and made the class much more thoughtful about the material, and more diligent about doing the readings. Besides all this, the poetry you read for this class is helpful just for understanding Western culture and Western arts in general, and should be read anyways. This class is a staple for a Yale liberal arts education.",
    "If you're taking 126 because you're an English major, take it with Glaser. He's energetic, enthusiastic, approachable, and very organized. His class is fun and interesting, he leads discussions well, and he provides a lot of additional material to enliven the texts. If you're not an English major, consider whether you feel up to reading all of Paradise Lost, and a good 6 books of Wordsworth's The Prelude. If you like long, old poetry and you love iambic pentameter, go for it! Glaser is great if you're up to the challenge, but the class can be a drag if you aren't engaged in the readings."
