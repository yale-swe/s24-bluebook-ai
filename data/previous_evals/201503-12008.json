   "comments": [
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to students interested in film or in need of a WR credit.",
    "Intro to Film is a must for those interested in film studies at all. I would definitely recommend the class to another student.",
    "A solid writing credit, but if you're a freshman\/sophomore, your written work will be compared to that of the dozens of senior Literature\/English majors who take this class for fun and grades will suffer. The screenings are hit or miss, but there are a lot of really good ones; you need to make sure that you can do 4 hour screenings on Tuesday nights though(syllabus says 2 hour, but it's a lie, only true for the first 2 screenings). I definitely learned a lot of new things about film though, and got exposed to a new academic discipline. Professor MacKay is a pretty good lecturer but he sometimes goes off on tangents. The readings are universally hated, unrelated to what is discussed in class, and done by approximately no one, even the Film Studies majors.",
    "This class was a real disappointment. I love film and was considering majoring in film studies, but this course veered me away from that path. The lectures were subpar and scattered. The material felt pointless and intentionally pedantic (so as to prove that film studies was an academic subject. Moreover, the class required a tremendous time commitment: screenings, readings, section, lectures, papers, and a final all start to add up. The screenings are falsely advertised as under two hours, when most of them ended up being longer than three. I truly regret taking this class. It should not be a prerequisite for screenwriting since it is such a waste of time. Stay away unless you really need the credit for something (screenwriting or some other pre-requisite).",
    "Film 150 is a good start to the subject of film, but is not an easy writing credit, if that's what you're looking for. This class very specifically designed for someone who is interested in film. If you are not, then this will not be an enjoyable class.",
    "I would summarize this class as an introductory film study course that would be a good starting point for anyone interested in film. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "This is a great class. Professor MacKay's lectures were always engaging, the readings were good, and the films were fantastic and we were exposed to so much. Watch out for the film screening nights though: on our calendars they were listed as a two-hour section once a week, but we usually watched two movies each night, so they could be as long as three or three and a half hours. Still, amazing class. I highly recommend it.",
    "yes. It immediately allows you to be more fluent in the language of film and is a prerequisite for all the other film courses.",
    "Learn about the relevant topics in filmmaking and watch some good movies! Definitely a recommendable class.",
    "Yes, take this course if you have an interest in films and need a writing credit. The course load is not to high and the quality of teaching is good. Go to the screenings.",
    "A good survey in the theory, style, and technicalities of film. Also introduced me to cool foreign films I hadn't seen before",
    "The movie selection is interesting but the course readings are a bit tough. You don't really need to read them though. You get what you put into the class. It can be very enjoyable though! John Mackay is very enthusiastic and the TF's are great.",
    "I don't think i would recommend this course to someone who wasn't a film major unless they really enjoy film theory.",
    "The class was somewhat interesting at times but felt rather disorganized and rambling. I certainly feel like I can talk about film more intellectually now but I'm not sure I learned all that much. The screenings will ALWAYS go over time, sometimes by more than an hour.",
    "Film 150 is a pretty easy writing requirement for students. I would recommend it to another student, as the class teaches you a plethora of topics to allow you to critically analyze films. It's also a necessity to take a lot of other interesting film classes.",
    "This class teaches you how to analyze and critique film, on the basis of some of the most important theories and techniques. Take this class if you are at all interested in the deeper and more artistic aspect of film. Of course there are some films and papers that are terribly boring and hard to sit through. Honestly the screenings were really long. However, there are some films that are really great, and the sections are super helpful. Don't expect to be watching modern hollywood movies though.",
    "If you like movies at all past the point of rom-coms (not that there's anything wrong with liking rom-coms), take this class. It's a fun course and all the movies we watched were interesting in some way or another. I would just say be aware that this class takes up a lot of time (lecture twice a week, mandatory section once a week, and a 2-3.5 hour screening once a week) and it has both a final paper and a final exam.",
    "Great course for anyone at all interested in film history, film theory, or individual films. Changed the way I look at movies, entirely for the better. MacKay is an engaging lecturer and a very, very smart guy. You'll learn a lot! Take it seriously.",
    "Survey course of film that covers everything from production to power production and distribution. Expect weekly screenings and section in addition to lecture, and don't expect to go very in depth in discussing the films except for in your three papers",
    "FILM 150 provides the foundations of film while analyzing the purpose, attributes, and effects of film. I would definitely recommend this course to someone for it discusses ideas beyond just the realm of film.",
    "I would recommend the class to a student interested in film studies. I would, however, tell that student that the time commitment advertised by the course is basically false due to the tendency of the screenings to regularly go 60 minutes (and sometimes 90 minutes) over.",
    "Film 150 is an overview of the basic concepts of filmmaking and film theory, and some of the most important films and trends in the history of film. Because it can be a little dry sometimes and the lectures are not always easy to follow, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to any student who is not a film studies major or at least very invested in the study of film. The class is only really a great class if you have a great TA and really enjoy the films you watch.",
    "Yes! Everyone should take this, it will give you an true appreciation for film and MacKay is a most take professor. Make sure you go to every screening though or else it won't be worth it.",
    "I would really recommend the course to anyone who loves cinema - the selection of films that are screened is extremely good, and the way they are discussed in class is revealing a lot of their deeper meaning.",
    "If you're interested in film but don't know a lot about it, this is probably the course you should take. It's a good survey of many different aspects of film and the study of it. Professor MacKay has a great enthusiasm for the subject. Be aware, however, the course has a fair amount of work with weekly screenings and 3 different writing assignments as well as a final. I personally did not know a lot about film before taking the class; I learned a lot and am satisfied with the course.",
    "A good introduction to film. Screenings of mostly interesting movies (diverse in all sense of the word) once a week. Not a heavy workload. A lot of reading but you don't need to do it all. A final essay and exam is kind of tough though.",
    "Film 150 is a great class to provide a solid background in film analysis. You will learn a number of terms and see a number of good movies, but don't go in expecting to be transformed by the end of the semester as a film critic.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in learning more about film, but do not take it if you just \"like movies\". You don't watch many Hollywood style blockbuster films, and you analyze the films from many different perspectives. But if that sounds interesting to you, the class is great.",
    "A class that provides an intensive introduction into the world of film studying. If a student is not interested in the subject, he or she should forgo the class completely. If he or she is interested in the study of film, he or she will find relish the class. Film 150 is a serious but rewarding time commitment.",
    "FILM 150 is a great class for someone new to studying film, and I would assume that it's also useful for the longtime enthusiast. One is introduced to the fundamentals of film theory and history, and watching and talking about movies for credit is the dream.",
    "I would summarize Film 150 as a quintessentially introductory course. That being said, it will cover a breadth of materials relating to film studies, and a breadth and depth of films will be screened. As a result, it can become particularly boring at times, but by the end of the semester will feel very rewarding for its most golden moments, and the way it encourages students to engage with film.",
    "For any student considering the Film major, this course is an obvious choice. I would make it clear that this course is an overview of cinema, and not so much film production. I suppose one would take production seminar courses in order to explore that side of film. To those generally or casually interested in film, I might suggest trying out different courses."
