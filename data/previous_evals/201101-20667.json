    "I'd definitely recommended anth 527. to summarize, i'd say it is a course exploring socialism\/post-socialism among different peoples, which would give students a latitudinal understanding of how socialism worked in different places.",
    "I would summarize this course as an exploration both of the nature and significance of socialism(s) and postsocialism(s) in eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and other parts of the world, both for the lives of the people from these parts of the world and forthe larger geopolitical order.The course provides an opportunity both for an in-depth study of these regions from an anthropological perspective and an illuminating study of what anthropology is - its guiding ideas, assumptions, and methods.The organization of the course encourages students to approach secondary texts rigorously, paying attention to their ideological and methodological underpinnings.But besides being a valuable lesson in the critical assessment of secondary literature, the course is also extremely informative regarding the conditions of everyday life in socialist and postsocialist contexts.Certainly one of the best seminars I have taken in my four semesters at Yale."

    "This course lies outside of my discipline, and I took it to gain a new perspective on my area of research and on the place of that area of research in the larger system of academic work. In these senses, the course was extremely useful. I learned a great deal about the region I study form a different perspective, although the time period on which the course focused differs from that to which I devote the majority of my research. Moreover, I learned new ways of approaching the secondary literature and methodologies of research in my own discipline in a productive and critical way with the aid of what I learned about antrhopological research and anthropology's critiques of other disciplines."
