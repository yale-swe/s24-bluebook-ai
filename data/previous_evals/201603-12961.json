   "comments": [
    "EP&E 242 taught me to appreciate issues of economic policy, regulation and markets from an entirely new perspective: one of power. As such, it was more than mind-opening. It will prove vital, will continue to inspire me well beyond my Yale career.",
    "This course covers the politico-economic origins of private property, the corporation, and banking. I amassed a tremendous amount of knowledge about the theory and practice of regulation of various components of the economy. The five writing assignments are very helpful for developing the ability to make a coherent, concise, and innovative argument based on the readings throughout the course.",
    "learned about healthcare.",
    "I learned a lot about regulations of the financial industry in particular, I also learned about theoretical approaches to predicting regulation.",
    "If you want to go into politics, definitely take this course. You learn about the behind the scenes strategies, influences, and transformations of the political process behind many impactful financial policies.",
    "As a student without an economics background, a lot of the subject matter for this course was new to me, and I learned a lot. I learned about financial markets and their application to politics (regulation, financial crisis, banks, etc.). This class is a great overview of important concepts in the intersection of politics and economics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: everything. The discussions were engaging, the lectures inspiring. Readings and assignments complemented each other in a most ideal way. I would change absolutely nothing.",
    "The main problem is that some of the readings are difficult to understand without some prior knowledge of the main terms\/concepts therein. A few notes outlining the readings and highlighting important concepts circulated in advance of class would solve this problem. Alternatively, the syllabus might be restructured such that the first 1-2 weeks of class is spent reviewing important terms\/concepts in the political economy of regulation before jumping into any substantive readings. Doing this would have the added advantage of enabling students to dive into discussion more quickly. There was a lot of lecturing in this class, largely because people didn't come in with a good grasp on the readings (though not always for lack of trying). A few minor organizational revisions might have gone a long way towards enriching the quality of this seminar. That said, the syllabus has a lot of great stuff on it. By the end, I definitely felt better equipped to analyze regulatory policy.",
    "This course had very interesting readings. Students are able to write and present on topics that most interest them. Professor Swenson provides great feedback on writing assignments. Class discussions are always very engaging.",
    "less reading.",
    "Readings were very long and complicated- sometimes the main point got lost in the heavy theory of the reading, which made discussion difficult.",
    "A little bit more background into the policies we looked at as examples for the changing and dynamic political economy would have been helpful.",
    "For me, Professor Swenson's flexibility and accessibility were the strengths of the course I think the readings were a bit dry, and Professor Swenson's mini-presentations each week were a bit too much of recitation (although the information was quite helpful). Also, while I myself enjoyed presenting, I don't know how helpful other students' presentations were for one another. Further, I like the format of revising essays that Professor Swenson implemented. His feedback was very helpful. But I think there should be three longer essays rather than five short ones. I found myself wanting to elaborate more in each paper, and I think having three essays would make it seem more like an essay rather than a reading response."

   "comments": [
    "If you are at all interested in politics, economics, or growing personally, do take this class. It will open your eyes to the power dynamics of economic policy. It will equip you with an invaluable set of skills.",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to gain an understanding of how the economic arena influences the political one in our society. The readings are super-interesting and you'll come out wondering about just how much large corporations shape your life, beliefs, and choices. I've been in seminars with better class discussions, but Prof Swenson is very engaged and clearly cares about the topic. The workload is very light but condensed. Only a few short essays on the readings, with two optional re-writes at the end: no final paper. Definitely one of the classes that has shaped the most my political beliefs here at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if he or she is interested in learning more about regulatory politics or has a particular interest in health care, the financial industry, agriculture, labor, insurance, or climate politics, assuming the syllabus remains similar. The writing assignments are manageable; revisions on two are allowed, and Professor Swenson's critical commentary is helpful for improvement. The seminar overall is fascinating.",
    "yeah it was engaging.",
    "Would recommend if you have a strong background in economics or economic theory.",
    "Yes! It was a challenging class but you learn about a topic that not many professors teach on and one that is definitely important in studying politics",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning about how politics and economics affect each other. This was an interesting course, and we read many interesting books throughout the semester."
