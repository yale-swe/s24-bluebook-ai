    "I developed increased familiarity with the works of several major philosophers, especially Lacan and Butler.",
    "I was able to witness a unique approach to teaching, one that looks at Antigone in various contexts, attempting to draw out ethical questions from each. The extent to which this project was successful is a bit unclear, but I appreciate the flexibility in discussion, for it tolerated and encouraged different ways to think about interpretation and argument.",

   "comments": [
    "I found some of the seminar discussions to be unsatisfying and unproductive at times, but on the whole the readings were interesting and I gained some valuable insights from the student presentations and the professor's comments.",
    "The course gave a lot of opportunities for work with short essays and a presentation, as well as a culminating project, which all forced us to consider the texts in different lights. The professor was a little slow with grading, which caused anxiety for students who were considering dropping or Credit\/D-ing the class by midterms, but became better as the year went on, and the feedback was very helpful."
