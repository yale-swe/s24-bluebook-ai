    "Don't take this class if your looking to spend a lot of time honing one skill\/medium. You'll spend a lot of time bouncing around between different projects and types of sculpture, most of which you'll be pretty awful at.",
    "I was disappointed by this class. While it's description made it sound like it was a introductory art class, I felt like I was constantly looked down upon by the professor and other students for not having more extensive art experience. This class was extremely disorganized, with no electronic communication for the first half of the class, and minimal communication in the second. I found the pace very aggressive for an intro class. The professor, Michelle, is easy-going and friendly, and while I acknowledge the fact that she is a brand new professor, I found her lack of organization really alarming. I felt like she was very disconnected from her students lives, and had way higher expectations than would be appropriate for an introductory class. This class is probably a good class with another professor and less aggressive schedule.",
    "This course is a materials survey. We moved quickly from one project to the next, using a different medium for each one. The first couple of assignments were in clay (additive process). Then we carved plaster (subtractive process). We learned about making armatures and suspending sculptures, got acquainted with the wood shop, collaboratively built a large structure with drywall, and had a welding demonstration. This left us with a broad sculpture vocabulary - but as with most surveys, we didn't go into much depth on any one project or technique.Class discussions, of which there were only a few, fell pretty flat, and Michelle's slide lectures tended to be disorganized.This was Michelle's first time teaching at Yale, so things may change next time around.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, who is looking to release their creative spirit. Professor Lopez is a great critic and was able to help us to open our minds and think creatively."
