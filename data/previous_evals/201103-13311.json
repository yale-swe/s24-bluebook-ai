   "comments": [
    "This is a very solid english class. Don't let Moby Dick deter you! It became one of my favorite books this semester. Wai Chee Dimock is great, and although discussions weren't always fabulous, I feel good about having taken this course. I don't feel that my writing got remarkably better, but I do think that I improved over the semester.",
    "We worked our way through 6 or 7 books and discussed them every class period, with a paper due every few weeks. I think the class would depend a lot on your professor and the way the other students interact-- the quality of the discussion is everything. The syllabus is good though and I don't really see how this class could be bad.",
    "Yes. take it.",
    "Engl 127 is a pretty good course if you like to write. Overall, throughout the semester itself, it is very light with only four 5page papers to write. However, it gets particularly heavy during the 3-hour, writing-intensive final. Still though, Dimock is a pretty lenient grader so the class was relatively stress-free. The highlight of the course was definitely visiting the Beinecke and seeing the real Emily Dickinson manuscripts up close. The books we read were very interesting and quite varied so I feel that there was something for everyone. If you like literature or writing, I would highly recommend the course.",
    "amazing class. prof dimock is a little robotic at times, but she is amazing.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in literature.",
    "Really excellent class. I suppose it depends on the instructor, but Dimock at least was incredibly patient, insightful, enthusiastic. The works we read were interesting (for the most part -- I'm not a fan of Moby Dick), and not necessarily obvious -- a few novels I'd never heard of before, and in factturned out to be the best of any of them. Workload's average and papers are graded fairly. It's not a super easy class, but not a super difficult one either.",
    "A basic English class with a reasonable workload. I enjoyed the literature selections. I would recommend the class."
