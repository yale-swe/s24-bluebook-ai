   "comments": [
    "I loved this class! I was conflicted about taking it because it didn't fulfill any of my requirements, I had another class that ended right before it all the way across campus so I usually had to miss lunch, and I was already taking four other demanding classes. However, I really was enchanted by it during shopping period so I decided to take it credit D, and I'm so glad I did. You'll learn so much about the racial discourse in America today, and Professor Weaver is so passionate and helpful. You'll be able to have way more intelligent conversations with your friends about race relations, and you'll be able to read the news with a far more informed eye. I literally think everyone at Yale should take this class because for once the things you're learning are directly relevant and vital to the progression of our society.",
    "Great class. Take it.",
    "The topics discussed in this course are ones that every Yalie should consider. Professor Weaver is great so I would recommend this course. However, unless you're using this for your major\/have taken a lot of political science courses take this credit d!",
    "This is he type of class that every Yale student should take as it sheds light on US politics hidden from the mainstream narrative. It contextualizes contemporary trends in a way most never get to see or understand. It is a lot of reading and dense reading at that but it's a great experience.",
    "Course explores the research that has been conducted on issues of inequality in the United States. Take it if you want to have substantial data to back up claims concerning inequality, while also getting a chance to read alternative view points. You'll learn a lot in this course in very specific ways.",
    "Definitely! It's not an easy class, but it totally changed my way of looking at the world. Take it! Gives a much more fundamental and solid basis for looking at difference around you. If you're worried about grading, which can be a bit harsh, start off credit\/d\/fail, perhaps, but whatever you do, DEFINITELY take this class, if only to share the room with Prof. Weaver.",
    "PLSC 211 is an excellent class that any student, regardless of major or field of interest, can get something out of. It is challenging as there are readings for each class which can be difficult, and Professor Weaver is not an easy grader. Professor Weaver is absolutely incredible - she is brilliant and very knowledgeable. She is a great lecturer and, even in classes that were pretty much an hour and 15 minutes of her talking, managed to be extremely engaging and never seemed to be talking at us. One of the most interesting courses and professors I have had at Yale.",
    "I think everyone (especially white people) should take this course to become more aware about how our country operates and how inequality (especially racial inequality) is propagated. Grading on papers is harsh but fair. Organization of the course is a little muddled but the professor is super engaged. Take the class.",
    "Yes but as Credit D",
    "A fascinating class with an amazing professor and great readings. Even if you've taken classes on inequality before, this one is definitely worth adding because of its focus on the politics of inequality, which was new and interesting for me. Wasn't super keen on the lecture\/seminar hybrid (but not sure if that will be done in the future), but really take any opportunity to take a class with Professor Weaver that you can get!",
    "This class is one of the BEST classes that I have ever taken at Yale. I would recommend everyone take this class before they graduate. It was great being able to take this class during this time in America and to be able to understand and make sense of everything that is going on based on the work of many political scientists and sociologist. Professor Weaver is a phenomenal professor who is extremely passionate about the course, which makes the course even better. You learn so much about the role of policy in inequality and the class provides knowledge that everyone should really know.",
    "This is a course about why racial and gender inequality exist in america, with a good balance of theory and case study.",
    "Good class, I feel like I learned a lot. You'll get more out of it if you engage with the material and are willing to discuss. Some of the material can be repetitive, especially towards the end of the semester.",
    "Very relevant, interesting",
    "It was a good course! I very much enjoyed the readings and the topic, would highly recommend to anyone interested in the topic.",
    "aight so here's wassup. weaver be like this cool mixed race chick (srs but she look white deadass i loled when she said like this shawty on krack if she half black den im gandhi with my ibanking job hahahahaHa) she also marry a black prof so she srs widdis race stuff. real great prof too, knows her shit b etc etc. okokokok aint bad total, she talk good be interesting hw fun all that. gotta read doe cuz she test dat allday bro if you cant read (some yalies cant, idk) do cr\/d don't cry past the drop date when you get ur 75 though i swear Carl will pray 4 u but cmon everybody know God got better things to do than yo grade son he'll prolly say rest yo ass on sabbath or sth hahaha COME GET AT ME G don't give her no shit, she writes on prisons nd guns so she know hood bros watch out on dixwell at night. imma ruin it for you now like U.S. got racist SOBs and screwed blacks\/spanish more than clinton-lewinsky, make they live poor af, no dream no franklins no jobs no boba (asians took it - dope book by R.J. Pops, he once drank with 2 straws and boba shit came out his nose no lie) blacks got lotsa weed nd kids eating mcds and doritos and now we got afam majors but also ferguson (am i the only one who think of fergie hearing that? damn, she fine. also hangs with blacks take notes kiddies) get all that? so basically if you like super smash you'll like the class. overall take this if you a racist republican methodist who think white ppl sweet but black ppl wack 'cause yo LEARN SUMTHIN MOFO cough cough or dont take it & u can get takeout jerk it in TD die a virgin, and so on. oh if you liberal u get wet dreams doing the readings, highlight of semester my so keep it real now unicorns #carl4prez",
    "This class is super informative. Sometimes in lecture I got a little lost, this being my first college political science class, but I still got a lot out of it. You will learn about so many different policies and effects you may have never known they have. Professor Weaver tries to put different readings in conversation with one another, which is really interesting, although the readings can be dense. So many different forms of inequality are covered, that there is definitely something in this class for students of all academic backgrounds. The class runs something like a seminar, with the professor expecting student participation and response in every class. I think having a section would make this class perfect. There is so much to learn in class that it makes it hard sometimes to discuss the reading during the class period. A section would be ideal for this, and then the class would still be able to enroll a lecture sized amount of people. Overall, I would definitely recommend it; you will learn a lot and be more equipped to understand how inequality has come to be\/still operates in America.",
    "Absolutely wonderful class with a wonderful professor. I would absolutely recommend to anyone who has any interest in social politics.",
    "Absolutely take this course!! Whether you consider yourself well-versed in the subject or uninformed (and are interested), this course will undoubtedly change your perspective and challenge you to think more deeply about why different forms of inequality persist today. Professor Weaver is the best professor I've had at Yale, and being in her class is honestly a treat. Keep up with the reading and meet with the TA\/Weaver before the papers and you'll be fine.",
    "The title is accurate. It's very much a political science course.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students the topics are extremely relevant to the current events and really provides a new perspective.",
    "A really excellent course especially if you are at all interested in inequality or issues related to poverty or politics. Fascinating readings and lectures. Prof. Weaver is a wonderful teacher and lecturer and some of the most interesting things I've learned about the political system in our country came out of this class. Be warned, however, that there is a LOT of reading. It is all worthwhile and interesting though so if you're ok with that then definitely take this class!",
    "It is an amazing class to take if you are social-justice oriented. Don't worry if you have never taken a political science class before. This is a very approachable class and an introductory class that presents important scholars in political science that are important to know.",
    "A really good class that you should definitely consider taking. It opens your eyes to a lot of things that you otherwise would have no idea about, which once again is so important in the context of today."
