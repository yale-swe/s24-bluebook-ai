    "I would recommend it. It's a great overview of African music, both traditional and popular.",
    "Music 262 is an excellent course on several types of music in a few countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. I would definitely recommend it to any student. The course not only taught me about music from neotraditional Yoruba music to Paul Simon's Graceland album, but it also taught me new ways to understand music and history. It is one of the best courses that I have ever taken at Yale."
