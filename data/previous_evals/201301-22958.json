    "Typography II is a fun class in which you get to do 3 projects: a poster, a book, and an animation piece. This last project is extremely daunting and challenging, in my experience, if you have not used the software before. Also, be prepared to take the class with graduate design students, as well as art majors. That can be intimidating. I cried during every critique.",
    "If you're interested in graphic design, take this course. If you want to develop a better visual language, take this course. If you're a person, take this course, but you should expect to put a lot of time and thoughtfulness into it.",
    "Henk assigned three really cool projects (poster, book, type in motion video), and we met as a class every other two weeks or so to share and discuss our work. I wasn't aware going into this class that it was pretty much a graduate level course (half of the class were preliminary grad students at the art school) and therefore a TON of work and super fast-paced. I usually got little to no sleep the night before our class, and at the end of the semester, I was scrambling to finish up all of my projects, in addition to my other papers and exams. That said, Henk offered great advice, and it was awesome seeing how everyone else's projects turned out. Overall, I'm happy with how all of my projects turned out and am glad I took this class (but would NOT recommend taking four other classes, like I did).",
    "This was a very enjoyable class. It's mostly self-structured, with three major projects - very different from intro and intermediate. Henk, as always, is wonderful, and a great critic."
