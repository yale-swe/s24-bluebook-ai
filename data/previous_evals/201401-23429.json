   "comments": [
    "YES. this class saved my soul this semester.",
    "Take this course--you will regret it if you don't. It is a journey. It is an experience. It cannot be explained sufficiently in words. You will learn more about yourself this semester than you ever have before, and you will never look at school the same way again.",
    "YES TAKE THIS CLASS. It is so different from other classes at Yale and really makes you think in new ways. The topics are different and the class is fun and relaxed. Plus the trip is incredible.",
    "Yes. Take it.",
    "Because the professor is a different grad student every year, it's hard to recommend. I would say absolutely shop it and if the professor is open and cool and hopefully a little non-traditional take it.",
    "Take this class if you can. You'll think about things in ways you never have.",
    "Highly highly recommend. This will be unlike any other class you've taken.",
    "Yes! It's a really weird class, but if you're like me and haven't yet explored the wilderness, it's an eye-opening adventure. The syllabus changes every year, but somehow I can't imagine any year being particularly tame in this course.",
    "YES, take this course. I don't know who will teach it next but there's no way you can go wrong with it.",
    "Take it because it is unique. No other class is like it- never have I been in a class with such an atmosphere.",
    "This class changes every single year, due to there being a new teacher every time the class is taught. However, I have never heard anyone say bad things about it. It's a true experience and adventure. Between the class trip (we went to Yale's Horse Island off the coast of Connecticut to camp for a night), and the class dinner, it's more than just a classroom experience. I came out of this seminar having gotten to know 15 or so other students incredibly well; I can't reiterate enough: this is not a class, but an adventure and an experience that will stay with you for the rest of your life. If you can get in, take it. You'll never regret it.",
    "It will be unlike any past version of the class because the professor switches annually, so there's no way to describe it with any certainty, but definitely take it. The course name alone should be enough to get you in the door."
