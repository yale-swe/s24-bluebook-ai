   "comments": [
    "If you aren't a fan of physics, but need to take it for a requirement, it's a solid choice.",
    "Super easy for anyone who's taken AP Physics C Mechanics before. Homeworks don't take too long, and exams are very reasonable.",
    "Test were extremely difficult. Professor NP is excellent, super patient and a great lecturer.",
    "yes it's great",
    "Highly recommend",
    "University Physics was a great introduction to classical mechanics, and was taught at a very manageable pace with great examples for each concept taught.",
    "The class was extremely challenging for me as someone who had very little to no physics and advanced math background. I dreaded taking the class, and tried to push it off for as long as possible during my time at Yale. That being said, I do believe that hard work pays off in the class, and the extra effort put in is well-rewarded by a more thorough understanding of mechanical physics.",
    "Likely a mandatory class for anyone taking it. I would recommend that you read the textbook prior to every lecture, and you do your best to attend study halls or attend office hours before midterms strike.",
    "Honestly, you're probably taking this because you have to. If so, TAKE IT WITH DR. PADMANABHAN. He is the literal best - super funny and dedicated - and you will not regret it. It's a decent, straightforward course with problem sets and exams - nothing surprising. But a good professor makes all the difference. So TAKE IT WITH DR. P.",
    "TAKE 180 OVER 170. Literally any day. Especially if Nikhil is teaching it again, but it could be anyone and it would be a better class than 180. I was really committed to 170 initially because I love biology, I love fun applications, and I have never loved physics. But 170 was just a jumble of really high-level application problems without learning the fundamentals. I switched to 180 from 170 on the last day of shopping period and it was THE BEST decision I ever made. All my friends in 170 regretted it for the entire semester. 180 is challenging but it is straight forward. You know what is expected from you, you are gaining useful skills, and everything is logical. Knowing multi was useful but definitely not necessary.",
    "PHYS 180 is an introductory physics course in mechanics. Overall, it was a pretty good course. I took AP Physics C in high school, so there was really no new material for me, which made the course substantially easier than if I was taking it for the first time. The course is scaled instead of curved, though, so if you are taking physics for the first time, you are not necessarily at a disadvantage. One of the midterms and the final exam were a bit challenging, but the scale for the grades was adjusted accordingly. The problem sets were straightforward for the most part and only took a couple of hours a week. Looking back, I wish I had taken PHYS 260 to challenge myself more, but it was still a good course. That being said, I would not take it it if were not required for my major.",
    "It can be hard, but if you like physics at all I would highly recommend it.",
    "An okay course, but pretty much only take if you have to. There are many way better classes out there, but this isn't horrific. Problem sets are surprisingly difficult, but doable with lots of group work. Tests suck, but the grading for this course is very forgiving. Mostly just make sure you do all the work.",
    "Shop all the physics sequences. Pick the one you hate the least. It might be 180 or it might be one of the other ones.",
    "This is essentially your standard, lecture-based physics course. Professor Padmanabhan is an excellent lecturer and devoted to helping his students and there are plenty of help sessions\/study halls if you want more practice\/help. Grading is also extremely generous and not on a curve so you don't have to worry about competing with others. If you've taken multi, or are doing so, or are just generally strong in math in general, this will probably be pretty easy for you and you might want to consider 200 or 260. If not, then it will probably be a pretty chill, but still pretty interesting semester.",
    "This is a solid class especially if you have Prof. Padmanabhan. It's definitely not easy (especially if you don't have much background in physics) but definitely doable. The study halls are extremely helpful. Plan on spending a lot of time in those study halls unless you are already really good at physics. Do psets with classmates and with the TAs in study hall if you can.",
    "Phys 180 is probably a class you have to take for your major or premed requirements. It's a challenge, especially if you are like me and dreaded physics\/do not have a 'physics brain.' However, it can still be quite enjoyable. It requires hard weekly psets, biweekly reading quizzes (online (vs in class) is better with section 01). The exams are very very difficult, the average always remained at ~D. Take this class with Professor P, he is clear, entertaining, and enthusiastic. His love for physics and his students is contagious.",
    "Great course and very well taught\/ excellent help.",
    "Physics 180 is actually a pretty awesome intro physics class. I shopped both 170 and 180 and thought that 180 was more straightforward and better organized. I was already sure I had made the right choice, but Professor Nikhil Padmanabhan made it so that I never looked back - seriously if he's teaching you HAVE to take his section. The course is really structured to help students succeed. There are study halls 3 nights a week where everyone can come and do the psets together, with help from the professor and TFs. I'm a committed biology major but I think Physics 180 is the best introductory STEM class I have ever taken - even non-STEM majors could take this class, enjoy it, and do well! Really cool demonstrations and really cool concepts! You probably have to take it if you're reading this, but have no fear, Physics 180 is a great class.",
    "PHYS 180 is the study and extension of Newton's three laws. You will study projectiles, vectors, linear forces, circular motion and rotational forces, energy, momentum, and waves. I recommend this class to anyone looking to understand essential physics (no more, like quantum physics, and no less). However, many take this class because they have to, but I say: you don't just have to take the class as a prerequisite for something; you can learn why things do what they do.",
    "PHYS 180 is an introductory physics course covering Newtonian mechanics, reaching waves. The course consists of weekly problem sets and frequent readings quizzes, but the absence of discussion sections makes the time commitment manageable. Professor Padmanabhan stresses problem solving approaches and the application of principles learned in class to new contexts. I would recommend this course to anybody interested in furthering their education in physics in college. The course is approachable and interesting, comparable to a rigorous AP Physics C course.",
    "i mean, physics was hell for me but most people are taking it as a requirement. don't take it just for fun, it's a hard class. would probably recommend 170 if you can take it. never spent so much time on a course. to give you some idea, i took organic chemistry this semester too, and spent probably 2-3 times the amount of time i spent on orgo.",
    "This class was difficult, but extremely informative. I have learned an incredible amount in only this one semester.",
    "If Professor Padmanabhan is teaching, take this class! He was such an amazing professor. You can tell that he is really invested in his students. He would spend so many hours in study hall and office hours just doing problems with his students. The psets are difficult at times but with his help I could figure out all the problems and learn so much! He really goes above and beyond! He stayed until midnight one night to help us with our problem set! I spend more time with Professor Padmanabhan than I do with my boyfriend. Wait... I don't have a boyfriend. But anyway that's beside the point. Physics can be really painful and hard but Professor Padmanabhan really helped his students through it. His lectures are engaging and easy to follow and he really knows his stuff.",
    "This class is only good if you take it with Nikhil Padmanabhan. If he is teaching it, take this class. If he's not, take 170.",
    "Physics 180 is a tough course if you're not a STEM person, but you really learn a lot and it makes you work hard. Definitely worth the work though, it makes you see the world around you differently. If you're up for the challenge, go for it, if you want a lighter physics this is not the class for you.",
    "While the material was often boring, the lectures themselves were interesting with Professor Padmanabhan. Problem sets were challenging, but help sessions made it easy to complete them with the aid of peers and TFs.",
    "Take it if you need to for your major. Otherwise a pretty boring class.",
    "A good intro to physics. If you've taken physics before then this class will not be anything new but still a good challenge.",
    "Take this course with Padmanabhan if you can. I can confidently say that this is the best introductory physics course you will find at Yale. As a premed, I came into the course dreading the endless hours of equations and problem solving, but found this course to be immensely interesting and satisfying. It is excellently taught by Nikhil, and you develop a real love for physics whether or not you are \"a physics person.\" This course will make you into one.",
    "This class is great. It's hard but very doable because there is so much help. I definitely recommend the class especially if Nikhil Padmanabhan is teaching it. The 180 part of the series is just mechanics. I found it very equivalent to the first semester of AP Physics C.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are passionate about physics or are taking it towards a major. If someone plans on taking this course, they must be prepared to do a lot of work and put in extra time to master the concepts.",
    "Take physics 180 over physics 170 if you want a class that is little more straight forward in physics. But definitely enter 180 having a background in physics, it will help.",
    "This class took a lot of time due to long weekly problem sets and pre-class online quizzes. The exams were pretty difficult, but the professors seemed understanding about the difficulty level and graded appropriately. Study halls were available but there was no required section, which was nice.",
    "Great class IF you take it with Nikhil. He's very smart and very willing to teach his students how to think about physics. Grading system is fair. Lots of opportunities to raise your grade.",
    "Overall, this was a very challenging course. I would not recommend taking this course unless you need it for a requirement.",
    "A lot of work, but an overall fantastic course with Professor Padmanabhan. He truly cares about both the subject and his students, and is willing to go above and beyond until his students understand. I'd say the pace is extremely fast for students who have never taken physics before, and slightly more manageable for students who have previously had at least some exposure. Fortunately, there are many opportunities to catch up and get help, from office hours, to nightly study halls.",
    "Yes, work intensive but overall well done and reasonable.",
    "I never thought that would say this, but I actually enjoyed taking physics this semester. It was definitely a lot of work, but with a good pay off. This has been the least painless iteration of physics that I have ever taken and I feel it is largely due to having Professor Padmanabhan as my teacher. Definitely take physics if he is teaching it!",
    "as good as it gets",
    "I would most definitely recommend it to a student! If you don't have much of a physics background, be prepared for a tough time. If you are pre-med \/ mbnb \/ mcdb, etc., I would strongly suggest taking a look at phys 170\/171 (or whatever the \"bio-application\" physics sequence is).",
    "If you're a non-premed student interested in physics, 180 is the course to take. 200 and 260 afford no advantages in terms of placement into future courses, and 180 (along with its E+M complement 181) will cover all the material you need to know for higher-level courses with a minimum of hassle. That said, it's not an easy course, especially for those lacking a physics background going in. Don't expect it to be a walk in the park.",
    "It is a good course for someone with previous background in physics such as taking AP physics. I would recommend this class for a student who needs to fulfill a physics requirement. I would also encourage that students allocate a lot of time for the class and take advantage of the study halls as well as office hours.",
    "Chances are this is a requirement for one of the many science or engineering majors... You'll be fine if you haven't even had Math 115 yet (though you probably should have had 112 or a high-school calc course). If Nikhil Padmanabhan is teaching this, I'd recommend taking it with him!",
    "Generally you will only take this class if required. It's more or less exactly what you would expect - a standard, somewhat dry treatment of basic physics concepts. It will probably not be your favorite class, but Professor Padmanabhan really does his best to make it enjoyable. He's a great lecturer and really dedicated to helping his students. He's hard not to like, even if you don't love the material (you probably won't).",
    "I would recommend this class as it was interesting and very important for a strong physics foundation.",
    "You know exactly what you're getting yourself into.",
    "Physics 180 was an interesting class with a boring topic. Classical mechanics isn't exactly fun, but professor Padmanabhan livened class up through his wit and exciting demonstrations. There are also a lot of resources available to students to help them succeed, like study halls and reviews. The problem sets were very annoying though.",
    "It's a hard class that most people will take for their major, but the three things that make it better are: 1) having friends in the class; 2) going to study hall; and 3) Professor Padmanabhan. Working on psets with friends is a must in this class, and a great time and place to work is during study hall. Professor Padmanabhan is an extremely accessible and passionate professor, and his demonstrations make class so much better.",
    "It's been said before by many students and will most likely be evident in other evaluations, but PHYS 180 sucks pretty bad if you don't have a good physics background, and is a walk in the park if you've already taken AP physics. If you haven't taken AP physics before, it's going to require a lot of time to get a decent grade on exams. If you have taken AP physics, I hope you enjoy a nice GPA boost.",
    "A course you have to take as an engineer\/premed\/science major. Not bad at all if you take it with Professor Padmanabhan. I even looked forward to the study halls! Class is huge with a lot of people who have taken advanced physics before, however, so be prepared to work your tushie off if physics isn't your strongest subject. Luckily, it is not graded on a curve, but get a study group anywyas. A quiz is due the night before each class period. Do-able. Reading the textbook is crucial. P-sets were actually fun if you went to the TAs at study hall. Teaching assistants were mostly first years (not yet jaded) and really fun to learn from. Tests were not mathematically hard, but really tested your understanding of the main topics and laws, and also your ability to set up the problems. Practice and confidence are key. #blessup",
    "Physics 180 is okay. It's not particularly fun, but not the worst thing I've ever done either. I'd try to take it with a good professor, but honestly, you're probably not going to take this class just for the professor. Take it if you have to. It won't make you hate physics (probably) but it won't make you love it either (probably).",
    "This is a solid foundation in physics. I totally recommend it with prof. Padmanabhan - it's not unreasonably difficult at all and there is a lot of help available throughout the week if you are having a hard time. The lectures include a lot of helpful examples and fun demos, the psets are very very reasonable and exam questions are pretty much on par with what you have done before."
