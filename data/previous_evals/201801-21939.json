    "Our proseminar was a very challenging course, however, I feel that it was one of the most productive course that I have taken at Yale. Being exposed to a vast array of theory and contextualizing that theory with discussions of theory, literature, and our profession was invaluable. Though the work load felt, at times, nearly impossible, I believe that was a reflection of the reality of being a literary scholar. More than anything, I feel that the proseminar was such an important course due to the range of scholarship that was required of us. Not only did we discuss theory and approach concepts in abstract ways, but actively conducted research, worked in genres of public scholarship and service in the field, and explored processes of editing and publishing."

    "Strengths - wide range of theoretical discourse -wide range of scholarship and discussion pertaining to the field itself -receiving excellent feedback at the end of the semester in a personalized portfolio -Having student-led discussions of texts each week -establishing historical continuity between theoretical traditions and discussing the implications of crafting such lineages -The research scavenger hunt Weaknesses - I felt that some of the theory was neglected in discussion, which was likely due to the large amount of reading (which I would not consider a weakness in and of itself) - stemming from this, there were some particularly difficult pieces that I felt could have been more thoroughly explained\/walked through"
