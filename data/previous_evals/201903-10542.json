    "I learned a lot about ethical conducts.",
    "I learned about the ethical considerations that one must be aware of in situations that are frequently encountered as scientists. I learned about situations where people clearly made the unethical decision and the consequences that resulted. Most importantly, I learned to develop how I think about these things so I can make the ethical choice if I ever find myself in one of these situations.",

    "Strenths - I liked the real world examples of the different ethical issues. I also liked the high level of class participation Weaknesses - for a pass\/fail course, expectations were very high with regard to outside of class research. Even when I took the time to research the topics he asked us to, it still felt like he was angry because we didn't research it enough. That discouraged my participation.",
    "The class teaches of the ethical dimensions of science to prepare us for our future careers. I did not feel that the students are treated in a way to encourage engagement.",
    "I liked that it was discussion based and that there were know quizzes or anything. It made it easier to focus on engaging in the group conversation as opposed to being preoccupied with taking notes. I also thought the content was interesting and was presented through a series of interesting examples.",
    "The open discussion format of the class was helpful. However, I think that the larger size of the class stifled the ability of quieter students to speak their opinions. The loud opinions of some students cut down the extent of discussions. I think it was consistently believed by the professor that a large number of students weren't speaking up because they weren't doing the reading or critically thinking about the situations. However, I think the problem more so is that a handful of students would consistently dominate the conversation without allowing other students to truly get their opinion in.",
    "Quite well-organized and full of interesting topics.",
    "I believe this course covered everything that it needed it. I think it could be improved by reducing the class size in order to better facilitate conversation\/encourage participation.",
    "It surveyed a wide variety of ethical issues, giving students the opportunity to think critically about many different topics",
    "Hands out could be more organized",
    "Every case study is very typical."

    "Yes.",
    "Of course! This course provides far more than a checkmark necessary to join a graduate research group. The topics covered in this course are useful things to consider, as they are more frequently encountered than one might expect. By getting this exposure to these topics and gaining ethical awareness, it prepares students to be ethical scientists and researchers.",
    "Yes, I think it is very important to take a course on ethics in scientific research, and this course did a great job in covering many different topics"
