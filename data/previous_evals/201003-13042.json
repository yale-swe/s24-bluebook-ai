   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class. The workload is not exorbitant at all, and professor Helfand is amazing - an extremely nice professor and one who knows a lot about art in general.",
    "I would definitely recommend Studies in Visual Biography. It's an art class, so it is a good way to explore your creative side, however it is also helpful as a freshman because it is a good introduction to Yale's libraries and resources.",
    "Yes! Take it! Even if you have no art background whatsoever--you'll be taught how to look at everyday objects with a more nuanced sense of their purpose and potential significance. You'll became a better conversationalist, critic, and thinker in general.",
    "This art class provides a relaxed environment to express yourself in ways that you haven't expressed yourself before. The professor encourages you to step out of the medium you are comfortable with to explore new mediums. We visit Yale's many different libraries to take a look at primary sources, which is always fun. I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is looking for an introduction to the art world, or even an art student who wants to do more than what he or she is good at.",
    "Take this class. The professor is amazing and you really get to know all the other students in the class. It really doesn't matter if you haven't taken an art class before - Jessica is very encouraging and so inspiring. Be warned, however, that this class is definitely focused on creating art, not just looking at it and discussing it. Be prepared to do a lot of interesting collages and try new things.",
    "YES!You don't need to be an artist to take part in the class and it is a wonderful way to meet a group of freshmen. Made some really awesome friends from taking this class!",
    "Great class! I had never taken an art class before, so I was worried that my work would be \"bad\". However, you learn from day one that there is no \"wrong\" or \"bad\" in the class, which really helps you explore and try new things. It isn't a technical art class in the sense that you will learn how to draw or how to collage perfectly, but the constructive criticism given by Helfand (and by students) help you learn more about things such as scale, color, and typography in a broader sense. The reading enriches the class but you can definitely get by without doing it if you don't have time. All in all, it was fun and I encouraged anyone who has an interest in art or biographies to take it!!",
    "I would recommend this class to a student looking for intellectual play time. Don't be fooled; It's not gut. The projects we did took a lot of time and energy. But nor were we taught any particular skills or disciplines, which for some students was a relief and for others a frustration. If you want to really learn studio art\/design or research skills, I would recommend an intro class in one of those subjects instead.",
    "Art 001 01 spends part of its time looking at old scrapbooks and artifacts from the Beinecke's immense collection From the information and things you view early in the week you then create your own interpretation of the material into your own scrapbook. It is a more visual approach to learning. I would recommend Art 001 01 to another student in a heart beat. It was an excellent course."
