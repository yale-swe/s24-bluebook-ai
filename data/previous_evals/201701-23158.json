   "comments": [
    "Campe likes to talk a lot, often lecturing for most of the 75 minutes. Furthermore, questions that students ask, instead of letting other students think and answer, he goes on to answer in incomprehensible length and no linearity. There is no classroom engagement.",
    "I think in philosophy especially, DS might be trying to do too much. Even with spending 3 weeks on Kant, there was so much that we never got to discuss even within the assigned sections of reading. I noticed it more second semester than first, but that might be because I was able to understand their arguments in more detail than in first semester. I think it might be worth reading less for the sake of being able to really understand more.",
    "Specifically with my section there could have bee more direct discussion between the classmates. However, I understand why there was not as much as there could have been- Philosophy is hard.",
    "Lots of good explanation of texts but not enough productive discussion in my mind.",
    "The course might benefit from readings directly comparing some of the different philosophers we read. It would be nice to have even more context for each work. The book choice was pretty great though and certainly a strength of the course."

   "comments": [
    "No. Take a Professor who is comfortable with the full DS tract, rather than just the German philosophers.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend continuing with DS. The second semester philosophy texts, in my opinion, were generally more difficult than those of first semester, but I really enjoyed the course. The lectures were fantastic in making parts of difficult works infinitely clearer. Professor Campe's section can seem daunting at first, and at first I was worried because he seemed unapproachable. That was a completely incorrect impression, as he turned out to be incredibly willing to discuss essay feedback or even extensions of discussions from section during office hours. He was also great about giving specific written feedback to papers. He's not one to explicitly outline the argument for you, so coming to his class unprepared makes it virtually useless. I think though that if you've done the reading and have particular concerns, his section is both interesting and rewarding.",
    "Yes, if they choose to do DS.",
    "DS, and the Philosophy track, is a great way to form a foundation in understanding the Western cannon that I think were be very useful in the future.",
    "Yes. Very though provoking class. The spring semester class especially forced students to consider how the individual or self is reconciled with the society or external.",
    "DS philosophy is an excellent course, but you need to be willing to dedicate a solid amount of time to the work in order to get the most out of it."
