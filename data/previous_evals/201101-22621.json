   "comments": [
    "French 160 comes as advertised; it's a course that provides rigorous french language practice. The class is has a moderate, but constant workload; I found that I was constantly working on my French homework. However, the topics were interesting, and I think that my written and oral french vastly improved. That's another thing; French 160 actually provides very good writing practice. There was a writing assignment due for almost every class--although they were short, they provided good practice. In sum, I'd say that this class is a definite must-take for someone who loves french (and talking!!); I really enjoyed our class discussions. Do make sure to shop different profs\/groups of students, though; because the class is so heavily discussion-based, who you're with really matters!",
    "This was a truly enjoyable class and I learned a lot too. If you like talking a lot in class about various issues in modern France, and you don't mind a decent workload outside of class, this is a great choice.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to improve your oral skills, but beware. The workload can be rough. It is like 150 on Crack! You'll also improve your writing, reading, and listening comprehension. If you don't really mind learning about French politics this class is good for you. If you're not interested stay away, it can be very boring and it may hurt your grade as a result.",
    "I would recommend the class. see answer above.",
    "It's mostly reading and discussions in class. Some weeks are writting heavy though. Overall it's a good course",
    "Take it. It's a great way to get to know French culture while improving your speaking and listening abilities."
