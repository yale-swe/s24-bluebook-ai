    "I learned a lot about active learning, scientific teaching strategies and methods of improving a classroom to help more students learn and to help them learn the material better. I also learned how to write teaching statement, evaluate student work and work with students of diverse backgrounds.",
    "Knowledge - active learning, creating an inclusive environment, using formative assessment in the classroom, and incorporating metacognition exercises Skills - created a teaching tidbit that benefited from peer feedback (did a demonstration) and scholarly insight (publications on inclusivity), polished my teaching statement, now able to discuss some of these sensitive topics with colleagues with some background the subjects of inclusivity Insights - all classrooms need to incorporate active learning. The STEM field is loosing students every day because it is not inclusive. We need to change NOW!",
    "I learnt fundamental knowledge about scientific teaching and had the chance of applying what I learnt.",
    "How to solicit and incorporate feedback, how to have a student-centered teaching approach that's as inclusive as possible, and how to think of yourself as a learning coach rather than the container of all knowledge that you give to your students."

   "comments": [
    "This course was really great. I learned a lot. It could be improved by including some papers that focus on teaching physics or math courses. It could also be improved by shortening some of the active learning activities, to show that it is possible to cover all the desired material and use active learning.",
    "Weakness - maybe outline the activities at the beginning of the class, not just the objectives. It will help us get through the lectures Strengths - taught us in the manner in which they would like us to teach. We could experience first hand how we like a particular exercise and know how important it was for deeper learning. Group work, evaluation of statements individually, in a group, and then with the class. I did a complete rehaul of my teaching strategies as I was taking the course. Thus this style was completely effective!",
    "Thoughtful structure each week from the teachers; fun group projects and team-building exercises; excellent research papers to supplement the ideas we discussed in class each week. To improve, I'd appreciate more discussion of the research results in class that was assigned in the reading. I also think the diversity discussion could happen sooner rather than at the end of the course. And I sometimes felt that 2 hours was an unnecessary amount of time from week to week -- I get that you want people to be really engaged with the course and that different subjects inspire more group discussion, but I sometimes felt that we were just filling time for 30-45 mins at the end of class."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in teaching in any scientific field.",
    "YES!! This should be offered in the MBB curriculum as a course that will satisfy graduation requirements. This is what we need to be good PhDs and what we learned in this course extends to all levels of instruction: one-on-one lab mentoring and presenting our research to the scientific community and in community outreach.",
    "Excellent for anyone at all levels of teaching experience. I wish professors could take this course, too. Taught me a lot of new concepts that will stick with me for a while and it was very fun and well-structured. So glad I took it."
