    "Dear goodness, don't take it unless you're super into masochism.",
    "It can get a little boring at the end of the semester--it's also an extra-long time slot--but overall I think environmental history is really important. For the environmental studies major, I think history is so important to show you how current issues fit in with what's happened before. For history majors, I think it's important to see how the natural world shapes the topics we talk about more--human politics, economies, and societies. (Hint: it's more than you've probably thought about before). Professor's commitment to the class is inspiring. Not a WOW Yale classic kind of course, but if you're enjoying shopping period, I recommend taking it. No regrets that this class was part of my last Yale semester.",
    "This class offers a new perspective on American history. Humans are still at the center of the course, but humanity interacting with nature has played such an integral role on the North American continent. This class is very interdisciplinary: economics, politics, ecology, history, and ethics\/morality are all integrated into the course. I would highly recommend this course for anyone, not just EVST majors, especially for the topics at the end of the course which are more contemporary and controversial e.g. the roots and polarization of the climate change debate. The course is successfully impartial: there are many contentious debates in environmental history, but in lecture, there is no obvious bias towards one side or the other.",
    "This class was very interesting if you are at all interested in environmental history in the US. Lectures and sections are engaging and there are lots of videos and pictures that help you visualize the material. The reading is a lot each week but it is manageable if you set aside enough time.",
    "I definitely learned a great deal in this course, and I think it's a well thought out overview of American environmental history. Since Professor Sabin extended the course's time to an hour and fifteen minutes, I think more material was able to be covered, but it could get a bit dry, especially because Sabin is not the most interesting lecturer. I would have appreciated him using the extra time in more interesting and engaging ways. Some days that happened in a great way--if that could be extended to most days, I think this course would be that much better. That said, I'm quite glad I took the course, and if you're looking to learn about environmental history, the rise of environmentalism, and have folk songs play at the beginning of lecture, this is a great course to take. The workload was manageable: weekly readings, sections, and blog posts; one midterm and final; one 8-10 page research paper; and a very small group project assignment for an environmental history tour of New Haven (which was pretty nice).",
    "American Environmental History has been the best course I've taken so far at Yale. 10\/10 would recommend! You'll get to explore themes typically not taught in history courses, and it's not just for \"environmentalists.\" Everyone can learn from this course!",
    "This is the type of course that I would only suggest taking if you have to. The jumbled, indecisive nature of the course made it incredibly hard to engage with.",
    "I thought this was a good humanities class and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in environmental history!",
    "A good class for a number of reasons, name that it's a good overview of the environmental happenings of the last 500 years, without being too much information to handle.",
    "Very broad survey of American Environmental History from pre-colonization to present. A good introduction to college level history courses or thinking about the environment. That said, I would not recommend this course to upperclassmen or people with existing knowledge about the environment-- there are more rigorous classes that one could take on the subject.",
    "Pretty good course, interesting material and readings. Graded a tad harshly, and there's probably more work\/class time than you expect for a course like this. Some of the lectures drag on a bit, and professor Sabin sometimes just reads directly off his notes for an hour and a half.",
    "This is a great class with a pretty manageable workload. I found it to be very enlightening and it helped contextualize many of our modern environmental problems. The is a low-stress class in which Professor Sabin plays folk music and provides detailed outlines at every lecture--it's a great deal and you'll learn a lot.",
    "Most environmental studies majors have to take it, and it's overall a pretty good class.",
    "YES! this course isnt too strenuous and you get out of it what you put in but its a great course.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS! If you are an EVST major, take it. If you are interested in the environment, take it. If you are interested in history, take it. If you are interested in foreign affairs, take it. If you are a SANE HUMAN BEING, TAKE THIS COURSE! Paul Sabin is the best, the lectures are well organized and easy to follow, the material is like learning a story, and the exams and assignments are straightforward. Easily the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "This is a really interesting course. The workload is reasonable although some weeks have disproportionately more reading than others. It is a good way to learn us history through another lens.",
    "I would highly recommend the course just because the required readings are crucial for an understanding of environmental history and the way modern environmentalism has developed. The work load is not too much - there is definitely a lot of reading but the exams are well-organized and it is clear what is expected in order to succeed in the class. If you do the readings you will have your beliefs on environmentalism challenged in a really good way.",
    "A great introduction to environmental history in the United States. Professor Sabin does a fantastic job bringing in aspects of environmental history that are often glossed over (environmental justice, pre-Columbian environmental history, etc.). If you've already taken an environmental history course this might be too basic for you, but I've taken a couple and still learned a lot. Great way to fulfill an EVST requirement as well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class-the themes and histories that Sabin shares are interesting and often not included in other history courses. There's quite a lot of reading every week, but the reading is also the best part of the class. Awesome reading list!! Sabin is not the most engaging lecturer, but he really cares about students and the course. The environmental history tour was quite fun and interesting! The midterm and final were easy to prepare for and do well on. This class helps you bring new perspective and background to other history and evst classes, which is valuable enough to make the slightly boring lecture well worth it.",
    "Decent environmental history survey. Sometimes got frustrated with lectures being a bit dry. But learned some cool stories\/facts.",
    "I recommend if you are interested in the environment or in history - it will definitely introduce you to a new type of historical research.",
    "The readings are great but the lectures are pretty bad. Only take it if you are willing to do all the readings and work hard on the final paper or you won't get anything out of it. It's also a lot of work.",
    "This was a course that discussed extremely fascinating topics in a somewhat fascinating way. I really liked the breadth of American history we covered and the themes that carried throughout. Lecture, however, was too long for my personal tastes and hard to follow with Professor Sabin speaking as fast as he was. Section was enjoyable and a good way to resolve the facts we'd learned in readings and lecture. Downsides: I put more time into this class than any other this semester because of reading and blog posts, yet the proportion of the final grade that this constituted was extremely small. I came out of the course having a much more nuanced understanding of how humans interact with their environments, yet the exams were pretty much memorizing and regurgitating facts with cookie-cutter themes.",
    "HIST 120 is a broad introduction to examining American history through its interaction with the environment. It was an interesting type of history course and was very different from anything I had studied previously. The course was well-run and Professor Sabin was both a good lecturer and seemed to maintain a relatively strong relationship with the teaching fellows. The course is stressful near the end, with a final research paper and a final exam, but otherwise, the work was relatively manageable throughout the semester.",
    "American Environmental History is a really cool class to take at any point in college. It shows a different view on history and helps ground modern environmental issues in a trajectory that makes sense. It's a little annoying to have to do weekly blog posts, and the extremely introductory paper-writing instruction is kind of wearisome if you're not a freshman, but overall it's a great course with material that anyone could grow from learning.",
    "Comprehensive history of the U.S., as seen through a lens focusing on the environment",
    "I thought this was a great course and offered a very interesting perspective of looking at the environment. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the environment or any relevant issues concerning the environment. This class was a lot of reading and at times felt like a lot of work. I'm not a humanities person, so at times it was difficult for me, but overall I felt like the work was worth it.",
    "This is an okay class, not too bad, but also not the best class you could take. The lectures are long and hard to follow, and there are a lot more assignments than I think the material really warrants.",
    "This is a great course. If you take no other environmental studies course at Yale, take this one: it will help you to understand the ways in which the environment is a truly interdisciplinary area of study. If you take no other history course at Yale, take this: it really makes you appreciate history as a discipline, as an analytical tool, and as a way to shift your perspective. This course is not too hard, but it is interesting, important, and will make you really challenge some of your preconceptions. This is everything a Yale course should be.",
    "Over all, it was an interesting course, but it was definitely a survey course and we didn't get very in-depth in any of the topics we studied. There was also a large amount of reading."
