   "comments": [
    "Take French 130 if you've learned French but forgotten some of the basics.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. But be aware that you need to put enough time to it. Do not take it for granted.",
    "Absolutely! It's a lot of work, but your French will improve. A lot.",
    "French 130 is amazing! I entered with a pretty mediocre knowledge of French and left feeling really confident about my ability and excited for L4. Madame Koizim is the best!! Our class was always fun -- Mme. Koizim is somehow always extremely high-energy, animated, and hilarious. DEFINITELY take it with her if you're lucky enough to get into her section.",
    "French 130 is an intensive course, with a decent workload, that pushed me to be highly organized in order to get all the work complete. I really enjoyed all the texts\/movies that we studied. We didn't just skim the surface, but actually analyzed the content of each text in depth - something I didn't think I would be able to do before starting the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 130 to other students.",
    "FREN 130 04 is by every mean the best FREN130 section. I was shopping some other sections and I was twice present in 2 more sections because of the illness of my professor and I can say that professor Ruth Koizim is by far the best. I improved my language skills in all areas in the most efficient way. FREN 130 is altogether a great class if you want to revise your grammar and have a smoother transition to FREN140 and FREN150, classes that require more fluency.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The workload was never too heavy and the teacher was wonderful.",
    "An INCREDIBLE class! I absolutely recommend it if you are willing to put in the daily work. Your French will drastically improve. Take it with Madame Koizim if you can -- she is hilarious, kind, and one of the best teachers that I have ever had."
