    "A discussion group with the eminent and encouraging Bloom. Read as intensely as you choose, and be prepared to be called upon to read and speak in class. He brings a personal knowledge of the poets, a comprehensive understanding of all of literature, and an astounding amount of care for his students. Take it!",
    "I would recommend this class. The poetry is wonderful, and class with Professor Bloom is an experience worth having.",
    "Of course you should take it. Class with Harold is a once in a lifetime experience. Unbelievable. Also, I think he's better on poetry than he is on Shakespeare.",
    "Take it! You'll read modern poets you probably haven't read--turns out great poetry is still being written in our time. Awesome.",
    "Take it. Seriously."
