   "comments": [
    "Pretty cool class. You are able to apply metrics skills to answer questions that you are interested in. It is helpful practice to run through the process of data collection, data cleaning, data analysis, paper write-up, and occasionally, presentation.",
    "How to read\/write\/evaluate Economics papers Review of Econometric techniques",
    "Critically reading research papers, applying econometric and data analysis tools learnt in survey classes, and writing research papers to test a unique, non-descriptive hypothesis.",
    "I developed an understanding of the actual econometrics research process, which, as you will learn if you take this course, takes up significantly more time than the theory, but is really interesting because you have the freedom to apply what you have learned in previous theory oriented courses to research topics of your choice.",
    "How to more critically engage with the economics literature. I also learned how to better find a problem, construct a hypothesis, and use the right econometric tools to test my hypothesis and contribute to the literature.",
    "I learned how different econometric methods have been applied to a wide range of microeconomic topics, including voter behavior, sports betting, and affirmative action in college admissions. I also learned how to conduct my own applied economics research through a series of three paper assignments.",
    "Excellent course on writing (and reading) economic papers, and interesting topics covered in readings. Sufficient background in Stata or R is necessary. Overall great course for learning how to do econometrics and you choose your topics for 2\/3 papers which is really awesome.",
    "Light coverage of various econometric methods and topics. Experience in approaching econometric research and hypothesis generation. Good review of literature from various economic subjects.",
    "The class was mostly just reading and discussing economics papers, but I actually thought it was very helpful in understanding how economics research is done.",
    "A greater knowledge of how to write econometrics papers, and reading and critiquing econometrics papers from across the field.",
    "I learned econometric theory behind a great range of papers which ranged in topic from voting (Professor Fair's paper) to political betting to sports. I also learned how to apply econometric techniques to create a paper based on an original hypothesis."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Any teaching of metrics was a weakness. Fair isn't the best teacher, but he is a great advisor. A lot of the theory he decided to include, quite randomly, was not organized or digestible for most of the students in the class.",
    "This course is a great introduction to Economics paper-writing. However, since the class size was larger than in previous years, it lost the seminar-like feeling it used to have, and class discussions felt less organic, especially towards the beginning of the semester.",
    "Great course - no suggestions for improvement!",
    "Overall I think this course is well run.",
    "I liked how most of the course was focused on reading and discussing journal articles in a wide variety of topics, so the class felt a bit like a journal club. I also appreciated the flexibility in the economics papers that we wrote, in terms of methods and topic. However, most of the papers that we read within each topic area felt a little disjointed -- I wish that there was more of a theme within each topic area and that we surveyed of the economic research so that we had a better sense of an overview of the literature. I also wish we had more of a technical discussion of the econometric methods and potentially had fewer papers but spent longer on each.",
    "Not much to complain about. Readings were interesting (although some weeks were very long). The second and third papers were fun to research and write given that topics are up to students to pick.",
    "I like the freedom the course gives you in doing your own research and how the class really is focused on that. There is no homework aside from reading papers for class discussions, but that is all chill anyway. You basically just had to know the main idea, understand all the models and tables, and you would be fine every class. Sometimes Fair would \"review some econometrics\" and go too hard on matrix algebra derivations of various estimators -- the class probably could do without that.",
    "Strengths: Professor Fair is really fun and I enjoyed going to class, also I learned many different ways to go about answering a research problem. Also loved the wide array of research papers we covered. Weaknesses: grading system wasnt super intuitive, also lectures often werent that structured",
    "Interesting content, format was not engaging too much just like cold calling to summarize instead of really engaging a discussion w the papers",
    "We were exposed to many ECON literature in the course and that fostered lots of valuable discussions. The projects by our classmates were also very interesting and it was nice to hear so many brilliant ideas. However, I do think that toward the latter half of the course the lectures became a bit dry and disengaging. Maybe in the future the professor could consider giving some guiding questions to help read the literature and foster discussion in class.",
    "Prof. Fair is a kind professor who encourages active engagement with the papers and introduced us to really interesting applications of econometrics. The class is very flexible in that you are free to choose whatever topics to analyze for your papers that you want - this is great for encouraging creativity and original work but can also be daunting especially in sourcing data. Additional support in finding data and how to come up with good ideas for papers would have been appreciated.",
    "Strengths: Professor Fair's insight into econometric techniques and his experience publishing papers, especially his voting paper. The selection of readings were great, and another big strength was the final paper, which allowed students to explore any topic. The TA and Professor Fair were extremely willing to meet outside of class to help with these papers. Weaknesses: Few weaknesses, the class may have been even better with a smaller size seminar which might allow for more feedback on papers- also, sometimes the cold calling felt intimidating in a larger class environment."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "This course a relatively easy economic seminar. You essentially just write three 5 to 7 page economic research papers. I would recommend this course if you are looking to fulfill a requirement for the economics major without strain on your workload.",
    "I think you can make this into a cool class if you devote the time to it.",
    "Yes; it's a great way to prepare for the senior thesis and practice doing independent research in a lower-stakes setting.",
    "Great class to take in preparation of writing a thesis or to stimulate ideas for a thesis topic. Also an interesting class to use econometric skills you may have learnt in other classes, but not had to apply to data or a hypothesis in any meaningful way.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, as long as they have the sufficient background in econometric theory. Both the papers that you read and the research that you conduct are very interesting.",
    "I really would. Professor Fair is a really interesting guy. There is not much work outside of the three papers, which do take some time to do. Overall I really enjoyed the opportunity to carry out my own research, collect my data, and run my own regressions. I think I learned valuable data analysis skills in a friendly setting. Be warned the grading scheme is a bit bizarre, and you have no idea where you stand in the class nor the final grade you will get.",
    "I would recommend this class if someone is interested in having an opportunity to write their own economics papers and get experience applying econometrics knowledge they already have. If you're looking to learn new econometrics techniques, then this might not be the class for you, but if you want to read some interesting economics papers about politics, sports betting, or other microeconomic topics, then you should consider taking this class.",
    "Yes, definitely. Absolutely great for applying everything you've learned in intro econometrics courses.",
    "I would because it is a fun class with a fun professor. You get to learn about a lot of economics topics and do your own research, which is rewarding in the end. Especially if you are gonna do a senior essay or thinking about economic research as a career, this class gives good practice in applied econometrics.",
    "Yes! Its a fun way to do the senior requirement and writing papers for the class was actually a pretty helpful experience. Professor Fair is a fun guy and keeps the course interesting. Also good way to practice R or Stata",
    "I would recommend this course only if you are confident and proficient in econometrics. As written in the course description, this course will not help you learn or review econometrics skills. The course expects you to be fluent in econometrics to participate fully in the class discussion and to carry out interesting research projects. The professor and TA tried their best to help students, but you may not get the most out of this course if you were still struggling with some basic technical applications.",
    "Sure, if you are interested in conducting original econometrics research and reading interesting literature in the field, but maybe not so much interested in it doing a whole thesis.",
    "Yes! The most amazing part of this course was the ability to write my own paper based on my own interest, and you can really write about anything! I didn't feel like I had a solid grasp of econometrics from the intro metrics course, and I learned so much more by actually finding my own data and creating my own hypothesis to test. I feel a lot more prepared to do economic research\/research in general. Sometimes it felt overwhelming because I had to teach myself a lot about how to use R\/Stata, but once I did, it was rewarding. It was also fun to learn about the various topics addressed in the great range of papers we read. I will warn though, that writing a successful economics research paper was very time-consuming and required reaching out to professors\/TAs."
