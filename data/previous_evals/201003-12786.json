   "comments": [
    "I think it would have been an amazing course if it had been offered as a undergrad seminar that met twice a week instead of once. The grad students were total wet blankets (with the exception of a few). They almost never spoke, started broodingly at their German texts, and came and left at weird times. I can't speak for the other undergrads, but personally I found their presence (and silence) really intimidating. If the PhD students don't have anything to say about the reading, then surely anything I have to offer would be juvenile or incredibly obvious, right? I felt like I prepared so much for this class every week, and yet every week I left after two hours without having said anything.That said, the reading list is amazing (although this class would be even better if it were a Nietzsche\/Heidegger course). The weeks we spent on Zarathustra were my favorite part of the course - I'm still not sure I like the book, but our discussions were really great.",
    "Yes, take this course if you have any interest in Continental philsophy.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course. It was constructed in a way so the readings are all responsive to each other and highlight aspects that could easily go overlooked.",
    "Absolutely recommended. This class taught me to think in a new way and made me feel competent, for the first time, to talk about some subjects that have really fascinated me for some time. Take this class. Read Nietzsche.",
    "This is a great class for anyone interested in Nietzsche in particular. This is not an introduction to Nietzsche so much as it is an in-depth look into his late writings and their interpretation. Take seriously that this is cross-listed as a grad school course. The discussions are not light and neither is the reading. If you are up to the task it can be a very fruitful course.",
    "This is not an easy class, but definitely worth taking! The texts are great, although difficult, but Professor North does a wonderful job unpacking them. The papers we write are very worthwhile as well."
