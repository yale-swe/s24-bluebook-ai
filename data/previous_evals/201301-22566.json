    "Yes, but you need to study a lot. Its not an easy course.",
    "I loved CS437. I took it with no knowledge of databases, and left with a understanding of SQL, formal query languages, data storage, concurrency control, database data structures, and more. I expected to be bored by the topics in the class, but it instead nurtured an appreciation for databases. It would be a great 5th class \u00e2\u0080\u0093 very little work and lectures were engaging and informative (if a bit tedious at the 70 minute mark). Avi is wonderful \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he really cares whether you understand the material and will explain what you need to know patiently if you ask him. He will call you out to answer a question in class, is awks but I thought really increased our engagement in lectures. Take it!",
    "This is a great introduction to databases for those who have never touched one before.",
    "In short, CS437 is an excellent course to learn more about the practical aspects of databases. Professor Silberschatz is extremely knowledgeable in the area. The course work is also not too heavy; which was helpful for me since my other three courses were work intensive.",
    "no.absolutely not.miserable experience.concepts are interesting, but just pick up the book and read it yourself.",
    "A straightforward introduction to the basics of databases. Three problem sets, two tests. A million grad students who only show up for the exams. Avi is funny although lectures run a little long sometimes...",
    "This class was deceptively easy. The material was not too difficult, and there wasn't a lot of it, but it was easy to become falsely confident in how well you knew what was going on.",
    "Study the slides carefully because anything on the slides could be on the exam. Meet with the TA.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you have a real interest in databases. The material is pretty dry, and starts off simple but definitely picks up near the end. It's not a terrible elective, but don't expect something super interesting and entertaining.",
    "I would recommend this class. The class definitely introduces you to a wide range of topics within the database world, and can be very interesting. The class is also not a ton work, but towards the end it was hard to decipher your grade because there weren't many assignments given, or returned.The midterm and final were surprisingly hard compared to the rest of the material. Also, it is more of a memorizing the slides type test.Be prepared for lectures to be solely from slides. It is good because if you miss something, you can get it later, but at the same time, it makes it very hard to stay motivated and concentrate during class.Avi is a good professor, and a very nice guy. His stories are enjoyable, and he tries to put life into the material when it is dull.",
    "Worth taking to have a glance over the general concepts in database; not too intensive a course, and does not require much time either, can be considered a relatively easy credit."
