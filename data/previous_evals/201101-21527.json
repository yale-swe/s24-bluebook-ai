    "I would only take it if you need a math requirement for Econ. Otherwise, no. Also, beware that a lot of people in this class have taken AP calc before. So if you have no experience in AP calc, I would definitely not take the class.",

    "If you have to take it take it",
    "I would recommend it if they need to take it for a requirement, but not just as another credit.",
    "Shop for every teacher and choose the one with the best English and the most confidence. Anton is fantastic and super smart. He always came to class prepared and smiling. I'm not sure if I can say the same for the other teachers."
