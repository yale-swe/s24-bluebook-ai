    "I would recommend American Scholars. I think it accomplished is purpose of providing a space for the cohort to engage in a wide array of discussions (that I'm sure will be ongoing) within the field.",
    "It is a great class for cohort bonding and really works in developing and locating your community at Yale.",
    "American Scholars is a necessary step towards getting through your first semester as a graduate student. Despite it not always being a fulfilling experience, you get to spend time with your cohort, which seems to get more rare as the semesters continue. Generally, I would recommend the class, though it might be frustrating to not have the option to take another class that may indeed be better fit."

   "comments": [
    "I don't know that the course contributed to my specific dissertation\/research in a direct way, but it certainly gave me a sense of the kinds of questions that are being asked and a broader understanding of (re)sources as I continue to develop my research.",
    "I have a better sense of which faculty members I might want to collaborate with in the coming years.",
    "It is a schematic class that aims to get students acquainted with life, work, and study at Yale. By allowing us to sample a range of professors' interests and works it allows for students to engage with people's work who may they otherwise never come across. It is a really important course for one beginning their career at Yale.",
    "I wish I could say my knowledge of American Studies was deepened. I do think that another class would have prepared me more substantially for my future dissertation\/research."
