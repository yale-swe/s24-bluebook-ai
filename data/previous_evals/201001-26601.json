    "There was no sequence to the course, apart from the first two lectures given by Steven. It did not take long for him to set the tone of the course, and the variations between the topics were very interesting to study, and expanded the arsenal of techniques employable in my future designs. From there, each case study was helpful in reinforcing or introducing similar concepts.",
    "Everything was clear.",
    "I really appreciated he coordinated four professors\u0092 presentations and lectures. All the lectures are so interested, and I also enjoyed to listening to the discussion between the speakers and Prof. Harris."

    "Since I'm interested in the relationship between architecture and specific site, I expected to study actual buildings analytically. Through the entire course, I could learn various type of design methods. Therefore, my expectation was met well.",

    "This is one of my favorite electives I have taken. It was a good break from the critical theories we are exposed to and learn more about dwelling and phenomenal perception of the body. This is a course that complements the first 3 semesters of M.Arch 1 very well.",
    "Through the actual case studies, it was good opportunity to learn reality of interaction between architecture and circumstance, which is useful for design of the future.",
    "Nevertheless I did not have much load of work from this seminar course, I learned a lot from Prof. Harris. It was an enjoyable and meaningfull class."

    "TA had no part.Steven was an expert in the field, and his frequent interruptions of lecturers and student presentations often clarified various points that were omitted or unclear. He was on top of hammering home important observations.",

    "Students worked hard on their models, but they were frequently under utilized and didn't get due attention.",
    "It would be better to do some actual design after analysis.",
    "I think this course would benefit from a period of weekly readings and discussions in the beginning that help to focus the student presentations at the end. Overall this class was great in its discussion of a subject matter that is often ignored in this school. The class could be a bit more rigorous in its methods but all in all is a great class."
