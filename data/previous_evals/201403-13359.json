    "TAKE THIS CLASS. This is possibly the best class I have taken at Yale. It was amazing. Professor Bsheer is so incredibly sharp and bright, and her class reflects this. I learned so much about not only the Middle East, but also about so many other places, and I had my worldview completely shaken up. It's been a few weeks, but I am STILL fangirling so hard about this class. Even if the subject doesn't sound like something you're specifically interested in, it' still definitely worth taking.",
    "YES THIS CLASS WAS AWESOME!!! I had sort of wanted to take a Middle East class here but had no solid plans to do so and am SO GLAD I decided to take this course. This class is so informative and clears up a ton of misinformation and general ignorance about the Arab world in the 20th century. I have learned probably the most about the world in this one class at Yale. Some common themes were theories of power, knowledge, and importance of voice (especially of subalterns), and though I had basically no experience with this whole \"theoretical framework\" business, I learned a lot and felt like I soon understood at least close to as much as other people in the class. After every class, I would leave and continue to discuss with my friends for quite a while because of the sheer amount of new things we now knew. Also, ROSIE BSHEER IS A GODDESS! We have literally had conversations about how awesome Rosie is, leading us to conclude that, really, the only thing we wanted out of this class was her approval. She is so good at giving background, connecting the really well chosen (but very long) readings, pointing out nuance, challenging students to make their arguments or thoughts clearer, and editing our writing. She has really high expectations for writing, too. I came in with little confidence in my writing and struggled with my own nervousness, but I feel like I've left the class as a much better writer. She's also supportive and very cool to talk to outside of class, though I didn't do that as much as I wanted to. The workload (especially reading -- DO IT THOROUGHLY) can be quite a bit, with weekly posts and a presentation and short paper due before the final paper (this was quite the behemoth). Dedicate time to it if you're going to take it, and TRY TO TAKE IT!",
    "Absolutely recommended - the class that has changed my perspective most on Yale. It helped that everyone in this class started out with a similar level of understanding of the Arab world (close to none) which meant we started on the same level. The readings seemed dry, but when we discussed them, Professor Bsheer really shed new light not just on what they were saying, but the importance of their argument. She also challenged us to point out not just what the readings said, but what their key points were, what the purpose of the authors were, as well as what their contribution to the field was, which is such a valuable skill to pick up. I learned so much - not just about the Arab world, but about American behavior there, about the structure of the world order. Cannot recommend more.",
    "EVERY PERSON SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASS. It will entirely upend the way you think about the Middle East. This class will force you to question the things you know and how and why you think you know them. You will come out of each class wishing that it could continue for a couple more hours. Professor Bsheer is brilliant, not just because she knows so much, but also because she is an incredible critical thinker. She will teach you facts, but she will also teach you to think. Professor Bsheer expects that your papers are critical analyses, not summaries. She emphasizes that every sentence should advance your argument. In exchange for all the time you put in to writing your paper, though, she will read it with the kind of care and attention that you wish all teachers would give. Her criticism is harsh and her expectations high, but your writing will improve drastically. This class is a lot of work. 120 pages of reading a week (some of which you won't fully understand until class), a reading response (again, critical thinking, not summary), a presentation, a short essay, a term paper draft, and a final term paper. This class is also worth every moment spent on it.",
    "A fantastic fantastic course taught by a fantastic fantastic professor. I would recommend this course to any person, regardless of their own interest in Modern Middle East Studies--they will become interested. This class is essential to understanding the geopolitics of today. The material is sometimes overwhelming--there is so, so much to discuss--but this is the best possible introduction to such a wide swarth of history. The readings are carefully chosen so that every class builds on an existing theme. The discussions could have been stronger--but that is in no way a reflection of professor Bsheer. In any other course, I would have been satisfied with the level of discussion, but Professor Bsheer pushes her students to engage critically and makes it very clear when the discussion needs improvement. She does an elegant job guiding the discussion, giving her own insight while still allowing students to voice their own opinions. As a result, I became not only a better reader but a better listener. In short, professor Bsheer pushes students to do their best. Her edits on my paper were phenomenal and her insight into my research was equally helpful. She really cares about her students (it was very apparent to everyone in the class) and is willing to guide them at all stages. This is the best course I have taken so far at Yale. Professor Bsheer has a true skill for teaching and the material is fascinating. Take this course. Take any course professor Bsheer is teaching. But also, take this course."
