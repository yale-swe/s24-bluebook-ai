   "comments": [
    "My classmates andI developed a common theoretical underpinning and conceptual vocabulary to discuss our future endeavors as professional historians.",
    "I developed the ability to speak across fields of expertise more effectively. I appreciated this class as an opportunity to be in a class with peers whom I would normally not see in my courses. It gave me the opportunity to see commonalities and differences, which helped me better understand my own position in the field.",
    "I developed a broad sense of major works in the field of history.",
    "In this class I was able to gain a glimpse of different fields, sub-fields of history. We were introduced to some of the foundational text in those fields and the methods used to approach certain types of history. I learned about how the historical field developed, such as when cultural and gender studies became important for the historical field.",
    "Great overview of major works and trends in the field.",
    "An insight into the different approaches taken by historians who focus on varying historical questions\/ time periods.",
    "Went through a series of important historical texts as well as some contemporary literature. Learnt about how the discipline has developed and what challenges it faces now.",
    "Good interaction with the rest of the cohort really did help develop a common language and areas of discussion",
    "I acquired a working knowledge of several contemporary schools of thought and methodologies within the discipline of history. Additionally, I developed familiarity with other students working on diverse periods, regions, and questions, which will surely serve us all well in the coming years.",
    "I learned and lot of knowledge and insight into the Subaltern field of study. Which after taking HIST 500, I am very interesting in studying further and reading more material in the field."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think a particular weakness of the course was an assumed knowledge of complex theoretical frameworks. For example, we did not engage with Marx or Foucault directly, but through works based on their inquiries. I feel we should have engaged more with that material to enhance our understanding of other common texts.",
    "Strengths: - Allowed for the cohort to meet each other. - Provided a space to learn about differing methodologies and approaches to history. Weaknesses: - Too many students to engage in any sort of serious dialogue with each other as most of class was spent waiting to speak. Perhaps if split in two separate sections. - Majority of the course readings are about Europe, with few texts written by people of colour. - No major texts devoted to Africa.",
    "The course was strong in that in provided a real breadth of readings and allowed everyone to have a week or two with which they were more familiar. I also enjoyed having to present on a book that was outside my field, because it really encouraged me to think more broadly. I also really liked the interviews, because it provided me an opportunity to get my foot in the door with professors that I may not know otherwise. I think that was a great assignment. The course was weak in that it faces an impossible task: to have us read the more traditional, Euro-centric, canonical texts of the field while also providing non-Euro-centric readings. Another weakness was the sheer size of the class, which makes the discussion often disjointed. I don't think much can be done to overcome the size issue other than maybe having book presenters also lead discussion together. At least, in that way, you have 2-3 students guiding the others in discussion.",
    "I realize that putting this syllabus together was a challenge. I really liked the choices. I appreciated the chance to get to know the cohort through this course and the instructors' organizing of a movie night. With such a large seminar, it was a challenge to hear from everyone in class, but over the semester I thought everyone contributed to the discussions. I did not think the instructions for the final assignment were clear. If I could suggest an alternative, I would ask students to write two book reviews (1-1.5 pages single spaced): one of the book that you presented to the class, and one review of a required book on the syllabus. This is a very familiar form that everyone would be familiar with, it's a form we should practice because academics have to review books, and it would be much less onerous for students than a 12-15 page paper.",
    "The co-taught course is obviously both challenging and rewarding. Better communication between instructors and with students about expectations, deadlines, and the nature of assignments would have been helpful. Additionally, this was a large course and discussions often grew sprawling. Often, when there were many hands raised and people eager to speak, it seemed that the instructor's hadn't fully decided how the discussion might proceed, and often interjected their thoughts without consideration for if those thoughts pushed the discussion in a direction they had intended.",
    "Strengths - the brilliant, broad array of provocative works we read, the way in which both instructors offered entirely different insights and readings of the text (too much agreement in co-taught classes is not always a good thing!), the diverse assignments that allowed us both to work on writing and other skills (interviewing, presenting), the social aspect of the class. I think both Prof. Botsman and Prof. Klein really encouraged me to think more critically about the profession, and not just discuss the important ideas of our texts as would normally happen in a traditional \"methods\" class. Having taken a methods class prior to coming to Yale, the \"professionalization\" aspect of History 500 was unique to me. Weaknesses - The group-work in-class led to dilution of ideas (some group members also just went off script when presenting group ideas). Sometimes we spent longer critiquing the work than actually working out what thesis was being put forth, what literature the monograph spoke to. I would like a bit more structure in opening up discussion - breaking down the arguments, the field, then discussing the texts' limitations, etc. I think sometimes we assumed we were all understanding the work in the same way.",
    "I think the strength of the course was allowing the first year students to have the opportunity to speak and learn with each other before we move on to work in our own fields. I think the weakness was in the class size, which felt to big most of the time.",
    "Enjoyed both large and small-group discussions. Dani and Jennifer did a great job of guiding our conversations. I also enjoyed most of the assignments, except for the final paper. It doesn't really match with any other genre of professional writing, and the page requirement was long for what was basically an enhanced book review.",
    "The class was too large. It would be helpful to split the group up, in order to facilitate class discussions.",
    "The course allowed the cohort to engage on a range of important and interesting texts. The only problem is that a class of over 20 people does not work in a seminar setting. It would be much better to split the class into rotating groups with each instructor heading one group. This model is followed by other classes, and works much better than than the arrangement we had in HIST 500.",
    "I would have enjoyed some more discussion of pre-modern subjects. For example the concept of feudalism is historiographically just as relevant as postcolonialism (in Marxist history, the Annales, etc.) The paper on the subject of the presentations felt a little unneccessary and more like a writing exercise rather than a substantive academic work.",
    "The course is structured very well. Each week had a definite theme that united the readings and presentations (perhaps the least cohesive was the \"Deep History\" week, which was the only week that seemed more like a grab-bag). The various assignments given all seemed relevant to the goals set for the course. The only suggestion I have for this is that clearer guidelines be provided early in the semester for each assignment. The biggest weakness of this course was its size and extreme weighting toward modernists. Nothing can be done about this, but I'd suggest providing at least two additional core readings on topics relating to the premodern period.",
    "The strengths of the course were definitely the broad knowledge of the instructors and their commitments to create comfortable spaces to grapple with difficult concepts. Dani and Jennifer did a wonderful job managing a large class with over 20 students. The weakness would be the organization level of the class. Many times I requirements of the course assignments were not made clear. But other than that the course was great!",
    "Hist 500 was great for reading in subfields of history that I was unfamiliar with; I though the list was a good mix of classic works and fresh texts that are well-received in the field. The class size was too large for a discussion-based model; dividing into smaller groups was a good move."

    "It's a required course. So no choice.",
    "Absolutely. Though the class is large, that in itself forces one to become more vocal and assertive because there are more people to speak to and wait behind. This is a vital part of graduate training, and one in which I am weak. This course forced me to contribute more actively to discussions and economize comments.",
    "Yes, History 500 is certainly a valuable class for all incoming graduate students of history",
    "Absolutely. The weaknesses noted above don't detract from the primary advantage of this course, which is the facilitation of the mingling and interaction of first-years to foster collegiality and broadening of individual perspectives on the field.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to others! I learned so much about multiple fields in history. I also learned much about the overall historical profession. The class is a must!"
