   "comments": [
    "I was not a huge fan of this course. While the professor was very knowledgable on the topic, I found him quite boring. The lectures dragged on and were fairly hard to sit through, mainly because I didn't like the focus of the class; in high school, I loved the rhetorical analysis and literary genius of the Aeneid, so I was expecting this class to much of the same. Unfortunately, there was next to no rhetorical analysis in the class. We would focus on trivial things such as \"why the author used ac instead of et.\" The professor went into great detail about the historical allusions made in the texts, which I also found to be fairly dull. The essays were quite strange to me, as instead of analyzing texts in the way that was done in AP during high school, we were asked to compare different authors, which I found to be somewhat puzzling. The class also assigns A LOT of homework. First quarter, we would generally only translate 15-30 lines, but during second quarter, we would regularly receive translations of 50 lines or more, in conjunction with either quizzes on the material, outside readings in English, essays, or polished translations (or sometimes a combination of the four). The class is a lot of work and not always rewarding, so I would definitely shop this course to see if you like the professor's style before signing up.",
    "I would recommend it as an intro to college Latin to people who studied it in high school (assuming they'd already studied some Latin poetry during that time)",
    "Very good course on some of the greatest Latin literature ever written. Professor is engaging and personable, and always willing to give extra help.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. The semester is split between Vergil's Eclogues and the first book of Livy's History of Rome. We learn a lot about the genres of myth and pastoral.",
    "Professor Solodow is incredible. Often in class he will explain different academic disputes about the topics we are discussing, which really gives his students an opportunity to see into the mind of a classics scholar. I always appreciated his academic honesty and integrity, and the care which he put into his teaching. While the workload was a little too much for me, overall I enjoyed being his student.",
    "Latin 412 was a rigorous, but rewarding class. The literature we read was extremely interesting and provoked thoughtful discussions. I would highly recommend the class.",
    "It's an excellent course if you're used to translating large amounts of Latin in a short time.",
    "Solid professor for a bridge course",
    "A good class if you are interested in the material. I would recommend it; I thoroughly enjoyed the class.",
    "Lots of translation and lots of literary critique.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the language and the texts we read. The link between Virgil and Livy was subtle, but as a result really interesting to investigate. Professor Solodow was always very encouraging and also very understanding when it came to work loads and deadlines. There is a good balance of quizes and papers to elevate the pressure from the final exam a bit too. The reading are very interesting! They are not essential to teh course, but I recommend reading them all the same, they supply you with a great background of the topics.",
    "Latin 412 covers selections from Virgil's Eclogues and Book 1 of Livy's Ab Urbe Condita. I would highly recommend it, especially for students of Latin who have not done as much work with prose, as translating Livy will greatly improve your skills by the end of the course. That said, this course does require a lot of work and the expectations are high, so make sure that you have the time to commit to it. Class time will primarily be spent on translation, especially toward the latter part of the course, so be prepared to reflect on and analyze the material on your own time to get the most out of it.",
    "Whether you are interested in Roman myth or many of the cultural roots for modern phenomena, this course is great. It is very interesting and has many ties to the modern day, really showing how Latin is not a dead language. Solodow is a great teacher whose extreamly close reading of texts will help you develop your own interests and methods for looking at texts. All in all it is a great course for both the Classics and non-Classics major.",
    "The homework usually consisted of a short translation and a reading, both of which were manageable. Class times were fun and interesting. I would definitely recommend this class for another student.",
    "In this class you read Vergil's Ecglogues and a bit of Livy. Primarily you focus on the texts and transitioning from literal translations to ones that are more suitable to the English language. I would definitely recommend it because the Parallels between and combination of these authors is very interesting and wonderful.",
    "I really hope this semester was a fluke for the course. Maybe the large class threw prof. Solodow off balance, maybe the weather wasn't right - beats me. Either way, this was undoubtedly the worst course I've taken at Yale so far. The professor is dispassionate, dry and plain old dull, the material would send an ADHD squirrel who just downed a dozen red bulls into a catatonic sleep, and the classmates were, with few notable exceptions, wholly unfriendly, solitary operators with superiority complexes. The only viable improvement for this course would be to eliminate this black stain on the classics department with extreme prejudice."
