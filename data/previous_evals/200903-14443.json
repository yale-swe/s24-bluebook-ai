   "comments": [
    "This is a course about the history of Medicine and if you are thinking of being a doctor it is of the utmost importance that you take this class. It will give you an understanding of what it means to be a doctor and why and how to be the best doctor you can be. Only by emulating those medical giants can we provide better care.",
    "It's a great course covering the very beginnings of western medicine up through almost present day. It's very interesting to learn about medicine from a historical perspective.",
    "The title is self-explanatory-- good survey course on the history of scientific medicine. Whet my appetite for more science and technology studies. It was really Eurocentric, so if you're interested in learning about Middle Eastern, Eastern, or indigenous American medicine, you'd be disappointed, but I thought the material was really interesting.",
    "Great if you find medicine or scientific biographies interesting.",
    "I would summarize it as a crash course in medical (and even world) history based on the fascinating sequential biographies of landmark physicians and their medical and literary contributions. Very helpful in using a common thread (development\/history of medicine) to weave together the development of humankind in (mostly) the Common Era. Wove together history, politics, religion, development of science, and sociology onto one fascinating time line. Certainly a course to be recommended.",
    "I've always been interested in medical advances but would never consider majoring in Science, so it is no surprise that Sherwin Nuland's slower paced teaching of the history of medicine through the biographies of influential physicians rather than impersonal timelines became one of my favorites last semester. Mr Nuland is an incredibly personable professor, and author, seeing as though the course is taught by way of his own published book. The course involved consistent reading, a midterm, and a final paper with a final exam also offered to the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You would be amazed at what and how much you will learn about the history of medicine.",
    "This class may have been my favorite this semester. Dr. Nuland is a wonderful professor who is not only extremely excited about teaching freshmen, but also full of fascinating information and anecdotes. Dr. Nuland is good at making sure that everyone is engaged in class. You learn about not only the history of medicine, but also things very applicable to the medical profession today. Studying the history of medicine through biographies was a very interesting approach. The reading assignments are very reasonable andvery entertaining. I would recommend this course for anyone who has even the slightest interest in the medical field."
