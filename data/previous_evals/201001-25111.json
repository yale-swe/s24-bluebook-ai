    "Yes, I would recommend UN and Collective Security to another student. The workload of the course is very manageable and Professor Krasno is a great professor. Many people are unaware of what the UN even is so it is a great opportunity to learn about the organization from all angles.",
    "Great course. Take it if you can get in. Gives you a broad overview about the behemoth that is the UN. Prof Krasno is an expert in her field, and hearing her stories is truly a unique and inspiring experience.",
    "Weekly readings that we discuss in class, a trip to the UN, and a UN simulation at the end. There's also a midterm based on the reading, and a final paper. I would recommend the class if you're interested in the UN.",
    "Not hard. An overview of the functions and history of the UN. Not particularly engaging for the students in seminar.",
    "Yes. It was an enjoyable class and taught me a lot about the UN."
