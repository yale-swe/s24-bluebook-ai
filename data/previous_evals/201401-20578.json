   "comments": [
    "A continuation of French 110. Lots of work, and the weekly tests are not fun, BUT doing all the work translates into making a ton a progress in language facility.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 120, especially after French 110. French at Yale is really amazing and you will be surprised how much progress you have made after taking a year of French.",
    "This class is pretty much what you would expect from a level 2 French class; a fair amount of workbook exercises and grammar practice. However, the weekly videos are hilarious and do a great job of getting you comfortable with the language.",
    "French 120 is the continuation of French 110. There is no real difference, other than learning more tenses. Madame Vysosias is a wonderful professor! She is very sweet and helps make the lessons clear. Definitely take it with her!",
    "I absolutely would recommend this class to someone who is truly motivated to learn French. You have to put in quite a bit of time into the class, but the work isn't especially difficult. You will learn a lot of French very quickly in this class, and be able to speak comfortable and fluidly",
    "It is a good continuation of FREN 110. I definitely think the French in Action program works and is wonderful. I would recommend it to another student, but would highly encourage taking it with Madame Burton or Monsieur Ngame.",
    "If you're taking this course , you know what to expect from French in Action. There does tend to be more focus on grammar than in FREN 110.",
    "French in Action is still funny, weekly tests are still there, you still have to write compositions, etc. It's just French 110 continued, so you know what you're getting into. If you have the option, try to take this with Ngame, but if not, Vysosias is good as well. Her teaching style is very different as she teaches directly to the test as far as I can tell, which is fine if that's what you're looking for, but not as engaging as other lecturers. She's really nice, though, and always open for conversation.",
    "It's a lot of work. If you commit yourself to study at least 30 - 60 minutes a day you'll do fine. It's a pleasant class. You get to practice a lot speaking. I totally recommend this course specially to people from my field!"
