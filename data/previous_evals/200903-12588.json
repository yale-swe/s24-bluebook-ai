    "The reading list covers writers who are \"migrant authors\" or deal with issues of trans-national identities and migration. It was a Chinese-heavy syllabus this term but that might change. Great class for exploring a subject area that doesn't receive that much attention at Yale with a great professor. Can be a bit scattered and difficult to reconcile all the different levels of discussion going on amongst students coming from different academic backgrounds and levels of preparedness.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in Asia or cultural\/immigration issues; it's not as valuable as an English or Literature class, although the readings certainly still are interesting.",
    "Take it if you're interested in Asian American stuff.",
    "This class surveyed East Asian and Asian American literature with a focus on China. We read on average a novel a week and had pretty intense discussions during our 2 hour class. I would strongly recommend this class if you are looking for an interesting English class on a non-canonical genre and also a class to work on your writing. Professor Tsu is really amazing and you gain so much perspective on the genre. As a science student, I found this class to be the break that I look forward to each week (though it's definitely not an easy class).",
    "I would recommend it to someone who's interested in the topic of Asian\/Asian-American migration as it is dealt with in fictional works by Asian and Asian-American authors. It has great discussions and the readings are really interesting.",
    "I usually tell people two things about this class: a) it was fun, and b) I learned nothing. The class was fun mostly because the professor had such a hands-off approach, letting students talk about whatever they wanted, which meant there were some \"Everyone Talk about Why You Liked the Book\" days. It also meant that discussion went everywhere, people went off on wild tangents\/monologues, and you didn't walk away with very much. I wish that the professor would have spoken more, giving her insight into the novels, as well as helping us tie in ideas and themes across novels. The papers were extremely frustrating, primarily because everyone felt like they hadn't learned anything in the class. What am I supposed to write about? How much I liked\/disliked the novels I read? (which is what class discussion was usually about). I also found her comments on the papers completely unhelpful, and the grading bizarre and somewhat unfair--it's still very unclear to me what her standards are. The classdid get better halfway through when she had students do close readings and give presentations, because it gave the class a bit more structure, but she still wasn't a very effective moderator. She said that she will be offering the class again as a lecture, which I think will probably be much, much better than this seminar, and has a lot of potential to be a great class.",
    "It's a bit of a scattered course at present. The books you read are interesting and very varied, but the discussions felt a bit meandering. Professor Tsu is brilliant and amazing when she does talk, but she took a bit of a hands-off approach to discussions this semester. Granted, I think that as this course is still experimental, this may change. As I highly recommend her as a professor and thinker, you should take anything she teaches if only to sample a bit of her mind. Plus, my writing really improved from her comments on my papers. I can't say this about most professors."
