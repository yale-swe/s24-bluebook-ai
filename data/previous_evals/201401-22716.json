   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it to students who have to deal with numerical simulations. However, it is important to know atleast one programming language very well else doing the assignments would be very tough. I had only taken 1 computer science course 3 years back and so I was not well-versed with programming techniques and good programming tips. Although some tips were provided during the course, I felt that had I been better acquainted with good programming habits, I could have understood some nuances better. However, that was not a significant deterrent in understanding the course-material.",
    "If you use numerical methods in your research, the course is highly recommended. But you need to coordinate well with your schedule. More than 15 hours is needed for homework per week."

    "Since my project involves numerical simulation of convection in planetary interiors, this course was extremely relevant to my research. I can now start deciphering the convection code I am using (written by my supervisor) and can hope to improve it.",
    "It shows me how the black-box software works for numerical methods and strengthens my ability on programming."
