   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend Chem 490 if you have the time to dedicate to research. You have to take it if you want a b.s. in chemistry. Your experience is really dependent on your lab.Also, Dr. Parr occasionally brings donuts to lecture.",
    "Graduate level research. Pick your advisor early.",
    "This is a great class for people who are interested in going into science as a profession. You work on an individual research project, exactly as a graduate student in chemistry would.",
    "If you like research, then do it. You might as well get credit for something you are going to do anyways. It's a great opportunity to be in close relation with a professor of your choosing in the chemistry department and motivate you to keep going to the lab for as many hours as you can over the course of the week. I was working about 20 hours a week in the lab.",
    "It's important to find a lab whose research you're interested in. Make sure you get to know the people in the lab before you commit, because those are the people whom you will be learning the most from.",
    "It is what you make of it! So put in a lot and you'll get out a lot!",
    "Take it.",
    "Yes. Chem 490 was a chance to see the other chemistry undergrads doing undergraduate research in one place and get all of the training necessary to do chemistry work. It's a required course for the chemistry BS and BS intensive majors and not too bad for being a required course.",
    "Research for credit for chemistry majors. Your experience will clearly vary a lot depending on who's lab you choose to work in. I was unable to make the periodic class meetings with Parr due to a scheduling conflict, so I can't comment on that.",
    "Chemistry 490, as an independent study will be as helpful and rewarding as you make it. If you care about your project and take advantage of the many resources made available to you, you can learn an immense amount."
