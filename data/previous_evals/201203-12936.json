   "comments": [
    "If you are taking this course, it is most probably because you have to take it as a major requirement or you are using it as an elective. Don't be alarmed! It's such an interesting course and Ouellette is a great professor!",
    "Absolutely fantastic course. Caveat though - I say this as a physics major, and Ouellette has a physics background, so this is very much a physics course. Engineers may be frustrated. But I loved every second of it. I shopped this class for fun and enjoyed the first couple lectures enough to stick with it despite the 9AM meeting time. Highly recommended, especially if you're a physics major looking for an elective! Professor Ouellette is awesome and so enthusiastic.",
    "This class was interesting but hard. It will probably be the hardest class of the semester so make sure you have enough time to devote to it. In general, I would recommend it.",
    "I would take this class if you need to, or if you are really interested in fluid mechanics. It's not an easy class so be prepared to put in the work, but you will come out having learned a lot!",
    "Don't underestimate it, it's not easy, and it's taught as somewhat of a hybrid between a physics class and an engineering class so it may be frustrating for people on both sides. On the other hand Ouellette is a solid lecturer and very approachable. The book sucks, but Ouellette can recommend much better supplementary reading if you ask. You probably have to take this course, but if you don't, then I would only take it if I were really genuinely interested in fluids and committed to really learning all the material.",
    "Fluids is hands-down an interesting subject. You'll learn a lot about phenomena you see in everyday life, with a nice mathematical framework to back it up. Ouellette likes to emphasize concepts over problem solving, so take this into consideration when deciding whether or not to take the class.",
    "Professor Ouellette approaches fluid mechanics from a different perspective than most professors in his department. For one thing, his background is in physics and computer science, so he teaches the subject like a physics course (honestly it baffles me why fluid mechanics falls under engineering and not physics...). If you are interested in learning fluid mechanics from square one and really understanding the intuition and nuances of the field, you will not find a better professor. He turns a subject which, because of its empirical-ness, has at times resembled an organic chemistry course (read: memorizing equations) into one where everything fits together in a meaningful way. Highly recommended. On exams, Ouellette definitely sticks to the philosophy of giving points for correct intuition and thought process, which is something that can't be said for most other courses. Homework isn't so bad either - maybe 4 - 5 hours a week.",
    "MENG 361 is a course that you should take only if you have to. It is a rather difficult course as the lectures are not that great and consist mostly of derivations of the equations. The exams are conceptual which is strange considering that the lectures dont really discuss concepts and the psets are mostly applied. Professor Ouelllette is not the greatest teacher of fluid dynamics but he always has office hours which can be helpful.",
    "Meng 361 is aimed at teaching the basic principles of fluid behavior. The goals are to help develop an intuitive sense of what is occurring as well as a methodology for approaching and solving fluids problems that may arise. The problem sets can be very challenging at times. The exams were completely different than the psets: they were more conceptual than computational. Ouellette makes the course manageable. It would be very easy for another professor to make it ridiculously hard.",
    "If you have an intuitive understanding solid-body mechanics and want to translate that to a continuum model, this class is great, provided you can remember multivariable calc and diff. eq. for the first half. I took this for ABET Mech. E. and was apprehensive going in, but it was one of my most rewarding classes this semseter.",
    "I would recommend Fluid Mechanics. The psets were not hard, the exams were fair and Professor Ouellette was a pleasure to have. The only killer part about this is that it's at 9am.",
    "You are probably taking this because it is a requirement for the major. Fluid mechanics is very difficult to understand so don't get discouraged. Psets don't relate to the midterm or final.",
    "A lot of theory, Ouellette cares but isn't excellent at establishing the core principles and then building off of them. Also, the Psets and tests are not that related which can be tough",
    "Professor Ouellette loves to do derivations, and at times it felt like he made the material more complicated than it needed to be. He doesn't really teach you how to analyze fluid problems; most of class would be spent talking about concepts and deriving equations. That being said, the tests demand that you have a conceptual understanding of the material. If I had to take it again, I would probably take it with a different professor.",
    "This is going to be one of your most challenging classes junior year, and you most likely have to take this for one of your requirements. It is a rewarding class though, and at the end of the course, you will feel like you learned a lot and were exposed to real engineering problems. My recommendations for the course would be: read the sections corresponding to the lecture right before or after lecture, don't focus too much on the complicated math, and ask Professor Ouellette on anything that seems unclear. In this class, Professor Ouellette really is a great resource, and he always seems genuinely happy to help!",
    "Ouellette did not do a great job of teaching the class this semester. His lectures were often difficult to follow, since he was using notations that were partially from the textbook and partially things he was making up himself. His exams contained lots of questions unlike anything we had seen before in the class and were pretty unfair. Similarly, the psets frequently had questions that were not very clear and not related to topics we had covered in class.",
    "Yes I will. it's so useful for atmosphere and ocean study.",
    "Ouellette tends to teach more theory before he goes into specific examples, but you just have to stick with it because while that makes the class a little frustrating at first, by the end you feel like you have a pretty good understanding of the material and can see how everything relates within the course. Problem sets take more time than average, and the exams are difficult but fair and are actually a nice balance between conceptual questions and calculations so that it tests you well you actually understand the material in addition to how well you can solve problems related to it.",
    "Yea, take it if you need it.",
    "So here's what happened: as a senior, I was, for the first time, going to have class only three days a week. I had it all worked out. And then, on a whim, I shopped this class with a friend. That was a huge mistake, because I got absolutely hooked and ended up with Fluids at 9am on what were supposed to be my off-days. SO WORTH IT. First of all, Nick Ouellette deserves every teaching award Yale has to offer. His board-work is pure art. His lessons are well-thought-out and clear. He is always supportive and available. And best of all, he's one of the only profs I've had who isn't afraid to be wrong. If he doesn't know the answer to a question, he says \"I don't know, but let me find out and get back with you\", which tells me he's more interested in teaching the material than in preserving a reputation for omniscience. One caveat: Ouellette is a physicist, so his approach is very physics-y and not very engineering-y, which I as a physics major loved. More real math and fewer frictional head loss tables.",
    "One of the more difficult engineering classes... Prepare for this to take up the most time of any class you are taking.",
    "Hard. Need to understand differential equations but not necessarily be able to solve them. Went into more multivariable depth than diff eq depth.",
    "Ouellete is a great teacher, but he likes to write difficult exams that don't really line up with problems from the book. I enjoyed learning the subject from him, and the problem sets weren't difficult, but the exams had a lot of frustrating trick questions.",
    "This class is taught like a graduate level course. The p-sets take forever and are mathematically intensive; however, the tests don't reflect the homework as they were mostly conceptual.",
    "I took this class after reading all the positive reviews (both online and by word of mouth) that people had been giving Professor Smoot, but I was definitely disappointed. I did not feel like lectures helped me understand the material better, and while Professor Ouellette was a very energetic lecturer, I never felt very engaged. Problem sets are stupidly easy and do not help you understand the material better either, as they usually just require you to find a relevant equation and plug in numbers or do an integral. Professor Ouellette makes up his own more challenging problems sometimes, but I did not find these to be illuminating. Exams are pretty fair and are not hard. Fair warning: I come from a math\/physics background with no experience in engineering classes, so this probably affected my opinion of the course (for example, I wish there were more theory and that we derived things more rigorously). I wouldn't really recommend this course.",
    "Chances are you need to take this class for your major, so in general it's a great idea to take. I would recommend this class because the focus is very much on the understanding and intution, and less about the math. Just to be clear - the math is definitely there, but this classwill give you a really good understanding of fluids and the topics necessary to operate in the field. If you need to take this for your major, definitely take the class."
