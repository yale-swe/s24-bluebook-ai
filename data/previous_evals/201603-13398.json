    "Gave me an understanding of how to form an arabic sentence and read and write using the arabic alphabet.",
    "I developed the ability to read, write, and speak simple sentences confidently.",
    "I have a good knowledge of the arabic alphabet. I possess some basic grammar and vocab, and can form basic sentences.",
    "This course was a great introduction to Arabic--we learned vocab and grammar that is necessary to speaking and writing, while also learning about culture and colloquial language which is critically important.",
    "I learned the Arabic alphabet and gained a basic understanding of Arabic grammar.",
    "I gained significant vocabulary for modern standard Arabic, skills in present and past tense conjugation, and some knowledge of the Syrian Shaami dialect.",
    "This was an L1 course so I think I learnt a significant amount of stuff for a new language.",
    "I learned how to read and write formal Arabic at a basic level. I learned basic Arabic grammar. I also learned to speak a specific Arabic dialect as well.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course does not focus on vocabulary too much, it's more about how to structure a sentence and learn this new alphabet. I thought it effective at accomplishing this. However, I feel like the class moves very quickly in the first part of the semester, and very slow in the last month. I would recommend spreading out the work better, so it's not as overwhelming at first.",
    "Lots of repetition, which is key to learning new vocabulary, is well promoted in this class. Lack of opportunity for one-on-one conversations in Arabic with TA's or professor should be improved upon.",
    "The course was extremely intensive the first month or so of classes, but as the semester continued, the pace of learning slowed drastically. It made it much more manageable, but I feel like I would have benefited from more material being covered in the second half of the semester.",
    "I think the teacher could be more clear as to what the homework is.",
    "Strengths: pace of the course is fast but really gets you to speaking and writing by the end of the semester, supportive learning environment in the classroom created by the professor and other students, and you learn through many ways including in class, reading the book everyday, the online website, helpful office hours, and weekly TA classes for speaking. Weaknesses: high daily workload makes it difficult to process all the information you learn",
    "This course is a well-paced course and by the end I reached a level of ease and comfort with the alphabet and language which I was not expecting. However, the course is structured around a textbook which emphasizes vocabulary that is of little practical value... I also wish there had been more dialect practice.",
    "Professor Aziz is a very nice man and that makes it easy to be in a class everyday with him. He is very understanding, however soemtimes it was difficult to understand him when it cames to things like grammer.",
    "Strengths: the instructor keeps us entertained; we had several classes where we played charades or listened to Arabic music. Weaknesses: neaely half of the course is spent learning Arabic letters - many students come from Arabic\/Persian\/Indian backgrounds and do not need such instruction. They aren't qualified for L2, however. If there are enough students with such backgrounds then maybe a separate L1 course should be designed for them - L1.5 maybe?",
    "Strengths: Learn a lot of material Weaknesses: miscommunication, requires a lot of time to grasp the material and nuances of the language so the professor must be accommodating Needs more of a focus on the spoken language",
    "It was a good course."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course. It seems overwhelming at first, but it does get better.",
    "Yes. One would be surprised by how much one's Arabic will improve in just one semester due to the repetitions and thematic division of chapters.",
    "If you have a deeper motivation to engage with Arabic language and culture, I would highly recommend this course. The workload can be big, but there are tangible benefits by the end of the semester if you stick with it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend L1 Arabic to other students for a number of reasons including that Arabic is taught well here so it is a great place to begin studying the language, Professor Aziz is incredibly supportive and fosters a love for the language in students, the language itself is fascinating, and if you are interested in traveling to Arabic speaking countries this course will give you a good basic ability to speak (in dialect) and read (in modern standard Arabic) while orienting you to the culture (through music, videos, and explanation of holidays).",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who's interested in learning Arabic; while the language itself is quite difficult, the class is not.",
    "Yes I would! I'd recommend any L1 course.",
    "This is the only class to begin learning Arabic. However, I would only recommend this class if the student is willing to dedicate a lot of time to learning the language on her own, as it is very difficult to learn for a native English speaker.",
    "Yes, L1 is a requirement to understand arabic."
