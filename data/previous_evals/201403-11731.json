    "Good overview of accounting. Very slow pace, but good if you're looking for a chill class!",
    "8:45 am at Evan's Hall on Science Hill...you're either going to love it or hate it. Rick has plenty of stories to make accounting a little more bearable, but you'll still have to be internally motivated (why are you taking accounting). The daily homework was easy to do and the 3 psets were reasonable. This course was very manageable. Many of my friends and I took it as seniors who had interviews each week during the first half of the semester and we found the work very manageable. If you're a senior you will get in. If you are a junior consider taking Rick's opportunity to be guaranteed a spot if you are considering taking this course in the fall.",
    "I would recommend",
    "Great course. You learn useful things. Not too difficult. Take it.",
    "Tough workload but great professor who is very flexible",
    "Practical class. The majority of your learning will come from doing problems since the lectures are overly general and at SOM MW 8:45. The valuation portion is very thin, so don't take this if that's what you're looking for.",
    "I would recommend it if you need to know basic accounting for finance interviews and such, but definitely do not expect too much from the class--you will not learn the details of DCFs, how to analyze statements, etc.",
    "Everyone should take this class. I really can't say enough good things about Professor Antle. He's the nicest, most helpful, and most entertaining accounting professor you're ever going to come across, and he presents the material in an entertaining and engaging way. The work -- daily mini-assignments, three problem sets, and a take-home plus optional in-class final -- is extremely manageable and important for learning the material. Plus, the skills you learn in this class will help you for the rest of your life!",
    "Most of this stuff you can teach yourself (as most kids do preparing for finance interviews) but I enjoyed learning this stuff in a classroom setting, and Prof. Antle is great.",
    "This is a good class to learn the basics of accounting, but doesn't go too much in depth. It was a good amount of work, but it ebbed and flowed and the Professor is very understanding.",
    "Only take it if you know virtually nothing about accounting. It's pretty basic material, and there's quite a bit of homework that goes along with it. Grading was pretty lenient, 3 Psets and a final.",
    "If you plan on doing finance or business, this is the course for you.",
    "Take it if you want a solid background in accounting, else could be boring.",
    "I would recommended this course for someone looking for exposure to the material but not wanting to master it.",
    "Great intro to finance and preparation for internships\/interviews. Would be useful to spend more time on valuation.",
    "TF's role was more like a grader.",
    "Yes, I felt that I did end up learning about the different financial statements. The workload was reasonable with daily 5min homework checks, 3 psets, and a takehome and in class final. Professor Antle is a great guy, but is not the most coherent lecturer.",
    "Broad overview of accounting. Recommended.",
    "It is a great general introduction to accounting and if you plan to work in financial services, accounting, or any operations of business role, you need to know this stuff.",
    "It's a nice, relatively-easier course than most and gives you some basic personal finance knowledge. I would recommend this class. A lot of it is self-taught, but doesn't take too much time.",
    "Woth taking, but if you are going to take it, do the work. He will assign things before we learned the relevant material, which can be frustrating, but in the end we knew everything.",
    "Great course. If you go to class and do the problem sets, you will do well. If not...You will probably struggle. The valuation techniques in this class are \"security valuation,\" not \"corporate valuation.\" YOU CAN COUNT THIS TOWARDS THE ECON MAJOR!",
    "This is a great class to take if you're interested to learn how financial statements are formed and how they work together. I found the class very interesting and I learned a LOT. Antle is great and SOM is beautiful. I thought I would have a problem with the early meeting time but I ended up making it to every class meeting so don't be too afraid of that.",
    "Helpful intro to accounting but only if you put in the work yourself",
    "ACCT 270 serves both as a surprisingly interesting introduction to common accounting concepts and mechanics (most significantly, basic financial statement analysis) and as a comfortably-paced presentation of elementary financial theory. If you have limited or no previous experience at all in either of these areas, this class serves as an excellent primer. The flip side is, if you do have some background in this areas or have already taken a course that covered Mean-Variance Analysis, for example, the class may be too simple or boring for you and you may wish to take a more advanced class, either at the College or at SOM. In any case, Rick is truly a jewel of a professor. He's dedicated to his students (as in, will answer your email with an urgent homework question at 3am) and sports serious business credentials. The bottom line is, ACCT 270's suitability for you really depends on your previous exposure to the class' topics. Other, more advanced classes include ECON 251 and courses such as Financial Statement Analysis at SOM.",
    "Take it if you're interested in knowing anything about businesses. Pretty necessary if you want to do anything in finance, but it's a good skill to have too.",
    "Yes, essential knowledge. But more work than a lot of classes.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student at Yale. The concepts the course teaches are a great basis for people who might want to continue working in the field of finance\/accounting or a good practical knowledge that one might use on a daily basis when taking a loan, etc. If you don't have any background in the field of finance\/ econ\/accounting, take this course CR\/D\/Fail.",
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in business or finance."
