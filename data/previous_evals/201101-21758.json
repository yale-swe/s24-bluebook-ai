    "Professor Alonso read off the powerpoint every class. Even though I came to every class, many people came to none, and there really was no reason to come. Sometimes it seemed like class was English practice for Professor Alonso, as we watched her sound out her own powerpoint. She clearly didn't go over the powerpoint before class, and when asked specific questions about the examples she had chosen to share (which were the same as in the book, always), she often said \"I would need to look at this again more closely.\"This was a great subject, but a pretty poor professor. It is still worth taking, as I don't hear much better about Sigga or about the Lecture.",
    "It'sa great class, but whatever you do, absolutely and by all means avoid professor alonso's sections. Take the other seminar or the lecture instead.",
    "Don't take it with Alonso. Really. Don't. I thought I'd like the smaller seminar as opposed to the lecture class, but this was essentially a lecture as well, only to 15 students instead of 150. The lectures were not engaging, Professor Alonso's accent was difficult to understand, and it turned me off economics.",
    "If you're going to be an econ major, then yes. This class made me realize that econ isn't quite the right fit for me. The problem sets and midterms are challenging - Alonso and Sigga created them together this year rather than having separate psets and exams in previous years; Sigga's questions are definitely tricky.",
    "This class will teach you macroeconomics, but the course is straight out of the textbook. Fortunately, the textbook is good and the course is relatively easy. Unfortunately, both professors were rather poor, and you were better off skipping class and reading lecture notes \/ the book itself.This course has potential to be great, but it really needs better professors offering it. Alonso and Sigga are just not going to cut it.",
    "It is harder than the lecture, and I do not know if the other professor (Professor Sigga) is in any way better than Prof Alonso. Shop it and decide on your own, but consider taking it if you want to understand elementary macroeconomics better or if you feel the need to interact with the professor more.",
    "I wouldn't take this class again. I think the content is great, and if you are really interested in that then go ahead. However, try out different teachers and find one whose style works for you.",
    "Keep up with the material because there is a lot of it"
