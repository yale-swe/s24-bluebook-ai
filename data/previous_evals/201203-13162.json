    "the class focuses on what we know of food from prehistoric times to the present, I would recommend it",
    "A good course, but don't be fooled by the name because while it's fun and interesting, it's not a gut! The readings are things you actually want to read and both papers allow you to explore whatever topic you are interested in. Recommended for sure!",
    "This course is excellent. Professor Freedman is witty, captivating, and truly makes each class enjoyable.",
    "Without a doubt!",
    "This class in general can be summarized in one word: annoying. I intended for this to be a fun, enlightening class, but it turned out to be way too much work than it's worth. If you want to take this class, take it CR\/D or honestly just eat at different restaurants if you love food. This class doesn't really talk about the restaurant aspect of foods as much as I would've liked too and is more history-oriented than I would've liked. If this is offered as a seminar, then I would recommend it slightly. As it stands in lecture form, I do not recommend this course. Especially not to fulfill a Hu distributional requirement. There are easier and more interesting Hu's out there.",
    "Yes! It was a really great class!",
    "It is basically a timeline of the evolution of attitudes towards food. I would recommend it if one is interested in History in addition to food. A mere interest in food will not give you the class you are looking for. You have to remember that it is first and foremost a history class.",
    "yes!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but with some hesitation. It is a fine class and I definitely learned information about food that I didn't know before, but it wasn't thrilling or mind-blowing. There is also a long paper on which we received almost no guidance (so you will have to take the initiative to meet with Professor Freedman and\/or your TA and start the paper early). I was also a bit frustrated by the final and midterm, which consisted of broad essays that would have been hard to answer in a specific, thoughtful way regardless of how much I studied (in other words, I studied a lot but felt like I could have studied for a quarter of the time and still have written the same vague responses).",
    "Solid class. Took it credit\/D and I think the readings were probably a bit too long but seemed interesting. Lecture was pretty good, assignments not too bad, midterm and final totally easy if you've been going to class.",
    "Yes, though it is more work than you might think.",
    "The difficulty will depend on your TA. The lectures are interesting and light, nothing super technical or hard to understand. If you take it Cr\/D, you still have to write the 2 papers, which is a lot for a class in which you're not getting a grade.Prof. Freedman is nice and the topics are interesting. Really great guest speakers.",
    "This is a FANTASTIC course! I would highly recommend it. It is a lot of work for a history lecture class (a midterm, a paper, a very long paper and a final exam), but it is well worth it. You come away with an immense knowledge about all things food and cuisine, and a deeper understanding about how food plays a role in society and history. Professor Freedman is incredibly knowledgeable about the subject matter, and is an engaging lecturer. I really enjoyed this class. If you aren't interested in food history though, definitely don't take it, because that's all it is. I loved it, and got a lot out of it.",
    "Food and Cuisine is a wonderful class! I highly recommend it. It does have a midterm and final paper, and a midterm and final, but they're graded fairly and it does not end up feeling like a lot of work. The readings are always interesting, and section with Ryan is the best.",
    "It's a gut. You don't have to do any of the readings, but they are pretty interesting. The paper prompts are really open-ended and fun too.",
    "If you're actually a foodie, take it. If you like food and are only somewhat interested in history classes, I'm not sure I would recommend it. The readings can be long and boring and there is a lot of writing to be done, as is typical of history courses.",
    "The first half of this class is a crash course in food history from hunter gatherer days to modern cuisine. The second half of the course is a topical discussion of food -- ranging from topics such as globalization& food, religion& food, to advertising& food. Definitely take this class. Its a low stress class and you'll definitely learn something. Plus, who doesn't like food?",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. The readings are great, the subject material is most oftentimes really interesting, and it's really not too tough of a course. It was my fifth course and I really enjoyed it.",
    "I never realized how much we can learn about a society by studying the way they relate to food. I'd highly recommend this course- Paul Freedman is a fascinating lecturer and the topic is very interesting. Section is fun if you enjoy talking about food.",
    "This is an excellent course that encourages students to view food as something worthy of historical attention. Professor Freedman is great and very accessible. I truly enjoyed both the reading and the lectures and have come away from the class with a new understanding of food. Given that this was the first time the class has been offered as a lecture, it can only improve from here on. The workload is reasonable and paper topics are meant to be interesting and not laborious.",
    "Lecture twice a week, a midterm, one short paper, one research paper, and a final exam. Professor Freedman is a great lecturer, I always enjoyed listening to him. The midterm and final were reasonable, and the essay questions were broad enough so that you could draw in information from multiple lectures, which was helpful if you studied some more than others. It's a fascinating topic, I'd highly recommend taking this class.",
    "I took HIST 246 as a credit-D and really enjoyed it. I didn't do much of the work but still really enjoyed the lectures (Paul Freedman is delightful) and the readings, when I did them.",
    "This class was wonderful. It greatly broadened my perspective on food and food issues. I look at the world through a different lens now. It is not easy, though.. lots of reading, two exams, two papers.",
    "Fascinating class that has definitely changed the way I view our everyday decisions and food history. Freedman is an engaging and extremely accessible lecturer, and we covered a lot of diverse but manageable material with interesting readings.",
    "This class was really fun for me because I'm (now) a foodie. We learned a lot about restaurants, chefs, styles, national cuisines, trends, and occasionally even some history. Lots of great reading which you could do without taking this class of course, but Professor Freedman is very good at tying the sources together in lecture, perhaps making this worth it. A lot of the course is spent looking at old cookbooks, which can be a drag at first, but then you realize that if you were assigned to gobble up everything on a food-related topic, the ancient cookbookswould be your first stop.",
    "I loved this course!! I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in food\/nutrition!! I am very interested in those topics and this was such a unique course on the development of American cuisine from pre-historic times until today. I also learned so many fun facts about food revolutions, globalization, and food traditions.",
    "I would recommend Food& Cuisine, but mostly only if it's offered as a seminar. DEFINITELY TAKE IT if it's a seminar, because I think that could be incredible.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class. Paul Freedman is one of the most engaging professors I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. The reading list he put together was very interesting, though I felt it was a bit excessive at times. But that didn't even matter, because all of the readings were so fascinating!",
    "I will take a lot away from the course because I am interested in food and restaurants. Otherwise, the course was way more of a drag than I expected. Quite a lot of work, too.",
    "Yes, I think everyone who has ever thought about their food beyond a sustenance level should take this course. It is such a huge part of our lives and culture. It's fun and not a difficult class. Take it!",
    "Yes. I'm not a history major, but I never felt out of my element in this class. Food is an inherently interesting subject, and the way that this course was taught completely changed the way I look at food. I don't think I'll ever be able to eat at a restaurant or food-cart again without thinking about something Prof. Freedman said.",
    "Both papers were fun to write. A few of the readings were dry, but the larger picture painted by all of them was fascinating. Guest lectures were interesting. Midterm and final were very reasonable: essays with many prompts to choose from. Section was not at all riveting. It was a nice course to take credit\/fail. If you plan to take this for a grade, take care; grading is understandably arbitrary.",
    "Food and Cuisine could be a great class, but as it is now, the course does not have a clear focus. Outside of the unit of profiling the rise of restaurant culture and the changes to this, I felt like a lot of lectures, readings, etc. were obvious, mundane, and ordinary (e.g. industrialization of food...very obvious). There is too much reading for too little explained in it.",
    "Not exactly the class I was expecting (to which you ask, \"what were you expecting?,\" and I respond, \"honestly I have no idea\"). Very history-oriented and invested in the roots of modern cuisine both stylistically and culturally; somewhat unexpectedly I've found myself evaluating food quite differently since taking it. Certainly worth it if you're interested in food and looking to mess with your perspectives. Professor Freedman occasionally makes tremendous jokes but even when not doing so is a reliably interesting lecturer. The two papers were almost definitely the most fun I've ever had writing a paper.",
    "Would definitely recommend - a very unique angle from which to study history, and an engaging list of readings!",
    "A marvelous class. Prof. Freedman is the greatest Yale professor ever - he's a genius, and his love for the subject is irresistible. This class will forever change your perspective on food, history, and the modern world. It takes an unusual and nuanced approach to various periods and aspects of Euro-American history, with opportunities to engage with questions of health, gender, class, and politics. The workload is quite manageable, and, as I said, Prof. Freedman is fabulous in every way.",
    "Yes, this is a great, fun, and engaging class. Take it if you have any interest whatsoever in the history of food and taste.",
    "Good, fun history course. Two papers basically on the topic of your choosing, and the midterm and final are very fair. Good for non-history types. If you can take it as a seminar I think that'd be more fun, but it wasn't bad as a lecture either.",
    "Great topic. Good HU course if you need a HU credit. That said, with two papers, a midterm and a final, it's not a gut and probably not the easiest humanities credit you could find. If you want an interesting, not too time consuming HU credit though, I would recommend this class. Fair bit of reading but I would say you can get away without doing a good chunk of it. Oh, and prof Freedman is great. He's a really, really engaging lecturer -- didn't miss a single class!",
    "Fascinating and should definitely be taken. Not an easy good grade, but great material.",
    "Fairly easy class. Cram read for midterm and finals and did fine\u00e2\u0080\u0094and this is coming from a STEM kid. Class is interesting if you're into history and food culture. Lectures summarize everything in the readings, and theoretically, you could just learn the in-and-out of lectures and do very little of the readings and pull off an A. This isn't a class you should take just because you're a foodie though, you might get bored out of your mind. However, if you like gastronomy, this will definitely be an interesting course.",
    "Take this to learn about the food ways of the world, Cultural changes in food and why they happened (aristocratic views in earlier centuries changed) Learn about different time periods-- What was gourmet food in the Medieval ages? The flamboyant& extravagant! - Green coloured boar's head! \"Hedgehogs\" shaped with liver p\u00c3\u00a2t\u00c3\u00a9 with almond slices as spikes! Whether edible or not, it was the standard of the era. Take this class. With Professor Freedman's vast culinary and historical knowledge, supplemented by his own experiences and anecdotes traveling around the world, surely not to be missed.",
    "good material. Freedman's a good lecturer. not my favorite section.",
    "Fun, pretty easy class. There's a lot of emphasis placed on American dining, especially from the 1900's onwards, but the first 1\/3 of the course still covers food and cuisine from a more global, historical perspective.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. As I wrote in my review of the class, this course was great in every way possible: the material was interesting (both lectures and readings), ProfessorFreedman was accessible, the exams were not too demanding, and even section discussions were thought-provoking. Though at times the historical context seems daunting to have to memorize, the important concepts are discussed in sections so that the material is much more manageable. I'd highly recommend taking the class - you'll learn a lot of relevant and interesting information about food culture - you'll be surprised and intrigued when you learn new information about things you've looked at, taken part in, or eaten many times before.",
    "This course teaches so much you never knew you didn't know about food and cuisine. Professor Freedman is engaging, the paper topics are fun to write about, and the TFs are great. The midterm and final seemed intimidating (all essays) but they were all on familiar topics from the course.",
    "Absolutely. But be ready to do the readings though -- they only take about 1 hour before each lecture. As someone who only did them occasionally (if at all), I found that the course made much more sense and was much, much more interesting when I crammed before the midterm and final. On a sidenote, the papers were both very fun to do.",
    "Great, fun class. Prof. Freedman is a wonderfully engaging lecturer.",
    "Paul Freedman is a treasure and I definitely would recommend this class. Just watch out for incompetent TAs."
