    "Working on the acting of musical theater songs - if this is important to you, taking this class will be very useful and helpful!",
    "If you are interested in musical theater and want to learn tools for performance and\/or gain experience in music direction and coaching, than I would highly recommend this course. If you plan on pursuing a career in musical theater, than this is a class you definitely take.",
    "This is definitely one of the most important courses I've taken in my Yale career, thanks to Prof. Gerle. It was one of my first exposures to acting techniques, and Andrew was wonderfully thorough in pushing our class to craft our performances down to the final detail. Andrew is a Yale grad and knows what our Yalie mentality is: finding the right answer and delivering it. But he pushed us to accept that we do not always know the answer and to \"make big choices\" instead of shying away from the possibility of being wrong. Be brave. The course asks us to learn a lot of music, and we learned a lot more about performing, acting, auditioning, and even pursuing a career. We were also expected to do all of our prep work before class and to show up ready to perform.If you are interested in an acting class and are willing to work hard, this is a course to take. The more you put into the class, the more you take away. Take it!",
    "If you're at all interested in musical theatre (and especially if you're a Theatre Studies major), you should really consider this course. It will definitely change the way in which you approach character work and your work in the theatre as a whole.",
    "I really enjoyed this class as a practical exercise in performing musical theatre. It was primarily performing and workshopping pieces in class, but we also analyzed performances on video and did some group acting work. We sort of looked at different performance techniques and approaches throughout the semester and built upon them as we moved through different musical theatre time periods. We also wrote three papers and maintained journals about our work in and out of class. Professor Gerle is extremely knowledgeable, both in terms of acting and music, and while the majority of the students in the class were actors, he seemed to give the students with an interest in musical directing and accompanying just as much critique in those areas. He also brought in some fantastic guest lecturers. In general, this course was an excellent way to spend three hours on a Friday afternoon, and I would absolutely recommend it to students who are singers or actors and who want to do some very practical and performance-based work within a program that is prettyweighted toward the theoretical. (Additionally, there are no prerequisites, save for an audition, so it's a great way for freshmen to do some in-class acting before finishing THST110\/111)"
