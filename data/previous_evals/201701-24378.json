   "comments": [
    "Case studies include Japan, Korea, Brazil, India and China, and offers a comprehensive survey of economic development thinking from the 1940s.",
    "i learned how to use economics in a useful manner. I learned how to think about a country's economic strategy and how opinions about strategy has changed.",
    "I learned about the fundamental tenets for rapid economic growth.",
    "This course taught me how to think critically about different development strategies, and critique different academic papers."

   "comments": [
    "The prompts for assignments must be clearer. Other than that, the information is extremely interesting and well structured.",
    "A good course of application. Professor Mohan is not a professor, but he knows how things work from the inside. The material was a lot--lots and lots of reading, perhaps too much-- but I am very happy with the learning. He asked us to learn entire country's economic strategy which is extremely difficult to do in one class, but Mohan did a great job. I would like him to be more articulate about what skills he wants us to develop. I think he was focused on content, and to be a great professor I think more attention should be paid to what students need. I didn't understand the essays, even the final. I think the directions should be clearer.",
    "The primary strength is Rakesh's vast knowledge and experience that informs what he is teaching. There is no better person from whom to learn development economics. The primary weakness of the course actually lies more with the students than with the professor. During weeks when students were less prepared or had done fewer of the readings, the onus fell on the professor to speak more and fill the time, and discussion\/debate lacked as a result.",
    "The seminar setting was fitting for this course, but it could have involved more student discussion.",
    "This course is very well taught, and a real asset to the economics department, which tends to be light on development-related courses. I really enjoyed the case study approach to the course, with each week focused on a different nation."

   "comments": [
    "I would say the info in this course is extremely interesting. That being said, the Professor was seemingly quite arbitrary and unclear in his standards for assignments. If you are willing to put the time into long readings and difficult papers, then the information is well worth it.",
    "This is the classic development economics course: it's all about the macroeconomic policies that lead to growth. If you are even vaguely interested in that, absolutely take this course. It's the best economics class I've taken at Yale. Professor Mohan is supremely knowledgeable he's been applying these theories in the real world for most of his professional career and an excellent teacher. The workload is also very manageable just two short reading responses and a term paper.",
    "yes! to learn how countries developed, take this class. It gives you a framework to think about country growth and development strategy, and Mohan is a practitioner and has a good sense for how things work inside policymaking, espeicailly in India. Be aware that he isn't a professor but a practitioner. He often needed to be more articulate about directions. His seminars often ended up as lectures, but he is covering a lot of ground, so I thought it worked.",
    "Take this course if you want to learn about fundamental strategies for rapid economic growth through the lens of case studies of countries that have achieved high growth rates for a sustained period of time. The class is handles more as a small lecture than completely a discussion based seminar.",
    "Certainly. This course provides a really great in-depth look at the development strategies undertaken by a variety of nations that have experienced rapid growth. Really enjoyed the case study approach to the course."
