   "comments": [
    "Yes. Definitely take it, especially if Bob Woodward is teaching again next year!",
    "I would definitely recommend the class -- especially to anyone that harbors any dreams of becoming a journalist. You will read some truly amazing pieces of long-form reporting, and have the chance to create a long journalism project of your own.",
    "You are learning from the master. Obviously an invaluable perspective.",
    "I think it depends on your professor. If you have a chance to be taught by Bob Woodward, you're silly not to apply for it. Just remember that once you're in the class, there's still a lot of work to be done.",
    "This class is great for journalism newbies and students with reporting\/writing experience alike. It was a special treat to have Bob Woodward as an instructor -- though he had never taught a college course before, you'd never have known it from his ease as a discussion leader and his accessibility as a professor. I enjoyed the selection of articles and books we read, and the weekly response papers were a helpful way to focus our reading and our conversations. The only thing I might change would be to add more workshopping and hands-on writing instruction. Formal peer editing or two drafts of every piece due and graded by the professor would have given us more opportunities to revise and respond to feedback. But overall a wonderful class!",
    "An amazing class. If you can get in and have the chance to take it with Woodward, do it. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity.",
    "This seminar is a great way to discuss journalism with fellow students and to learn from the wisdom of a legendary journalist. You'll read a lot and write a little. If you have published pieces before and are moderately good at writing, you probably won't improve a whole lot through this class - it's not writing focused. If you have never done journalism before, you'll be thrown into a style of writing that is unfamiliar - you might flounder or you might swim. Take a lower-level intro class if you want to learn how to write - take this class if you want to talk about journalism."
