    "An excellent introduction to the technical aspects of reading poetry and the ways in which we can judge a poem to be 'good.' Stern is an amazingly passionate professor, always quite humorous in class, and listens to student input to shape the lectures and poems covered. Would recommend highly (except that he's allegedly retiring... I'd say to check back after a year!)",
    "This class is amazing. Professor Stern is the best teacher you'd ever want! He is unimaginably intelligent in different fields and brings it all into the class. I am incredibly lucky to have been under his instruction. We covered poems every week with an in depth look into a few choices. The discussions can become a bit stilted when students don't do the readings, but if Professor handled that well. If you know what's best for you, you'll do the readings and reap the rewards.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student!! Although Professor Stern will not be teaching after this semester. If you have always wished you had a greater appreciation for poetry, this is the class to take!"
