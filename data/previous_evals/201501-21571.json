    "TAKE TAKE TAKE TAKE!!! You get to watch the Walking Dead and Homeland, what more could you ask for? Dean Muller is an amazing professor and her class was such a treat after a long week",
    "take this or miss out",
    "I would definitely recommend AMST 385 to another student.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, it was a very fun time and I learned a lot.",
    "Yes! Great course; really interesting subject matter, awesome dialogue between the reading and media materials, and great professor!",
    "This class is a seminar in which much of the reading is based on the the psychological aspects of trauma and class discussions would often center on this, while the film and tv aspect would come in later. Recommended if you're interested in the films and tv shows we watch and looking for a nice seminar that isn't too hard, but not always super exciting.",
    "Great class. In the first half, read about trauma and watch an episode a week. Focus more on the tv\/film in the second half.",
    "I would recommend Trauma in American Film & TV to another student. The readings are fairly short and the TV shows\/movies we watch are incredibly interesting. Class discussions are not all that thrilling, however, as our readings could be a little dry. But overall it was a very positive experience.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course to another student. By prompting us to look at trauma through the lens of popular culture, the course allows us to reconsider the dynamics of trauma and the role popular culture plays towards allowing us to understand the phenomenon.",
    "Great intersection of Psych and American Studies--reading and viewing assignments were very interesting. Discussions sometimes got too repetitive and didn't move toward any particular point, but overall interesting and informative. Professor Muller is wonderful. Would recommend it!",
    "Good class overall. Interesting class discussion. I'm a huge TV\/Film buff so if you're not tryna watch a bunch of tv episodes and films, do not take this class. Not a lot of work at all. Definitely would recommend for a chill but also pretty interesting class.",
    "An intriguing course. Prof. Muller is a fanatastic professor. The course caters to students interested in both psychology and American Studies and the premise of the class is fantastic. We do discruss psychological trauma in depth, but the final paper is an awesome opportunity to do indpendent research on any cultural object and its relationship to trauma. It was nice to watch tv shows as homework. Do all the homework; it helps. I'd reccomend this class."
