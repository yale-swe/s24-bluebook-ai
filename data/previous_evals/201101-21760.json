    "Only if they needed it.",
    "Good class ... the LECTURE is not as good as Berry but the MATERIAL i MUCH more interesting than Micro.Great class and good knowledge that EVERYONE should know about how markets work (especially in our current economy)",
    "Definitely, it is the best course I've taken so far at Yale. My only reservation is that the material at the end of the term is not completely covered.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to. Not worth it.",
    "I would only recommend it because it is a requirement for Econ. majors. Other than that, the class was just so disorganized and dysfunctional that from time to time I left the lecture feeling like I hadn't learned anything other than contemporary economic news.I learned more from the book than the lectures.",
    "I would recommend this class to everyone, no matter what you are planning to major in or how much you know about Macroeconomics and Financial Markets. Things you learn in this class will explain a lot about what is currently happening in the global economy as well as on the world political arena.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone with an interest in economics and the way markets work.",
    "I think that this is one of the few classes that everyone should take in order to understand more fully the consequences of one's actions. It's helpful to understand fiscal and monetary policy in general, from voting to applying what is learned to an individual level. The class isn't too time consuming; the lecture setting isn't dull; and the concepts aren't too hard to understand.",
    "Strengths: teaches basic macroeconomicsWeaknesses: lectures are not very helpful. He goes off on many tangents. Does not hold the attention of students.",
    "Kind of boring, and not taught very well. I would recommend it with caution to some students, but not freely. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone who is not considering an econ major, and even with that I would be wary.",
    "If Smith is teaching the course, be prepared for some boring lectures at the 2nd half of the semester. The Mankiw book was great and made studying really easy. If you can, take it with a different professor, but if Smith is still teaching, be prepared for exam questions that don't really test the obvious points of the lesson.You will learn a lot about macro, just through the book.",
    "Take it if you're really interested in the subject. I've heard that first semester has a worse lecture but the curve is easier so if you just need this class for a credit or as a prereq, then take it first semester.",
    "It is an important class if you want to learn more about how the world economy works- really relevant for any student.",
    "Yes! What you need to know about how the world works.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you are interested in Econ. If you're just taking it because you think you should take an Econ class at some point, maybe consider credit D because it's not an easy class at all. I took Econ for 3 years in high school and was on a competitive Econ team and I am still not at the top of the class.",
    "Take it if you want to learn macroeconomics, but read the book because lectures are not comprehensive at all.",
    "Yes I would. definitely. It helps me understand so much more of the economics of the world I'm living in. I feel like every one should at least take this basic macroeconomics class to make sense of the world they live in.",
    "Take it if you want to learn macroecon, its not too hard.",
    "I think you should take it! You'll learn a lot, but don't expect to get an A if you don't read the ENTIRE book + work really hard on the psets and etc. You'll come out feeling really good about yourself :) You will hear a lot about Krugman because Smith is obsessed with him.",
    "Yes, if you are thinking about a major in econ, macro is a great course!",
    "Course is really interesting, especially because of its applications to the financial market. However, be prepared to learn a lot of the material yourself.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "Not too hard, the midterms were a little ambigious at times but overall ok",
    "Great course, take the lecture (especially if you need it for a major)",
    "A decent introductory macro course. Prof. Barron was a bit disorganized at times and the end of the course was rushed, but on the whole, it was pretty interesting and pretty well-taught. Prof. Barron was very in tune with what he had taught and assigned in terms of problem sets and tests. The tests were fair, but graded pretty harshly in terms of partial credit. The final was tough but not impossible. The problem sets took about 2 hours, for the most part.",
    "The course itself is interesting, but maybe take it with a different, more organized professor.",
    "If you're considering an Econ major, take it. Otherwise, I would advise against it. It was a fairly boring class, although you do learn a considerable amount of relevant information.",
    "Probably better than the seminar, but honestly Econ dept intro courses just aren't great here.",
    "If you want to learn about unemployment, inflation, GDP, etc. and also some useful information about finance--what do banks do, stocks, bonds, derivatives...take this. Tony Smith is okay, but pretty disorganized and all over the place. Make sure you have Angry Birds on your phone.",
    "I would recommend this course, but with caution. I enjoyed the course because of the amazing textbook and riveting material that we covered that included topics on financial markets and the recent financial crisis. The book is exceptionally well-written and easy to understand, especially for someone who is new to economics and finance. The part of the course that I didn't like were the lectures. Overall they were just not comprehensive and seemed random and unplanned. Professor Smith focuses way too much on the technology he uses and wastes valuable class time figuring out how to play a movie on You Tube or pull up a blog on the internet. We got so behind by the time the final rolled around that I felt very overwhelmed and frustrated. Also, people stopped going to lecture by the end of the course, which shows that many people thought Professor Smith's teaching was pointless, since most of the information could be learned more easily and comprehensively by just reading the textbook.",
    "This class has good information, however, the lectures are horrible. I recommend just do the readings in the book and you don't need to go to lecture.",
    "I honestly think every Yalie should take this class before graduating. You cannot really understand the world or the U.S. without understanding the fundamentals of macroeconomic theory.",
    "Intro to Macro is the typical general level economics course- yes the information can be very interesting as it relates to the economy today, but some of it is pretty dry. I would definitely recommend this course over the macro seminar because it involves much less math and is more relaxed. The curve and the exams are pretty fair as well.",
    "Take it if you liked Micro a lot and are willing to spend some time before exams going through the book.",
    "Econ 116 is a great start to an econ major or for anyone who wants to know what is relevant in the economy today. I would absolutely recommend.",
    "I would recommend it only if you are interested in the major. Do not take it if you are simply looking for an interesting course. It does, however, help you understand macroeconomic data and reports.",
    "I would recommend Econ 116 if you need to take macro - don't know why anyone would take an intro macro course just for fun, though! Took it as a senior and found it much better than the micro course I had taken before, and also far better than the previous instructor in this course - I sat in other years and fell asleep. Anthony Smith explained things clearly and not like he was emerging from a coma. For the econ dept, I would count that as a win!The material itself is relevant to understanding financial systems and the recent economic crisis.",
    "I would recommend Econ 116 to another student if they need to take for one of their majors. Tony Smith is better than Ray Fair and other Econ professors, so its worth taking it with Smith. A problem set every week, 2 midterms and a final. Fairly basic econ course. Macro is definitely easier than micro.",
    "a great class to take however the teaching was terrible.",
    "It's a tough question because the only other option is the seminar which I heard isn't that great either. If you want to learn more, take the seminar. Just be aware that this class is not a walk in the park, as the midterms were very tricky and the people grading them were really really harsh.",
    "I would recommend this course for everyone.",
    "In this class you will learn about the macroeconomy as a whole. You will understand what GDP is, you will understand how the Great Recession happened, you will understand how banks work, and you will see how various things can shift the economy. It is not that math based, relying more on theories. The textbook is more like a history book than a math book.",
    "This was a good, relatively easy class. Lectures were very unfocused and all over the place but problems sets were usually pretty simple and the the material we covered was interesting and related well to current events. Overall, I would recommend it as an interesting, low stress class.",
    "If you are looking for the worst taught class at Yale, look no farther! Intro to macroecon taught by Professor Smith is the most painful lecture class I have ever taken. Professor Smith spends most of his time trying to figure out how to use his computer and showing us random economics blogs or news articles that only vaguely relate to the material we are covering. Make sure to get a good TA because otherwise the only way you will actually gain any knowledge of macroeconomics from this class is through the textbook (which is actually pretty good). I have never seen a class where so many people fall asleep. If you are freshman, try as hard as you can to get a seminar with Sigga (Alonso is even worse than Smith). It's a shame that the economics departments fills its intro classes with such horrible professors.Do NOT take this class unless you have to (for Econ, Global Affairs, EP&E, etc). There are way too many well-taught classes at Yale to waste your time with a professor who does not even prepare for his lectures.",
    "I would recommend the class for students who will take time to do the extra work needed outside of class to truly grasp the material. Reading the textbook is essential and informative.",
    "Much more interesting than Micro! Professor Smith is usually interesting and the textbook is great.",
    "It's intro macro-- you sort of know what to expect. Do the reading. Prof. Smith is a good lecturer, take it with him.",
    "lectures are boring, professor smith is okay",
    "The course was overall very good. The textbook was fantastic and I really learned a lot. The material is very interesting. Professor Smith was a good lecturer. Sometimes he got carried off on tangents of little relevance to the course material, but he was a very likeable guy who was always prone to crack a few jokes. You probably don't have to go to all of the lectures in order to do well, but you definitely have to read the book, which you should do anyway. Good class overall.",
    "This is a worthwhile course if you get the right professor. I had heard terrible things about the class from my friends, but I found it great with Prof. Smith. He's very approachable and shows how interesting the subject actually is. Watch out if someone else is teaching it though.",
    "Unless you really like macro, I wouldn't recommend this class. It's a bit boring and everything you learn is basically from the book.",
    "I recommend this class if you plan on being an econ major or if you need it for your major. Otherwise, it is pretty hard and not very interesting",
    "ECON 116 was a very difficult course. Anthony Smith is not a good professor. Everything I learned came from reading the textbook. The lectures were not helpful and did not reinforce the readings. Also, little partial credit is given on the exams which makes it very difficult to receive a good score.",
    "Professor Smith failed to cover core materials in the lectures because he kept talking about recent financial crises and \"interesting\" articles. They were somewhat helpful, but I feel like we could have made a better use of the time. We did most of the exam prep by reading the textbook (which is very helpful) not by listening to his lectures. But I guess you don't have any better choice, because I heard that Professor Ray Fail is also not very good.",
    "This class is good for less intense students.",
    "A class that introduces you to broad macro concepts. Yes--you will learn what you want to learn.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to learn about econ.",
    "A tough class with difficult long problem sets. the tests arent too hard but the problem sets take awhile and are pretty challenging. Its quite boring at first but gets more interesting.",
    "If you want to do Intro Macro do it with Smith.",
    "Good class overall. I would recommend it because it is needed if you want to be an econ major and it does a good job showing the broad scope of government's control of the economy. Now, when things happen in the news concerning the economy, I can actually understand what is going on.",
    "Ugh.",
    "A general overview of the macroeconomy. I would recommend it. In the light of the current economic situation in the US, it is particularly interesting and allowed me to understand what is going on in a way that I didn't before.",
    "Interesting class and cool material but Tony Smith is not a good professor. He cannot keep on task and then wondered why everyone didn't come to class. The book was really good for the class, read it. It was a substitute for lecture because of the poor teaching, which it shouldn't be.",
    "No. There are no good intro teachers, though, so fend for yourself.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in economics and I promise it is much better than micro. I've heard that the introductory courses for economics are usually very abstract and theoretical but I thought that the information we learned in macro is actually quite useful. Take the lecture with Smith if possible- he is much better than the instructors teaching the seminars!",
    "If you're going to major in Economics, you're going to take this class. Its alright. Its just an average class. The lectures are a little boring, but you can skip a few and you'll be alright. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who doesn't need it for a prerequisite, as it isn't an extremely good or life-changing class. But if you need to take it, its really not that bad, and the workload is only moderate.",
    "Unless you need to take this class for a major I woud not reccomend taking it. There are other classes at Yale that will be more worth your time.",
    "AWFUL. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL.",
    "Not recommended with Professor Smith though the course is probably an important basic course to take.",
    "I would only take this class if you want to be an econ major. The work load is not impossible but the midterms and final are pretty difficult.",
    "Smith isn't an especially great lecturer (or even an especially good one), but the material was really interesting and I thought the book was especially good. Skip lecture and learn from the book.",
    "Macro is inherently more interesting than micro, because its applications to the real world are more obvious. I got a lot out of the course, but not from going to lecture - we happened to have a great textbook, and the time I devoted to reading it was well-spent. Professor Smith often did not use the time in lecture well, and had trouble explaining difficult concepts.",
    "I shopped intro macro with another instructor last semester and I was happy to take it with Professor Smith.",
    "Absolutely take this class. You will feel like a better person coming out from it-you will be more knowledgeable about the US economy and will understand the news (NYT, WSJ) better. The teaching was very clear-Professor Smith is great and very entertaining. The textbook was also very readable. As it and the course include the recent financial crisis, it is very relevant and current. The problem sets are fairly straightforward, as are the exams. Definitely take this class with Professor Smith if you can!",
    "Macroecon with Prof. Smith started with the fundamentals of the macroeconomy and moved into the financial system and analyzing the recent financial crisis. I thought the current events material was especially interesting and pertinent. A very good class overall; the textbook is pretty good.",
    "If you're just looking for an insight into how an economy works, this class ticks all the boxes",
    "NO!!! DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS...",
    "good intro to macro",
    "Every week there is some reading (one or two chapters) and a problem set that takes about one or two hours to complete. Macro is a difficult subject to understand, especially in the beginning of the course when we learn about interest rates, which are very important to understanding the course.",
    "This course offers a good introduction to basic macroeconomic models and parts of the financial system. It was best during the weeks covering the IS-LM model: problem sets and midterms asked interesting questions and required rewarding applications.Problem Sets and tests during other weeks were not as good. I often felt their questions were beside the point (tedious exercises with excel and number-punching).In addition, lectures were rarely helpful. Because they moved slowly and were without a clear line of argument, most of us had trouble paying attention. While I appreciated Prof. Smith's attempts to present relevant current events and data, these parts of class were not planned carefully and so moved terribly slowly. I, and most of my friends in the class, learned mostly by reading the very good textbook.The last units on the financial system did not succeed. I understand that Prof. Smithwas teaching this material for the first time. Nonetheless, lectures, problem sets, and readings presented nothing resembling a coherent curriculum. We spent lots of time studying financial terminology in the textbook, which in turn never appeared on a final or problem set. This unit has much to offer, but it really needs more work before students will get anything out of it.Lastly, I was really disappointed to spend so little time on the Solow Growth Model and other long-term growth topics. I wish Prof. Smith had been better organized and not shoved such an important topic into 75 minutes of lecture.",
    "Very OK economics course. Not terrible, but after a while you realize how much (or little) you're actually getting out of the 75 minutes, and you start sleeping through the class. even though it's at 1pm.Also, do some TA shopping at the beginning of the semester to find a good one.",
    "Take it if you have to, otherwise, there are probably less painful ways to learn about something purely out of interest.",
    "If youre taking it, its probably because you have to. If tony smith is teaching the course, try to get into the seminar, i dont care how bad the reviews are. while the seminars may be slightly more difficult, you will actually learn the material.",
    "I would recommend this class, but only if you have an established interest in econ and are prepared to teach yourself much of the material. Econ 116's greatest strengths were the material and the textbook. The book was the most helpful tool in the course; much more helpful than the lecture, especially at the end of the semester. Professor Smith was often all over the place and distracted, and I had no idea what the main concepts of his lecture were. He started off much stronger, but definitely became much worse when we started learning about financial systems.",
    "This is a pretty straightforward intro econ class. I would recommend that everyone take it because it's something everyone should have a basic knowledge over.",
    "No, unless you will be able to take more econ courses. You get some good basic knowledge, but I do not think it is worth the sacrifice of another class that could be informative AND engaging. The horrifying reviews from previous years are true. Read the book and the NY times a few times a week if you can commit to it.But yeah, I think Tony Smith is better than Ray Fair.",
    "If you're going to take Intro Macro, take it with Smith! I really enjoyed the class. The material was interesting. He made the class pretty interesting with his youtube videos, blog sites, and graphs\/charts. The work load was very manageable- problem sets, 2 midterms, and a final. Make sure you read the book though since a lot of the details don't get covered in class.",
    "Interesting subject material. Poorly taught. Do not take this class unless it's for your major.",
    "I would say it is a comprehensive intro to macroeconomics. Gives one an idea of what the subject truly entails. I recommend it to everyone.",
    "This class can be interesting and can be a good introduction to later courses in the economics major. But the lecture is too big for anyone to take much out of it. Exam formats have been nebulous until final. The problem sets are not hard and the textbook is good. Definitely find a good TA if you want to take this class.",
    "Pretty dry intro class. Good information and interesting material sometimes, but just choose your section wisely.",
    "Yes but not with Professor Smith.",
    "Based on the reviews of this class from previous years, Smith has improved it a lot. He is quite clear when he explains things, though he does get off track, and the material is overall interesting. Worth taking.",
    "Take it if you want to learn about macroeconomics.",
    "the material is worth learning, but the class is not very well-structured",
    "Bleh.",
    "I would recommend the class, it is an introduction into many of the topics that dominate the news. The basics of the economy and finance make reading the newspaper easier and you understand more of how the world works.",
    "Good introduction to the study of Macroeconomics and to continue in your economics career, you'll have to take it. Not great, but I did learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Take it if you want to do Econ major or something similar that requires it as prerequisite. I\u0092m not sure if the seminar is absolutely than the lecture, but as far as I could see, you should be prepared for a pretty negative lecture experience at Prof. Smith\u0092s class. If you can do self-study pretty well, you may probably be fine, since most of the materials mentioned in the lecture, which he doesn\u0092t explain quite clearly, are clearly written in the textbook.",
    "Yes. As far as introductory lecture courses go, very good.Problem sets and exams very manageable.Professor does a great job of applying the course to current issues, so the material was highly relevant and engaging.",
    "It is necessary for other econ courses, so I would recommend you to take it to be able to take other classes.",
    "I would recommend this for any econ majors.",
    "Yes, take it because it is extremely important to understand this material, but if you don't care about having taken the actual course, but rather just learning the material, just purchase the textbook and read it; nothing else really helps that much.",
    "Yes I would recommend that every Yale student take this course at some point in their four years, probably earlier rather than later as the stuff you learn will be immediately relevant to the budget talks and economic issues facing our country and will remain relevant for the foreseeable future. Macroeconomics is actually a fascinating subject as it deals with things that affect us so deeply. Without a strong macroeconomic framework it is difficult to write papers, think about the world, or participate in enlightening conversations. Take this laid-back course but take it because you're interested as well. Take that attitude and you will enjoy it.",
    "Yes, it is good to take even if you are not an Econ major. The concepts in 116 are applicable in many ways to world affairs, and you need to know them to be an educated person. Professor Smith is nice and the class is well run. The grading on the exams can be kind of harsh, especially compared with 115.",
    "Prerequisite for the Economics major, so most of you have to take it. Take it with Prof Smith if you can, he is good. I also recommend it for non-econ majors as it is very applicable to life - much more so than Intro Micro.",
    "Econ 116 covers basic macroeconomic concepts - aggregate consumption, investment, changesin interest rates, economic growth, as well as short-term economic fluctuations, including booms and busts, and the financial system, including bonds, stocks, securities, derivatives. Overall, I really enjoyed this course, as it helped me to understand a lot of current economic and financial news that I previously would have no clue about. Professor Smith is generally a good instructor, although he sometimes went through material too slowly, with the result that we had to rush through stuff in the last 2-3 weeks of the semester.",
    "This class was TERRIBLE. Professor Smith tries his best to be funny, but he is the WORST professor I have had at Yale. His grading is extremely unfair and the exams very unpredictable. He provided no previous test questions or practice exams, and very little guidance for studying. I taught myself almost everything from the book. This class was WAY more stressful than it should have been (as well as extremely boring) and I regret not dropping it. Try to avoid Prof. Smith if possible - he is the reason I am no longer an Economics major.",
    "The best say I heard this semester: \"If I was taking this class Credit-D, Professor Smith would be really funny\" --->True, but I was not taking the class Credit-D. We are not in the class to read blogs. He tried too hard to be cool. He is a very nice guy and had good intentions, though. But it really didn't work out. Problems sets were fair, the midterms were easy and the final was harder. The textbook is helpful. If Kieran Walsh is TAing next semester, do your best and get him. You can actually learn the subject in the sections. Lectures were boring as hell!",
    "Yes, you will learn important things to know about and important aspect of society and how it works.",
    "I thought it was a pretty terrible class. Professor goes on lots of random tangents in class and I didn't feel that class time was very productive. I think you'll probably do better if you spend the time reading the textbook.That said, I think it's important to understand macroeconomics, whether you want to take more econ or not, and I don't think the seminar is much better.",
    "Pretty standard intro macro class; interesting material (especially the financial markets stuff at the end) and definitely relevant to current issues. However, Smith isn't the best lecturer and the whole class seems to be organized rather inefficiently.",
    "This is how the world works - learn about it!",
    "This course is pretty boring and you don't get much out of the lecture. Take it with friends.",
    "Take it because it's a good class to have taken, but hope there's a different teacher.",
    "Good overview course of macroeconomics that is not too difficult. I would suggest it if it is a requirement for your major or if you have a strong interest in economics.",
    "This is not a difficult class and I think anybody interested in reading the newspaper should take it.",
    "If you gotta take it, then take it. If just curious, try the smaller classes instead of this big lecture.",
    "Solid intro class for a great major. Worth one's time and efforts.",
    "ECON 116 is your basic introduction to macroeconomics. You can learn a lot in this course, but you really have to study the material on your own. The lectures feel really long (as expected for a 75-minute lecture), but the information is a lot more understandable if you read the textbook beforehand. If you don't, expect to be bored, asleep, or endlessly confused. Professor Smith is a good lecturer. His enthusiasm for his subject is evident but he is not a charismatic lecturer so you really have to try hard to pay attention. I do feel like this course is a bit disorganized and Professor Smith can be frustrating in his indecisiveness on what material is covered on the test. This leads to many hours studying things that were not covered in class, and not tested on...Overall, good if you like macroeconomics, but shy away if you don't.",
    "ECON 116 is helpful in understanding macroeconomics, but the size of the lecture distracts from the material. It is easy not to focus in class, so I would suggest taking a look at the macroeconomic seminars while making a decision. With that said, Professor Smith is very knowledgeable. He tries to make class fun by incorporating rap songs, videos, and articles. The pace of the class was slow at times due to these extras or due to discussing graphs, but this often was illuminating. I also had a great TF who went out of his way to explain questions I had (Scott Murdock). In short, I am happy for what the class has taught me, but the class itself could have been improved.",
    "Comprehensive overview of the basics of macroeconomics. Smith tends to be an interesting lecturer although sometimes goes off on drawn-out tangents. Staying on task is not one of Smith's strengths.He's really good however at combining diverse materials into the course including PowerPoint, videos, and data from the Federal Reserve. He's also a very approachable person and is more than willing to go over material.Exams are pretty fair and the textbook is superb although a bit on the expensive side. There is a section that he expects you to attend--it's 50 min in addition to the 2.5 hours of lecture per week--although TFs don't take attendance. Problem sets are reasonable and designed for team work.Also on the positive side of things, Smith takes all his (thorough) lecture notes on a tablet PC so all you need to do is show up to class and listen and the notes will be on classes v2.",
    "The material is so much more interesting that Introductory Microecon, however getting through the lectures might be tougher. You will definitely have to do the textbook readings yourself to keep up with the class. If you do these readings, you should be fine.",
    "I would recommend it because it helps you understand important aspects of the world today.",
    "It's an intro Econ class. Tony Smith does a fine job teaching. The quality of your experience in your class is directly proportional to your own interest in the material, so don't take it if you feel like you should, but do take it if you're genuinely interested.",
    "Macro isn't a particularly challenging course, although it's also not the most exciting of courses either. Smith clearly cares about the class, but he's not the best lecturer. This means you'll have to put in some time independently to learn the material. Basically, if you work hard, you should do well.",
    "Big class, sometimes dreary lectures, but interesting material when you read the textbook. The curve is both helpful and hard because some kids legitimately do not get anything wrong.",
    "Its a good class with an average ammount of work. It's very interesting though",
    "If you want to major in econ take it but it is neither interesting nor particularly easy.",
    "I feel like Intro Macro is such an interesting topic, but Prof. Smith somehow made the topic so bland and boring. He tried to incorporate modern economic events, which was cool, but when he explained graphs and major concepts it was just so boring. And he spent so much time on online databases of economic data, which was interesting for 5 minutes and then just repetitively boring. He just had trouble explaining things - had difficulty articulating concepts which made it really frustrating.",
    "This is a worthwhile course to take if you would like a basic understanding of the economy and trends that have occurred in the 20th century.",
    "Economics 116 is probably the better option for taking Intro Macro - or so I've heard. It's a very good class generally with good lectures that link into the real world. I would definitely recommend Econ 116 to another student.",
    "I really enjoyed the material of the course, and the textbook (Mankiw and Ball, Macroeconomics andthe Financial System) was great. However, Professor Smith was a horrible lecturer. His lectures were disorganized, and he spent lots of time talking about simple concepts while glossing over and not explaining difficult concepts fully. Also, his problem sets were mostly based on number-crunching and did not help reinforce the concepts or provide a good preparation for the questions on the exams.",
    "Economics 116 introduces students to the fundamentals of economic theory on the national and global scale. The course covers large scale supply and demand, Keynesian economic theory, and basic information on financial institutions.",
    "It's a great introduction to macroeconomics, but if you want to really learn the material, prepare to be independent. The lectures\/sections will only give you part of what you need to learn the material, and most of what you need is in the books.",
    "It's a good course and Prof. Smith can make the material very interesting. While it is true that the lectures were not the most organized I've had at Yale, and notes-taking can be difficult sometimes, the lectures give important information and should not be missed!10 problem sets, 2 midterms + a final, no papers",
    "Take it if you are looking to major in the course. The lectures weren't very interesting, but they often did help explain the material in the course book.",
    "was a bit boring but i'd say its worth taking",
    "Take it Cr\/D to gain literacy in macroeconomics. Smith is a terrible lecturer, and most of the questions on his problem sets have zero relevance to what you will see on the exams.",
    "Great if you like econ.Not great if you don't like econ.If you want to be an econ major you have to take this course anyway (unless you took AP Macro in high school)--so why am I even answering this question?",
    "Econ 116 is a good introduction to the simpler macroeconomic models and ideas that are quite relevant in everyone's daily lives. But the class itself is slightly disorganized and the work tedious. If you're an Econ Major, I guess you have no choice, but if you're not, I suggest you buy the book and read it yourself, because the lectures don't really add much to it.",
    "large lecture course, though office hours are offered, so not as much interaction as would be liked",
    "If you have to take it, you will. If not, you won't. But this is stuff that most everyone should know.",
    "yes. gives basic understanding of economy and is a must for everyone.",
    "Some people really like Prof Smith, some people doesn't like his teaching style. I liked his class and I'm glad I sticked with the lecture instead of the seminars. But you should attend one lecture and one seminar and decide which one you like better. The evaluations for intro econ classes are so conflicting that they can't help anyone.",
    "I'd definitely recommend taking Macro class because it's very useful. But reading the book might suffice",
    "Macroecomics is a good class with an interesting subject matter and decent (but not great) teaching. Professor Smith is great about posting class notes and study aids online but is not the most engaging lecturer. The book is very good but very expensive so buy a used copy or rent an electronic version online.",
    "Yes if you are interested in Economics. More useful and interesting than Micro.",
    "Professor Smith was very good at the technical aspects of the class like getting Pset info and grades out efficiently, and also providing TAs with material to make section more effective. The lectures weren't quite as awe-inspiring as the book, but I would say he was also good at drawing directly from them in writing exams. Professor Smith was not the best with actual technology, which would often eat up class time, but I feel like that's less important than these other factors.The exams were stressful because we had no practice exams, but I think that's mostly because we were using this book for the first time.Overall, I wouldsay it's more interesting but also more difficult than it sounds. Way more real-life examples than micro.",
    "Intro Macro is a good course that covers topics every student should be familiar with. The textbook was amazing. Lectures were not at all focused, and wasted way too much time on current events, digression, and technical difficulties. This was a shame, as Prof Smith was very good at explaining the more difficult concepts, and had he spent more time on those subjects the course would have been much clearer. Also, the last part of the course became very rushed, which made it difficult to do well on those p-sets and that portion of the final. Take it if you want to be able to understand financial\/fiscal issues."
