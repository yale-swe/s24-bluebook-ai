    "Yes, I would recommend this class! One of the best art classes I have taken. You will make beautiful work! Though, beware the time commitment.... ! I would not necessarily recommend for a senior who is interested in having a relaxing last semester (unless this is one of three classes). Make sure you get to class early& finish your projects ahead of time so you do not run into problems of supplies running out or overcrowding in the shop. You will probably have to buy supplies outside of the $150 art fee. And it is DEFINITELY worth it to buy your own screen (~$50) rather than mess around reclaiming one; or to do both, as when you do 4-color process separation having two screens to burn will make your life much easier!",
    "You should take this class if you are ready to learn a new medium in a setting that is healing and zen-like. It is a wonderful course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I would say that someone with more of a background in the arts would benefit the most from it, although it would be enjoyable for any student. It is more of a time commitment than it seems to be at first, because you will need to come in for quite a few studio hours outside of class (although the number varies depending in how ambitious you are with your projects). It also requires you to plan out your time ahead, because students have very limited access to the print shop outside of class.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to everyone. Especially, those students that are like me and are non-art majors and have taken Basic Drawing and Painting and are looking for another Art class to take at Yale. It is a decent amount of work, but its fun work and you learn a lot.",
    "Yes, just plan ahead because monitor hours are annoying.",
    "Yes, I would recommend silkscreening. It's a great course to learn a new skill and apply it to your own practice.",
    "Absolutely. It teaches a valuable skill that anyone can learn and employ in other fields."
