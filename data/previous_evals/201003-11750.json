   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class. Not much work, instructor is chill, and reading isn't necessary all the time.",
    "Only if you're really interested, I guess. I thought it got a little slow into the semester.",
    "Great class to take, esp. if you're Catholic. Prof. Eire does a great job explaining really complicated texts, and it's fun to learn about history that not many people know much about. The grading is very fair and if you study, you can get a good grade. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "If you are interested in the history of the early church, this is a great class. Professor Eire's lectures were always interesting. The reading load is pretty intense, however, it is not necessary to do all of the reading every week in order to do well in the class.",
    "This class is a great combination of history, theology, and sociology, accessible to anyone regardless of background knowledge. Professor Eire is fantastic and the readings are generally interesting. The workload is sizeable but not overwhelming: lots of reading, but a few basic bluebook midterms and a book review at the end. I would definitely recommend the class to anyone, whether they think they're interested in the subject matter or not.",
    "This was a good class. Not great, but quite good. It was a subject I knew nothing about and was very glad to discover. It had a good mixture of theology and history. It got a little tedious towards the middle of the semester, when all the theologians seemed to be debating the same petty issues, but it picked up again when the Crusades came along. Professor Eire is a good lecturer. He held my attention well. Though he was rarely exciting, he always made the issues at hand interesting, and I very much enjoyed listening to his lectures. There's nothing spectacular here, but I'm glad to have taken the class. I learned a lot about something entirely new, and it was very entertaining. There's a fair amount of reading--it starts out very slowly, but picks up. But the tests are pretty manageable, and, in general, there's not a huge amount of work.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to someone who is interested in specific histories and cares about learning about religion.",
    "Very similar to Paul Freeman\/Anders Winroth's medieval history classes, read a lot of the same material. There is a lot of dense reading, but that is the only challenging part of the class, other work is easy. Very interesting, especially for anyone Catholic, interested in medieval lit or history. Although as someone who has already studied this period in depth, I found the survey-style lecture pretty broad, but Prof. Eire provides a good bibliography if you're interested in learning more. Prof. Eire is funny and entertaining. Can't wait for second semester.",
    "An excellent survey course into the development of Christian (and Western) thought. Eire is a great teacher, and the material is incredibly important historically, even though it's the sort of thing many people (myself included prior to taking the course) knew nothing about.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "Professor Eire is AMAZING and the material is interesting, but beware the reading; if long theological texts from fourth century don't sound appealing in any way, reconsider taking this class.",
    "This is an excellent course introducing early Christianity. Do not let the \"Catholic\" title turn you away if you are interested in Christianity more generally, as the first 1,000 years of the Catholic Church are basically the first 1,000 years of Christianity. There is a lot of discussion of the East as well, so Orthodoxy is at least partially covered. The only thing that was *really* a problem with this class was that there was not enough time on exams, which means that they were more an evaluation of how fast you can regurgitate facts than how much you know.",
    "A good course, with excellent material, but it could have been better. Too much focus on intellectual history\/Church fathers and not enough on what was going on in the ancient world at the time. In other words, the readings were low on historical narrative. More of the recommended reading, which contains such things as biographies and secondary histories, should have been required. Eire is a good lecturer and the tests are easy.",
    "This course gives a great overview of the first millenium of Catholicism. History majors should keep in mind that it is cross-listed with Religious Studies and thus it is as much a history of the evolution of theology of the Church as of the actors and politics of the church. Thus, some of the readings can be a bit dense, but never terribly long. There are two midterms, a five page book review, and a final so there are plenty of chances to mess up one of the assignments and have your grade bounce back. It wasn't the most interesting lecture I've taken in the history department, but nor was it the most boring. If you want to understand the material, it is a useful course. If you are a Catholic or Episcopalian, you will find yourself understanding nuances in the mass that you never noticed before, so in that sense, it is really cool and useful.",
    "This course is great - professor Eire is really engaging. There is a lot of reading, but generally it's interesting.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "A great overview of the development of Catholicism. Take it.",
    "One of my favorite classes I've taken. A great chance to read primary sources that you've wanted to read but never had the time to. Carlos Eire is a fantastic lecturer, and his expertise and knowledge shine through during lecture. Not that much work, exams aren't too difficult. I would thoroughly recommend it.",
    "An excellent course to take if you know more recent history than past history of Catholicism. Three exams, not cumulative.",
    "I would highly recommend Hist 200 with Prof Eire. The reading can at times can be rather excessive (though, thisis coming from a science major) and studying for the tests a bit tedious but overall the course was quite enjoyable and the material is very valuable for Catholics and non-Catholics alike.",
    "YES take it. Particularly if you are interested in Catholicism or religion. Lots of cool topics.",
    "Good course. Professor Eire is great. Not too much work. The reading seems overwhelming, but you don't have to do it all to do well in the course. I would definitely recommend it to anyone curious about the origins and development of Catholicism.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, whether or not they're Catholic. It really surveys the beginnings of Western Civilization and provides good insight into the current state of the Church. There's quite a bit of reading, but the list includes some of the great works of Western literature.",
    "I would highly recommend it but would warn that the reading gets a little heavy with so many full volumes and books we're supposed to read during the course.",
    "I really loved this course and that's all thanks to Professor Eire. He is a thoughtful and informative lecturer, one of those great professors that make your Yale experience. I'm not Catholic and had no previous interest in the subject, but Professor Eire made the class very interesting.There are three exams (including the final), all weighted equally. There's also a short (5-6 pg.) paper. Just some words of wisdom for the exams: for the passage analyses, make sure you identify the author and text!! Professor Eire said in class that it's ok to just write down the type of text (ex: gnostic), but that's really not true and it'll really hurt your grade. Even if you're not sure if you have the right author\/text, a guess gets more points than just writing the type of text. For the essay, Professor Eire will often pose many questions within the prompt. It's not physically possible to answer all of them, so don't even try. Just write an essay addressing the main topic\/prompt.",
    "This class had to cover approximately a century per week. Although there are a lot of particulars you will miss in a survey course like this, it will fill in many gaps in your knowledge, even if you are pretty familiar with Catholic history. I am so glad we got to read a lot of primary sources. This is stuff that you don't really get to read every day, and it's wonderful to study the works of the Church Fathers. Definitely take it; you get a good taste of the actual substance of Catholicism that you don't necessarily get if you only study it from a historical perspective.",
    "This course is rarely taught; if you have the opportunity to take it with Prof. Eire, do so. You will encounter major theological and philosophical texts that are generally ommitted from undergraduate courses. This course makes an excellent sequel to Directed Studies, as it fills in some of the medieval period that is partially leapt over by the DS sequence.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Carlos Eire is amazing, and the subject matter is really interesting.",
    "This is a really interesting class, giving a wide overview of the first 1000 years or so of Christian history, with a lot of emphasis on primary sources. The first 500 years are the ones emphasized, and you skip a lot of the middle ages.",
    "It's the History of Catholicism from Jesus to the Crusades. I would definitely recommend it, especially if you're interested in Catholicism or if you're Catholic yourself. Catholicism and Western culture are inextricably intertwined, as Carlos Eire explains.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to students both in and outside the History major. It explains the history of the Catholic Church and the history of much of Western world too.",
    "This was an excellent course. The material was interesting, the tests were fair, and Professor Eire is great. Take this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to others. If you're Catholic you will learn a lot from this class, especially since Carlos Eire is Catholic and has some interesting insights into Catholic theology. Most of the course's readings are primary documents, which are interesting. There can be a lot of reading every week though. Section is valuable in condensing the sometimes difficult material. The exams are pure memorization, and a lot is expected out of you in 50 minutes (4 terms, two quotes, and an essay). Overall, itwas a great lecture course.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the subject. Professor Eire is grear but its a ton of reading",
    "Great lectures. Long readings. Definitely recommend only if you are interested in the subject matter.",
    "Catholicism in the 1st Millennium is a great class, and Carlos Eire is a fabulous professor. The lectures are interesting and the workload is manageable, take it if you're interested in the material!"
