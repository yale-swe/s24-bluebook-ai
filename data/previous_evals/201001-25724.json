    "This class is a half credit class. It is meant as a supplement (concurrently) to music 210 or 211. Apart from the two 50-minute classes per week, there is also a half-hour keyboard lab once a week where you learn and play figured bass exercises with a different grad student instructor. These exercises have a single-voice bassline with numbers above like 6, 5, 3, 4, etc. which tell you what kind of chord to play.The class portion has no homework other than to practice and study for quizzes. However, I barely did any practicing or studying outside of class since class is all practice. There is really no theory lecturing in class; it is almost purely practice. You start with interval recognition and chord progression recognition and then progress through somemelodic dictation and then 2-part (2 voices) dictation and melodic dictations with some chromatic notes thrown in and dictations of string pieces played from a recording. You also do some sight-singing.The class had only 6 people; I found it very relaxing to have this early in the morning, able to listen to piano and string recordings and also do some sight-singing. Doug Fisk was my grad student teacher (Sarita is not the instructor even though she's the professor listed), and he was very nice and chill. He is very organized and gave us lots of handouts from which we did lots of practice in class and from which you could practice more from outside of class. The quizzes and exams are very very reasonable. You get to hear the melodic lines you are dictating anywhere from six to ten times, after which you'll probably already have the tune stuck in your head.You even get two unpenalized absences, but you don't really want to skip such a fun and intimate class.I had a very positive experience with this class and I think my ears improved a bit.",
    "I would summarize Music 218 as a class that drastically improves musicianship in a short time through dictations, sight-singing, and musical games. I would definitely recommend it because it truly helps one grow as a musician in an engaging way.",
    "This course is basically ear training - dictations (mostly melodic, but some harmonic also), a bit of sight singing, and a lot of fun! I thought there was not enough practice with sight-singing, and the singing on numbers was pretty challenging. The keyboard lab was also very helpful, not only for learning figured bass but also for thinking about the rules of music theory in a less strictly theoretical way."
