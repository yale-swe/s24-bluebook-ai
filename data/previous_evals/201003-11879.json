   "comments": [
    "Unfortunately, Math 120 is a fairly necessary class for those students who haven't had multivariable calculus in high school but hope to study advanced sciences\/ economics\/ engineering or math.Some professors are better than others. I know that Joe Lauer was a very nice and approachable teacher, though I didn't have him myself. My teacher was knowledgeable, but she seemed a bit new to teaching, as she moved very quickly through the material in a fashion that was not especially conducive to learning.Pay attention, do the problem sets, get help if you need it and you should be fine. It might be a good idea to get a different calculus book in addition to the one Yale uses because the Yale one is not especially good.I hate to write a negative evaluation of a course, because I know it will (along with the many other comments here) tend to create a sense of dread. I went into Math 120 expecting it to be bad (based on these evaluations and what other people had said), so that probably didn't help me. This class is a necessary evil for many people who hope to use math in their college careers.It's poorly taught, but it's manageable. I learned the most doing the practice tests getting ready for exams. (Do ALL the practice exams.)",
    "I'm definitely a math person, and I found the course to be pretty routine. Do the problem sets and study before exams and you should get at least a B+. It's a lot of material, but the professors are amazing; they make it really easy to understand the material.",
    "This class is worth taking if someone wants to do calculus in three dimensions. It's definitely a step up above normal calculus, but is interesting and applies concepts learned in regular calculus.",
    "This class gets an unnecessarily bad rep. If you find a good teacher, you'll be fine. Miki was way better than anything I could have hoped for, based on previous reviews of this course. She presents all the material clearly with plenty of examples, and she makes jokes here and there or lighthearted comments so I never found myself bored or zoning out. She's very friendly and if you have any problems she sticks around after class and during office hours. So if you're planning on taking 120 take it with Miki!",
    "If you think you will end up in a science major, this course is helpful in getting your basic foundations really strong.",
    "This class is a textbook based math class, a generic continuation of calculus. If you like math, take it, you basically have to when you get to a certain level, but don't expect anything life altering. Havlickova is a really great teacher and makes a pretty dry class entertaining and fun. She's great at explaining and really teaching the course and is really easy to understand. Just try not to take it at 9am, you may think it's manageable but calculus that early is pretty brutal!",
    "I would summarize math 120 as a general multivariable calculus class. The first part of the semester was fairly basic stuff that was not too difficult to master, but the topics toward the end of the year were much tougher. I would recommend this class to someone who likes math or is interested in this type of calculus.",
    "Take this class if you enjoy math and enjoy picturing things in 3D. It's difficult, but if you actually like math, then it should be ok. If you don't really like math, I wouldn't take this class.",
    "This is a really difficult class. If you have never seen multivariable calculus before, it can be really annoying and intimidating to have kids in your class that have. The material is challenging and the homework is time consuming if you don't necessarily understand what you're doing.",
    "Very boring class--only take it if you need it for your major. If you're not a morning person do not take this class in the morning. Professor Havlickova is super nice, and is really helpful if you come to her with questions, but her teaching style is based on doing a lot of practice problems so you know how to do the work rather than making sure you really understand the theory behind the math. Maybe this works for some people, but I thought it was a problem. The workload is not bad at all.",
    "The course does exactly what it says. Solid, demanding but definitely doable. But it's intense so take it only if you have to.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone majoring in math or science. It is very accessible after a course in single variable calculus.",
    "Yes. But sometimes I did feel Prof. Havlichova's lectures going faster than I can understand, so I would suggest everyone taking her section to do enough preparation before class in order to get the most out of the lectures.",
    "Math 120 was not a bad class despite what some other people might tell you. I wanted to take ENAS 151, but it was canceled this semester. Ifyou have the option of taking ENAS 151, I would recommend shopping it because I hear it is a better alternative to Math 120. The problem sets for this class weren't difficult (they would take approximately 2 hours a week) and the first two exams were easy. The difficulty in this class comes at the end of the semester with all the big theorems (Greens, Stokes', Divergence). And since it is the end of the semester, the professors don't have much time to teach these topics and rush over them. Not going to lie, the final exam was hard and is worth 50% of your grade. If you do take this class, I would recommend Miki (Havlickova). She moves fast and teaches beyond what you are supposed to know, but trust me, this is better than getting a TA who doesn't speak English. You could try to get Frame, but I heard this is his last year or semester teaching (and who wants to wake up at 5 in morning to stand in line to preregister for a class when all I did was walk into this class during shopping period and got in).",
    "It's an ok class, not particularly fun but does teach you the material you need to know. I've heard ENAS151 is a good substitute.",
    "Unless you absolutely love math, I would not take this class as a QR requirement. If you are required to take this course for your major or as a pre-med requirement, I have heard the engineering version of this course is better. It's a math class so one version may not really be more interesting than the other.",
    "Whether to take this class definitely depends on the student. There are subjects in the course that are beyond BC calculus, only dedicated math students or students who have taken BC should be taking the class. The problem sets can be challenging and therefore time-consuming; expect the class to be difficult.",
    "It's your basic multivariable course. A little less detailed than high school."
