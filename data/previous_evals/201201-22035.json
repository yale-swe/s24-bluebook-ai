    "Yes, this is one of the only gems I've found here.",
    "I would highly recommend it if you're interested in tying science to cultural\/political factors. It isn't a highly technical class but you will get more out of it you know a good deal of science.Fairly relaxed class but you learn a good amount and the work you do will make you think. Also, the group projects are kind of cool because they are highly applicable.",
    "Absolutely! The class is wonderful and the workload is not bad at all. The midterm and final projects are really fun!",
    "It was a good general overview of different issues in global health and pertinent technological applications. But we covered a bunch of different topics so we couldn't go into too much depth for each topic. It's a good intro global health class, but for people who already have experiences in global health and have taken other similar classes, you might not learn that much from this class.",
    "I would recommend the class if you're interested in global health at all",
    "YES. If you are remotely interested in global health and current issues facing the developing world, take this course. It was interesting to look at issues from all different angles: technical, anthropological, economical, etc. The workload is completely manageable, and it was very refreshing to have a project-based course. It made the material we were learning feel very applicable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to my fellow students and I already have!",
    "I think that the course covered a wide range of topics that were very interesting and might not otherwise get taught in engineering courses. This class really showed how the engineering process must consider its end-users and those who would need technologies in the developing world. There was a midterm project, a final project, weekly reading responses, and a current event presentation. Overall, this was a pretty relaxed and easy course. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who thinks they might be even remotely interested in the subject. I learned a ton and think it will inform many of my future career decisions.",
    "Great way to be exposed to biological and anthropological issues related to health in developing nations. Great seminar type feel.",
    "Yes.",
    "I took this class after sitting through a large intro to global health class last semester, which made me feel a bit hopeless about the complexity of GH problems and about effectiveness of interventions in the the long run. In this class, however, we talked specifically about the ways technologies can be designed around those complex problems, and can actually be useful and sustainable for their target users. The lectures and discussions do a good job of introducing the issues that need to be considered while designing products for developing countries. The students, with their diverse range of personal experiences in GH, contributed a lot to the class discussions. As a bonus, this class is not too work-heavy, and the grades are pretty generous. As a double bonus, Prof. Gonzalez is an amazing professor who really cares about her students. Definitely take this class if you can.",
    "Really interesting class if you're interested in biotech, the developing world, and\/or global health. Nice survey on how technology (the definition of \"biotechnology\" is pretty broad here) is applied to solving health problems in developing countries. Professor is really nice, easygoing, and interesting. Not much of a science background required for this (I took Chem 118 and AP Bio). Workload is relatively light, with two group projects.",
    "Take it. Super interesting material. Reasonable workload. Great professor!"
