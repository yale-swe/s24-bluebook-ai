    "I had never taken an archaeology course prior to this class, so I learned many foundational archaeology skills including the analysis of settlements, burials, and other remains to interpret the living conditions of ancient peoples. I also learned how to be critical of archaeology papers and how to propose new ideas for archaeological research. I feel that I grew as a writer, too, through the two essays for this class. It was very enjoyable learning about the ancient history of China, Japan, and neighboring countries through their material records. I had also never taken a history course focusing on these areas before, so I learned a lot about early dynasties and cultures that I had never been exposed to before."

    "This was a very strong discussion-based course. At first, I was nervous about participating in sections with little background in the subject, but I came to really enjoy talking about and debating the many archaeological papers we read. I appreciated having a short lecture at the beginning of class, a break, and then a discussion, as this allowed everyone a chance to renew their focus and avoid being overwhelmed by the length of the class period. I really liked the two writing assignments we had, for they gave us all the chance to explore different regions, times, and trends in ancient Asia. I do not really see how this course could be improved. It would have been interesting to have spent a little more time on Japan, but that is difficult to do with such a broad time and space being covered."
