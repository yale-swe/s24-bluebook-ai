    "If you are looking for a WR credit \/ are interested in Sports definitely take it. After taking 114 for a WR credit, this is so much less work. 3 250 word essays and a research project. BUT, the professor can be mean at times and they aren't easy graders.",
    "If you're interested in sports, take it.",
    "This class started off a bit slow, but really picked up after a few weeks. We covered a lot of interesting topics and had great discussions.",
    "Take the class! If you are a sports lover and want to better understand how they impact society, this is the class for you.",
    "This class explored certain topics in sports and how they are related to the culture of an entire society. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who has any interest in sport, and the culture of societies.",
    "Fun class. Sucked that it was at 9 am, but that might change. Very interesting if you are interested in\/care about sports at all. Also, it's amazing you get a writing credit as well. Definitely recommend.",
    "A great class to take if you are interested in the culture of sports, and there were some really interesting discussions. You look at sports in a different way after this class.",
    "I would recommend it if you love sports and are prepared for some frustrating discussions about sports--frustrating in the sense that there really are not answers to the questions we discuss in seminar. It's a cool class and changes your perspective on sport and causes you to see it as a cultural phenomenon rather than as a game.",
    "Take it.",
    "I recommend this class as the class to take for you freshman seminar. Not only does it count as a writing credit that doesnt kill you with papers, it is also interesting every day. There is also a manageable amount of reading."
