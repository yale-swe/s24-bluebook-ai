    "I learned how to develop an original research question, dig through the literature for potential hypotheses, and adopt tried and true econometric methods to a new data set. I also learned the importance of creating feasible data analysis and writing timelines and the value of creating accountability mechanisms to get the 80-100 pages done.",

   "comments": [
    "There needs to be a much better structure in place to improve thesis writing in the major; a seminar or some other accountability structure must be created that has required GRADED drafts to ensure that students are producing high quality material at the beginning of the year, not just during the final two months. As it stands right now, any kind of structure is completely dictated by the students and the advisors she chooses. Though it is nice to have a senior essay consultant read drafts, having two drafts due is not enough. We should be required to submit a research question, proposal, timeline for completion, and maybe about 4-8 partial drafts for the course (many other writing intensive courses require about 2-4 essays per semester, so this would about to 4-8 during the year). We should also be encouraged to develop our question during our junior spring semester (like other majors, such as African American studies) so that we can potentially collect data or do some of our research in the summer time and have the fall be a productive writing semester, rather than just a semester of brainstorming. Even if a seminar is not created (it could be difficult to know what to teach or review when everyone's paper is so different), much more accountability needs to be built into this. At the very least, a seminar could review advice for writing good literature reviews, creating a tight research question (by going through student examples), and potentially review econometric techniques for data analysis.",
    "EP&E 493 is a great option for an EP&E senior looking to do a lot of research\/reading on his\/her topic. Both senior essay consultants were very helpful."

    "This is a great opportunity to produce a piece of scholarship that is your own and is particularly useful if you plan to apply to certain graduate programs in the future. But, BEWARE. You have to pick an advisor that will keep you accountable and be willing to meet with you frequently (weekly meetings are amazing)! You also absolutely need to commit to a timeline for yourself and your advisor so you finish everything on time. The EP&E department will do NO handholding for you and the drafts that you are supposed to turn in will pile up during the spring semester. You should really try to know what you are doing junior spring or junior summer so you can approach an advisor early and just get starting working on your project once senior fall comes around. This is also just as scary and stressful as it sounds - 80-100 pages with minimal departmental support is not a joke and you might be sandwiched within weeks of hell in March and April if you do not pace yourself.",
    "I would recommend a full-year senior essay to another EP&E student especially if he\/she would benefit from conducting a substantial amount of research\/doing a lot of reading on the topic and has a topic on which he\/she is interested in writing 80-100 pages rather than 40-50 pages."
