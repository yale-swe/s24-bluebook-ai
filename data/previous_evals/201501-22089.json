   "comments": [
    "Yes! Take it! The assignments can be very abstract so if you like clear direction, this course may not be for you. Otherwise, it is very valuable and will force you to engage with new topics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It's a great introduction to ethnic studies!",
    "Absolutely. How could you not take a class so interesting, important, and academically valuable as this one? So many great conversations were had in the class. Birgit is a wonderful human being. As in a real human being, which many professors at Yale fail to come off as to their students. She's extremely caring, understanding, and has so many interesting things to say about the world. She's a great discussion leaderevery class was full of insightful comments from everyone, and Birgit does a great job of making sure everyone gets the chance to speak. The assignments of the class get you to think creatively about how to approach ethnic studies, and that might be one the most useful ways of learning at Yale. Your classmates will challenge you, support you, and create a welcoming atmosphere for discussion. THIS ISN'T A CLASS JUST FOR PEOPLES OF COLOR. Please please please at least shop this class. There is so much to learn from it no matter who you are. This upcoming year is potentially (probably) Birgit's last year at Yale, so definitely try to take it with her while you can.",
    "Highly recommend this course if you are at all interested in Ethnic Studies. This class has some great readings and discussion that will show you how much scholarship and theory there is in ethnic studies.",
    "A must if you're interested in discussing the systematic oppression of minorities during the past and present.",
    "Take the course! Prof. Birgit Brander Rasmussen is very knowledgeable and down to earth. You will learn things about Ethnicity and Race that you did not know you even didn't know. It will open your mind to current race problems today. There is a lot of reading, but worth it.",
    "Yes! Everyone should take an eye-opening course like this. You don't need to be a major in ER&M to understand basic concepts. We need more ethnic studies courses like this.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! Discussions are excellent and the topic is very important. Most of the readings are great. Professor Rasmussen is very accommodating and wants students to be invested in their work. Her assignments were interesting and thought provoking and flexible. The final project could be pretty much whatever type of project students were interested in pursuing--some people did artistic projects, other people did curricula.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who is interested in learning about ethnic studies. The material is engaging and insightful. It will change how you see and interpret your world."
