    "If you're interested in Sanskrit, take it with David.",
    "I would say that it is a perfect class broken into perfectly digestable, absorbable 50 minute blocks. I would even say it's fun! Professor Brick is fantastic because he is fair, yet has high expectations. Sanskrit is not a spoken language, so we focus on translations. But I feel like I've honestly learned and RETAINED a LOT, even in one semester. I would definitely recommend it to another student, and this is definitely the class I talk most about to friends and family."

    "There a lot of AHA! moments in this class, when I discovered the true meaning or actual formation of a Sanskrit word that I've seen dozens of times in readings on Hinduism or Buddhism...and this is just in the first semester!It is clear that class will prove to be invaluable to my Asian Religion studies."
