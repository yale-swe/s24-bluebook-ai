    "HSAR 276is a great course for those who know nothing about early Christian art. Some of it overlaps with other art history courses that cover the same time period and area (don't take it if you've already taken a course in Byzantine art because there will be a lot of repetition). I didn't know anything about Christian art coming into the course, but now I want to keep learning about it. You will really come to appreciate Roman and Byzantine art and learn how the two influenced each other through the ages. It's a wonderful course!",
    "HSAR is a good overview of the end of the classical age and the rise of Christianity. It's a great link between studying the Greco-Roman classical tradition and medieval or later works - the course covers the turning point between the two. Professor Nelson is very, very endearing and also very responsive to meetings with students - I wish I had taken better advantage of office hours.",
    "Great course, take it if you're at all interested in art from this period. Covers churches, icons, manuscripts etc. Nelson a really good professor, loves his subject and is very nice."
