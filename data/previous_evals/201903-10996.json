    "The course was challenging but doable and the professor is great, but the textbook was not very helpful.",
    "strengths: large scope, excellent examples from instructor experience \/ research, weakness: textbook was a little difficult to follow and some homework problems had typos \/ were unclear Understanding could be improved if homework was divided into weekly chunks instead of multiweek giant packets. This way students would have more frequent feedback from TA \/ instructor about concepts they may be struggling with.",
    "I think the only real weakness of the course was the book's lack of example problems. John did a great job explaining the theory and math behind problems.",
    "The material is relevant to understanding how organic compounds effect and transform as they enter the environment. The amount and speed of material presented was fair. There should be more examples\/applications of the equations presented so that students can understand how to use the equations for different situations. Also, I found the textbook that was used to be very hard to understand. It did not clarify anything that I learned in class, making it hard to strengthen my learning."

    "Yes as the professor is great and you will be able to model organic chemicals throughout different environments after taking the class.",
    "Yes, the topic is very important.",
    "Yes, I believe knowing partitioning is key to any environmental engineers work.",
    "If the class improves in how the material is presented, I would recommend this course. With more practice problems in class gone over more thoroughly and a better textbook, I think this class will improve greatly."
