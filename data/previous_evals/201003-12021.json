    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. I learned so much about storytelling of russian authors.",

    "I definitely recommend this for another student. Very interesting readings, and very helpful for writing skills (although it is not a writing credit which is unfortunate)",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. The reading list is fantastic, and you really feel you improve as a writer."
