    "Good class, even for those not necessarily interested in aging. Good exposure to interesting, though difficult papers, with the instructor being very patient and engaging.",
    "Economics of Aging is a great class, Professor Doug Mckee is one of the best teachers I have had at Yale, he is reason enough to take the class. The class discussions are great, I definitely recommend taking this seminar.",
    "Yes.",
    "There are very few classes in the economics major that are actually worthwhile. This is one of the better ones without a doubt so definitely take it. The professor is fabulous and the material is not only engaging but highly pertinent to the current economy and state of the country. The workload is not bad at all and the final project is not just a boring paper but actually very fascinating independent research that he gives you a lot of help with. Take this seminar, you won't regret it.",
    "You'll never really have the chance to learn how to write a paper like this, with a professor who is willing to teach you how. Take it."
