   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this course! Getting to read about many different Asian cities, cultures, and populations was really interesting. We also had many discussions about methods, which was helpful for me as an anthropology major. Every book was not phenomenal, but this lead to interesting class discussions and was a good chance to learn about what goes into writing an effective ethnography.",
    "ANTH 339 is an introduction to various ethnographies that deal broadly with urban populations throughout Asia. You read one book a week (mostly) and then the seminar is spent discussing it. Each week a group prepares a book review which is the basis for discussion. The books chosen were hit and miss. Some were very interesting and well written. Others not so much. The class discussions usually began about the topic discussed in the book (migrant labor for example) but then repeatedly veered towards discussing the practice of ethnographies. This could be interesting for anthro majors, but I found it tiresome. A significant amount of course time was also spent discussing the practice of writing and the presentation in each book. Peer edits took up two class periods. In sum, if you are looking for a class in which you can gain a quick insight into a broad cross-section of Asia then there are probably better classes out there. But, if you are looking to learn how the discipline of anthropology can engage with contemporary issues in Asia, this class is for you.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are prepared to do a lot of reading that is sometimes interesting cultural commentary but a lot of the time dense theory. The class was more focused on the writing of ethnographies than the study of these Asian cities, which I wasn't expecting. But I did learn a lot about Asia indirectly and the final paper was an opportunity for me to learn a lot about a particular Asian city. The class was really close as well and Professor Harms can be really, really funny. He took us all out to Great Wall at the end of the semester, which was so nice! I enjoyed it overall, but you've got to be ready to do the work.",
    "One of the best classes at Yale! Harms choses super interesting books, he teaches academic writing like no other, the classroom atmosphere is relaxed but super productive. Anthropology experience not necessary but don't think it feels uninteresting for Anthro majors either. Should be a writing credit. Take this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was a great course and as an anthropology major, I loved it and want to take more seminar classes. You have the chance to write a final paper on any aspect of Asia, and the broadness of this assignment is extremely fun not just for an individual, but also for the class (since we have writing workshops). If you get in, absolutely take it!",
    "TAKE IT! Not only is the reading list super interesting, but Professor Harms is one of the best seminar leaders at Yale. I looked forward to every class and found the thematic connections that we made throughout the semester to be meaningful. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in urban studies, Asian cities, anthropology, research methods, or looking for a great class! If you have a chance, take it! Professor Harms is really the best and super helpful with both the midterm and final paper!",
    "If you're interested in Asia, cities, and\/or urban anthropology, this class is a must. Prof. Harms is an observant and self-aware man who knows how to provide a good seminar experience. If anything, take it for him; his extensive knowledge alone made the class a joy to take. That being said, your enjoyment of the course will depend a lot on the reading list and the other people in the course, so be sure to shop smart.",
    "Good seminar with a great professor. The readings are pretty cool.",
    "Recommend without reservation--even if you're only tangentially interested in Asia, urban areas, or ethnography, you'll still find the class worthwhile as a learning experience.",
    "Yes, if it's offered again, definitely take it! I knew very little about ethnographies and anthropology as a discipline, but this course has shown me how exciting this kind of research can be, and helped me learn quite literally a new way of writing! The readings were great, and it was also fun to be in a class with a group of people who have such diverse interests in Asia.",
    "A tour through various forms of ethnography in many contexts. Each week a few students write an academic critique and the discussion branches from there. This is a fantastic course to learn about the specific cities represented by the readings, the urban sphere more generally, and ethnographic approaches. A fantastic course, highly recommended, especially because of Professor Harms' insights and direction -- this is a seminar done right!",
    "Yes, please take this class. I am not joking. If I were joking, I would tell you not to take this class. If you have any remote interest in Asia, even if it's not at all the other countries in Asia, this course will still speak to your interests, and maybe even expand them.",
    "I looked forward to this class every week\u2014Professor Harms was an engaging discussion leader who always had a lot of interesting things to say. Some of the ethnographies we read were definitely better than others, but I learned a lot from their comparative strengths and weaknesses. I also appreciated that Harms offered thoughtful comments on our midterm and final papers, particularly since I\u2019ve rarely received final papers back from other professors."
