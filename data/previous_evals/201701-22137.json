    "Strengths: Mostly excellent readings. A good mix of foundational works in material culture, sociology, anthropology, and archaeology, as well as contemporary readings that give a sense of where these fields are going. Ned is a fabulous teacher. Great discussion leader, very high intellectual standards. Great idea to have us write position papers that consider both makers and consumers. Weaknesses: Too much reading, much of which goes undiscussed in class. Two essays per week, or maybe two or three book chapters would provide more than enough material for discussion. Bringing in objects is helpful, but takes up more class time than necessary, and it's not always evident how Ned's discussion of the objects relates to the readings. I wish we would stick closer to the assigned texts in class.",
    "strengths: -variety of methodologies explored -good classroom discussions weaknesses: -not enough object analysis in Yale's collections"

    "Absolutely. I've been recommending the course all semester. Great readings, great professor, really creative students.",
    "YES!",
    "Yes, because it helps to develop material literacy, and to build a vocabulary for analyzing objects (as opposed to paintings and 2-D works)."
