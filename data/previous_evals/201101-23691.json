   "comments": [
    "Take it. It is fantastic.",
    "You should definitely take this class if you need a junior seminar that isn't too stressful. There is still the same work load, but Professor Gitlin presents it in a very manageable way. Pus there are field trips that are actually worth going on.",
    "Professor Gitlin is wonderful and extremely knowledgeable. The class is very laid-back, and it's a good topic to learn about.",
    "History of Quebec and Canada is a very fun class on a history and culture that most Americans are totally unaware of. The class has a strong focus on Quebec (and thus great for someone with a background in French). Professor Gitlin has a great sense of humor and always has interesting and unexpected connections between French Canada and American history or culture. I would highly recommend the class for anyone with an interest in Canada as the class is one of the only ways to learn about fascinating figures such as Louis Riel and Pierre Trudeau.",
    "It's a fun out-of-the-box class where you get to learn all about Canadian culture and history. The workload is pretty even, and most readings are fairly interesting. While some topics are more interesting than others, Professor Gitlin's enthusiasm for Canada and his knowledge of the subject can't be matched. Besides, all Americans should know more about our neighbors! The final paper topic is also very open, so you can have some fun with that.",
    "You probably don't care about Canada, but you should! The history of Canada -- and particularly Quebec -- is so much more interesting than I ever would have expected, and Professor Gitlin is delightful. The workload is reasonable -- one short (~3 page) analytical paper, leading a few reading discussions, and a 15-20 page term paper. Professor Gitlin's classes always have a jovial atmosphere, and you'll love forward to this seminar every week. Take it!",
    "take it! the work is bearable and the seminar is fun. canada is worth knowing about for many many reasons that you have not yet even considered.",
    "I got a few funny looks when I told friends I was taking a seminar on Canadian history, but the course was excellent -- a rich archive, a body of material narrow enough to accommodate the one-term seminar format, and a wonderfully energetic professor. It's not the most organized or the most rigorous, in certain ways, and but it's a cultural history class in the best sense of the term. I'd strongly recommend it to anyone interested in colonial and post-colonial history, language questions, or simply getting more familiar with the process of historical inquiry in a manageable and interesting setting. Prof. Gitlin can be hard to reach, but was clear and fair and so infectiously excited about the material that the two hours each week never dragged.",
    "It's an indepth analysis and study of Canadian history with a focus on the Quebec and French problem in the country."
