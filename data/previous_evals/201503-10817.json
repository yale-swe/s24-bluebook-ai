    "I would recommend it because it is a very useful class.",
    "This course is very helpful for both students in the BBS program and students from other bology-related programs such as Biomedical Engineering. The lecturers are top researchers in their own fields, and are very knowledgable. I would recommend this course to other students.",
    "I think this is a good course for a student aiming to work on stem cell.",
    "GENE 655 01 is a challenging and amazing course. If you are interested in learning about stem cell research, this is the perfect course. The course covers a plethora of concentrations within the field; I am a neuroscientist and was still so interested in every lecture, and chose my presentation on cardiac stem cells. I would definitely recommend this course to another student."

   "comments": [
    "It exposed to the wide variety of excellent research pertaining to stem cells and deepened my understanding of the field and my approach to experimentation as a graduate student.",
    "This course deepens my knowledge in the biology and applications of different types of stem cells such as hematopoietic stem cells, neural stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, etc. Since hematopoetic stem cells is the topic of my research, it strengthens my knowledge in this field. It also expanded my knowledge in other related fields.",
    "It deepens my knowledge by walking through each topics related to stem cell researches.",
    "This course contributed to my dissertation\/research in the exact way that I'd hoped it would. I am new to stem cell research, but joined a prestigious lab that focuses on stem cell research. This course really helped me understand so much about stem cells, from the basics to the most challenging areas; from the techniques to the questions asked and the range of clinical applicability the field is constantly striving towards. I feel so much more comfortable in my own lab and with my own thesis than I did before taking this course. I am so glad I did."
