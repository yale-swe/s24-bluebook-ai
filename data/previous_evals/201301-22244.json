    "Obviously this course is only for architecture majors. It is a huge commitment and a ton of work.",
    "Well, I think you are required to take this course if you're an architecture major. The course is structured differently from 250 but it makes you approach the design problem at a different angle.Tips: Start early and make sketch models! Don't be too precious!",
    "I think junior studio was different this year than it has been in the past (and it's always pretty different second semester than first), but I would strongly recommend it provided that you understand the time commitment, level of intensity, and nature of the course. It's a conceptually-driven studio with one long project divided into four parts. The first involved conceptual drawing, the second concept development (program\/scenario), the third organization (the first time actual plans and sections were required), and the fourth a sited design solution. I really liked the conceptual nature of the studio,but I thought there were some pacing problems. Again, I think it's important to know what you're getting into.",
    "Ya know. It was harder this year than in previous years apparently. Michael is zany and great. Joyce is the whipbearer, and she gets right to business and is helpful too. You will learn a lot and will do cool impossible things. Don't be afraid to do stuff just because. Try to maintain a healthy lifestyle though, it's too early to start dying.",
    "This question is irrelevant.",
    "It is a ton of work but necessary for any architecture major.",
    "Ah, studio. How shall I say it... this class is probably the most frustrating experience I have ever had at Yale. You will frequently be asked to build things in ridiculously large scales for no apparent reason (you won't really have enough time to make the scale worth it). There will be weeks when you hardly have to do anything, and weeks where you will literally have no time to eat. For some of the assignments (especially building towards the final project) I felt as though the instructors had skipped some steps - the jump from basic program to fully articulated plans and sections is a very large and fast one. Make sure to have everything they ask for, or it will not go well. Michael and Joyce have very different things that they are looking for (and frequently the students didn't really understand either). You will be very glad for guest critics at the midterm and final, if only to not be spinning wheels on ideas any more. Good luck.",
    "If you are taking it you have to take it. Be careful, your other classes will really suffer and its going to be a really difficult experience. Try not to get too depressed."
