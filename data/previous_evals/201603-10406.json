    "Learned how to use photoshop, a DSLR camera, and how challenging it is to take photos that matter.",
    "I developed a great understanding of photoshop and camera mechanics that will prove to be invaluable.",
    "Understanding of a camera and the skills involved in operating it improved. I also gained an appreciation of what is involved in becoming an art major.",
    "This class really teaches you to see the world as a photographer, understand the medium of photography, and appreciate photography as an art form! A ton of work, but totally worth it! You will learn a ton and the class got really close because doing photography with other people really teaches you a lot about them."

    "Ka-Man and my classmates made the class. It was a wonderful, collaborative environment. A lot was asked of us, but in a relatively gentle manner. I always felt supported.",
    "More time spent taking photos under the guidance of the professor would really be helpful in understanding how the camera settings work.",
    "The course was really well designed in getting you to make a lot of work, discuss the work, learn photoshop, and think about photography. There could have been a slower intro to photoshop with a more in depth look in to how to use different tools, but you can figure this out on your own for the most part."

    "Take this class if you want to learn how hard photography is and why it matters. If you want to feel like you have the potential to make art and engage with the world through the lens of a camera.",
    "The is a great class for anyone remotely interested in photography. It was a lot of work, but you gain a valuable set of skills. It's one of those classes that can change your perspective in seeing the world. Ka-Man is a great lecturer and photographer. She has high expectations and really pushes you to improve throughout the course. The class is a bit costly, so that is something to keep in mind.",
    "Yes, it is successful in providing an understanding of how to operate a camera and what makes a successful photograph.",
    "Yes! Take this course. You will think in new ways and really appreciate photography. Be prepared to work."
