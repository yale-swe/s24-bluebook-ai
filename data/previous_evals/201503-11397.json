   "comments": [
    "I would reccomend this course as the language is interesting, and the course also teaches about Italian culture, not just the language.",
    "It is a great, immersive course for learning a beautiful and rich language. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to pick up another language especially if they know other romance languages.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone. It was a great class where you learn a lot and work hard. The course work is definitely time consuming but very enjoyable.",
    "A relatively fast-paced introduction to Italian. In small seminars, students learn grammar and vocabulary. Although the class will present you with hundreds of vocab words by the end of the semester, exams emphasize grammatical concepts rather than vocab. Each week has a small writing assignment which apply concepts learned in class, and demonstrate the progress made. La Professoressa Lorenzini is a wonderful instructor--always energetic, a native Italian speaker, a fair grader, and great at explaining grammatical concepts."
