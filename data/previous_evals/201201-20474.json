   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "To a fellow student: You get what you put into it, since the instructor doesn't push too hard. This is actually nice, since as graduate students, we shouldn't need someone to hold our hand. If you like listening to and analyzing music, this is the course for you. Brush up on your Russian history before hand, because you'll get a lot more out of the course if you're on top of cultural-historical issues.I would recommend the course. Great music, great instructor, and an opportunity to learn about a fascinating period in world history.",
    "Since it is a composer-centered course, I would certainly recommend the course to anyone who had an interest in the music of Shostakovich. But at the same time, it also provides a good model for how music history and music analysis can to a certain extent be integrated into one another. Furthermore, it also provides methods for talking about form and deformations in 20th-century compositions."

   "comments": [
    "This course teaches students to employ many different methods for approaching repertoire.",
    "I'm not well-versed in the music of 20th-century composers, so this course certainly helped to rectify that shortcoming of mine. It deepened my appreciation of the enormous influence of classical composers even on 20th century artists.",
    "The course was a great survey of Shostakovich's music, providing both a large-scale view and detailed analysis of specific works.",
    "In general, I increased my skills in discussing 10th-century music and its analysis. In particular in the two papers, I gained more insight in how text and music can also be related to biographical aspects."
