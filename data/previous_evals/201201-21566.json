    "Blaxploitation Re-examined was a survey of an important era in American film history. Professor Francis investigates Black identity and places each film into historical context. I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in film.",
    "Loved Francis - awesome teacher who truly treats students with respect and knows a lot about film. Go to class and take it if you are interested\/passionate about Black culture or film.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for students looking for some awesome cultural edification with very little work. The films we watched are incredible and fun, and the work is almost non-existent - a presentation and two papers. Make time for the film screenings and just soak up the 70s.",
    "African American Studies 277 01 is a class for lovers of cinema, lovers of Black culture, and those who want a class where they will learn something new. It is a class about the analysis and inspection of Black cinema of the 1970s and how such films relate to film culture today.Without question I would recommend the class to a fellow student."
