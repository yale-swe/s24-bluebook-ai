    "The first half of this course is like Latin 110- it finishes up the textbook. Then, we move on to real readings. At this point, the course becomes disorganized- not in any way bad, but it won't be like any other language course, in that you'll have to rely on yourself to keep on top of everything. There will be no vocab lists, and for many of the texts, which may feature opaque grammar quirks, there are no English translations available online. This being said, have no fear! Grading is very generous, and you do come out of the course with the ability to read arbitrary Latin texts.",
    "This is a fantastic class. I really like the way it was structured- spending the first half of the semester in the textbook and the second half in Aeneas to Augustus. Also, Sean is a phenomenal teacher. He made coming to class every day enjoyable, and he really helped me improve my Latin.Your Latin will likely improve a lot if you take this class, and it's a really enjoyable way to spend an hour every day.",
    "Latin is great. If you want to be a doctor, lawyer, or scientist, you should definitely invest in Latin! The passages are enjoyable and you really begin to master Latin by the end of this course. You can read actual Latin texts after only one year! And that's pretty cool.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wanted to begin reading real Latin.",
