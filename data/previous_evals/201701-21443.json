    "I learned a lot of French in a short period of time and this course is very rigorous and respectable in that regard. The pace is like last semester but students who are comfortable from taking L1 should see the same level of rigor required of them to take this course.",
    "I learned French",
    "Lots of grammar & vocab. Also improved my speaking fluency and pronunciation.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of the French language - this course especially helped to solidify my knowledge of the grammar and increased my vocabulary while helping me become slightly more fluent in French.",

    "Good basic introduction to French. Lots of group projects."

    "There is way too much work when combined with other classes to be able to completed properly. However, I believe this method has worked for many and is a very effective way of teaching French.",
    "Too much workload",
    "Strengths: incorporates a lot of vocab\/expressions that can be used in daily speech. Very rigorous. Establishes a good foundation of french. Weaknesses: the homework got really long.",
    "The French in Action method is an excellent way of teaching the course, but I think that it could be improved by distributing the lessons more evenly, and I felt like I was able to grasp the material less completely during the weeks we would study two lessons instead of one because of the extra material.",
    "French in Action videos could be filmed again; vocabulary should be reviewed: many words are not used anymore in daily conversations.",
    "I think there are too many tests. I think a test once every two weeks would be more effective because then there is more time to speak and learn."

    "If you want to improve your French then this is the way to go. Be prepared to put it a lot of work everyday if you want a good grade + want to master French.",
    "I would recommend FREN 120 to a student who was interested in improving their knowledge of basic French. The course establishes a much stronger foundation in grammar than the L1 course, and is a good way to continue language learning.",
    "If you are interesting in rapidly improving your French, you should take it.",
    "Only recommend if you really want to learn French."
