   "comments": [
    "This course is perfect if you want a basic run-down of Python and C++. You won't delve much into CS theory, but you will leave with a very practical, working knowledge of both languages. Certainly possible if you haven't programmed before, but probably a bit too difficult \u00e2\u0080\u0093 definitely seems designed for people with at least some programming background who need more familiarity\/practice.If learning the basics of Python\/C++ is what you're looking for in a course, I'd definitely recommend it, even though the 2.5 hour lectures can be brutal. But if you have an extensive comp sci background, then I would probably say to pass on it since you probably won't learn much.",
    "This class is a good but fast-paced class on Python and C++ programming. It is absolutely possible for someone with little programming experience to take the class, as it starts with the very basics, but it also moves very quickly (we got to topics in the four or five week C++ section that we didn't get to in my semester-long undergrad course on C and C++). I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs to do coding for research and wants to solidify their skills in these languages. Also, it is certainly open to undergrads--I am an undergrad, and I know about a half dozen others who took the class and didn't have too much trouble.",
    "A must for all physicists.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in using computational methods for their research or future ambitions.",
    "You learn a lot of really great things for programming and research, I feel it should be a mandatory course for most students!",
    "This class does what it purports to do!",
    "Take it, but only if you have the time to dedicate to really learning the material.",
    "It's a good class that aims to teach skills applicable to physics research. I was frustrated that the CS department didn't have a practical intermediate-level programming class, and I found it here. The choice of material is excellent, but the class is not very well organized. It felt too rushed, and we didn't get much of a chance to study example codes or see codes in practice. The homework assignments and project got really hard in the second half of the semester and took up way more time than I expected. Be warned that if you have no programming background, especially with C++, you will have a miserable time.",
    "Definitely take it if you want forced programming practice.",
    "Take the course it should be very useful for research.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to anybody in physics, because its content is fundamental for anybody trying to do research in the field. I would say, the course was a success. Many of us learned a lot of useful concepts and benefited from the course. The final projects were both challenging but fair. We received plenty of help from the professor and the Astronomy TA.The only negative part about this course was the fact that the full time TA was completely useless and didn't know anything about the material being taught. Office hours were pointless and at a very inconvenient time.",
    "Physics 678 is great for learning practical skills. The lectures a pretty boring, but the homework is really interesting a worthwhile. I would recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "A nice introduction to programming for research. If you have no programming experience whatsoever going in, as I did, you'll be fine and learn a huge amount but will certainly have to fill in some gaps by reading up online. If you're already significantly experienced, though, I suspect you would find the class too basic until nearly the end. The workload is light at the beginning, but fairly steep at the end.",
    "Great intro. to computing.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student.I think this course really helped me to start program seriously and actually I'm already using the knowledge I got from it!",
    "This is probably the most relevant\/useful class I've taken since I've been here. I would recommend it ot anyone else who uses c++ on a regular basis."

   "comments": [
    "I used the basic Python knowledge as a starting point to develop code in my senior thesis, so it was helpful in that regard, since Python is very useful to generating plots.",
    "I am an undergrad, so this question doesn't wholly pertain to me. However, the class has been helpful in my research, as I code in Python a lot in lab.",
    "It has given me more tools to do my research and aid me in my academic career.",
    "In every way possible - research will be a lot more efficient after this course.",
    "Gave me a lot of useful tips to use in my research",
    "I never had a chance to learn C++, especially not in a physics-related context. It was helpful to see it here.",
    "Very useful for research.",
    "This course was absolutely great from that point of view, given that 100% of my research consists of making python scripts and working with C++. I wish I had had a similar course in undergraduate. This class will certainly impact my research very strongly and in a positive way.",
    "This course gave me a lot of practice and practical skills with using python and c++. This will be so useful to me for my research, as much of what I do is programing.",
    "Very much.",
    "In my research I need to program in both python and c++. The course helped me a lot and I'm already using the knowledge I got from it.",
    "Wish I'd gone into CS instead of physics."
