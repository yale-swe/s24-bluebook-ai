   "comments": [
    "The course was pretty good. We learn to use Solver in Excel, which is a very useful program. We also learn how to reduce a real-life problem into solvable equations, i.e. the objective of optimization. The problem sets are doable, and the TA is VERY GOOD! Also, Professor Denardo is a wonderful resource. The midterm and final are both take-home and open-note\/text. I found the exams more difficult than I had thought they'd be though.",
    "Interesting course. Less focused on practical applications than it sounds. Be prepared for lots of theoretical material. The professor often forgets how certain parts of the material simply don't make sense at first glance. He then tends to omit further explanation because he feels that it's too \"basic\" or \"redundant\" to show.",
    "it was okay, no strong recommendation either way",
    "Take it if you have to. I would highly recommend people to consider OPRS 237 to see if that's more appropriate to what they're looking for, as well as look through some of the course material before hand. The material of the course is actually pretty simple and straightforward, it's just not taught in the best manner.",
    "Take it if you're ready to work on your own. Class won't be of any help.",
    "Great class to take especially if you are interested in constrained linear and non-linear optimization. It is demanding and the exams are time consuming and challenging. Take it if you are an Econ and Math major.",
    "Go to the first class, peruse the book. If you enjoy Prof. Denardo's teaching style and have an interest in the course material take it.",
    "Yes, as long as you are prepared to do quite a bit of math. Problem sets, which are once a week, vary from very practical Excel based assignments to more theoretical assignments about linear programming.",
    "OPRS235 wasn't that great of a class. I came in expecting to learn a lot more and came away pretty disappointed - for the most part, it was difficult learning from Professor Denardo, who generally did not explain concepts very well and went through proofs too quickly (or not very clearly).",
    "This class is pretty good (and very useful, I would suspect) but it can be frustrating at times since the professor authored our textbook, so topics that were confusing in class were usually still confusing in the textbook. Meet with the professor if you're confused, because he's very friendly and helpful.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to anybody who is interested in economics or applied math. The course goes over many interesting ways in which linear algebra can be used to efficiently solve problems in game theory, business, and economics. The course is a good mix between theory and practice. So not only do you become familiar with running linear programs on Excel spreadsheets but you also get an understanding of the underlying linear algebra or geometric reasoning that justifies the computer\u0092s algorithms. Prof. Denardo can be a bit dry, but he is overall a good lecturer and a great resource since he has office hours everyday.",
    "Operations Research 235 provides a great introduction to optimization. You'll learn the theory as well as practical applications of the field, along with its history. Professor Denardo is an amazing professor - don't miss out on the opportunity!",
    "Do not take at all costs! There is no reason that this course should be a requirement for you which means that you are reading this considering taken it of your own free will. I'm telling you that that is a mistake. Terrible professor who is way too old to be teaching, and in fact makes so many errors teaching that material that you just learn it wrong. He also wrote the textbook which is as badly written as they come (also far from publishable so he gave us the electronic copy, at least). Then he writes tests that have more typos than you are allowed to make in the test and still expect a decent grade. He offers take home tests which sound nice until you get them and realize you know nothing then spend an ENTIRE weekend trying to figure out what is going on (these two lost weekends also takes the class from a typical workload class to a super high workload class since you literally will get no other work or sleep done in that time). Then because everyone is in the same boat, everyone gets the same score and then the curve is unbelievably brutal. The problem sets are sort of the same story, but the TA spoke barely enough English to sympathize and give away answers, which again doesn't really help anyone. But he couldn't really teach the whole class, although he would have been better than Eric (the Ogre, which he called himself).In summary, STAY AWAY FROM THIS COURSE! If you want to learn this stuff, just buy a book and read it. Don't waste a credit here.",
    "Stay away from this course! I signed up thinking it would be interesting, but it proved to be very poorly-taught. Normally when I can't make sense of lectures, I read the textbook, but the professor also wrote the textbook for this course, and it is a long way away from publication, so it's in \"rough-draft\" PDF form online. I struggled to make sense of my lecture notes and the textbook, so it was very easy to get lost since the concepts behind optimization are nuanced. I think this course could be good with some major changes, but in its current form, its students don't learn as much as they could, and the grading felt very arbitrary\/unpredictable. Also, be warned that the final was significantly more difficult than the midterm, and it completely ruined the last several days of my examination period. If you have to take this course, than I guess there's nothing you can do, but if you can find another one to substitute for it, I'd advise doing that instead. The professor really cares about his students and makes an effort to help them, but there are just too many flaws with the lectures\/book for him to drag everyone through the course individually.",
    "You basically learn how to use excel to solve constrained linear maximization and minimization problems. And then go beyond that to learn all the theory behind it. Really useful in life (except for the theory). Not too much work, but the take home midterm and final are sort of brutal."
