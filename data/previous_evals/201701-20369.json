    "It's a good course that exposed me to developments in biomedical engineering. We read lots of papers and learned about experimental techniques",
    "This was a fascinating course all about the reaction of the body to wounds and implants. It's an intriguing topic.",
    "Good course for learning how to gain things from a paper. I learned a lot about the immune response, etc. Overall this class is DOPE. Prof was super interesting and engaging, and clearly a leader in the field. Brilliant guy. Workload was pretty dang low, especially because tests were open notes, but on the flip side, its was very, very difficult to get ahead of the curve in the class, so it feels very likely that I'll end up with a very average grade, ie B, B+ rather than an A. I'd be happier if I was getting at least an A-, but definitely one of the more interesting classes I've taken at Yale. The fact that it's at 9 am sucks tho. Pros and cons I guess.",
    "I learned a lot about the foreign body response, the use of scaffolds, grafts, and implants, the technological and biological foundation underlying the interaction of biomaterials and tissue.",
    "Not much to be honest. Class was just learning about research reports done in the professor's field of interest and did not have much structure to it.",
    "The class helped me develop new insight in modern biomaterials and how they interact with the body. There was great focus on the cellular interactions between synthetic implants and host tissue. The principles taught in the class were supported with case studies of real implants for various diseases, including Parkinson's and diabetes.",
    "I learned about the biomaterial considerations, protein interactions, and biological pathways associated with the foreign body response. I don't come from a biology background, so this class exposed to me the art of reading biology papers and learning all the jargon and acronyms that come with it.",
    "This class tested your ability to bring a wide range of ideas and information together in order to problem solve complex biological issues.",
    "easy BME course, can get repetitive, themis is a cool guy, all open note exams",
    "I gained a thorough understanding of the basics of wound healing, the foreign body response, and the many approaches various groups are taking to try and improve their materials.",
    "Introduction to biomaterials, different applications of biomaterial implants, different experiments to test biocompatibility\/function, bodily responses to biomaterials, different approaches of thinking to improve implants",
    "I learned so much about the bioengineering field and the recent advancements and current technologies used. I feel like I have a very robust amount of real-world applicable knowledge.",
    "I learned a lot about the body's response to foreign objects and how to mitigate them.",
    "I learned a lot about the current applications of biomedical devices",
    "As a mechanical engineering student taking this course, I learned a lot about how research in biology is carried out. I learned about different methods (plasmid-DNA\/ ELISA\/etc) and different systems of the both (vascular\/brain).",
    "I learned about topics related to biomaterials and implants. Each lecture focused on a different aspect of the science of biomaterials. I learned how to analyze and interpret data, which was a skill that was useful for the MCAT.",
    "This course went over the the body's foreign body response to biomaterials. It went into the specific biology that triggers the response. The course also teaches you how to read research papers and analyze their methods and conclusions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "IT's a good course; maybe we could have more firm grounding in textbook readings",
    "A little more clarity on the syllabus couldn't hurt. Like, the names of the papers clearly laid out on the syllabus and associated with the class in which they are taught. Other than that really no complaints, it was a dope class.",
    "Themis is a fantastic lecturer and the class was very easy to interact with--the lectures were interesting and complemented the readings well. However, a drawback of the course is a lower engagement outside of class--just a few current events.",
    "Class was just learning about research reports done in the professor's field of interest and did not have much structure to it.",
    "The strength was the breadth of topics covered during the semester about biomaterials and how they interact with our body. There was great emphasis on applications and case studies of real implants. There were no glaring weaknesses of the course.",
    "While I did find the class material pretty interesting and the lectures overall pretty engaging, this class didn't satiate my desire for an engineering elective that involves problem solving. In fact, I'm shocked that this class counts as an elective for any engineering class because it felt like a pure biology class. Also, while I did appreciate that the exams were all open note (because I don't understand when classes test pure memorization), many of the questions involved finding a particular line in a paper that answers a very detailed problem, and I just don't find this to be the most engaging or rewarding type of test.",
    "Perhaps more review before finals and more directed studies around a textbook.",
    "The course material is really interesting. The writing assignments are a great way to expand the class material and engage with biomaterials in the real world.",
    "wish it wasn't a 9 am for sure all open note so exams aren't bad (that being said, take good notes in class) very chill class, very current material mainly learning from scientific literature",
    "I loved the material of this course and enjoyed the lecture format. I also really appreciated how Prof. Kyriakides was flexible with how much material he covered per lecture so we never had to rush something in at the end of class. My primary suggestion for improvement would be to add a few more notes and just a bit more text to the lecture slides. I liked that the class was very focused on figures and experimental results, but they weren't always the most clearly labeled. Many times when I would go back to my room to study I would pull up a slide and forget whether a particular experiment was in-vivo or in-vitro, or whether it was an IP or SubCu implant because there were no labels. One other weakness of this class was the organization at the very beginning of the term. I was confused about the first few assignment\/midterm dates because the slides were wrong, and although a corrected version was shown in class I don't think that slide was ever uploaded to canvas. The assigned readings were a similar story. If you didn't write them down in class you were kind of on your own in terms of trying to figure out what they were. I wish there were a definitive document on canvas that was updated with that information (and if there was this year then I must have had a hard time finding it).",
    "I really liked the material in the class but I think it was organized in a haphazard way that was hard to follow. Sometimes the focus was on too much specific detail rather than overarching concepts.",
    "It was a great course with an engaging professor. I can't think of any improvements to be made, except maybe that I wish the professor had more office hours for questions. Also minor, but I wish the reading assignments were posted more clearly (like indicating this is the reading that you should read for this week).",
    "I have nothing but positive thoughts about this class. I think it was well organized, taught in an accessible and engaging way and covered interesting material.",
    "Loved the open-book concept of the class. However the class didn't seem in-depth enough, or not as immersive.",
    "I really liked how the course showed the strengths and weaknesses of current scholarly articles",
    "This course was excellent, and I learned an incredible amount of information. Prof. Kyriakides was always available after class for questions, and he arranged the course so that the work allowed us to get the most amount of information from the class. To improve this course, I would ask that it be changed from the 9am time slot!",
    "There are no weaknesses. Professor Kyriakides was so dedicated to the class. He explained concepts clearly and allowed us to interrupt him in class if we had questions. I think this is probably one of the best BME classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "The lectures for this course were interesting and very informative. Also, having open-notes exams relieves the stress of having to memorize a lot of information without ever really understanding it. I think the open notes exams tested how well we understood the material and not just how much we could memorize. I just wish we would have gotten through all the material that was planned for the semester. Some of the material at the end was a little rushes."

    "It's a good course. Take it if you're interested in anything related to BME",

    "Yes! So interesting and a great elective for BME. Themis is fantastic and the material is so interesting and applicable. Take it!",
    "Class was just learning about research reports done in the professor's field of interest and did not have much structure to it. Only take if you're really interested in foreign body reaction.",
    "I do not recommend this course unless you are great at memorization and have a heavy biology background. This is not an introductory class. The workload was not extremely heavy, but I spent a lot of time preparing for an exam only to score way below the average. You have to be prepared to memorize every word Themis speaks. The exams are graded harshly. 2 Midterms, a Final, and 5 current engineering article responses (1 page each). This class was just not for me. No numbers or calculations or concepts. All rote memorization. Welcome back to biochem.",
    "This class is a great introduction to biomaterials and different types of implants. The class covers a lot of material, but it is very manageable and the workload is not too bad. It is important to keep up with the occasional reading assigned - it's easy to forget that they are there because there are so few and they aren't covered in class. The tests are fair and test what was taught in-class and in the readings.",
    "Yes, overall I would recommend this class to another student who is interested in the foreign body response surrounding biomaterial implants. However, I will caution engineering students (or really any non-biology students) that this class feels like a pure biology class. The material is not difficult to understand so don't be worried at all if you don't have the terminology background, but the tests are more conducive to students who are used to focusing on the small details as opposed to overall problem-solving.",
    "This class was relatively low workload, but the exams required a lot of preparation. It was a good class but it really helps to have a background in biology.",
    "I would definitely recommend BENG 435. The course material is interesting and the professor is engaging.",
    "not a bad course. easy enough. will learn some interesting things. cool prof",
    "This course is an excellent elective, even for someone who's not a BME major! I'm an MB&B major and I could easily follow what was going on in class, even though I had never taken a BME course before. There's a bit of a learning curve to start \"thinking like an engineer\" rather than a biochemist, but you'll pick it up really quickly. Prof K. is really cool and really helpful during office hours. Tests are open note and very fair, as long as you come to class and take really good notes you'll be fine. I would think twice about taking this class if you're planning to miss a bunch of lectures though, the slides are almost impossible to study off of if you haven't been to class, and there's no textbook. Overall the class is awesome though. I would HIGHLY recommend it for pre-meds too, as the class content is kept very up to date with what's going on in the field.",
    "Tes",
    "This is an incredible and engaging course that is not super overwhelming. Grades are determined by 3 exams, which are open-notes, and additionally there are 5 short, straightforward writing assignments. The material is really interesting and the professor is very clear\/very receptive to questions from students.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. I genuinely enjoyed attending each lecture and felt like I was really learning more about the field with each topic covered. I felt that this was a very rewarding class.",
    "A chill senior class if you want something science-y but pretty shallow and not very rewarding.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any engineering student",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! As a mechanical engineering student taking the class, it was difficult at first to follow the unfamiliar terminology. However, as the course progressed, it was very manageable and incredibly interesting.",
    "Yes, you should take this course even if you are not a BME major. The topics are super interesting. The TAs are very supportive. I thought the midterms were not that stressful also.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Although this is a biomedical engineering course, I think that anyone that likes biology would enjoy it."
