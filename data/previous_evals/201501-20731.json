    "CHM 524 is an advanced synthetic methods course with an emphasis on advanced mechanisms and chemical transformations that are not taught in other courses. The material learned in the course is applicable to modern day chemistry and provides the knowledge to design better synthetic routes by gaining exposure to new ideas and concepts. Yes I would recommend the course because it betters oneself as a chemist.",
    "There's not really anything else to take, so, sure. Go for it.",
    "Very helpful class with the class projects and assignments especially!",
    "Depending on the topic of the course, it may be worth taking. I did not find it particularly useful.",
    "Largely a total synthesis class, in the context of learning and applying modern (last 15 years or so) synthetic methods to a total synthesis. Highly recommended for any organic or synthetic chemist."

   "comments": [
    "The course provided a lot of new information that will certainly be of use through my research and future career.",
    "This course exposed me to many advanced topics in organic chemistry and showed me how to successfully write a research grant, which is important for careers in the science disciplines and professions.",
    "Greatly deepened my knowledge of modern synthetic methods and total synthesis. All of this knowledge will be very valuable for my dissertation research and further studies. The independent and group total synthesis projects in particular provided an excellent exercise to learn and apply modern synthetic methods."
