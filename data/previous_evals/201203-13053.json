    "This class was pretty enjoyable. I have no regrets for taking it. I affectionately referred to it as \"scrapbooking club\" to my friends. One of the most valuable parts of this class is that you get to explore Yale's amazing collections. We saw brains, old student scrapbooks, Holocaust video testimonies, and a number of awesome guest speakers. Also the class was tiny--only nine people this semester--so you get plenty of individual attention. That being said, it's definitely not a traditional class. You don't learn facts or techniques in any normal sense of the word. If you get frustrated by disorganization or talking about feelings, this isn't the class for you.",
    "Studies in Visual Biography is a course that combines looking at first-hand accounts (diaries, scrapbooks, letters) and creating your own narratives (in films, collages, and graphic designs). It's a wonderful creative outlet and encourages you to think in a non-linear way. You also meet really interesting people in this class, who become some of your best friends and who inspire you to do great work. Definitely take this class!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone. I want to take this class every semester. I am worried I have already taken the best class at Yale.",
    "This Freshman Seminar is hard to summarize. We had class in many different locations (i.e. Beinecke, Grove Street Cemetery) and had many guest speakers, from filmmakers to photographers to collectors of visually biographical information. Basically, class was the same and was never boring. We did an art project weekly and were always expected to stand proudly and confidently behind our work. Even if you do not consider yourself \"artistic\" or \"creative,\" take this class. It teaches you to become a better learner and observer of the world and inspires confidence in a supportive and challenging classroom environment, which is great for a first college class.",
    "Visual Biography is an extremely comfortable way to dip your toes into the art world at Yale. There's a weekly creative assignment (collage-style pieces done in a journal and short films), some of which will require more time than others. However, you'll end up liking Jessica and caring about the class so much that you want to devote yourself to making something meaningful. Speaking of which, Jessica (or Professica, as she became known) is wonderful! Thanks to her moderation, weekly critique discussions always remained constructive and useful for the student artist, and were usually entertaining, too. (Also, she brought breakfast every week for our 8 am class.)I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. Beprepared to put in the time and thought that the assignments deserve, but also know that regardless of your technical skill, you'll be taken seriously, given excellent advice from your peers and your professor, and you WILL improve as an artist. Most of us began the class interested in art but not (yet) serious artists, so there was no real intimidation factor. As a bonus, we took lots of field trips to on-campus galleries and exhibitions, so you'll be exposed to the abundant art resources here at Yale!",
    "Yes, it is a class that explores scrapbooks and videos through various art forms. Almost every week their is a trip outside of the classroom to view one of Yale's collections."
