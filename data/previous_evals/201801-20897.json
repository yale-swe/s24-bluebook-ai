    "Extremely well-organized and well-taught. Plenty of difficult material, but the structure of the class makes it much more approachable and less stressful. No major weaknesses come to mind.",
    "I am not a very big \"powerpoint presentation learner,\" though I know some people are. However, for me, less calculations on the slides and more written out would have been helpful",
    "This class introduces some of the most important technologies in water and wastewater treatment processes. Great!",
    "it is very systematic and well-developed. I think it is a good course.",
    "More practical applications",
    "Workload was high, which was a strength and weakness because I feel like I would have spent more time on problems if I had longer on the problem sets, but also learned a lot from the difficulty level."

    "Yes, but some topics were not relevant for everyone looking for a higher level understanding of treatment processes.",
    "Absolutely. Whatever a students exact focus in the environmental field is, the material is likely to be useful. Meny does a great job teaching it and makes it an overall pleasant experience.",
    "Yes. I think for the length of the classes, the amount we learned was comparable. It was very well taught.",
