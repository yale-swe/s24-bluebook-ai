   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend this course even if you are not interested in journalism.",
    "If you've spent years in journalism, AND you have extensive knowledge of finance, this class is not for you. If only oneof those applies, then you will be bored some of the time but will still manage to learn things. If neither applies, then you are totally fine, since Prof. Herman goes over every concept approx. 100 times by the end of the semester.Strengths of the class: GREAT guest speakers (and field trips to NY, which are optional). Not much reading (and you can get away without doing the reading, anyway). Interesting essay topics. Prof. Herman cares SO much about the class and is really invested in it.Weaknesses of the class: Repetition. Too many journalism basics (e.g. ledes) for those who have spent time at a newspaper. Prof. Herman cares so much about the class that he sends multiple emails every day, which is a bit overwhelming.Overall, a fun class -- just think about what your current levels of experience are and how much you want to learn in the class...",
    "Introduction to financial journalism and a chance to meet cool journalists and investors along with some really interesting field trips.Yes - definitely a recommended course, provided you know going into it that's not an academic experience as much as it is a chance to have some interesting conversations about the future of journalism and the state of finance with practitioners. Prof. Herman is really sweet and goes out of his way to help students however he can - really cool moments from field trips to the WSJ to going to sally's pizza with one of the most famous investors in the country (jim chanos).",
    "Take this course. No question. Herman does a fantastic job of weaving together concepts of business and media to deliver weekly topics which are interesting to even those not destined for a career on Wall Street or in journalism. Your writing will improve and your knowledge of the classes two main topics will also grow.",
    "Take it, take it. The class and Tom Herman are gems. He knows a lot and conveys it well, and the speakers and field trips are one-of-a-kind. We had Joanne Lipman, Jim Chanos, Linda Greenhouse...and went to Goldman, Bloomberg, the New York Stock Exchange and the Fed on field trips. It's sweet.",
    "If you want to be a journalist, take this class.",
    "I would. You get to meet a ton of influential people in the industry and come away learning something.",
    "If you are interested in journalism take this class it's great. If you are interested in the economy take it because it is important to understand how financial journalism works and how stories are covered.",
    "Great fun course with interesting discussion. take it if interested in either press or business or finance",
    "If you're interested in journalism and\/or economics at all, take it.",
    "Great for student journalists. You meet a lot of successful journalists from the WSJ and NYT. I learned much from my peers and the professor and loved to write in this class; might write for some student publications next semester. It's also a very interesting topic -- business and the financial world."
