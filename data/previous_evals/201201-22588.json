    "Japanese 151 is the L5 Japanese class that continues from Japanese 150.The two are very similar: kanji quizzes every class, a variety of readings taken from actual Japanese sources, the occasional speech or essay, and so on.The Japanese department at Yale, in general, is organized, challenging, and will teach you the language. If that's what you're looking for, and you choose the class that's right for your level, you'll love it! I know I did.",
    "L5 Japanese is a fun, tight-knit class that really focuses on upping our reading comprehension and speaking abilities so that we can become more fluent in Japanese. I would highly recommend it. The homework may be time-consuming, but it really does prepare you for the tests, which are very fair. There are plenty of opportunities the senseis and TAs offer outside of class to practice speaking. Class is always interesting and engaging and you become pretty close, as each section has only around 7 people. Definitely take this class if you can!"
