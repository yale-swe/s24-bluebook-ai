   "comments": [
    "If you're MB&B, you probably have to take this, so let me just assure you that it's easier than PChem and that's about all there is to say about it.",
    "Only taking this if you take the major, or at least I'd assume. Pretty good class in terms of not too much work but still also very interesting. Enrique is pretty hilarious.",
    "You'll be introduced to a lot of cool new technologies and concepts, but it might be up to you to teach them to yourself :\/",
    "This course is great for taking a lot of the information you learn in biochemistry and PChem and explaining how it all works together. You probably have to take it if you're an MB&B major (unless you take PChem II), but it's actually a really enjoyable class. Professor De La Cruz is the best science lecturer I've had at Yale, and he's great at making complex information understandable. Professor Sindelar is extremely helpful about answering questions and explaining confusing topics.",
    "This class is fine. If you spend some time thinking about the concepts you realize they are quite useful. The problem is motivating yourself to spend some time doing so. The matter is really useful for reading papers (particularly ones about enzyme kinetics and xray\/cryo EM).",
    "You have no choice if you are an MB&B major. It's a bearable class.",
    "I would only take this class if you're very interested in learning biochemical lab assays. This course could be dry and may go into these subjects too in-depth for some students, yet the professors do a good job at making the content accessible and enable.",
    "If you're taking it you have to take it. It's pretty good though. Midterm and final are each half of the grade.",
    "EDLC is cool, his lectures are interesting, and he's willing to admit that he doesn't know everything. Chuck is the opposite of cool, but he's very likeable. His lectures are more complex and so it's more difficult to judge his teaching (but I never understood everything and I'm not sure I was supposed to). Exams are easier than the material. Don't worry about them. It isn't too much work, psets are chill, and the papers we read aren't too difficult. I still couldn't really tell you what biophysics is, though, and I'm an MBB major.",
    "Yes! Take it!",
    "This course is a lot of fun. You have to put in some work, but it's a lot less than many science courses and a lot more enjoyable. Don't be intimidated because you've never heard of biophysics!",
    "2nd half is so annoying. 1st half is great.",
    "Straightforward and interesting material, although I would not consider it a cornerstone of your understanding of molecular biology. Helpful TAs defined my experience and really supplemented what was sometimes sparse lectures, particularly by Professor Sindelar. Good luck!",
    "This course will feel much more relaxed than either of the biochemistry courses. That doesn't mean it will necessarily easy; you have to pay attention in lecture, especially during the latter half of the semester. I learned a lot in the class but wished we could have gone into greater depth on the topics.",
    "If you're taking this class for Enrique, that's understandable (totally worth it), but be weary of the second half. I probably wouldn't take it unless you're an MBB major. The material is pretty interesting but I taught myself everything for the second exam which was frustrating. ALSO, this year the exam was on the LAST time slot, so if y'all are trying to make it to myrtle on time look into rescheduling it earrrrrrrrrlyyyyy so you can get you can have sufficient time to celebrate the absurd number of stem requirements you just completed.",
    "You probably have to take it. De La Cruz's half was good, Chuck Sindelar's half was not so great. The material was hardly taught. That being said, I liked the material from Chuck Sindelar's half much more.",
    "You'll probably have to take it, and you'll likely enjoy it. The tests are much less harder than you'll fear that they might be, but definitely study hard.",
    "Overall, I am glad that I took MB&B 302. True, it is necessary to complete the MB&B major, and it can sometimes feel like a drag; however, I really felt like I learned how modern biochemistry measurement techniques worked. The material can be dry and sometimes very rough, but if you really sit through and try to understand the material, it is very very cool.",
    "Yes!! It was totally fine and required for MB&B. Actually quite refreshing compared to other requirements. Learn interesting stuff and get to look into the physics of MB&B."
