    "my favorite class at yale. awesome professor. great material. weekly assignments and quizzes but all doable and not terribly strenuous. weekly discussions were always interesting, fun, and informative.",
    "Every week you read 2 or 3 papers on a topic in cognitive psychology, complete the reading response by 9 pm the night before class, and then discuss them for the first half of class. During the second half of the seminar the professor gives a short lecture about the topic for next week. This is an awesome, relaxed seminar with really fun, interesting material, and rewarding discussions. It was sort of a random sampling of ideas in the field but each one was interesting in its own right. I didn't walk away with a coherent idea of how thinking works, by any means, but this class definitely changed my perspective on my own thought process.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It's an absolute must. Professor Ahn is amazing and super funny. The content covered in class is incredibly relevant to situations we face in our daily lives. also, the format of the course allows for meaningful discussions and participation is key.",
    "This is my favorite class I have taken at Yale. The material is interesting, the workload is very manageable, and the class structure works well (half discussion, half lecture). Also Professor Ahn is really hilarious, and class time flew by for me. I was sad to have it end!",
    "Yes! Professor Ahn is lots of fun. The class is basically an hour of discussion and an hour lecture, followed by a 10 minute quiz on the day's lecture. There will be questions before every class on the reading that you should probably clock 3-5 hours for. The reading is not generally difficult, though. Focuses mostly on the shortcomings of humans in rational thinking. Very Cog Sci oriented. You read 2-3 studies for every class and critique. Two 10 pg papers.",
    "YES! Definitely take it. It will change the way you think about your mind in many areas of your life."
