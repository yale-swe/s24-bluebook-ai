   "comments": [
    "Yes, it goes over all the basic math you will encounter as an engineer. You will cement in your brain all of the mathematical knowledge that you forgot from undergrad.",
    "Yeah, this is a core courses.",
    "This course covered most useful mathematical methods required in engineering. I would highly recommend it to another student.",
    "Summary: 4 advanced level math courses combined into one crash course, complete with the homework and time commitment of 4 courses.No, I would not recommend this course to other students whoare not required to take it. This is due to the major time commitment required to succeed in this course.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend this course to all engineering students! This course not only lay a foundation for the future research work, but help students recollect what were taught in the past!",
    "An overview of graduate level math in one semester. I would not reccommend this course as I did not come away with retained knowledge as i had hoped due to the sheer volume of material and the rapid pace (i.e. covering PDEs, which is normally a 1 to 2 semester course in 1 week).",
    "I think it is useful, I will recommend it to others.",
    "It is a difficult class and requires a lot of time commitment.",
    "Be prepared to spend a lot of time doing work. The material will be stimulating, but also extremely challenging.",
    "You will learn A LOT of material, but it has a steep learning curve and you are often left to learn many things on your own.",
    "Summary: Calculus^2I would recommend the course to a student who felt like the material covered would be useful to them as they progressed through graduate school.",
    "Yes, the math is essential for graduate school.",
    "I will recommend this class to students who have a good background in Mathematical Methods, and would like to have a systematic review of all the main topics.",
    "Since this course is a general overview of engineering mathematics topics, I would suggest this course to be taken by first year students",
    "Yes. Because I will learn everything I need for engineering classes.",
    "Absolutely not, I would say avoid at all costs. For the amount of time that you spend on all the homework, reading and understanding the textbook, the professor doesn't even meet you halfway by setting the exam questions correctly. Why would anyone want to take this class?"

   "comments": [
    "M research is very mathematical, so this was a great course for refreshing my math knowledge.",
    "Help a lot.",
    "My research discipline has a high requirement in math. This course is very helpful to my research.",
    "As a professional returning to graduate school, I can say with 100% certainty that this course did not remotely contain any skills that I will use, or have used, as an engineer in industry. While it may possibly help enhance my baseline understanding that will enable success in other courses or research, I can not yet say this conclusively. I believe that this course should not be requirement, and my time would have been better spent taking a course with more applicability.",
    "This course is very helpful for quantitative calculation of my research.",
    "Was not very applicable to my work,",
    "I do not foresee myself using most of the information gained in the class, as much of it was not application based but more theory. It is good to know that some of the more applicable material could be applied in the future if needed.",
    "I am unsure as to how much of the knowledge I gained I will have to use. I learned A LOT... unfortunately the knowledge might not be applicable to biomedical engineering.",
    "There are certain mathematical concepts relating to heat transfer I now have a greater appreciation for. My research will be improved through a thorough introduction of vector calculus and matricies.",
    "The course does not contribute ti my research but helped my critical thinking ability.",
    "This course introduced me for the first to complex analysis, and this topic was extremely helpful to understand some theoretical aspects of the subject I'm dealing with for my research.",
    "This did not deepen knowledge and understanding, but rather revisited past topics throughout the undergraduate courses. An understanding of engineering mathematics will help and contribute to dissertation research although currently there was not a direct connection between this coursework and my research",
    "Not known",
    "It didn't, sad to say. It was almost like there was so much information to cover, that it was hard to really deepen any area of specific knowledge. It was a fast-paced class with a lot of work, and if you've seen the information before, you're in luck. And if you haven't, don't depend on Dr. Ahn or the textbook to teach it to you.",
    "It helps review mathmatical terms as i am a chinese",
    "This course gave me knowledge of the existence of many engineering math tools, though not a working understanding of any of them."
