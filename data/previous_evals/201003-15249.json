   "comments": [
    "If you've taken French in high school and want to start back up again, this course is the right level. You cover a lot of grammar and some random vocabulary. About 3 books and 3 movies are covered. There are a lot of online exercises to do, which can get very tedious and time-consuming.",
    "For the love of God, don't take this class unless you have to.",
    "L3 French is a good overview of what you learned in L1 and L2. You read some good books, and expand your vocabulary throughout the semester to help become more conversational in French. Not the most effectively organized course, but you have to take it to get to more advanced courses.",
    "Take it if you're good at language at don't want to work to hard to get a good grade.",
    "I would recommend it with the warning that it has a much more academic focus than a practical one. The program shifts away from the all-around utility of 110-120 and toward a focused program of reading and comprehension. This is useful for those who want to learn French for research purposes, but students seeking to use the language actively might be disappointed.",
    "I would recommend it if you have to take it and like french but its not easy",
    "French 130 is a requirement\u0097or, at least, it was for me\u0097and so it's hard to recommend against it. But the structure of French 130 is frustrating and ineffective, for both student and instructor. I would recommend Aaron Schlosser as an instructor; I would hesitate to recommend the course French 130."
