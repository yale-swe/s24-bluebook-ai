   "comments": [
    "This is a really interesting class about an interesting period in Roman history. The expectations of reading are very high, especially considering the weekly quizzes in section (which to be fair are pretty easy but still require a little preparation). Johnston is so cool and really engaging and clearly loves what he does.",
    "A great outline of roman imperial politics and culture",
    "If you love learning about ancient civilizations or history in general, this is a class you will want to take. You will learn to learn and love the Roman Empire from a new perspective and it will really help you understand why cultures\/societies are the way they are today. I would 100% recommend it to another student. The workload is manageable and if you go to lecture everyday and office hours, you should be fine in the class.",
    "Take this class!",
    "Best class I've taken so far at Yale (second to the Roman Republic, also with Professor Johnston). Take them both, and get a thorough and fascinating learning experience about one of the most important cultures in world history. I think that the Roman Empire would be a great foundation for students who want to study any kind of history, because you learn so much about historiography and source analysis. TAKE IT!",
    "A great class to learn so much about the Roman empire, whether you're coming in with nothing or a very detailed knowledge. The professor is amazing and has very interesting and deep ideas to present. The source readings allow you to go as deep as you want and have time for. A really enjoyable class, and a good writing credit too (about the same work as the regular section, but with more workshopping).",
    "YES. If you have an interest in ancient history (which is still surprisingly relevant you'll find out), major or not, take this class. You'll like Prof. Johnston so much that procrastinating on your essays will actually make you feel guilty that you didn't submit the best work to him.",
    "Yes absolutely. I took it because everyone should know about ancient Rome, and now I do, and I'm thankful for it. Johnston is an incredibly dedicated teacher and obviously brilliant. You couldn't ask for someone better to learn about it from. This made for a good 5th class for me, not too much work, and I started it credit\/D but ended up switching.",
    "If you are interested in history or classics, then this is definitely a class you should take. If you are looking for an indepth history elective, however, then this might not afford you the thoroughness of some more specific course offerings. However, take a class with Professor Johnston if you ever get the chance--he is one of the best teachers at Yale.",
    "I would recommend taking this if you have any interest in Roman history! Readings are alright, and you don't really have to do them all. And the lectures are interesting, with lots of ppt visuals.",
    "If you are at all interested in Roman history, or even if you just need a history or writing credit I would strongly recommend taking this class. Professor Johnston is fantastic and the material is incredibly fascinating and in-depth. The class is graded fairly and there isn't an excessive amount of work (midterm, final, 2 papers, and short weekly quizzes in section) and the reward is more than worth it. If you hate history it may not be for you, but if you have any interest in the subject (or even if you don't) I would still recommend taking the class at some point if you have room.",
    "The Study of Rome from the assassination of Julius Caesar to the beginnings of the Byzantine Empire. Take it."
