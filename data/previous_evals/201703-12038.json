   "comments": [
    "The most informative session was on the publishing process, which is valuable knowledge.",
    "I learned what constitutes an important research question and a good piece of publication in political science. This course is also helpful in familiarizing the students with the publication process and with each other's academic interests. I wish this course were offered when I was a first-year student.",
    "great discussions on the qualities of outstanding research papers",
    "I gained real, practical insights into the process of securing publication - the kind of thing no one ever dares to write down. I also had the chance to think about how to do research in a very meta-way, and brilliant feedback from fellow students on my proposals as well as the ability to learn from seeing them grappling with the same challenge of research design as I was.",
    "Advice for writing a good journal article.",
    "This was an important course in moving from thinking like a student to thinking like a researcher, with good introductions to the publication\/ journal process, basic guidelines and great feedback.",
    "I learned about approaches to writing and publishing an article-length paper in political science, as well as considerations when speaking to different audiences and interests.",
    "I developed insights into how to develop a specific research question appropriate for a journal-length article.",
    "What a proper research question should look like.",
    "This course gave me insight into the academic paper publication process, helped me become a more productive critic of works in progress, and encouraged me to seek and respond to feedback from multiple perspectives."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "More sessions like the one on the publishing process would be helpful, on various parts of academic life that we don't really get taught about elsewhere. Perhaps that will come in the spring (giving an effective presentation, etc.), and perhaps some of it is outside of the scope of the course, but I feel that the lack of teaching of these sorts of skills is one of the omissions in the program.",
    "This course is carefully planned, and class meetings are well-coordinated. Besides offering useful guidance in class, the professors also make sure that students are not burdened by assignments and have enough time to do independent research.",
    "detailed discussion of everyone's proposal",
    "I think this is a mature course that has been refined over time and it shows it. I honestly don't know how it could be improved. It worked really well.",
    "The advice from Ian and Greg was very useful. Class was well organized and felt like a good use of time. I wish some students would have engaged more in class. It felt like about one half or three-quarters of the class was engaged, but it was aggravating to read and try to assist the projects of some students who so clearly were disengaged from the projects of others. This problems is certainly not the fault of the professors, but perhaps it could be addressed.",
    "Strengths: In class feedback was hugely helpful Weaknesses: With half the room divided on methods and opinions from the other, it is hard to know what to leave or take in pursuing a project.",
    "It has been great so far. Probably because of our large cohort size, the discussion seemed somewhat less focused at times (too many disparate thoughts). The second part of the course will likely address this, but getting together with students who share similar expertise may help. (Of course, getting feedback from the broader audience has been essential, but perhaps as an addition.)",
    "Strengths: -- active engagement and feedback from the professors -- terrific class discussion in which most of the class provided feedback on research projects Weaknesses: -- might have been helpful to encourage discussants and others to put their feedback\/criticisms in writing in addition to the verbal discussions",
    "This version of the course seems to be optimized given the purpose of Research and Writing in general. Prior to classes where we discussed proposals, each class meeting had a clear point and topic. It never seemed like the class meetings were a waste of time. The weakness was perhaps in the size of the class, which limited the amount of time spent discussing each project, but that probably cannot be helped.",
    "It may have been too hand-holdy, but I think it could have been helpful to have a checklist of what we should be doing throughout the semester to make sure we are constantly iterating on our projects. While I appreciated the format in the second half of the semester, it would have also been helpful to have an outline of a variety of interesting ways we could make progress\/iterate on our papers."

    "Yes, since it's required. But it's also useful to have a course that pushes students to do some actual research early on as a graduate student."
