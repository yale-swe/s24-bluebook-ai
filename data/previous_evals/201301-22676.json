   "comments": [
    "Its a fine class. Take it so you can move on to level 5.",
    "The class focuses on speaking rather than writing, although we learned a great deal of grammar. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "It's considerably harder than L3 but I did get better at Spanish",
    "I would call it a better continuation of Spanish 130. Grammar-focused with a good expansion of vocabulary while exploring culture through literature and media. I would definitely recommend it because it is very helpful.",
    "I would. It is a great way to hone in your spanish language skills.",
    "Yes. I thought I should go to L5 directly and was upset to get a 4 on the placement. Having gone through L4, I must say the experience has helped my Spanish improve.",
    "If you have to take it take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone wanting to learn Spanish.",
    "The beginning half is like spanish 130 in that you do the workbook every night and you get tested on grammar. In the second half of the semester you read a short novel and focus on oral presentations.",
    "Worth taking. Unlike Span 130, 140 has much more literature and media involved and you learn more about cultures and politics rather than constantly reviewing grammar. Its a great class if you are looking to improve your spanish skills.",
    "Spanish 140 is better than 130 in that we are given less busywork homework to turn in daily. Having class every day was hard for me, but you will definitely become more comfortable with spanish in this course."
