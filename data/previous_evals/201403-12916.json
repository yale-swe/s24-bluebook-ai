    "This is a great seminar, and while there is a lot of reading, the light workload makes it worth it.",
    "The class analyzes the role of the spectator in viewing art, focusing mostly on painting, photographs, and film. The class was a unique experience because of its small size and unique topic. I really enjoyed spending class at the Center for British Art and watching films. The class is not for everyone, but I would recommend it to some students.",
    "This course explores the spectator's relationship with several forms of media. It exposes you to several theories from a lot of traditional and contemporary thinkers. A student starts by analyzing landscape portraits, and ends with Hitchcock's \"Psycho\". It might seem like a strange paradox, but these two forms of art have a surprising amount of attributes in common. I would recommend this class to a student, but only if they are willing to take the subject seriously. One finds that they can take what they learned about art, panoramas and film and apply to many different situations."
