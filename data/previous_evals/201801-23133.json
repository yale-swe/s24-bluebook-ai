   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot.",
    "Coming into this course as a first-year never having taken a writing-intensive course at Yale, I feel like I have definitely improved my writing skills and I feel more secure about writing papers for other classes in the future. Class discussions with Professor Park were also always extremely interesting, and I've never had to think about empathy through so many lens before.",
    "I learned how to craft a written claim, lay out my argument, and engage with literary material on a deeper level.",
    "Learned a lot about formulating a strong argument and outlining it with a logical flow. English 114 really helps hone your skills far beyond the high school level and teaches you to create nuanced arguments. In this particular section, I learned so much more about empathy, everywhere from its historical origins to neuroscientific mechanisms. We read a bunch of fascinating texts including Anne Fadimans A Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, Toni Morrisons Recitatif, and many others.",
    "I learned a lot about how to improve my writing, how to come up with strong arguable claims, and how to structure my essays.",
    "Writing academic papers",
    "Knowledge of how to write academic papers",
    "I learned how to structure a strong argument, by introducing the entirety of the argument early on and then developing as the essay progresses.",
    "How to write in every way! Structure, flow, interesting stances.",
    "Gained more confidence in writing. Definitely learned how to structure an essay and how to write a convincing thesis.",
    "I learned how to properly revise and edit my writing. I also learned about empathy and how it has influence in culture, medicine, and society at large. I was able to understand some of the limits of empathy and some of the implications of these limits."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I wish the discussions were more interesting.",
    "Prof Justin Park is a fantastic professor and this course was amazing with him. If you can get into the class, TAKE IT! Youll think about empathy in a new light after the class, and youll also learn so much about writing. As a whole, English 114 does have a rigid schedule and sometimes the turnaround time for papers is tight.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is that it is a very interesting topic with good readings, and great discussions. It also helps improve your writing. One weakness is that at times it felt that the readings were a bit two much (we had to read the two books for this class right after each other, and it was a time that was already really busy for me, so I didn't get to enjoy them as much as I could've.)",
    "Longer time on books",
    "The course is strong in going over the tips\/suggestions for good writing, but more time could be spent in peer review.",
    "No weaknesses. Strengths: exposing students to new viewpoints through literature",
    "Would have liked for more close reading vs broad overview\/thoughts about reading. Class discussions were still exciting though. Professor was very willing to help.",
    "Strengths: This course definitely helped me develop my writing, and it was a course that allowed me to learn a lot and have intellectual discussions. Weaknesses: At times there was a little too much reading."

   "comments": [
    "YES",
    "yeah. you should know how to write stuff.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. My writing has definitely improved through it, and I'm so glad that I decided to take it my first year. All the readings were also extremely interesting and definitely manageable.",
    "I absolutely would recommend \"The Limits of Empathy\" to other students. If you can't take this specific class, try and take a class with Professor Park. He is phenomenal.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially with Prof Justin Park.",
    "Yes I would! The course is overall very interesting and eye-opening. It teaches you to think about writing in a new way and we had a lot of great discussions in relation to empathy, the role of emotions in our lives, the different groups found in our society, and how that all relates to each other. I thought that most of the readings were very interesting and relevant and liked how professor Park ran the discussions in class.",
    "Yes because the skills are applicable to future classes",
    "I would recommend this course to any student, but especially STEM students who need a writing credit. The course content is really interesting and applicable to STEM as well.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, because it is a good introduction to developing strong writing.",
    "YES. It was incredibly eye opening, one of my favorite classes at Yale. Writing courses can often feel tedious, however, this was actually a lot of fun. Also, prof Park is SO engaging, teaches writing in a unique way.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to another student. One can learn a lot about empathy and have his or her views changed on different things. It is a great course with a great teacher."
