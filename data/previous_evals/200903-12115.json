   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class. I had no idea that nature writing was such an extensive genre of literature.",
    "I would describe this class as being an interesting introduction to Nature Writing and a chance to do a bit of creative writing too. I would definitely recommend it because Professor Peterson is awesome.",
    "I didn't expect to like this course as much as I did, but it turned out to be one of the most enjoyable seminars I have taken at Yale.The reading list is stellar and the workload is totally manageable; you'll read a few longer works (by the likes of Gilbert White, Charles Darwin, and Henry David Thoreau, for example), quite a few short snippets from a multitude of authors, and then finish up with a longer work by one of those authors, chosen by a class vote (we did John Muir, which was beyond fun to talk about). If you don't enjoy an author, no need to worry - you'll spend only half a class on him or her. It's somehow still enough time under Linda Peterson's guidance, though, to get a fairly good understanding of that author's place in the nature writing canon.The workload is definitely manageable. You'll do three papers, two of which can be creative if you'd like (and I'd recommend at least trying a creative assignment; it's a change-up from the standard analytical paper) and one of which is a new introduction to a work that you'll read. You'll also lead class discussion and do a brief presentation on an author of your choice. Readings are occasionally a little long but are very doable.Professor Peterson really knows her stuff, and she's great at leading discussion and at asking the right questions.I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend the class if you are highly interested in nature, because sometimes it was only my love of birds and snakes that got me through the reading. If you're in it for the literature, it's a mixed bag. Darwin and John Muir are great, but some of the more obscure guys were pretty average, at best. I enjoyed it, but if you have only a passing interest in the topic, read Walden or Voyage of the Beagle on yourown time, you'll get most of the main ideas without all the excess.",
    "It is just really nice to read nature writing for a class. Some of it is beautiful, a lot of it is really amusing, and the class included trips to the BAC and Walden Pond. It was just amazing and I had a lot of profound thoughts about nature. Two of the essays have a creative option so if you want to do some creative writing, this is a great class!",
    "This is a fantastic class, covering its topic with the right balance of breadth and depth. Prof. Peterson is wonderful; she always strikes the right tone, keeping things rooted in the literature and scholarship of nature writing (but not in an excessively academic manner). She's also always ready to strike out in a more philosophical or practical direction. The syllabus is manageable, as are the assignments.",
    "Take this class! It was amazing -- one of my favorite at Yale, in fact. It's not too much work (reading for each class, but it's never overwhelming, three papers, and a presentation). Two of the essays can either be traditional analytic essays or creative papers -- having the creative option was awesome. Professor Peterson will read drafts if you get them in on time, which is also a plus. She is a wonderful professor. Students have a lot of control over the syllabus, since a good chunk of the semester is decided by which authors students want to present on. The class was never stressful, always fun, and I learned a TON. No complaints -- only fond memories. Take Nature Writing!",
    "The course is a survey of the nature writing tradition in English literature from Gilbert White to the present. Professor Peterson is fantastic, and I would recommend this or any other course that she teaches. I would not have shopped this course if an unfamiliar professor had been teaching it, and I am very glad that I took it. The material of the course is pretty interesting, and generally not the sort of thing that English majors are used to studying in our coursework. The reading load is not too heavy, and there are three papers, two of which have a very appealing creative option and all of which are relatively fun to write."
