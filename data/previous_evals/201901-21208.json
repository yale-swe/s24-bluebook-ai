    "This course had a focus in developing connections and comparisons between different schools of thought concerning how to analyze and experience literature.",
    "It was interesting to see literature from different perspectives and actually apply the theory we learned to different works.",
    "You learn about some of the major ways to think about comparing texts in the history of comparative literature.",
    "I learned about different methods of comparison and read some texts that I likely would not have read otherwise.",
    "Reading, analyzing, and comparing literary texts with philosophical texts. Understanding metaphor, difference, sympathy, linguistic and cultural translation, and more.",
    "I learned how to make astute comparisons between different mediums of art and literature. It was great being able to read works across world literature, watch films, and analyze art pieces. The small class size made our discussions enlivening and engaging. Professor Creswell and Professor Tsu are wonderful professors and experienced comparatists who are always willing to help. Every comment they had to offer in class was worthwhile.",
    "I learned about a variety of modes of literary comparison."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course would definitely be improved if it were more structured. I honestly had trouble keeping up because I didn't know what to look for when reading. Sometimes I would focus on one aspect of the reading and then the entire class revolved around a separate issue I hadn't had the time to think about before hand.",
    "It was interesting, but it didn't always feel very organized. There was a lot left up in the air sometimes and the professors didn't always seem to fully be engaged.",
    "The reading list was really great for the most part (although this of course will vary based on personal preference). Some weeks were less effective than others at carrying the main threads of the course. I particularly found the weeks on taxonomy, science fiction and ekphrasis not very compelling in continuing the dialogue of the course (although the readings were great for these weeks). I also thought class discussion could have been better. This of course depends upon who is taking the course, but at times it felt that class discussion was lacking because people either did not do the reading in depth or did not contribute enough. The reading responses were due too early in the week, which lead me personally to do the reading very early the week before, so by the time class started, I did not feel as prepared as I would have if I could have spaced the reading out a bit more. Perhaps have reading responses due every 2 or 3 weeks on any topic that may have been covered during those weeks to help with this.",
    "The course could become really interesting given its subject matter, but the way it was run made it just extremely not conducive to student learning. Most times, the entire class section was discussion, but it became discussion that fell between the two professors who co-taught the class where it felt like students just became silent listeners and watchers of these two having a conversation. I wasn't really sure every week, what exactly we were supposed to get out of that week's reading or the class. Many of my fellow classmates agreed that the class would have been better either was just 1 Professor teaching it, or if there must be 2, at least 2 who meshed better in teaching style than Professor Creswell and Professor Tsu. It seemed that they never really got their collective groove quite right while teaching the class, making for some pretty stilted and awkward class discussions. Also, there was a reading response due every week two days before the class met, making it really stressful to try and finish the reading AND the response extremely early.",
    "The readings for this course were really great. I felt like I got a good idea of the many different ways to compare from week to week. The seminar style facilitated good discussions and everyone had insightful comments. The response papers were hard but helped tease out ideas and improve writing a lot. Some weaknesses were that it felt a little disorganized. There was no clear criteria for the response papers and sometimes discussion was too unstructured. Some classes it was the case that we would come in to class having no background knowledge of the author or the text, so one of the professors would have to spend a long time explaining historical contexts etc., which maybe we could have looked at beforehand.",
    "This course felt disorganized. It was a seminar, but the conversation did not flow very naturally. It would have been improved by a some organization (lecture followed by questions\/discussion is what long seminars usually have). It lacked a cohesive element. It felt like we were reading random assortments of literary criticism, but we did not read very much actual literature and when we did, it did not feel particularly relevant. As a result, I often did not know what to write about in the weekly responses. Because it is a requirement for the major, I think the course needs serious improvement."

   "comments": [
    "As this course is a requirement for the literature major, some people may not have a choice. But I did find myself wondering what it would have been like to take the translation or film course substitutes, as this class was hard to enjoy.",
    "If you want to major in comparative literature, yes because it's required.",
    "The course was honestly better than the majority of other required seminars for other majors (at least comparing how I felt to how people described other seminars). You will at the very least discover some interesting texts and occasionally be challenged to think in a way. That said, the course seemed to lose its steam after break and many of the connections we made in the earlier parts of the course were not continued very well.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student - some students in the major have to take the class, so there's not really much of an option. I just feel that (and in conversation with other students from this class, it seems to be a shared sentiment), we aren't really sure what we got out of this class, and it wasn't engaging. As far as classes at Yale go, it's not the worst - but, if you don't have to take it, definitely find another one that will both teach you more and be more fun."
