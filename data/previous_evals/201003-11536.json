    "Question 6: when I say the class moved a little fast I'm referring to covering a great amount of material over the semester, not the actual speed of class or material presented at any one given time. I would have liked to delve deeper into fewer cases than have covered more cases in less depth.",
    "I thought the group papers were extremely beneficial to working through each case study, but I the problem sets felt like busy work.",
    "I didn't know how to evaluate all the TAs, but just wanted to mention they were all very helpful and responsive to questions.",
    "Nice way to learn about water issues in several different locations.Instructors are very knowledgeable and present a good overview of the material.",
    "This course was team-taught; the caliber of instruction was not uniform. Gentry and Anisfeld were excellent. Raymond was quite good as well. Zimmerman was not an effective lecturer and came off as confrontation and condescending in tone.The course is billed as integrated; there was little evidence of integration - this was more multi-disciplinary than interdisciplinary and professors were not always on the same page. Each person taught their section; there was no enhancement of bringing two or more perspectives together on one point or issue",
    "Question 1 and 2: clearness of instructors' explanations varied according to their backgrounds and the particular intricacies and details of each case.I was disappointed that the only field trip was scheduled on a Thursday rather than on a Friday when students would be more available. I think a really involved field trip would really contribute to this course.",
    "3. The case studies\/group projects were very helpful. The individual problem sets were less so.",
    "3. The assignments seemed to involve random tasks that we didn't actually cover in the lectures.6. At times, the instructors rushed through the materials because we didn't have enough class time to go through everything.",
    "This course was taught by a total of 4 professors and 4 TA's. While the general organizational structure was sufficient- actual class sessions were poorly constructed. We had teachers disagreeing with each other; no consistency in what teachers were saying or communicating. The same goes for grading- very few valuable comments were given. The levels of students dramatically differed- so you did not learn from your groups, much time was spent teaching students in your group, which is either something the professors should have done or the TA's but not fellow students. A lot of the students had NO science background at all, or any relevant background and weighed the groups down--so again, the professors should have compensated for this, rather than just having other students do this. Also about 48% of the class grade is on group assignments--again, turns out, many students are either lazy or have no useful background at all- no one learns from having such student in a group--its not real world simulation at all. Going to class was a struggle- the professors were not coherent or open to comments- and would be shocked if you pointed out something to the contrary of what they said. Professors also forced students to use an artificial \"though diagram\" which was not helpful, after being told that these causal loop diagrams are not always relevant professors did not adjust or show alternatives. No real tools were introduced-- just the same tool, which wasn't really a tool-- which was: to write a report summary with solutions.",
    "Overall this was an exceptional course. It was a privilege exploring this challenging subject matter with our four professors, each of whom brought considerable expertise and insight to each case study. The group assignments were a valuable exercise in team work, but the number of total case studies made the work load pretty heavy, and there were not adequate opportunities to give feedback about actual group dynamics (next time may I suggest anonymous group evaluations). It was great getting to work with real (and timely) resource management challenges and explore problem solving approaches. I think this class is tremendously valuable, and greatly appreciated its water focus- it would be fantastic to see this approach expanded to other resource issues (energy, climate change, forest management etc) but I hope FES continues to extend its water related course offerings, as water availability is arguably one of the most pressing natural resource issues of our time. Thank you for a great semester!",
    "The papers for each case were interesting to write and I learned a lot by doing them. However, I was frustrated at times because of the lack of limitations. I felt like I was making solutions up at times, without any consideration of budget or feasibility. It would have been advantageous to have some more guidance when writing our memos so as to make them more realistic.",
    "(1) Sometimes I felt like the professors\/TAs posted the first materials they found on the topic, without doing an exhaustive search to provide us with the best. But a lot of them were very helpful for the assignments.(6) We could have spent more time on each case study (and had fewer studies), and I think we would have benefited.(8) For a trial run, this was a great class. Much to be improved, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.(10) We need more classes on problem solving and case studies!",
    "Question 3: The homework assignments (not the papers) were completly random and out of any meaningful context. They seemed very much like \"busy work\" which did not build on any skills that we were learning in class.",
    "I've already given the profs a great deal of feedback in and out of class, but overall this class was a very good effort at that most tricky of problems, teaching interdisciplinarily. There are some bugs to be worked out--for instance, the challenge of integrating the different instructors' disciplinary perspectives on teaching and lecturing, and focusing the case studies so that they go as in-depth as possible. But overall, I'm glad I took the class.",
    "This course is very promising!Students have a few weeks to consider a specific real problem in environmental management, and propose actual solutions to this problem. There is not a lot of time, there is limited information, and students must work in groups. This is great training for future problem solving. Students must interact in groups where there are different strengths and weaknesses in group members: team members must learn to work together, trust one another and work well in a team. This is a very useful skill.Professors were very responsive to student opinions and ideas. Professors also had very different areas of expertise- it was very instructive to approach cases from different disciplines and perspectives, and to listen to the questions that professors posed to each other.In future courses, it would be helpful to receive more structured responses from professors. Each professor had a different grading system, and paid attention to different elements in the paper. Perhaps in the future, all four professors should refer to a set of specific common grading points, in addition to their own observations. Some suggestions:- How realistic\/plausible\/applicable are the solutions proposed?- How adequately\/insightfully\/completely is the problem defined?- What methods\/systems\/tools are used to understand the problem, define the problem, and compose solutions to the problem?- What perspective\/expertise\/knowledge does the student\/group bring to the problem? is the student\/group aware of the limitations\/advantages that this standpoint affords?I think perhaps what is missing is a methodology for approaching problem solving and problem definition. I am sure there are more than one. Students did not have to be explicit about how they arrived at their conclusions. Prof. Gentry provided a couple of great methods to approach problem solving. All professors provided important insights, issues, tools, information.I think this class was extremely useful and instructive. There is a great variety of knowledge to be learned, including particular concepts from scientific and social disciplines, current events, problem solving methods, specific measuring techniques, team work skills, time management skills. There is much polishing that the course needs, but this is a great start. I hope the professors will continue to collaborate in a course like this in the future."

   "comments": [
    "I really liked learning through case studies and that the speed with which we were required to understand an issue and produce a memo on it mimicked the real world working environment.",
    "Writing group papers for each case study. Despite the initial challenge of working in a group, it forced me to do all the reading and invest time in writing my section of the paper, as my groups was relying on me. It was also helpful to bounce ideas off groups members when coming up with solutions and monitoring options.",
    "The integrated and multidisciplinary approach of the class, as well as the fact that we studied real-time case studies rather than just theory.",
    "The differing viewpoints of all the professors surrounding a single topic - lots of professionals looking at important issues through different lenses. Wonderful case studies, as well.",
    "The case-based nature of the course and the variety of the cases.",
    "The case studies were extremely interesting and very well-chosen; the course was as much about learning how to work in groups and collaborate - absolutely critical in professional realms - as it was learning about freshwater issues.",
    "I loved that students were given the opportunity to hear the opinions of not just one, but four professors. I really liked that all professors attended almost every session. This was incredibly helpful for students who had lecture related questions that the primary lecturer for the day could not answer with certainty. I believe that having this course be team taught meant that the logistics had to prepared well in advance of a lecture. This made the class run incredibly smoothly!",
    "I allowed students to draft management solutions for real life case studies.",
    "Four of the five assignments were groups projects. And since the issues that we had to deal with were all very complicated it was more than great to work on a group and exchanges views and ideas.",
    "This was my only course this semester that actually treated us like adults. The case studies were unwieldy, technically complex, there was lots of information, plenty of disciplines about which we had no background, and yet we were asked to interpret that information into a useful set of recommendations. Sure it may not be publication quality, but it definitely forced us to think on our toes and explore fields that we may not have been exposed to previously. We had to assimilate lots of basic technical information from the fields of water resources, hydrology, some engineering, legal lingo, economics, and ecology. It forced us to see connections between different disciplines that we maybe were not previously aware of, and into thinking about how to reconcile the needs and values of those different disciplines (e.g. why is water-quality monitoring important to ecologists and economists?) and also the values of different stakeholders involved in the issues. The group work was valuable for learning to work well with others and sharing ideas, because we had to reconcile our biases with the biases and interests of others in trying to approach a problem. In a nutshell, I was not interested in water issues prior to this class, but at this point, I'm seriously considering incorporating water resources into my focus atFES.",
    "The five case studies we looked at in this class varied greatly in scope and topic within the 'water world' - great variety.",

Since it was my first semester at FES I found it really helpful to work with other students and see how other people approached an issues and thought it through. It also eased me in to the paper-writing process. I also really enjoyed the cases we studied.",
    "- Great professors- Much appreciated teaching approach- Engaging subject matter",

    "Great course, very wll organized. Having the perspective of each professor on each of the problem was extremely valuable. I wish FES would have more courses like this. Even if water is not your interest, the whole problem solving thing worth taking the class.",
    "Real-world problem solving of complex water resource challenges.",
    "The breath of the material covered. The ability to consider five different case studies. The possibility of working with four professors in one class. The opportunity to both learn, and apply knowledge to real problems.",
    "I loved getting to dig into widely diverse topics from many angles. Getting to write many papers with my group and then complete my own was satisfying. I now know a great deal about the case studies we covered."

   "comments": [
    "I felt that there were too many case studies. I think the instructors could cut one case study and then that would be a good amount (making it 4 total). I also think that maybe at the beginning of the class the professors could have asked students to fill in a form saying what their \"expertise\" is (generally) and then the groups could be made up according to skill set (ie one water person, one technical person, one social science person, etc).The problem sets did not really help me learn because they were so easy. I think they should just be dropped from the class- there was enough work with the papers as it was and I didn't find that they added value. There was a also a lot of confusion with them because TAs didn't know what professors were expecting, questions were worded poorly, etc.",
    "I would include an Economists perspective. It would have been interesting to see that angle on each of the topics.I think the grading structure could use some work. Why is the final paper worth so much of our grade? Why does group evaluation and problem sets account for almost the same portion of our grade as a group paper? I would either not include problem sets, or re-structure them to make them more helpful and relevant to the case studies (like the problem set that was used for the Murray Darling Case).",
    "Because of the multidisciplinary nature of the course, some aspects of case studies were not covered in class or were a little fragmented.",
    "Sensitivity of some professors to controversial topics that may be of importance to some students (i.e. the \"developing world\" fiasco).",
    "Evaluation methods for group-members to evaluate each other were poorly constructed and were not explained to the students. There was no clear sense of improvement as we progressed through the case studies because we did not have a clear sense of how to approach the papers and feedback came from a different professor each time.",
    "I would make changes to only two facets of the course.First, clearly the student evaluations of each other need to be handled better.Second, I truly enjoyed attending the optional field trip to the Whitney Water Treatment Plant. This trip should most definitely be repeated, and required, when this course is offered again. I would also like to see one, or even two, more optional field trips to other water sites that might help students understand the issues that are raised in the StS course. (I don't believe that an optional student funded trip to one of NYC's watersheds would be out of the realm of the reasonable.)",
    "Would like a little more detail in lectures.",
    "The evaluation forms didn't work out and I think the professors should take them out next year. I think it would also be helpful before starting talking about the cases to have one or two classes on the hydrological cycle and some basic geological concepts that are needed for the cases.",
    "I think the structure of the class could be tweaked a bit, though I admit I don't necessarily have any home-run alternatives that I'm ready to suggest. That being said, I think some alternative structures for the papers could be suggested that would help us make them a bit more to-the-point. I think it was unfair to weight 40% of the grade on the individual final paper, since we only dedicated one full class session to the Asian carp, and we had already put in so much work and class time on all the previous case studies. I think 25-30% at the most would be fair. I think there should be one field trip scheduled on a Friday that could help contribute to our understanding.I do feel, however, that the case studies could be chosen somewhat differently. My personal bias, but I found the Cochabamba case study to be the most interesting and allowed us to do the most in offering solutions. The NYC and Asian Carp offered so much information one what had already been done, that it was difficult to see our role in the process, or even a simulated role. So I guess I would have enjoyed more ambiguous, mysterious case studies where the readings could be drawn from multiple disciplines more readily. I did not enjoy readings from the huge management plans at all, but I did enjoy readings from the scientific, social sciences, legal, and anthropology disciplines.",
    "It was somewhat unclear if we should be concentrating on the process or the issue at hand. Because we had so many papers with short turnover times, it was a bit difficult to go very deep into an issue; however, it seemed that we were criticized if we failed at this level.The information offered in the course was extremely interesting, but it was offered at more of a superficial level. At times, it seemed as if we were rushing through lectures and papers. I would have liked to go at a slower pace and delve into some of the issues deeper.It would have been useful to discuss monitoring practices a bit more as it is crucial to have a proper monitoring plan in place when administering conservation campaigns.",
    "Four group papers was maybe one-to-many.",
    "-regulation of independent feed back. Professors: do not be lazy and only allow for group feedback ONCE throughout the whole semester when there were a total of FOUR projects.-professors: find a way to see how each student is doing BEFORE THE FINAL.-come up with an assignment that is original. do not tell us to come up with solutions to a problem that has been addressed thoroughly in literature- while giving us a week with limited resources. this is not the real world. this is not what consultants do at all.",
    "Some of the lectures were a bit too fast and difficult to follow, mostly the engineering related ones. I also felt that most of the homework assignments were not strongly related to the work we were doing\/learning in class and they seemed more like busy-work. It seemed strange to be using complex equations to solve mathematical problems when in class we really didn't focus on this.",
    "- Work load was a little too heavy (maybe only require a total of 3 group project submissions to give groups a little more flexibility and a little less constant work pressure?)",
    "I did not enjoy the discussion sessions in this course. THe room was not suitable for discussions and I never felt comfortable talking in class. I recommend separating into smaller groups for discussions, possibly having one person from each group in a discussion group. THis would facilitate true discussion and conversation.I also thought that some of the material was discussed too quickly. I realize that there was limited time and many cases to get through, but I had a hard time keeping up with some of the lectures, esp those related to finance, technology, and legal tools.Powerpoints were abused. There was too much writing on each slide and it was overwhelming. Powerpoints should be used with pictures and summarized information-it was very frustrating to have an entire lecture detailed on a slide--what would be the point of attending a lecture if no new information is offered orally?",
    "We could have benefited from lectures on the final (take-home) case study, because that was a lot of work for us to do all on our own (research in addition to writing the entire paper, which we weren't used to and may not have timed it well).",
    "smaller class size and more discussion.",
    "Too many slides. The professors tried to include too much material, often showing slides for just a second or two and leaving us in the void as to how important the slides were, or even how to frame a question about their content.",
    "More continuity among lecturers.",
    "Sometimes the assignments are too \"open-eneded\".Prof. Julie can do a much better Job. Sometimes you feel she has some sort of \"attitude\" toward students. She was good at some classes, but at Cochabamba she could had been much better.",
    "Communication amongst the professors involved re: tone of instruction, conflicting instructions on citations in case study papers, etc.",
    "See question 11.",
    "Important information was often presented too quickly or superficially - I often felt that I was not learning much from the in class lectures. It was rare that I felt I was given enough information on a given tool, science, or specialty to claim any real understanding of it. The case studies were great but in the end the only things that I learned were the specifics of the case studies. I do not feel like I know much about managing water, or integrating science into management, more generally.My advice is to have one fewer case study and to then spend more time on each section, really teaching the specifics of a given tool. Readings should include material on management generally, and not just materials for the case studies."

    "I learned more than I expected. Spitting out a giant paper on a new topic every 2 weeks is a huge challenge that taught me to be way more efficient.",
    "The course offered little constructive feedback on how to improve the process as we moved from one case study to the next. Comments were focused more on content than structure of approach or the framework within which the analysis was conducted",
    "Absolutely. I am so glad that I took this course.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes",
    "I learned lots of background science on hydrology, biogeochemistry, the use of causal loops, all of which I didn't know before, and also learned a bit of the legal perspective on water issues that I could certainly apply as a lens to other environmental issues.",
    "No.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes although I'd like to have had a little more background on financial and technological tools.",
    "Yes. And more--I made close friends in my small group.",
    "somewhat.",
    "No, but I had high expectations",
    "yes!!",
    "I think so."

   "comments": [
    "Advantages: getting to know a group of people that I didn't know before, collaborating with a team, sharing ideas, learning from others, etc.Disadvantages: one too many papers so by the end we were exhausted from working together, dealing with a difficult group member, finding times to meet (getting 5 peoples' schedules to line up is EXTREMELY difficult).",
    "Advantages: Shared workload, able to talk through uncertainties or problems (regarding assignments)Disadvantages: Not everyone does the same amount of work, scheduling, small disagreementsOverall I liked working in a group setting. I enjoyed the people I worked with and feel like I got more out of the assignments than if I had done them on my own.",
    "Advantage: Forced me to do all the reading and put in my best effort when writing my section. Allowed room for collaboration and bouncing ideas off each other.Disadvantage: The first paper was extremely challenging to write as a group. Coordinating meeting times was often challenging and it probably took us longer to write the paper as a group than it would have if written individually.",
    "Way too much group work.",
    "Although working in a group was more time consuming and challenging, I really appreciated this aspect of the course because it taught us the practical merits of knowing how to work in a group, led to very interesting discussions and a shared sense of ownership and teamwork that I believe will be essential in our future careers.",
    "Our group dynamic was wonderful. I got to meet several other people who turned out to be really interesting on an individual level, and we also got a lot of work done together. It's great to have other people and other ideas for this type of assignment.",
    "The group work was a very good experience. There were a few frustrations when one person in the group did not submit as high quality work. However, I enjoyed working in the groups and learned a lot from the other group members.",
    "Group work and collaboration is a critical skill to develop. Working in a group for all of the case studies, we had ample time to develop such skills. The consistency of one group throughout the semester allowed us to become comfortable working together.",
    "I was grateful to work in a very diverse group with students' backgrounds which ranged across the FES academic spectrum. As such, I felt that I learned much more about the topics which were presented in this course because we collaborated across disciplines and discussed the material multiple times per week in our groups. With that said, our group met for a minimum of 8 hours per week to work on our group papers. This was a significant amount of time.",
    "I learned a lot of interesting ideas form my classmates.",
    "The advantages were that we could exchange views and ideas and propose creative solutions to the problems. Moreover, my group members were very cooperative and working with them was fun. The only disadvantage was that we didn't agree all the time and we spent time trying to reconcile the different views.",
    "We are forced to consider andincorporate very different ideas and try our best to mesh them with our own preconceived notions of how the world should be. This is without a doubt invaluable training for the real world. It can be very difficult to coordinate and mesh these ideas, which I found frustrating at the time but in retrospect it was very rewarding. You also tend to do work on time (mostly) when other people will hold you accountable.",
    "Advantages: My colleagues introduced me to new software and new ideas.Disadvantages:It was difficult to find time to get together and work on the papers.",
    "As I mentioned above, working as a group over the course of the class was very useful. We progressively improved team rapport and each writing experience went smoother than the last. It was tough when some people were not available to help on certain papers.",
    "See response above.",
    "The advantages of the group work were seeing other student's perspectives on the problem and also being able to come up with far more solutions to the problem than I could have ever come up with myself. It also made the load lighter. The disadvantages were scheduling the meetings and also working with people who preferred to work alone and have less group work time.",
    "It was very helpful. Working in groups is a valuable learning experience, although not always enjoyable. I learned a lot about my strengths and weaknesses from this experience.",
    "Four people may have been the optimal size for these groups, but ours was five and that made things challenging. We also had some personality issues, but that was not related to the way the course was taught.",
    "advantages: creativity, shared workdisadvantages: scheduling to meet difficult",
    "My group was apathetic, which made it a frustrating experience.",
    "It was a great experience. I grew as a team member and gained useful professional skills.",
    "Very helpful to understand your peer views about problems.",
    "TONS of group work...good preparation for team consulting projects, good for thoroughly thinking through ideas, but time-consuming.",
    "I think the work group presented all advantages, as I was forced to learn how to work and interact successfully in a group, with limited resources and time, to produce good work.",
    "Advantages: n\/aDisadvantages: Students with prior background taking over the whole work."

   "question_text": "For students taking this course, what advice would you give them?",
   "comments": [
    "Pick a group of people with whom you know you can get along well with, who are responsible AND responsive and who deliver high quality work. There is a lot of group work, so if you take this class you should enjoy working with others.",
    "Read all the material for each case study and get together with your group early on to formulate a problem statement and outline possible solutions and monitoring efforts. Break the paper into sections and divide and conquer.",
    "Find a good team is the most important",
    "Our group found that it worked well to have each person \"cycle\" through a section of the group papers. That way, everyone got to try and work on a different area (introduction and background, systems analysis, etc.). The group projects go quickly, so it's a good idea to have a weekly meeting, decide on the problem statement, and have everyone agree to submit their section before the deadline so that the paper can be put together and made to flow.",
    "Do the readings. You'll learn a ton and it will be easier for you to participate in your group papers.Students should be aware that this course is going to take a large portion of their academic preparation every week.",
    "be proactive and ask many questions.",
    "If you are interested in policy and water, take the course. Just try to be in a group with people you know they are responsible.",
    "Just keep an open mind, proactively choose your group members early, and set aside enough time early to do the readings. The lectures and the papers were so much easier to benefit from if I had taken ample time to read and think about the cases (as in, 1-2 weeks before writing). But even if you think you may only be tangentially interested in water issues, I would recommend the course because of the opportunity it allows people of different backgrounds and interests to offer creative ideas and actively contribute to the class.",
    "Attend the TA sessions to get assistance on the homework.Do not rely only on the recommended readings for the papers. It will be useful\/necessary to conduct outside research.Set up meetings as soon as possible with your group to ensure you have meetings on the calendar.",
    "-be wary. it really depends on the group you are in- so make sure you have \"friends\" in the class or at least know who is a good student or not, since we are too old to babysit people.-make sure the professors teaching it are in the mood to be interactive",
    "This is a great course and allows you to study some interesting cases on water. It's also a really great opportunity to work in groups and to write papers together. Go to the TA help sessions for the homework - they help a lot. And start working on your group papers early, as it's hard to schedule meeting times sometimes. Lastly, start the final paper early (over Thanksgiving break) and you'll be much happier during finals week!",
    "Pick your group members wisely, and make sure they are good writers!",
    "Pick a good group.",
    "Take it, it was helpful and interesting.",
    "Make sure you work out a clear division of labor\/understanding of how your group will be structured as soon as you can!",
    "Pay attention not only to the specific cases in question, but the skills and knowledge you are learning. If the goal is to become a better environmental practitioner. the skills learned are more important that the final specific solutions proposed in the papers."
