    "I was exposed to a variety of viewpoints from different philosophical thinkers such as Aquinas, Grotius, Hobbes, Pufendorf, Schmitt, and Foucault. As a political science major, this was my first foray into a course with a very strong philosophy component. I was exposed to the thinking of these people and the conditions which influenced them. I learned to look at situations both historical and present day from a long term philosophy perspective. We were walked through the evolution of philosophical thought from ancient Greece to contemporary times. I feel this has made me much more versatile in my ability to examine an event and thus much better at developing successful strategies."

   "comments": [
    "I was truly appreciative of the willingness to examine the roots or basic foundations of political philosophical thinking as well as the directions where it has moved and where it is today. I thought the many historical and contemporary comparisons of conditions that coincided with the theories made the class extremely interesting and pertinent. I also thought the selection of reading material was excellent, as even though it did not make the most sense to me initially, it all coalesced to a very complete, coherent lesson by the end of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It had something to offer for everyone. Students well versed in the views of the great philosophers had the ability to have their views challenged and beginners were provided an excellent opportunity to be exposed for the first time to a tremendous amount of diverse views. It was definitely a course where making sure the student understood the material and be able to effectively participate and enjoy the intellectual exchanges were a top priority. The topics will cover a wide chronological spectrum from ancient Greece, to biblical, the French Revolution, to modern times. I thoroughly enjoyed the topic matter and think other students will as well."
