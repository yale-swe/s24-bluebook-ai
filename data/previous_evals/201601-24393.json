    "Depends on how you do your paper class discussion is good, but the research and writing for the final paper really determines what you take away from this class.",
    "overall great course on the evolution of Indian thinkers throughout the past century or so. would have liked more readings on the historical context in which these thinkers were writing, but otherwise very illuminating",
    "Professor Mantena is one of the best political theorists\/intellectual historians at Yale, and a wonderful person. Her grasp over the material is unusually strong, and is evident in her very insightful comments throughout class. Having a mix of graduate students and undergrads worked very well, and Professor Mantena attracts a strong set of graduate students with a lot to add to discussion. The material is essential to read for anyone interested in the history of ideas in South Asia. Not sure if this class will ever be offered again in this form, but if it is, must take for those interested in non-Western intellectual history\/political theory or modern South Asia.",
    "Definately take the class if you are interested in South Asian political theory. Mantena is a wonderful professor who keeps discussion very interesting.",
    "This is a class that could be great but isn't."
