    "Hindi is an interesting and useful language to add to your arsenal, and learning it with Seemaji and Swapnaji is a stress-free, relatively easy way to do it. The class is very easygoing, especially as compared to some of the other more rigid language courses, and the spontaneity is very helpful a lot of times. Occasionally the lessons will be delivered poorly, but the professors are willing to spend as much time as necessary going over things until each student is comfortable. The weekly quizzes are very doable if you take SOME time to study, and the midterm and final projects are stress-free and fun to do. I definitely recommend this course, if you want to learn a great language and have a stress-free time doing it.",
    "Good class. You get as much out as you put in.",
    "yea- it's fun and nice. i'd recommend it for the people not because you learn a lot",
    "Hindi is a really interesting language. The workload isn't too bad and the instructors are really nice.",
    "yes",
    "A lightweight language class that is interesting and fun.Highly recommended.",
    "Take it if you want to learn Hindi. Would recommend supplementing with a tutor.",
    "Hindi is definitely a gut language class. Seema was awesome. Swapna means well, but does not know how to teach Hindi, which can be very frustrating. If you take it you'll probably enjoy, but do not take the course seriously or you will be disappointed.",
    "If you want a very rudimentary introduction to the language, this is a good class. It gives you a feeling for the language so you could go on and study it by yourself. It is also graded nicely, and worth 1.5 credits, so..."
