    "YES! Do it!",
    "Yes, fully. Great course, good workload.",
    "Photography classes are more work than you think, which you'd probably know if you're thinking about taking this class because that means you took intro, most likely. But you do have to invest more time and take more pictures than you think becasue that is what they value. I also don't really like the way Yale teaches photography--they have a very specific aesthetic and school of thought to which they subscribe pretty strictly and it seems like they automatically like stuff that's gritty and spend less time on other things.",
    "This course is great- it exposes you to all sorts of different kinds of medium format cameras and techniques, so is a good way to go beyond 35 mm, yet it isn't strictly limited to medium format- some people still shot in 35 (though why would you once you have all these other arguably superior possibilities?), we also learn to do color and scanning, night photography, flash, and there is some possibility to shoot view camera at the end of the semester... However, try to take this class with a small group because otherwise it's too much material and too many people to live up to its potential, which is very unfortunate. Lisa is wonderful and you must take a photo class with her.",
    "TAKE THIS WORK. Be prepared to work. I would not recommend this if you have not taken intro photo at Yale, you'll be jumping in over your head.",
    "No.",
    "Intermediate Photography offers a little bit of everything, from medium format and darkroom printing to color scanning and digital printing. Most of the class takes place in the darkroom. I had a fantastic experience in this class, and it was my favorite class of the semester. Lisa is a phenomenal teacher, and the broad scope of the course exposed us all to so many different aspects of the medium. If you have the opportunity, take this class. You will not regret it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was a ton of fun, we got to learn a whole lot of practical knowledge about equipment and also were encouraged to try new things. I would especially recommend taking this class (or any class) with Lisa Kereszi.",
    "Intermediate Photography is a class dedicated mostly to medium format photography. It is a studio art class that continues to hone your photography skills and pushes you to the next level of the art form.I would recommend this course to anyone."
