   "comments": [
    "I loved this course. It is more like a political science grad school class than anything, but it is not difficult in grading. The workload is average, but you actually have to do the reading. If you're interested in these subjects, though, you'll want to do them, and believe me, it's a very interesting class.",
    "Great intro to the American court system - an actual seminar, where I learnt a lot, and great classroom discussion",
    "I would enthusiastically recommend this course. Professor Beim will emphasize the quantitative aspects of the course on the first day and talk about how difficult the papers are, but even if you're just someone who really wants to learn about courts and doesn't know much about statistics, there's no reason you couldn't handle this case. The workload is manageable and interesting, and the professor is outstanding.",
    "A pretty good class. Read the syllabus and make sure you will like the material. The class should really be called \"Courts and Judges\" rather than \"Courts, Judges, and Controversies\" since there was no discussion of any sorts of controversies at all. However, I still really liked the course and found most of the studies we read interesting. Class could get a little long, and the homework could get a little tedious, but overall, I would recommend this.",
    "This is a pretty difficult course - both in terms of how hard it is to understand the material and the workload. This is different than most other political science classes - we read three or four 30-40 paged political science studies per week, all involving some sort of advanced math that not too many people in the class understand. Professor Beim guides you through it, and most of the other kids also are probably lost by the math as well, but overall it's all still pretty difficult. There are 1-2 page responses due every week to make sure you do the readings - they're just summaries of the readings - but do take a while to do since the readings are a bit long. Usually they end up being 3-4 pages. There's also an 2 extended reading responses, about 7-8 pages, and a final take home 48 hour exam that's also only about 5-7 pages, though it might turn out to be more, depending on how much you write. More difficult than your average political science course, but you get a lot out of it, and the material and findings are quite interesting. Professor Beim is also a very helpful and kind professor!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if he or she is interested in the topic!",
    "This is a great course if you're interested in the material. This class is about analyzing empirical research on courts and judicial behavior. If that seems fun, take it. If it doesn't don't. Prof Beim is really great and helpful.",
    "A solid and pure Political Science seminar, especially if you're into statistics. If you're not into heavy statistics, some of the material may seem incomprehensible at times, but most of the discussion involves piecing together concepts in more theoretical fashion anyways. Strongest discussions of course were when we approached the material from a normative perspective. Also a good class for those interested int he intersection between political science and the law\/courts\/legal system.",
    "If you are very interested in statistics\/ the academic law and courts literature and being required to write over 40 pages does not scare you away, take it!",
    "Take it if you are interested in methodology. The course is light on normative discussion. You do learn a lot of neat things about the judicial system, but the vast majority of the discussion centers around the methodology used in the readings. Professor Beim is really smart in drawing out some interesting conclusions. It would be nice to have more normative discussion though...too often class time just felt like a reading review.",
    "Take it! Courts, Judges & Controversies was a great class and I definitely recommend it. Though the reading load may be heavier than your typical seminar, the majority of the assigned articles were really interesting and the weekly reading responses were easy to do because of that. Professor Beim is a wonderful professor as well and this class is one that I honestly enjoyed coming to each week."
