    "Great course, learnt a lot and professor was great. Lab component could be better organized as was discussed in class.",
    "Lab section needs to be planned out better beforehand",
    "The course is very interesting--a must for students interested in learning current topics as related to cancer genetics. I liked the idea of the lab component--I would suggest having each student be responsible for doing a small project over the course of the semester if this is feasible. I think this would maximize the learning experience in the lab and the presentation at the end of the semester could relate to this project.",
    "This is a good introductory course, it covers a lot of useful material. The only drawback of this course is that it could use a dedicated lab where students can try the techniques that we learn in class.",
    "I like the idea of having a lab course, but the labs didn't have enough work for the students to make them interesting. The material is really fascinating, and I felt I had enough of a background to understand it, but we didn't go really in depth with any part of it. More readings would have been helpful."

    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0Not great at explaining concepts. Really interesting research, though. Topics could have flowed better. Lab component definitely needs to be improved."

   "comments": [
    "Great class. Learn a lot in a short space of time. Lab component is interesting but needs to be better organized.",
    "Very little work, interesting material",
    "The course provides an overview of basic and molecular genetics, as well as topics in epigenetics. The focus of the course is mostly on cancer.There is also a lab component which provides hands on experience.",
    "I would recommend this only for a student that has little background in genetics. It is not thorough enough to be a course where students will learn a few things in detail but it is good enough that it covers most current genetic analysis techniques.",
    "This is the first time the class was taught with a lab component. This could be a very interesting way to teach it if the labs are evaluated so students have enough work to do during them. Midterm was open-note, not difficult. Very interesting material, biology background required, finalpresentation only."
