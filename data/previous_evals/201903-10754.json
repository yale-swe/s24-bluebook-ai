    "During this class, I learned a lot about Chinese history and culture. I improved my essay writing abilities.",
    "significantly increased oral, written, and reading proficiency in the Chinese language & gained a lot of insightful knowledge about Chinese culture",
    "I increased my knowledge of Mandarin vocabulary and grammar, both spoken and written.",
    "I learned an incredible amount of Chinese vocabulary and culture through the lens of Prof. Su.",
    "I learned new Chinese characters that added to my existing bank of foundational vocabulary. I also learned interesting Chinese proverbs and practiced my Chinese essay writing skills.",
    "I developed a much deeper understanding into Chinese culture. This course helped me not only strengthen my writing, reading, and speaking in mandarin, it also helped me understand how interesting the language itself is. I learned to better present myself in mandarin and also how to use more familial terms when speaking.",
    "Improved my Chinese skills- verbal and written especially",
    "At the end of the semester, I noticed an improvement in my Chinese listening and reading skills, as well as in my knowledge of Chinese culture. I also learned to recognize more traditional characters because that was always included in the lessons and I appreciated Su Laoshi's efforts to teach us that."

   "comments": [
    "Strength: really interesting class with interesting material to discuss, very engaging, always loved going to class because Su Lao shi has the most interesting stories to share Weakness: wished I could practice my speaking more",
    "Su LaoShi's course was both very rigorous & very interesting without having an overwhelming workload :) I learned a lot!",
    "The course is structured to really engage students each class. The course could be *greatly* improved by increasing the number of teaching fellows such that tutorials could actually be held. As it is, the course is not sufficiently staffed to sufficiently practice oral exercises. Whole sections of the textbooks are not used because they require a sufficient number of teaching fellows in order to run the oral exercises.",
    "Strengths: This class was incredibly engaging and helpful in the process of becoming more fluent in Chinese. Weaknesses: None, really. Maybe a little more class discussion!",
    "This class' textbook lessons covered very interesting topics and introduced us to Chinese culture. Su Laoshi's handouts on each lessons were also very helpful and made it clear for students what they needed to know in order to succeed in the course. As to what could be improved on this course, I wish that we did more structured pronunciation practices in class and that students had more speaking opportunities in every class.",
    "I think it was an amazing course, and that it was very organized and well planned. The teacher was very enthusiastic, and I think the course should not be changed!",
    "structured and clear; not enough speaking time for students",
    "Strengths: I learned a lot of Chinese culture during the classes, which I found to be highly interesting and I appreciated that Su Laoshi told us personal stories or stories relating to Chinese culture to supplement the textbook readings. Weaknesses: We didn't really practice our speaking skills besides doing 5 minute presentations every other week. It would be nice if we could have some discussions in class where we practice the new vocabulary so we could fully immerse ourselves in the material. Also, the class moved really fast. There wasn't a lot of time to ask questions about the material in between the lessons and Su Laoshi moves really fast.",
    "I don't think we are taught much language wise .. almost no grammar was taught. The only thing I really learned was vocab and that all depends on my own studying. In class we learned about Chinese philosophy but not really the language."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student even if they have already fulfilled their language requirement. It was a super interesting class and I learned a lot.",
    "i recommend this course for students who are truly interested in Chinese language \/ increasing their level of Chinese language. i like to say that the course is what you make of it yes, you can get by without putting in a lot of effort; however, it is far more rewarding if you do. overall, i feel that i improved a lot, gained a lot more confidence with my Chinese language abilities, and learned a lot about Chinese culture, even Chinese philosophy.",
    "I highly recommend this course to someone with sufficient fundamental Chinese skills to benefit from these advanced-level classes.",
    "I would, with Prof. Su. He is a great teacher who has had incredible experiences and stories. It was a pleasure to learn about him as a person throughout the course of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who has a strong background in Chinese and who is prepared to significantly self-study if they want to gain the most out of this course.",
    "Yes! It will spark your interest in continuing to learn mandarin. The teacher is amazing (Su Wei) and the course is just the right level of challenging for a native speaker.",
    "Yes! If you are looking to further master the language, take this class!",
    "Yes, though I would recommend it to someone who is advanced enough in Chinese, especially in terms of their listening skills. It is a wonderful course for students who can understand lectures about Chinese culture (which are very interesting and useful but also very advanced), but if you are struggling in Chinese, I wouldn't recommend taking this course - I would recommend taking an L5 course. However, if your listening skills are great, I highly recommend this course. The work is not very overwhelming and the class is very managable.",
    "I only recommend if you are at a high enough level of Chinese that you are okay with not really learning more of the language aspect"
