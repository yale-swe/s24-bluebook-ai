    "louise is amazing. her class really depends on the other people and the energy of the group dynamic. she definitely has a specific thing she is looking for in poems whcih can be frustrating, but it's a good (and important) class. you write a poem every week and a one page response to a collection, and she picks three poems to workshop in class. only ten people.",
    "Every week, you read a book of powms, write a book of poems, and workshop three of your classmates' poems. Spending two hours on three poems was often agony, especially with Professor Gl\u00c3\u00bcck's sometimes insightful but sometimes obtuse advice. If you're okay with that, this is a good chance to read and write some poems. Be warned that Professor Gl\u00c3\u00bcck has very specific taste, and after a semester of weekly feedback I still have NO idea what she will and won't like.",
    "The joys are many!",
    "If you are serious about writing poetry and willing to work hard and learn, take this class. You write one poem a week and also review a contemporary poetry collection; each week three poems are workshopped intensively in class and you also get specific feedback from Louise via written comments and personal conferences. You'll be pushed not only to engage with the work of others seriously, but to apply that same attention to detail and craft to your own work."
