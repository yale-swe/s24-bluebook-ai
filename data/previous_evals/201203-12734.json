   "comments": [
    "This is a graduate seminar, regardless of how it's listed in the course catalog. You should take this course if you're interested in American Politics as a subfield of political science. If you don't know what I mean by American Politics or subfield, then this probably isn't a good seminar for you. You don't need to know stats, but it's basically assumed that you know what a regression is. The course is kind of a grab-bag of topics, but it's an interesting course in that it imparts both substantive and methodological knowledge. If you're deciding between this course and Prof. Bullock's other seminar (Public Opinion), you should probably take Public Opinion. That said, this is a good course. You'll actually learn about political science, which is a rarer quality than you might imagine in political science seminars. If you take a look at the syllabus (especially the last couple of weeks) and you like those kinds of articles, then you'll probably really enjoy this class. The reading is pretty heavy, but aside from the first couple of weeks, it's not particularly difficult.",
    "Good class if you are at all interested in the development of American political science.",
    "Take this course, but be warned when the professor tells you that it is really only for graduate students. If you are unfamiliar with experimental methods in political science or are a stranger to reading articles in polisci journals, you will find much of it to be way over your head."
