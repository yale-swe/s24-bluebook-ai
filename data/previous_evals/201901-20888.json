    "The Senior Essay gave me a new appreciation for how to pose a relevant research question. Of course the research and writing processes both taught me immensely about efficiency, relevance, and clarity, but learning how to pose a research question that brings in the reader and stages an argument is one of my biggest takeaways from the project.",
    "I learned a lot about structuring a thesis, writing high quality survey questions, and I got incredible feedback from Gautam Nair, my department advisor.",
    "I learned a huge amount about the work I plan to do in the future. An invaluable experience in theory and knowledge base building."

   "comments": [
    "The level of autonomy awarded the student in this process could be both a strength or a weakness. As my personal preference is towards independence in writing, I enjoyed having lots of liberty in my research and writing processes. However, students who may want more direction could feel a bit lost or unsupported. Finally, while I greatly appreciated Gautam's critical insights (he offered cogent advise about how to make papers readable and accessible), I do think his inclination towards more political writing meant he could not understand more philosophically-driven papers.",
    "I think my thesis advisor should be expected to put as much work in if not more than my department advisor at editing\/ providing feedback. Gautam got all the work and barely any credit.",
    "I had a hard time writing and I didn't feel satisfied with my result. Even though I felt I learned a lot about the subject and I got out a lot from it, I just feel I needed more focused time to actually communicate it."

    "I'm under the impression that the Senior Essay is a requirement for all EP&E students, so I will not advocate for choosing to take it; I do not believe there is a choice. However, I can say that this project is a wonderful, culminating moment for the major. Seeing myself write a paper that was entirely self-driven and researched felt like a great referendum on my Yale career.",
