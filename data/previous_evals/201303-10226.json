   "comments": [
    "This is a really good class for anyone who is weak at math. The topics covered are chosen by the whole class at the very beginning of shopping period, so you know exactly what you're getting into. The homework is very fair and doable and the exams were not trying to trick you either. Professor Lachowska was a fantastic teacher and a really sweet person.",
    "If you don't like math and need a manageable QR, this class is perfect",
    "I would for those needing an easy math. However, their are a lot of problem sets.",
    "If you need a QR credit and you don't want to suffer a brain aneurysm while doing so, do this class. Learn about radioactive decay equations or whatever and then forget about it later.",
    "I would recommend this class to non math-y people that need QR credit.",
    "Great class",
    "Yes, but be warned--this is not a gut. If you're taking this class because you're mathematically challenged like I am, it will not be easy. The math itself isn't difficult, but if you have trouble with algebra (like me) you will still find it challenging.",
    "I really liked the class! I've never been able to take a math class at Yale because they all moved too quickly and did not have enough tutors. The professor taught at a really good pace and the problem sets although difficult were also reasonable. I took the class with Professor Lachowska, and I would definitely recommend taking the class with her! Just remember to study for the midterm and final!",
    "Great for students with low confidence in math and limited knowledge. Again: patient, thorough, lots of help available, no calculus.",
    "This course teaches students practical applications of mathematical concepts such as financial calculations and fractals. This course is not a gut as the problem sets are difficult and you need to study a lot for the exams. You have to be willing to refer to the chapters in her book are you go through the problem sets and take initiative to learn some of the concepts that are not fully explained in class. I would definitely recommend this course for a non-science non-math major person who wants to fulfill a QR requirement in a do-able manner but is willing to put work in in."
