   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The best and worst part about the class is that multiple computer programs are used. On one hand, this is great for accessibility, and allowing a variety of students to get involved. On the other hand, it is frustrating when one's selected program isn't covered for an example. That being said, I don't know how this could be improved. While it is nice that group work is offered, it feels like those who work alone are put at a disadvantage. Perhaps there could be an incentive for those unable to find a partner\/group.",
    "I think the Professor himself is a strength of this course. For material is typically dry, I think he did a good job of engaging the class and making the material interesting.",
    "The key strength is being able to use your own data set through the course. It's a great balance between learning about the techniques in lectures and the math that the computer is doing, and then applying them to the dataset. It's a much more satisfying and easier class than Intro Stats surprisingly. The only weakness is that I wish I had received feedback on my homeworks throughout the semester - I still haven't received feedback on most of my homework - but I think there was a shortage of TAs? However, going to Jonathan directly when doing the homework is very helpful.",
    "I think it this class would be much more useful to research students if taught in the fall instead of spring. While there are a lot of benefits to showing examples in multiple software platforms during the lectures, I sometimes found it hard to pay attention when the demonstration was in a program that I wasn't familiar with. The turnaround on grading assignments was very slow (3-5 weeks), and I would have really liked faster feedback on my work.",
    "The best part about this class is that Jonathan wants us to actually learn useful skills. It sounds trivial but I honestly don't feel that way in most other classes here at FES (and Yale broadly). This is exemplified by the fact that he lets us modify assignments to suit our needs and our data -- that means not wasting time working on a rote assignment but actually learning and understanding where and how to apply different skills. It also means more work for him and his TAs (which is probably why most professors force you to stick with slogging through fake datasets and performing memorized actions), and I really appreciate that commitment.",
    "I wish we could have spent more time during lecture working through interpreting the outcome of different tests and less time on the nuances of the linear algebra. I struggled the most during homework when trying to interpret the output. I do understand that the nature of multivariate statistics is less straightforward and often subjective, but I would have liked to spend more time working through those challenges.",
    "I find it is a great course. I don't see any need to improve.",
    "Strength - Professor's teaching was lively and excellent. Weakeness - Too fast",
    "The course was a good combination of theory and hand-on skills, and lectures were well-organized. It was also video-recorded so I could review the knowledge afterwards.",
    "The class discussed more the technical side of making calculations with limited discussion on actually interpreting them. More discussion on interpretation would be very helpful.",
    "The course is flexible. I think it will be better if the lecture could focus more on examples rather than mathematics.",
    "The strengths were that homework assignments related well to subject material and cemented my knowledge on the topic. Weaknesses were again I didn't always feel like I knew what the significance of the outputs of our analyses. Also, homework assignments were handed back very late so it was hard to gauge how well I was doing in the class and what I needed to improve.",
    "I love how the class is video-taped, and therefore I could watch the streaming anywhere anytime I want.",
    "Strengths - engaging lectures, appreciated that they were also recorded. Weaknesses - actually wish that we went more into the proofs and had some exams\/tests to make sure we understood the underpinning of the techniques. Not sure I understand when it is and is not appropriate to use certain techniques.",
    "i think the course is somewhat loose but students came in with different expectations of what they'd like to get out of the class. so I appreciate the flexibility",
    "I loved that it was taught online as well"

   "comments": [
    "Keep up on the work. Find a dataset at the start of the semester that really fits the class. Speak to the instructor.",
    "I would highly recommend it for any research-focused students who are doing data analysis. I used data from my research project and this was a great way to continue to explore my data.",
    "Take this class, it's incredibly useful. You will learn how to actually think critically about multivariate methods and you can use your own data making it incredibly practical and worthwhile.",
    "It is the skill that we would need at some point in time. I suggest taking it and thinking about its application, especially if you are interested in research and working with data.",
    "Definitely take it your work will require knowledge of these analyses. Helpful to take the course with project data in your possession.",
    "Yes. it is not a very difficult class, but I learned so much from it",
    "Anybody who needs to deal with different variables of data and doesn't have more advanced background on statistics should take this class to have a basic understanding and skill of this kind of analysis.",
    "Bring your own dataset.",
    "Be ready to have your brain stretched and get one of the books to read before you come to class.",
    "If allowed, try to do assignments in group. Doing assignments alone can cost you good amount of sleep.",
    "I would suggest them to have some knowledge regarding linear algebra.",
    "Take this if you have data that is appropriate for the techniques. Otherwise, you might not get much out of it.",
    "it's more beneficial if you are applying the techniques in this course on your project",
    "Take it! Get your data set early. Don't be hesitant to use multiple programs for analysis (R, SAS were the most useful to me)"
