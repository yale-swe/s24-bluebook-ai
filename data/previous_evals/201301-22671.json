    "Spanish 130 is very much like 120 but much more detail oriented. Instead of getting into tons of new material, it makes you get the stuff you know right. This can be challenging, but it is rewarding to realize that at the end you actually feel comfortable with the basics, and to feel that you are only really unsure about the insignificant details.I would certainly recommend the class, but urge students to participate as much as possible because otherwise they will not improve as much.",
    "standard. not difficult",
    "Diaz is definitely one of the chillest Spanish professors- great one to take. Although Spanish can be a pain every day and there are five or six exercises a night, I found L3 to be easier than L2.",
    "Spanish 130 02 is a standard language class that covers grammar and vocabulary on the intermediate level. Prof Diaz is an awesome professor - he really cares about his students and is very fun in class! I would recommend this particular section to other students because Prof Diaz is a wonderful teacher.",
    "Yes if you want to continue improving your language",
    "Sure if you want to work more on your grammar",
    "Obviously the class is a lot of work but at the same time its a lot of fun. Will definitely improve your spanish speaking\/listening\/reading\/writing skills."
