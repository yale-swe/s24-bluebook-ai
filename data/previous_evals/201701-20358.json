    "I learned about electrostatics and electrodynamics, and how waves work in electric and magnetic fields.",
    "Learn basic physics and then more advanced physics where you relate everything to waves.",
    "This course taught me how to analyze a variety of electrical systems in terms of their magnetic and electric fields, power, and energy.",
    "Intense version of electrostatics and waves.",
    "Good knowledge of E&M. Math was sometimes more advanced and confusing, but professor gives really good guidelines and help.",
    "I got a very good overview of physics E&M, with newly incorporated multivariable calculus and differential eq.",
    "Unsurprisingly, I gained an understanding for the physics behind electromagnetic waves. However, learning the physics also really gave me a much, much better grasp on multivariable calculus and vector calculus. I didn't really feel comfortable with my multivariable calculus before this class, and I feel much better now. I definitely learned a lot in this class."

   "comments": [
    "I thought the class was well done; lectures were sometimes difficult to follow because of the density of the material, but Professor Rakich is a great teacher, and the lecture notes were very helpful. The problem sets were very useful in learning the material, and office hours were helpful. The exams were also very fair. One thing that I think would have been helpful would have been doing more concrete examples in class; we learned a lot of theory in class but I sometimes had trouble applying that to homework problems.",
    "The content did not seem very \"applied.\" It would have been nice if the practical uses of these topics was more emphasized.",
    "Clear course for the first half, and then things become very hand wavy in the second half.",
    "This was a very well-done course considering its complicated subject material. It was confusing at times due to its complicated and sometimes non-intuitive topics, but there was a lot of help available at all times. Professor Rakich and the TF held office hours weekly, and would move them around if the problem set due date was moved around to ensure that we would always have a chance to help, which was extremely considerate and not a common accommodation in my experience. The support from the TF and the professor, along with some very helpful textbooks, made the subject material of this class clear.",
    "This course can use more practical and applied examples from real life. It is very well structured, and prof. Rakich is simply amazing, but I didn't see much \"applied\" for an Applied Physics class",
    "Material was awesome. Professor was awesome. His notes were awesome. Homework helped me understand the material and were thus, awesome.",
    "Awesome and very approachable professor. good office hours, really good handouts and problem sets on a good level. Cons: sometimes the math part gets tedious and boring or confusing",
    "The course material goes fairly in depth, although it is very much applies physics in that many math concepts are glossed over.",
    "I really, really appreciated the notes that we got every class and that the class was a straightforward lecture on the notes. Sometimes the professor stumbled a little over the math in his notes, but that will happen less when he teaches the class more times."

   "comments": [
    "I probably wouldn't recommend this course to another student unless they had to take it. Professor Rakich is a great teacher, but I felt like the class was halfway between a physics class and a math class, when it could have benefited from just being one instead of trying to be both.",
    "This course was okay....the PSETs can be long some weeks, but by the end of the term, you could essentially finish the previous PSETs within an hour. Rakich is super nice, but the lectures can be dry, which is a shame because the material is actually very interesting in the application form, which we didn't see much of.",
    "I would recommend this course, although not without a solid background in E&M. Professor Rakich and the TF offer a lot of help if you need to brush up on some concepts.",
    "Very much so. Gave me a clear understanding of especially electrostatics (transmission lines were a bit weirder) and a strong basis for going forward with more courses in optics or EE.",
    "This is a solid E&M course, and because it was almost a seminar style class, I felt like I got as much attention as I needed to learn the material, so yes I would recommend this course.",
    "I really enjoyed the class, and I would recommend it to other students with a strong math background who are interested in E&M. The professor made the math really approachable, and it was a straightforward class."
