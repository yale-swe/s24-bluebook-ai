   "comments": [
    "The class moves fairly quickly, and it was stressful trying to work out the problems in class that the professors would give you. I had talked to a friend that had taken the class in a previous year, and my friend said that he would always feel rushed to do these problems and would never be able to keep up with the pace of the ckass. I felt I had a similar experience. I think the idea of the course is good and should continue since a lot of physics ph.d. students need to be proficient with c++ for their work. For this reason I would recommend the course.",
    "If you are in physics and need to learn C++, this is the class. It's not the best, but it's the one they offer.",
    "For a broad education on programming, including everything you need to know, this is the course for you.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to other students, especially students doing particle and nuclear physics research.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it."

    "I need to know a lot of C++ for my research, so it was good to get a better grasp of the basics.",
    "It gave me the skills that I will need to conduct my research.",
    "The materials covered in this class are what I will encounter in my research. The class gives me almost everything I need in C++. Most important, I feel confident now and is able to learn further knowledge by myself in the future.",
    "I have done some programming for research, and as we move into data analysis and I am programming more and more I know it will be very helpful."
