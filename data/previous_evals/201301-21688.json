    "If you're a music major you're gonna have to take it so just do it.",
    "This is a course to build a very useful sort of musical skill. It is definitely not a theory class, but it is not meant to be. I would recommend this course enthusiastically to any student interested in improving aural skills for performance, composition, or for greater enjoyment listening to music. The course is not by any means simple--it is, after all, not the first in its sequence (coming after MUSI 218)--but it is approachable and enjoyable to any student willing to put in the time.",
    "This course help you learn the skills of ear training: being able to interact with functional harmony and melody through listening. If one has an interest in composing, and or analysis of music, this course will provide a great foundation of skills.",
    "Wonderful class and follow-up to 218. Do it. Take it with Sarita if you can.",
    "Many music dictations.",
    "Take this class. It's challenging for people who aren't natural musicians, but it's manageable and the learning curve, while tough, isn't vertical."
