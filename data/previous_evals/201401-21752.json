    "It's definitely helpful to have a background in analog photography before taking this class, but not 100% necessary. Ben is the man, and will help you out with anything you need. If you're an art major and you don't take a class with him before you leave you are really missing out! The class itself focuses on the use of the 4x5 view camera. You go over all of the different movements and ways to use the camera, develop prints, have critiques, etc. Great class for any art major, and you should definitely take it if you're concentrating in photography. As all photography classes go, it is a big time requirement, but being in the dark room is a blast.",
    "If you're looking at taking this, you've already taken at least an intro course (B&W is much more recommended), and are either an art major or very interested in photography. If you're considering it at this point, do take it. You will likely be in a very small class, and have priority over the hordes of intro students in terms of dark room and equipment access. You do get a camera loaned to you for the course. Film is expensive,* but worth it if you're interested in the course and the medium (that's photo and\/or large format). Ben is a fantastic teacher, but this class *will* be what you make of it. I recommend at least one digital and one analog class under your belt just to make the most of the course, so you're not f**king around, learning the basics. If you haven't taken analog, you'll be behind much more than if you've not taken digital, but it will be possible to keep up: just remember, printing takes more time than you think it will. As for \"workload\" you could probably get away with doing very little work (I've seen it done), so I *could* label this \"less,\" but you're not here for the easy credit (and Ben will probably notice and grade accordingly\u2014it shows in your photos and in your prints), you're here because you want to make art, and taking the time to do so could push this class up to a \"much greater.\" Honestly, where you want this course to fall between those two points is up to you. *for those who want to know, you'll need: \u2022 photo paper (you're familiar with this stuff already\u2014bigger than 8x10 is entirely up to you and you won't need more than 50 sheets if you're sparing with it) and possibly digital photo paper; \u2022 you'll get 50 sheets of tri-x 4x5 film (look it up for prices); \u2022 and possibly 10 or more sheets of kodak portra 4x5 (again, l.i.u.) if you want to shoot color (not required); \u2022 developing the portra will be $3 per sheet (that's one photo) in NYC (so possibly plus shipping) plus you'll have to print them on digital paper. So it's ~$2 per shot B&W, and ~$7.50 for color ... before cost of printing (that's paper).",
    "The class focuses on using a large-format 4x5'' view camera. If you are interested in photography at all you should definitely take this course, as using a view camera is a rare opportunity you probably won't have later on in life, and its pretty incredible to use one. Keep in mind that the film and processing can be very expensive.",
    "Highly recommend it to anyone with patience and an interest in analog photography."
