   "comments": [
    "gained a knowledge and appreciation of sociological vocabulary and theories about race and inequality within the urban environment.",
    "Interest in developing a background in ethnographic literature, and learn more about how a variety of departments and schools represent racialized inequality in urban areas.",
    "This course gave us insights on the structures in place that allows for inequality to prevail in American inner-cities. It gave us a solid, sociological approach of these inner-city neighborhoods and the often misunderstood people that reside within them.",
    "This course introduced me to ethnographic studies, particularly as conducted by Dr. Elijah Anderson over the course of his career. Over the course of the semester, I was introduced to numerous concepts that have greatly impacted my thinking. One of these is the \"iconic ghetto,\" which theorizes concerning the lingering effects of the perception or assumption that all or most black Americans live in segregated ghetto communities.",
    "As my first semester at Yale University draws to a close and the time comes to ponder the many classes, books, scholarly articles, and interpersonal interactions I have experienced, there is little doubt that the most important course this semester was Inequality, Race, and the City. This course went far beyond class readings, presentations, and extra intellectual gatherings. True to its title, the course examined the intersections of racial inequality through the lens of city living, with emphasis being placed on those that live in what is unceremoniously called the ghetto. One of the most powerful concepts I picked up this semester was the idea of \"The Cosmopolitan Canopy\" - \"Settings that offer a respite from the lingering tensions of urban life and an opportunity for diverse people to come together. Canopies are in essence pluralistic spaces where people engage one another in a spirit of civility, or even comity and goodwill.\" (Dr. Elijah Anderson - The Cosmopolitan Canopy) Understanding \"The Cosmopolitan Canopy\" and its function in everyday life will be of valuable importance for me moving forward both as a academic and productive member of society.",
    "I learned a lot about the iconic ghetto and how the government invests in the maintenance of the iconic ghetto.",
    "Extremely rich insights on qualitative ethnographic academic techniques and historical and present race relations and social constructs in American - particularly institutional and social inequality and implications.",
    "I acquired the knowledge, skills and insights necessary to be able to carry out my ethnographic research agenda, from the most prominent ethnographer in the field.",
    "This course gave me both substantive and methodological knowledge, skills and insight on race, inequality, and urban ethnography, which I know I will be able to utilize moving forward."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength-knowledgeable professor; wonderful reading list; opportunities to present\/reflect Weakness-lack of structure to the class; surprise midterms and finals; professor dominated conversations",
    "At times it wasn't clear what the trajectory of the course would be regarding assignments and due dates.",
    "The strength of this course is the syllabus. Every reading was engaging and necessary for really understanding the issues of inequality and its causes. The weakness of this course was that it was often difficult to sustain good discussion between the students in class.",
    "This course went above and beyond my expectations for an academic course. When courses are at the apex of academic learning, it is hard to imagine how they can improve. Like a fighter in their prime, \"Muhammed Ali or Floyd Mayweather\" the only way to go out on top is to get out while still on top. Dr. Anderson is still at the top of his teaching\/writing game. I hope he retires a champion, and knows when his time has come, but that time has not arrived yet. Course Strengths: Assigned Readings - extremely relevant to class discussions Class Presentations Extra Class Activities - Saturday viewing of PBS film \"Jack Johnson: Unforgivable Blackness\"",
    "the strength is that we learned a lot of material on slavery, poverty, ethnography, and urban cities.",
    "Strengths: Fantastic readings, class discussion, and professor Improvement Area: A little more clear course and grading requirements - eg advanced notice of final paper",
    "Strengths = everything about this course. There were no weaknesses.",
    "I thought this course was great and I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Anderson",
    "This course was terrific. No weaknesses come to mind."

   "comments": [
    "It very much depends on what the student is hoping to learn. The readings are a must, and worth it. Prof. Anderson offers lessons through personal narrative; you have to ask questions when you have them, or you might lose the opportunity.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students. Dr. Elijah Anderson is an amazing and respectful teacher who is able to draw on decades of personal field research and experience to instruct students, and he is always candid and sincere. The course is structured in a group setting, and this made all the difference in terms of students feeling as though they were part of the conversation and not simply receiving instruction.",
    "Yes, \"Inequality Race & the City\" is a transformational experience that has the power to sharply increase the knowledge of participating students in the areas covered by the course. I wish Dr. Anderson was teaching a class this spring.",
    "Yes, Professor Anderson is a wealth of knowledge, and he is an outstanding ethnographer. You will have an opportunity to learn about ethnography, tips on how to conduct it, as well as the knowledge that creates racial and classist inequalities.",
    "Yes definitely!!!",
    "Without question I would recommend this course.",
    "yes",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely! This course will give you unparalleled knowledge and insight!"
