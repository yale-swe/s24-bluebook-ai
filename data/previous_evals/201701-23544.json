    "Instructor: Samara Meade Brock \u00a0This was a strange course, Samaras way of putting so many themes in the field with very good guests was amazing, greetings for her!. but maybe we had fewer chances to interact and discussion, maybe she need to be more strict on time management. But I appreciate the dedication and professionalism.",
    "Instructor: Samara Meade Brock \u00a0Samara was fantastic in communicating course expectations, facilitating logistics and course discussion, and providing assignment feedback. She really helped foster an engaging community within this intimate class.",
    "Instructor: Samara Meade Brock \u00a0Samara did a nice job of identifying interesting guest speakers and organizing their visits. I would have liked to have had her actually teach some class sessions, as her questions to speakers were always very interesting and smart.",

    "Instructor: Samara Meade Brock \u00a0The classes were led by students and when the discussion fell short or silent, Samara would sometimes jump in and ask a question.",
    "Instructor: Samara Meade Brock \u00a0Great teacher and very knowledgeable. Unfortunately as the class was so dense with visiting speakers, and two other full professors, she was given limited opportunity to shine. That was a shame as when she did have the floor she provided fascinating insights into the material and subject matter, and a needed perspective.",
    "Instructor: Samara Meade Brock \u00a0Interesting discussion facilitation and great speakers that I believe she organized! I did not interact with her beyond weekly classes",
    "Instructor: Samara Meade Brock \u00a0Samara is very knowledgeable about the subject matter. She was accessible. She explained projects clearly and her expectations were clear from the beginning.",
    "Instructor: Samara Meade Brock \u00a0Samara is a great teacher, facilitator, and has an deep knowledge of many different facets and elements of food systems. As a teacher, she is open, makes important and helpful suggestions about sources and angles to take, and was the mainstay of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Gordon was the professor, but the man behind the class was Mark. Mark did an excellent job at bringing complex conversations up and boiling them down to their most important elements. Gordon was more of a bystander.",
    "Mark Bomford was also an instructor for the course. I tremendously valued his lectures and support of class discussion. Would rate him a 1 on all above metrics.",
    "Courses on the environmental impacts of food production and alternative food production methods that are being designed to avert those problems are really important at FES. What is needed, however, are courses that go in depth, rather than repeated courses that are surveys of problems without in-depth inquiries into solutions. This was a solid survey course.",
    "Gordon is the instructor but not *really* -- Mark lectured, Samara ran all the logistics, and we had guest speakers every week.",
    "This was a high level course and felt a bit more geared toward a PhD audience than a Master audience. This was the first course I have taken in food systems and at times, I felt as though I would have benefitted from more previous knowledge of the subject. Specifically, I would like to point out that lectures of Mark Bomford. He is an incredible wealth of information and I learned a lot from him and his approach, but his lectures were at times over my head and I found it hard to follow his thought process. Regarding the lectures from the visiting speakers, I think those lecture were much more accessible and helped me learn about food systems on the whole. I do wish that we had more time to discuss what we learned from the different speakers, as a class, to debrief and hash out ideas."

   "comments": [
    "Mark's lectures. They would have been more valuable if they had been interspersed among the guests, though.",
    "The topics were extremely interesting and the material of study and lecturer guests very interesting also..",
    "The selection and organization of guest speakers (e.g. panel style with student introductions and questions) was so well run, academically stimulating, and actionable. We were also heavily supported by Gordon, Mark, and Samara in our final semester projects. As a School of Management MBA student, I would also comment that the class was extremely welcoming and approachable for non-FES students interested in the covered topics. This was my favorite and most rewarding course of the semester and one of my tops for my entire Yale graduate experience.",
    "Guest speakers.",
    "This course's strength is in its presentation of varied approaches to food systems change. The course takes care to send a message that there is no one \"right\" way to go about change, but that many working on concert are valuable. This is a unique perspective to get from a class at Yale.",
    "This class is a survey course, providing a superficial introduction to many topics and not going into depth on many topics. It is structured around a guest lecture series, which is fantastic in terms of meeting individuals and practitioners in fields that one might be interested in, but hard when not having any depth to the global food system frameworks\/theories presented.",
    "The various avenues of the food sector that were explored with fascinating guests. It's difficult to compress all of the various subjects covered though as any one week could arguably be expanded into a course\/study in itself. As well it's such a vast subject that there could be more subjects and depths included, although that might need a year.",
    "Diversity of speakers",
    "I loved covering a wide range of subjects and having the opportunity to discuss in depth with the guest speakers.",
    "The wide range of visiting speakers that Samara got to come to our class to present. The best part was the way in which students acted as interviewers to the speakers after they finished their lectures, also allowing for students to ask questions after the interview. This was an incredible way to learn and I felt engaged the entire time. I have never had a class that used this method and I would recommend it for other classes that utilize guest lecturers as well.",
    "The prefacing of the course through the question of values and differing perspectives on food systems, why the plural is used in systems, and why the instructors take this approach. The different perspectives of the guest speakers and the ways in which we were asked to seriously consider their attitudes, approaches, and perspectives within food systems created the possibility of real conversation and engagement with differing ideas of the problems and solutions."

    "Time management and discussion time.",
    "I would have loved to do an optional field trip or two - e.g. the Yale farm, a community garden, a food lab, etc. We could see tangible examples of some of our course topics and have further discussion.",
    "THE CANVAS QUESTIONS. The intention of the canvas questions needs to be clarified. If you're looking to see if we did the readings, great. If you're asking us to pose questions to the guest lecturer, great. Fusing those two intentions made the exercise tedious, and resulted in a product that seemed useless to the guest lecturer. Not to mention the Monday class to posting Thursday deadline was hard to meet.",
    "So many moving parts that there was rarely time to digest and comprehend all the information.",
    "I would have liked to have some continuation from session to session, some discussion sessions for just the class students to bridge the different topics covered by the external speakers.",
    "I would have liked more opportunity for discussion within the class (rather than just questions and interviews with guest speakers).",
    "The reading responses for each week were due the same week as class and this made it very difficult to get through the extraordinary amount of dense reading and also synthesize it into a reading response. We brought this up in class one day, as well as through emails I believe, but the professors did not feel they could change the due dates of the reading responses. This aspect of class made it hard for me to keep up with the pace and unfortunately made me fall behind at times. The course dealt with very dense material and at times very cutting-edge material and it would have been nice to have more time to digest the information and get the reading response submitted on time. Also, the aforementioned aspect of the lectures of Mark Bomford.",
