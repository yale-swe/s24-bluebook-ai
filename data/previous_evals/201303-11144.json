   "comments": [
    "I would! It's a pretty chill class, and it's intellectually stimulating.",
    "Recommended for easy and interesting writing credit or if you're into studying empires.",
    "Yes I would recommend EPE 337 to another person.",
    "Fascinating class that looks at the empires of the Ancient Near East, Rome, Aztecs, Incas, Carolingians, Ottomans, Habsburgs as well as European overseas Empires. Obviously the enormous breadth of material means that no one Empire is examined in great detail, and many are left out (notably Asian land empires such as the Mughals and those in China as well as perhaps the idea of an 'American Empire' although discussion often tends toward this) but rather the course looks at how empires work, and rise and fall and what it means for their populations and elites.The grade is composed of two papers of length 5-10 and 10-15, both of which were a pleasure to write. The readings are largely historical (and its a slight mystery to me as to why it is not cross-listed as a history class since the Professor's expertise is 'historical sociology') and insightful.Overall, the course is interesting with well chosen readings (none of which are particularly daunting), stimulating discussion, and enjoyable paper topics.",
    "Don't take this class. If you're interested in imperialism, you already know what this class offers.",
    "Take it for a very interesting writing credit.",
    "I would recommend the course, particularly to another adult student who is capable of self motivating, dislikes classes that are designed for teenagers, and has a broad interest in the history and development of the world.",
    "It is a great survey course on the mechanics and motivations behind imperialistic expansion. The workload is very low, just some manageable readings, a short midterm paper and a final paper. There is one reading response that you have to do per semester (1 pg), very doable. Overall a great 5th class.",
    "Great class, good discussion. Professor Stamatov is fun, engaging, and chill. Can get away with far less reading than is required, but the readings are cut down and interesting enough that one should have no reason to do so"
