    "Very manageable and fun course, could be improved by moving at a faster pace and including more material",
    "I liked how I felt like I left the class feeling as if I learned a lot and it was super fast paced, but it wasn't too difficult. If you do the work you will do well. That was rewarding. I liked how there are many different assignments that factor into our grade. It leaves a lot of room for mistakes just in case you don't do so well on one thing.",
    "Well organized and interesting, and gives students lots of chances to practice speaking and listening in class.",

    "Korean is an extremely rewarding language to learn. South Korea as a country is growing massively in the global scene and its culture is rich with history.",
    "Yes!",
    "I definitely would. I love how it meets every day. I really got to know Professor Park and the rest of my classmates and felt like I was learning every day. I like how the class is structured, with daily vocab quizzes, grammar lessons cultural readings, and oral presentations.",
    "Yes! Definitely one of my favorite classes at Yale. Park seonsaengnim is a great teacher and she makes the class quite interesting and comfortable. Material is not hard but requires work daily.",
    "YESSS. the korean faculty is great and you'll make amazing friends"
