    "I would--the course is a necessary foundation for an understanding of modern literature. We learned in class that literature is self-referential, and many of the references are directed back to literature discussed in this class.",
    "A great introduction to the study of English verse and with the best professor you could hope for!! Pretty reading-heavy (but you're taking a core lit class so I mean what do you expect.) Three 10-page papers instead of shorter ones can be a little intense, but overall means you have more space to engage with what interests you about each poet, and less constant deadlines to maneuver. Professor Patterson is incredibly knowledgeable and engaging in guiding the class through the texts. She also incredibly funny and kind; if you have the chance to take this class or any with her, do!!",
    "I'm not sure that Professor Patterson, who led my section, will be teaching in future semesters, so I will constrain my discussion to the general merits and pains of taking English 125. The decision of whether or not one should take English 125 seemingly is, and likely should be, vastly colored by whether or not one intends to be an English major. If one is an intended English major, as I, at this juncture, believe I am, than one's only choices are when to take English 125 and which idiom to use to most accurately describe one's decision: \"grin and bear it,\" \"bite the bullet,\" or another phrase that similarly encapsulates the \"I-don't-really-want-to-do-this-but-I-kind-of-have-to\" spirit of the class. If a student is not an intended English major, than she or he should probably not take English 125, unless she or he has a great interest in reading the works of a few very dead, very white men, who, admittedly, for the most part still seem to have had a pronounced effect on much of the English literary canon. The in-class discussion can often be dry, the reading load ranges from relatively heavy and dense (Chaucer and Spenser) to much lighter and easier, but nonetheless still centuries-old-poetry (Donne). You will probably not find yourself ever looking up from one of these books and suddenly realizing a profound connection between the text at hand and your own life, but if you are a prospective English major, you will probably breathe a deep and cathartic sigh of relief at the end of the semester when you realize that yes, finally, the hard part is over. Of course, you could well be terribly wrong. English 126, here we come!",
    "If you're an English major, you have to take it, but it's not too bad. I think this was Professor Patterson's last time teaching the course, but if she teaches again, it's worth taking with her--she's a Yale institution. She teaches a good section because she forces you to go deeper on less material, which is more worthwhile when reading poets like Chaucer\/Spenser\/Donne.",
    "It was a great, if completely idiosyncratic, rendition of 125. Professor Patterson was a lot of fun, if sometimes a little erratic. She skipped pieces of the course she didn't like, and placed very secific emphasis on other parts. Honestly, I am incredibly glad I ended up in her section: she made a required course absolutely fantastic. Unfortunately, I believe this is Professor Patterson's last year teaching the course. If she teaches any more courses, make sure to take the class, regardless of what it is about."
