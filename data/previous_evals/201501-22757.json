    "Absolutely amazing course. Take it, if only so that you can get to know Professor Papachristos. He is fascinating to listen to, and also very invested in his students' projects. I was skeptical going in that there would be 12 weeks worth of unique gang-related stuff to talk about, but I was never bored during the semester. Must-take if you can get in.",
    "This is a great class. It will likely be slightly larger than a traditional Yale seminar, because Professor Papachristos does not like to tun people away, but if you're interested in urban policy of any kind, this class is worth taking. Professor Papachristos is also a very engaging and entertaining discussion leader.",
    "I would summarize it as a good introduction to the study of gangs and urban street culture. The readings are good, and the subject material is compelling. At the same time, you probably won't dig as deep into a lot of the topics as you would like to (except for whatever you pick for your final paper). Also worth noting: the grading was super-chill, and Papachristos is nice\/hilarious.",
    "BEST CLASS THAT I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE. Honestly, this was an incredibly interesting course and Papacristos is probably the coolest person I have ever met. I would definitely recommend taking this class regardless of your area of study. You will learn a lot of relevant information about the real world.",
    "Pretty disappointing, to be honest. Interesting material, knowledgeable and charismatic professor, but there were too many people in the seminar and it was run more like a lecture. Take it if it's taught like a true seminar (18 people max).",
    "An easy seminar with an interesting topic. Only take it if it is a lecture or a seminar that is truly capped.",
    "Great class to get you thinking about gangs, which can sometimes feel like a mysterious or taboo topic, in a number of different and interesting ways. Really fascinating readings, engaging professor, and a nice distribution of grades where the final counts for 25% of your total grade (and you get a ton of freedom in choosing your topic so that's fun). If you can get in, take it!!",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. It was a complete waste of my time that I, and everyone I know, regrets taking. The class is just the professor telling unrelated stories. Such a waste of a credit for senior year.",
    "Learn more about street gangs and look at it from an angle that is not overly distorted by the media.",
    "Fun, informative course overall. Take it if you can get in! The readings are fascinating and varied. The concepts you learn are not very complex or difficult to comprehend. The workload is totally manageable and spaced out: a take-home midterm, a couple of short assignments related to your final paper, a presentation, and a 10-page final paper. This year, the class was not as great because there were too many people in the course.",
    "DO NOT TAKE IT. don't be fooled, you will hate your fucking semester. it was my last yale class ever--thursday seminar--and it made it super easy to never take a class again. if he hadn't let us use our laptops in class, i would have dropped out.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class because it covers so many topics that are surprisingly relatable and important. The strength of this course is that it opens one up to understanding a type of group that is often stereotyped and misunderstood by looking from a different angle.",
    "I would recommend it if you have a particular interest in gangs. If you are taking this class just because it sounds cool you might not enjoy it much since the whole class is about gangs. It was a bit too specific for me and the readings got dull. Papachristos is awesome, and the class is really quite easy work wise (if youre looking for a gut) but Im not sure the grading was that easy... and the readings can get kinda boring (with a few notable exceptions). It's meant to be a seminar but because of the size felt a lot more like a lecture.. not much class discussion, more of people in the class raising their hands to answer questions. So if you're looking for a seminar experience this wasn't really it. Learning about gangs was interesting, and important, but as life changing as I expected it to be...",
    "Don't believe the hype. I would not recommend this class to a student who wants to know more about things like culture, communities, policies, and poverty as it relates to gangs. This class really doesn't cover those things in depth. The lessons got less and less relevant as the course progressed. This was a \"seminar\" with 29ish students, so really a lecture with commentary from the same few over and over again."
