    "?What History Teaches\u0094 is a freshman seminar taught by Professor Gaddis, one of Yale\u0092s best professors. The course incorporates many disciplines (literature, science, philosophy) to explain how history is written and then concludes with what is actually taught. There are four 5 page writing assignments that are not the typical history paper. This year, the assignments were 1) to write an autobiography, 2) explain how someone 100 years from now would look at 1 day in your life from artifacts, 3) write a comprehensive history of a tradition or product,and 4) explain what history teaches. Gaddis really helps students improve their writing, as this course gives a writing credit. I highly recommend this class to freshman, and especially potential history majors, because it is a great way to be exposed to a wide range of perspectives on history. Be prepared for a lot of reading but that is compensated by not having any exams or long papers. The course completely changed my view of history.",
    "I would recommend it to those who are interested in following the track here at Yale that leads to \"Grand Strategies...\" I think this class will give you a good idea of what you have to do to make it into Grand Strategies, if that is your ultimate goal.",
    "Good writing credit. Lots of reading, but the reading is interesting and makes you think. I would recommend this class, if you can get in.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Know going into the class that there WILL be a lot of reading (Yay War&Peace!), but it's manageable. The essays are very reflective and short, so there is not a lot of fear in that regard. If you've ever wondered why we bother with history at all, this class will change the way you think about it. Though you may leave the class with more questions than when you entered, it is valuable to think about how and why we approach the field of history, especially in a place like Yale where every course will require you to think a little bit about history.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone, whether or not they want to be a history major. He won't be teaching fall semester of 2010 but if he offers the class again in 2011, take it take it take it.",
    "This was one of my favorite courses this semester. It is definitely more of a philosophy than history course. There is a lot of reading but most of it is pretty enjoyable. It is also great to have had a small seminar with such a distinguished member of Yale faculty.",
    "This was a fantastic course. I came into the class not really liking history, and I came out of it with an entirely new perspective. This is what I was hoping for when I came to Yale. There is a large amount of reading, but it's worth it.",
    "What History Teaches will define the philosophies of how you approach your studies at Yale. Definitely definitely take this course, and do all the reading, it's worth every minute of time that you put into it.",
    "Absolutely- everything about the class is great.",
    "I would summarize History 022 01 as a course that does not just focus on history but on the broader picture. It is more of a philosophy class than a history class. It is a class that alters the way that we view academics in general. Academics are more interconnected than high school has taught us. I would absolutely recommend another student to take the class because it is fantastic, interesting, and life altering. It is also a unique opportunity to meet a truly fantastic professor.",
    "Anyone interested in the study of history (or the study of life for that matter) should sign up for this class. If you don't fit that description you should still take it, just to experience Professor Gaddis.",
    "If you can get in, sure, take it. It's a pretty easy, low-key class and you'll start thinking about history differently. I might have enjoyed it more if I did more of the reading, maybe. I cannot stress enough -- don't be fooled by the hype!!",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any student. It is a great way to interact personally with one of Yale's best professors as well as an opportunity to think about history in a new light.",
    "Take this class! What History Teaches has a lot of reading, but it's well worth it and the books are great. This is not a standard history class that focuses on learning facts--this class will change your perspective about history and life. You don't have to love history to enjoy this class, though you do have to like thinking. Gaddis brings in connections from movies to science. He also seems to know everything about everything. There's a great balance between student discussion and Gaddis sharing his wisdom. Occasionally class becomes story time with Gaddis, and those moments are wonderful. You have to read War and Peace, which to me looked long and painful at first, and it'll be tempting to Sparknote, but if you give it a chance it's actually a great book and the way Gaddis connects it to the course is brilliant. Also, the papers for this class were shortish (4 papers x 5pgs each) and on creative topics, such as \"personal autobiography\" or \"historical record of what you did on Oct 1\" etc. It's not hard to get an A in the class, and writing the papers is fun, not stressful."
