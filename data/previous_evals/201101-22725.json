    "Math 260 is a fairly easy work load class (take-home midterms, no problem sets), however it is very easy to get lost in the material. I went in hoping to learn some interesting math to apply to physics, but didn't learn anything beyond what is generally covered in linear algebra and differential equations. For those interested in the pure math side of things, this class is most certainly not a decent replacement for 301\/305.Also the text has absolutelyno utility and doesn't reflect what was done in class at all.",
    "Yes, light workload, interesting material.",
    "This class has quite challenging material but is not too intensive. I recommend it.",
    "Great class. No homework. The material is difficult but definitely doable."
