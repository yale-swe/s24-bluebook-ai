    "Yes it is a good course in an intimate setting",
    "I would recommend this course to heritage students who practice speaking at home but would like to improve on writing. If you do not practice speaking at home, the class will be more tailored to students at a higher level, though it is perfectly manageable with some extra work.",
    "Great course as long as you are willing to put in the time.",
    "Great course. The only weaknesses, really, were my classmates. Since this is a heritage class, the class will always be very small, so it's really win or lose in your classmates. For me, it was definitely a lose because my classmates were very quiet and unmotivated to speak and converse in Korean or about Korean culture. Professor Lee is charming, cute and motherly.It's very clear how to get an A in this course - study your vocab, speak often during class, go to section with your marked-up homework, spend a little extra time on your homework - especially short essays - and Professor Lee will notice. Your work pays off, and you'll see this while speaking with your parents or family on the phone."
