    "I would recommend this class to a student who has already taken classes in international development or NGOs and would like a closer look at the ways in which non-state welfare provision interacts with states. Be prepared to work with data on your final paper.",
    "yes!",
    "Social Welfare and NGOs covers a broad range of types of social welfare provision and non-state actors. It would be useful for anyone interested in aid and evaluating social welfare programs.",
    "If you are interested in learning about service provision outside of the traditional role of the sate, take this course. However, the seminar discussion is not that great. If you want to take a seminar where there is more discussion you are better off taking a different course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student in the social science sphere who wants to learn about social welfare from the ground up. You gain valuable exposure to research methods, statistics-driven political analysis, and a diverse array of real-world cases studies of NGOs and governmental social welfare projects. This was Professor Baldwin's first year teaching this course, and I think she will get better as she goes. That being said, some of the readings get pretty long and dry (filled with statistical models), so be prepared to skim and work through those sections."
