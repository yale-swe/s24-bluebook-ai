    "I would recommend the course to any student of literature or history. The readings, discussions, assignments were all good.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 899 01 !",
    "I would. For students of basically any department, too. It's a great introduction to things that any student should know - and that impression is the sign of a great course.",
    "A study of the cultural development of Modernity through literature in the 19th century. An excellent course.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student.",
    "It feels a somewhat more like a French class than a CompLit class - although its interdisciplinary nature does mean it is useful to CompLit students, even if the focus of the class is on one country's literature. I would recommend it to anyone who is seeking to get a good overview of the preoccupations of many of the great novelists of 19th century France, and who is looking for an exploration of some of the prominent theorists of modernity."
