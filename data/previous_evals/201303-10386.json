    "LET YOUR HESITATIONS MELT AWAY. Forget Chinese or Spanish or Arabic or what the Economist tells you would be the most 21st-century ornament on your LinkedIn page. Take Russian and we'll take the global arms trade by storm.",
    "I would recommend it. If you are considering it seriously, just make the decision to do it.",
    "It's a LOT of Russian, every day, but there's no better way to learn such a tricky language. Both Professor Muravnik and the TAs are excellent. You'll be stunned at how much you've learned by the end of the semester.",
    "If you want to actually learn Russian at a good pace, take it. Professor Muravnik is totally right in saying that languages are best learnt at a fast pace and it seems doubly true for a Slavic (=complex) language.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn Russian. And if you're a little unsure, still -- take the class. I took it for weird and personal reasons, but don't regret it all. I'm impressed by my progress (and of course, eager to learn more).",
    "If you want to learn Russian at Yale, this is the way to do it. To go more slowly seems ridiculous (you wouldn't even get through all the cases in a semester). People complain about the workload for this class, but really it's just a steady hour or two of homework every day and you get 2 credits. Kostya (Constantine, the professor) is extremely knowledgeable (besides being a native Russian speaker and hard to distinguish from native in English, he can offer comparisons to French, German, Latin, etc., and knows etymologies and other interesting bits of history) and makes class worthwhile. At least in our large class (about 13), half of the time was spent with TAs, which does change things up, but your experience will depend on your TA. You do not need to know any Russian to do well in the class; those who have some Russian or other Slavic language experience (not me) will find it easier and\/or get better faster, though. As far as I can tell, the grading is extremely lenient, especially with orals. You should know that speaking and pronunciation are not heavily emphasized, probably because of all the grammar to cram in (although some of the choices the textbook makes in terms of order of presentation are pretty questionable).",
