    "Definitely helped me think about the importance of editorial and print practices, and the consequences of book history for other types of literary criticism.Part of a much longer process of figuring out what kind of scholarship I myself want to do. I don't think I'm going to be a book historian, but the course definitely helped me along in defining what exactly it is that I'm interested in. Also provided different ideas for the ways that book history can contribute to other types of projects"
