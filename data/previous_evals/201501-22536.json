   "comments": [
    "Phil 126 is an excellent intro philosophy class focusing mainly on epistemology and philosophy of mind. Although it's a survey, DeRose puts a huge emphasis on seeing how each philosopher responds to the ones who came before, so there is a large degree of continuity\/coherence. He also is a fabulous and pretty laid-back teacher. Would recommend to anyone with an interest in philosophy\/cognitive science.",
    "Weekly readings and section, midterm, paper, and final. Grading can be tough on the exams, and readings also go very quickly, so keep up.",
    "I would if you want some background in modern philosophy or just philosophy in general.",
    "A solid class. Epistemology\/Metaphysics is the main focus of the course dealing mainly with sensations versus existence as a theme through the early modern philosophers. I found the course interesting and a nice exposure to systematic philosophy. I personally would have liked a little variation on topics (maybe just a few moral musings, but I understand for comparisons sake why we followed one theme. Professor DeRose is a good lecturer. He is not the most engaging, but, if you are interested in the material, he does a very good job clarifying difficult\/complex arguments. While I know this class is marketed as the major required philosophy class, I, and the majority of my class, were mainly STEM majors who were taking a fun humanities credit. I found the grading to be a bit worrisome. With only three grades, there is a lot of pressure, and I find that there is always some subtlety that I missed\/misspoke due to the precision and long tradition of philosophy to which I have not been exposed. I would recommend this class in general to most students who are willing to do the reading and engage in section. Grading: moderate ; Workload: light-medium; Knowledge: EPISTEMOLOGY\/METAPHYSICS HWSNBN",
    "PHIL 126 is a solid introduction to some seminal thinkers in early modern philosophy. Professor DeRose does a good job of tracing threads between the philosophers, highlighting similarities and differences among them. Take this class!",
    "Material is good and important to learn. I felt, however, that I learned more from doing the readings and independent thinking than the lectures. Take it if you want to a survey of modern philosophy, but be prepared to guide yourself through it.",
    "This is, much as it sounds, an introduction to philosophy necessary for the major. If someone is interested in the basic questions that have shaped modern philosophy, this is a good and representative opening. The readings aren't overwhelming and they really make you think. I would recommend it to someone trying to figure out if philosophy is right for them.",
    "This class is for anyone who wants to consider studying philosophy, or who has any interest at all in the subject--the reading list is excellent, the content is really, really cool, and it's taught me to think differently, even after one semester. I'm definitely going to keep studying philosophy, and I would encourage anyone and everyone to take this course!",
    "Decent introduction to Descartes, Leibniz, Berkeley, Hume, Locke, Thomas Reid, Kant. (Though when I took the course, we did only 1.5 weeks on Kant, so don't take the course if you're looking mainly to do Kant.) The course did a good job of showing you some of the difficulties of the questions these philosophers address and some of the complexities of their responses to them. It's helpful having this introduction for when you get to Kant, but the course will likely still drag if you're not interested so much in the first six philosophers THEMSELVES (rather than just as preparation for Kant)."
