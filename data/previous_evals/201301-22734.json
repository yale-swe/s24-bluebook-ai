    "This class deals with topics of molecular adaptations, primate evolution, and comparative genomics. You get out of the class exactly what you put in. If you enjoy he subject matter, then you will most likely enjoy the class too. Not too much work, although the final week can be a little stressful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a student who has a bit of literacy in and affinity for primatology\/genetics. I wouldn't think it would be totally necessary to take ANTH 212 first (would depend on how much biology\/primatology the student already had) but it was productive for me to take them in sequence.",
    "This is a really interesting course on primate genomics. It is mostly student led with lecture style presentations from classmates on a topic in the field of interest.",
    "This is a great advanced science class, however students of all backgrounds can succeed in this course if they are willing to put in a little extra work. Bradley is very understanding as long as you show that you are trying. I would recommend this course!"
