   "comments": [
    "The course can be good, and the Labs great. However, until the professors have got their act together and have the Labs correspond with the classroom, DO NOT take this course. You will regret it...",
    "This class is essential to an electrical engineer. I would recommend it. Workload is manageable. Labs are very useful in gaining practical experience and deeper understanding. Be prepared to spend time on them.",
    "I would recommend EENG 203 to another student, with some reservations. The class covers some very important material, but the disparity between topics covered in class and topics covered in labs was frustrating.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. If they re-write the labs (which they should) then the class will be great. If not, this class will be a frustrating and miserable waste of your time. If you want to know how your life will be in this class, grill the professors on the first day about whether or not the labs have been re-written. If they say anything expect for yes, completely, then good luck.",
    "I was incredibly disappointed by this class. It was extremely disorganized, and there was an enormous disconnect between lab and class. I believe this class was taught by two different professors last year; this year, Prof. Reed and Prof. Tang revised the curriculum but left the labs the same. Unfortunately, the labs were intimately related to the old curriculum. Given the new curriculum, the labs were irrelevant and extremely challenging because we did not have any of the theoretical foundation necessary to do them well. Also, I felt that even though the professors taught well, we didn't actually learn that much new material. I think they could have taught us a lot more. That said, I think both professors are GOOD professors, and taught the material well. Also, the TA's were very helpful and supportive, helping both with the labs and the problem sets. I would like to believe that since this was just the first year with the new professors, the class will improve next year. That said, the class, as I experienced it, was was disorganized and frustrating.",
