   "comments": [
    "Amazing course for scientists and non-scientists alike. I've been doing hard science for 4 years and its nice to finally see how that applies to the real world",
    "I was really excited for this course but was a little disappointed. I feel that lectures could have been more useful than they were. I liked the current events but questions took so long and transitioning that they took up too much of class. Overall, the lectures were a little scattered. It seemed like we constantly ran out of time, usually people of many random comments by other students. There's too many people in the class to really have a constructive seminar format.",
    "An interesting class. You won't necessarily learn that much new stuff if you've taken a global health class, but you will learn a lot on your own. Final project is to write a grant proposal for a new biotech idea, which was really fun for us. Very low work - weekly (sometimes less) reading responses, midterm project, and final project.",
    "If you can get in, take it. I absolutely loved this class. I went to every single class, did all the readings, loved the assignments, and feel like I will use this knowledge in so many ways going forward. To me, that's an incredible course. The prof and TF's were incredible, and you get to know so many other similarly passionate students across a variety of majors. I will also add that you will get out of this course what you put into it, but for me, it was so easy to find the motivation to do the work and care about the assignments that this wasn't hard in the slightest.",
    "YES OF COURSE, BEST CLASS AT YALE IF YOURE INTERESTED IN GLOBAL HEALTH",
    "I would highly recommend the class to students interested in the social aspects of biotechnology. It is not as scientific based though which is a good thing.",
    "A great experience for someone like me, a science major without much prior exposure to global health. The class provides a broad overview of all the challenges and considerations necessary for a successful biotechnology to make an impact in the developing world. Can be a bit basic at times on the global health side of things, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for someone who has had prior experience in the area. By far the greatest resource however are Professor Gonzalez and the TFs. They all bring a wealth of experience, and can be incredibly helpful in advising you on your final project (which can and have turned into summer\/post-grad startup projects). They are also wonderfully enthusiastic about connecting you to people who share your interests, so if you are serious about having the opportunity to make something new and helpful, definitely go to them, take this class, and they can help you create something special.",
    "A great course! Being a global affairs major, I was a bit nervous about initially enrolling, as most of the class seemed to be biomedical engineering\/pre-med kids. But do it! Anjelica really values the perspectives that we all bring, and I definitely felt like I was contributing in a different way to class discussion through my legal and international background.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! this epitomizes a 'Yale' class and uses so many cool resources and ideas.",
    "Chill class that focuses on the cultural and socioeconomic factors that make biotech innovations succeed or fail in the developing world. Prof Gonzalez is the nicest person and really cares about her students. Most of your grade is based on group projects, so beware if you're not a fan of that.",
    "Definitely would recommend.",
    "Yes absolutely",
    "Having taken a lot of hard technical STEM-classes, the class was a nice change of pace. You still need a working knowledge of biotechnology, but there's a lot of coverage on implementation, and social\/cultural factors involved with deploying biotechnology. If you're interested in global health and how biotechnology might play a role in developing countries, this is the class to take. Professor Gonzalez is fantastic. The workload is pretty low, except for two group projects. How these projects go will depend on your group members, which is not the best, sometimes, but you have plenty of time if you manage yourself well.",
    "An easy class for those interested in development. You don't need much BME knowledge (I wasn't BME and was 100% fine), but you also won't get much BME-type knowledge out of it. You're not going to learn too much if you're familiar with development, but the group projects were very cool - one was to submit a proposal to Gates Grand Challenges.",
    "Yes, it's different from most classes since it focuses very much on current and challenging issues. The team projects are fun and the readings are interesting and useful to know about. There will be some slow classes but the interactive sessions were a blast.",
    "Wow, this is the only interdisciplinary class that I took. Taking it with Prof. Gonzalez was a treat. Through the class I learned about what it means to develop meaningful and useful technology. It forced me to think about minute details and challenge traditional volunteer and service trips. The current events presentations were a fun way to see what classmates were passionate about.",
    "This is one of those courses where you get out what you put in. If you are an engineering (or other STEM) major, it can really help broaden your perspective. Prof. Gonzalez is also very enthusiastic, which helps keep students motivated. Both the midterm and final are group projects. While they were overall great projects, it can be very frustrating to try to coordinate with everyone throughout the semester. This is important to keep in mind up front.",
    "This was my favorite class at Yale. You will learn so much, and have a blast doing it. Grading isn't harsh, but projects will be graded harsher than reading assignments. Absolutely 100% take this class. I loved coming to class each and every day.",
    "This course was one of the best classes I've taken so far at Yale. It provided me a clear understanding of what it takes to design a successful project in the realm of biotechnology, and I was inspired to pursue a project of that nature. Few classes have left me with the knowledge, to apply what I learned in the classroom to a practical problem. I would definitely recommend taking this course if you have any interest in global\/public health or engineering.",
    "Biotech and the Developing World is a fun course with a lot of good material to think about. It covers a broad range of material from need, development, failure, and implementation concerns. With a good class the group projects are actually a lot of fun and the reading responses really allow you to get out of them what you put into it. In short I loved it!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in taking an introductory public health course with a technological focus. It may be a little repetitive for someone who has already taken a lot of classes in public health."
