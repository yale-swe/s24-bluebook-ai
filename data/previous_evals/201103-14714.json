   "comments": [
    "We would watch and listen to a portion of an opera as well as read supplementary works for each class meeting. Overall the discussion was very good. Professor McCreless is very approachable and puts so much effort into making sure the class runs smoothly. He is willing to meet with his students to discuss the way the class is going, and is a great source of information when preparing for papers and presentations. I would suggest reading a biography of Wagner before you take the course so that you can delve right into the works. I would definitely recommend this, or any course that Professor McCreless teaches.",
    "Seminar on the Ring (duh). Just go from A to B, learning about the literature, theory and history behind it.",
    "It's great listening\/watching the operas, but the class itself wasn't my favorite. I often felt like we ended up spending way too much time in class making superficial laundry lists of what we found interesting, without any real learning taking place--kind of like as if we were just a bunch of particularly-educated pals sitting around and gabbing about how great Wagner's music was. Overall, I was pretty disappointed in it, even though I enjoyed it at times.",
    "I would definitely recommend it - I learned a ton about Wagner and about musical scholarship in general. The only caveat is that Professor McCreless loves talking about key relations in Wagner, which is an interesting topic but was a bit overrepresented in discussion. Other than that, Professor McCreless is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic and great to learn from.",
    "This class was very ambitious in tackling the whole ring cycle in one semester, however, Professor McCreless was well aware of this and managed to cover all of the operas in sufficient detail. It was not the most organized, but that led to more free form discussions on topics which the class found most pertinent. It was an enjoyable introduction to a work that could take an entire life's work of study to fully understand. If you have any interest in Wagner, I would highly recommend this class.",
    "This is a great class - I highly recommend it! I knew very little about Wagner coming into the class, and Prof. McCreless is an amazing resource. Definitely take it!",
    "If you're a huge fan of the Ring, you will love this class! If you've never seen the Ring, you will love this class! And even if you hate the Ring, you'll *still* love this class because Professor McCreless is the most wonderful teacher you'll ever have."
