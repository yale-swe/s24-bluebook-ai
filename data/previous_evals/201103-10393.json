    "This course is an overview of the different kinds of research happening in chemical biology. It looks into methods that probe biological system with small molecules or ways to perturb biological systems with synthetic macromolecules.",
    "This course investigates both classical and modern techniques in the field of Chemical Biology. This is a great course, and I definitely recommend taking it -- however, I would suggest that the student have some basic chemical biology background prior to taking this course.",
    "Yes, I definitely would. Great class to take for exposure to a variety of chemical biology techniques and advancements in the field. Also learn to read literature and get exposure to a variety of new areas of research.",
    "Chemical Biology provides a broad overview of current research and academic pursuits within this newly developing field of chemistry. Students are exposed to a variety of topics and allowed to discuss and present different findings for each. This is a great class. It helps one connect how chemical research is easily applied for biological uses."

   "comments": [
    "I havenot started research yet. This course broadened my understanding of what qualifies as chemical biology and helped me understand a lot of cutting edge techniques.",
    "I attribute pretty much all of my knowledge of chemical biology to this course. I have done some lab rotations in MBB and MCDB, and I feel that I have a MUCH better understanding of the research which goes on in those labs because of this class. This course will have a lasting impact on my future research and dissertation.",
    "Exposure to a variety of areas was very helpful for research and in acknowledging the leading research in each field. Class presentations were also very helpful in providing a broad overview that will also be helpful.",
    "This course helped outline current research expanding the fields of chemistry and biology. Basic and difficult topics were discussed and learned. Additionally, the presentation requirements helped me to learn how to better read academic papers and present their findings. Great course."
