   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Really great course! Very interactive and very relevant & thought-provoking topics covered.",
    "Strengths: Everything from the guest speakers to readings to in class activities are well planned out. There was one day when the majority of the class was zoned out and it seemed as if we did not do the reading so Megan became upset. Make sure you come to class prepared to answer questions from the reading! Weaknesses: The format can be a little redundant: lecture then student presentations. The readings are interesting but the amount is a tad bit overwhelming.",
    "I enjoyed the course material.",
    "i liked a lot presentations from guests.",
    "The individual presentations were a nice way to bring in more class participation\/different perspectives, I enjoyed that aspect of the class more than I expected to. The in-class group projects were interesting and helpful for discussion, as well. Sometimes it felt like the class was too large for the discussion activities to work out optimally, but the resulting discussion was still good.",
    "Strengths - group work, raised important issues, allowed students to voice opinions while challenging them in appropriate and meaningful ways Weaknesses - The projects were a great idea, would have preferred a bit more time talk about discussion questions but i think this was related to lack of time overall",
    "Great course. It should be one of the core courses for YSPH. Great material and lots of opportunities for dialogue in the classroom.",
    "Great course! Enjoyed the topics and classroom atmosphere. We all seemed very engaged and this led to great in-class discussions. The papers are also thought provoking. The student presentations were my favorite part of the class though. There was such a range of interesting topics people chose. Each class flew - we always seemed to be running out of time.",
    "Strength: organized in a way that is linear",
    "Strengths: I really enjoyed this course! I like that the class was broken up into lecture and student presentations, as I felt it allowed me to learn about a wide variety of topics related to mental health. I also enjoyed the in class activities that we did, as they really helped to cement some of the material we were covering. Weaknesses: I found it a little problematic that participation was such a large part of our grade for this class when it ended up being a fairly large class, and some people, such as myself, are not as comfortable participating in large groups. Though as mentioned above, I appreciated the in class activities with smaller groups, as I felt more comfortable speaking up in this setting. I do also wish that we had watched the documentary on suicide. I realize that this is an upsetting topic, but I think as future public health professionals, it is one we need to be open to discussing.",
    "Strengths: learned so much, all the material was so relevant and interesting, and the structure of the course really helped to put all the key concepts and topics together. The class presentations were fun and interesting as well, and the guest speakers were great. Weaknesses: can't think of any!",
    "I think this was an excellent course about mental health in America. We covered almost every relevant mental health issue and heard from student panelists regarding specific issues of interest. However, by virtue of covering so much information, I felt sometimes that it prevented us from going into depth on some of the issues. I felt that we were rushing during some classes. Thus, I think the class could be improved if maybe some topics were taken out and we went into depth more.",
    "Great subjec matter and class style which was heavily based on student participation. Instrctor was great and assigned readings phenomenal. The student presentations were great for public speaking.",
    "The class was ok -- it was so much theory and I wish we were given more skills or application, though I'm not sure how that would happen unless it was a social work or psychology program.",
    "This was a fabulous course, one of the highlights of my semester academically. I loved being able to hear from each classmate during the presentations. I also enjoyed writing the final papers, though I think the class could have benefitted from receiving a little more in-class instruction as to the expectations for each writing assignment.",
    "Very good, interesting topics. Sometimes, I wished we had more time to go in depth on the lecture subject, and didn't have to break for student presentations.",
    "Strengths: The papers we were assigned to read were very interesting, and we got to discuss them in class. We also had an excellent TA, Elizabeth. Weaknesses: The classes didn't necessarily talk about the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. However it would have been nice to start with a general overview of the disease to have a better understanding of the disease discussed. The classes didn't have too much structure. We had too many readings assigned per week, ranging between 5-6 papers. Due to that we didn't discuss all the papers we had to read, it would be nice perhaps to have a list of must-read papers (the ones we would discuss in class), so that it became more manageable. I could not manage to read all the papers assigned, in addition to the 5-7 papers assigned in the other classes as well.",
    "This course is a fantastic introductory course to mental health topics. I appreciated the frequency of use of guest speakers as it was just enough to enrich the course with outside firsthand experiences without being too often as to disrupt the flow of the course. The classes were well organized and I enjoyed the breakdown of the class with the second portion of the class being dedicated to student presentations. The class readings were also always relevant and very interesting. The class's no laptop rule was very inconvenient during class discussion since the readings were numerous and often long and printing every one to bring to class in hard copy was expensive and environmentally wasteful. Because of this, I often did not print them, but as a result, struggled when referring to them in class discussion.",
    "My overall assessment of the course is that it was a fantastic experience to say the least. Strengths: very strong and informative lectures, fruitful class discussions, student panels, class break, interesting topics that come up in class as opportunities to research and then follow up discussions in class. Weaknesses: Inconvenient class time, panels are too short.",
    "Excellent course. Sometimes there were some time management issues (for example, we didn't always have time to discuss student presentations at the end of class).",
    "I thought this course was great. I think that the material was well-organized and very interesting. It was not unfairly rigorous, yet did require engagement with the readings and material from class to complete assignments. My least favorite part about the class was probably some of the guest speakers, only because their presentations were sometimes a little off-topic or technical.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and really feel like I learned a lot from both instructor and student presentations.",
    "We were able to cover a great deal of subject matter over the course of the semester. While it was sometimes rushed, I enjoyed that we were able to learn about diverse topics. I also really enjoyed the individual presentations as it was nice to educate the class on a topic of interest to me as well as hear from other students. The only downside was that we only had 5 minutes to present and little time for discussion due to the number of students in the class. I also didn't love all of the class speakers."

   "comments": [
    "Great course, definitely recommend if you are interested in mental health.",
    "Really great exploration into various topics concerning the role of social and cultural factors in mental health. I would recommend it to students who are interested in this perspective on mental health or anyone who is interested in mental health in general!",
    "The course does a great job of introducing the concept of mental health and illness and how social and cultural factors can affect them. The course covers a number of subpopulations and specific illnesses. I would recommend it as it is a well-organized and relevant course.",
    "Yes, if mental health interests you.",
    "I would. It is very useful for understanding the burden of mental illnesses and the ways how public health can provide support for those who need it",
    "A course that looks at various topics in mental health from a social perspective. The class is broad, but the discussion can be interesting. Not a skills-based course so much as a way-of-thinking course; I would recommend it if the student has an interest in mental health.",
    "Great course. Best course I took all semester. All the assignments were great and not overwhelming. I recommend it 100%.",
    "Great overview of a range of populations with unique mental health needs. Papers are not overwhelming. Readings go quick. This is definitely an enjoyable class.",
    "This course will give you an overview of a broad variety of issues related to mental health and I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Regardless of department or field of interest, EVERYONE should take this course. Mental health is such an important area that intersects all facets of pubic health, and this course truly makes you appreciate and understand that. I highly recommend this course.",
    "This class is a great survey course regarding mental health issues in America. I would definitely recommend it to any student. I really took a lot out of the class, and it gave me a new perspective not only on mental health, but also on public health in America. Definitely one of my favorite classes I've taken during my time at Yale!",
    "Highly recommended. Interesting papers and readings, interesting class discussions, and high degree of choice in topics to write\/present on.",
    "Fantastic course, a wonderful overview of mental health. Megan and Elizabeth are fabulous instructors.",
    "A good introductory level course to the issues, but it doesn't get into too much depth.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student. It covers a wide sector of issues that are critical to public health and engages students of all backgrounds in mental health knowledge.",
    "I would say that if you are interested in anything mental health related at a public health level, this is a \"Must-Take\" course. Be prepared to be challenged, to grow, and to learn much more than you could've ever anticipated.",
    "I would highly recommend this class - really opened my eyes to public health approaches to mental health.",
    "This course is a great introduction to topics in mental health. For anyone interested in health disparities or vulnerable populations, this course is a great way to bolster your specific knowledge on mental health problems. The workload is not too much or too little; great class all around.",
    "I think this course provides a really interesting overlook of the difficulties facing both individuals and providers in the mental health system. The class readings were very interesting, and class presentations provided new insights into a variety of different aspects in the mental health field. I think you will get the most from this class if you take the time to really delve into all of the readings.",
    "Great course overall. Covers a range of topics, so there is something of interest to everyone and you are sure to learn from it, regardless of how much experience you having working in the mental health field. Only limitation is that there isn't much opportunity to explore a topic in depth during class time, but your class projects allows for self-directed study of a particular subject area. Megan is a great teacher as well!"
