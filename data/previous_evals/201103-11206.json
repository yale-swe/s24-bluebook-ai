   "comments": [
    "An awesome class. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to students interested in the subject matter, especially those who aspire to be a U.S. legislator in the future. The readings for this class are highly readable and enjoyable, and the class discussions are extremely interesting. You'll feel as though you have just become a freshman legislator, faced with multiple dilemmas that actual legislators encounter on a daily basis. Larry is amazing and his stories working as a legislator himself were very informative and helpful. If you are lucky enough to get in, don't hesitate and just take it. Youwon't regret it.",
    "It forces you to think about your beliefs and your decision making. Definitely one worth taking.",
    "A great look into the major ethical dilemmas facing legislators. Though the class focuses on the state legislature, it's still very applicable to the federal government.",
    "If you get in, take it! This course was very interesting. Four papers on interesting topics, and class was really fun. Prof. Alexander even brings a snack to every seminar! If you're looking to learn how a legislature works from a former legislator, take it. Only problem is it doesn't count for the PLSC major.",
    "Yes, take this class. It wasn't the most exciting class to me all semester, but in retrospect it was a really great opportunity to dig in deep on all sorts of questions you might have never thought about that legislators have to confront on a daily basis, to talk about those questions with a bunch of people who are probably going to be successful politicians some day, and to hear endless interesting stories from a professor who has personal experience with these topics (as well as Mike Dukakis!). Just understand that most of the class will be made up of guys who want to go in to politics.",
    "An opportunity to learn about the most difficult decisions of being a legislator.",
    "Great seminar. Class will likely be made up of students experienced and greatly interested in politics, which leads to good and interesting discussion. Professor Alexander did a great job bringing in illustrative real world examples (introduced through newspaper clippings) to help better comprehend the ethical dilemmas legislators face on an everyday basis."
