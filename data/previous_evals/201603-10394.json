   "comments": [
    "I took Basic Drawing because I wanted to practice my drawing skills. I don't think I improved that with this class. I did, however, learn how to look abstraction in a better light. I brought myself to think of some of it as an expressive art form with meaning behind it.",
    "I learned how to figure out what works for me and what I want to further explore as an artist.",
    "This course forced me to re-evaluate my understanding of what it is to draw, and Molly definitely succeeded in breaking down all our received prejudices around the discipline. I developed a better ability to quickly synthesize information (music, text, objects) and turn it into some form of drawing. We were also encouraged to think of drawing, and art in general, as not just confined to the arts, but linked to current affairs as much as the social sciences are.",
    "I mainly gained a new perspective on the broad definition of what \"art\" can mean, as well as exposure to many artists, movements, and terminology I had not encountered. This very loose but historically informed approach to art was new to me.",
    "I learned to draw! How to represent 3d things in 2d and also how to draw abstract thoughts which was even cooler. Also how to experiment visually.",
    "I learned to think in a way very much different than I had before. Some of my long-held beliefs about art were challenged and I believe the course really helped me improve my conceptual thinking skills.",
    "I gained more of an appreciation for abstract art and artistic thought. I learned how to connect art to bigger ideas.",
    "I learned how to think about art in a very nuanced way, which I really appreciated. The course brought together alot of topics outside of art - philosophy, literature, etc - so that was a great way to be introduced to the subject.",
    "This course allowed me to expand my definition of drawing and what makes art powerful, while freeing me to explore non-representational drawing and techniques."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the class wasn't structured enough. That was due to the professor, and in no way is it bad--that was her style, and it worked for her and the class. With that said, I do think we could have drawn way more in class.",
    "The course was a little disorganized. There was a lot of freedom to explore my own interests, which was especially nice for a beginning art class.",
    "The content of the course is very dependent on the instructor, which I definitely think is as it should be with art classes, however if you didn't like the teaching style of the instructor it would really change your experience of the class.",
    "The strength of this course lies in the enthusiasm and insight of the professor, who was engaged and passionate and encouraging. However, the weakness of the course comes from its lack of structure: there were very few formal lessons on technique, and no schedule was followed.",
    "Strength: drawing, 4hr of weekly relaxation, low stress, learning a valuable skill, spontaneity Weakness: spontaneity",
    "Overall, the course had a great dynamic. I think, as tempting as it is to deviate, the course should have had a bit more structure. And I do think it would have been beneficial to dive into some more of the classic drawings \"basics\" even if they feel antiquated or irrelevant.",
    "Professor Zuckerman-Hartung was an amazing teacher and really let us discover some of the deeper meanings behind art. I actually wish the classes were a little longer or met a bit more frequently.",
    "The strength of the class was in Molly's insight. A weakness of the class was that it was pretty disorganized. Assignments were often unclear. It seems that the class wasn't basic drawing but more of an introduction to abstract thought.",
    "If you're taking this course with Molly, it'll be different from art courses you've taken in the past. Molly tends to focus more on the theory and philosophy of art more so than the actual technical applications, so if you're looking for a class that's all about learning techniques, this isn't the class for you. You'll be introduced to new, various ways of thinking about art, however, which is very valuable.",
    "Though the course sometimes felt a bit disorganised, as a whole it was constantly engaging and surprising in the best way possible."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. I do think that with Molly the course description should be changed. The class is not Basic Drawing,but rather \"the Politics and Philosophy of Abstraction.\"",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to take an art class but has little experience in art.",
    "I would very highly recommend this course to students like me who have a strong foundation in drawing technique but need to be stretched intellectually and creatively. I would not recommend this course to students trying to strengthen a technical foundation in drawing.",
    "Molly was an amazing, innovative professor who was truly unpredictable and really sought for her students to experiment with art and learn in their own way. Less pedagogy and more experimentation. This class was a lot of fun",
    "Yes, would recommend. But if you are trying to take a typical intro drawing class, this section may not fulfill that expectation. If you are trying to learn more about making meaning with drawing and thinking about drawing in a conceptual way, this is an excellent class.",
    "I would highly recommend Basic Drawing if only because of the way it makes you see the world differently.",
    "This course is not for everyone. It is not for a student looking to refine her drawing skills or learn the basic techniques of art. It is for a student who wants to discuss really conceptual ideas and try out really conceptual and abstract art.",
    "It's a pretty chill art class that really makes you think about a certain subject. I would say take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student with a background or interest in art and\/or drawing - it's a very mind opening and freeing course which will help you grow as an artist."
