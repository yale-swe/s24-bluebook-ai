    "This course is very reading intensive, but the syllabus is a blast. After first semester of DS literature, second semester is the chance to start having those \"DS moments\", when you begin to trace themes and ideas from work to work, while reading some of the best literature the west has to offer.",
    "I could not recommend this class more highly.",
    "Second semester Lit is one of the best parts of DS - there's a ton of reading, but it's also incredibly enjoyable reading. Despite the class's insane speed, you get so much out of the discussions, lectures, and papers. Professor Levin is wonderful - totally enthusiastic about the works and about her students, and a wonderful discussion leader. She also tends to have us focus on key passages to get at major themes, so you get the close-reading experience in section, which is really nice. She is a very fair grader, and gives incredibly extensive and helpful comments. She is also just so kind and supportive, and I feel really lucky to have had her.",
    "DS Lit is great 2nd semester. You get the chance to read the great works but with a knowledge of the classics, which will help you understand allusions and the complexity of texts. The reading is a lot heavier this semester (stay on top of it), but take the class with Levin! She is so nice and encouraging, and her section was quite enjoyable. She is very personable and she gives great feedback on papers.",
    "Second semester of DS Literature starts with Petrarch, and for a brief week, it may seem as if the torch that was passed from Homer to Virgil to Dante in the first semester will persist long into the winter months. This, however, would be a false assumption; aside from Petrarch, Milton, and, arguably, Tolstoy, the second semester of Literature makes a marked break from the first, and, in general, the connecting threads among the ten works read here are less readily apparent than they were before. That being said, all of the books are phenomenal, and though the reading load gets heavier with the addition of long novels like Don Quixote and War and Peace, these works deserve all of your attention, even if that means setting aside time during Winter and Spring Break to get a head start on the reading. Professor Levin has also taught first semester Literature, and she really enriched our DS experience by drawing from a deep well of knowledge about the Western canon. Her enthusiasm for these works is infectious, and I really appreciated how she never let us get so bogged down in structural or stylistic analysis that we missed the sheer beauty of these texts. A phenomenal syllabus, and an even more phenomenal professor.",
    "A great intro class on western literature. You will love it if you are interested in the reading materials. But you have to do the reading to really enjoy the class. The class is discussion-based. You'll have many chances to exercise your ability to express your understanding and analysis in a coherent and succinct manner. Most of the students in DS are very bright and sensitive to the texts. You'll learn a lot by listening carefully to your peers. It's a wonderful experience to gather with a bunch of bright and passionate peers to read and discuss some of the most interesting works ever written."
