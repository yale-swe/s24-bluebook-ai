   "comments": [
    "Close reading, writing philosophy papers",
    "One of the most formative philosophy classes I've taken. It taught me to question everything, especially things that have been assumed for centuries. The rigor of the discussion and the readings forces one to think more critically, analytically, and thus, philosophically.",
    "This was my favorite course this semester. Lucas was extremely passionate about the subject matter and did an amazing job teaching his first class. I highly recommend any class with him. I will add that at times the discussions were slightly disorganized but most of the time they were great.",
    "I have never taken a course in philosophy before, so this course introduced me to a very nuanced view of political philosophy.",
    "I gained deep insight into some of the top political philosophers of the twentieth century and learned how to read and comment on famous interpretations of ancient works."

   "comments": [
    "Readings were fascinating, seminar could be led a bit better.",
    "The readings, for how dense they were, were very long. That's the only thing I would change.",
    "The instructor is excellent at leading a small seminar. He used our weakly reading responses to guide discussion, which was very effective in further our introduction of the reading material and discussion. One of the weaknesses of the course is that sometimes the discussion was not engaging because very few of us (students) were able to follow. As a long seminar, it would have been effective to leave the last 5-10 minutes of class as a recap period to go over everything that had been discussed and make sure everyone was on the same page.",
    "This course had a perfect syllabus. It was incredibly well thought out and made sense each week. I loved reading Plato at the beginning and the middle and breaking the course into two parts--Nietzsche, Heidegger and Arendt, and then Gadamer and Strauss. Sometimes, Professor Entel lectured a bit too long where we could have had discussion instead, but it was never much of a problem. I always felt comfortable to talk in class and ask questions when needed.",
    "I thought this was a very good course, with a great syllabus. Seminar sessions typically generated good discussion, although the earlier sessions felt somewhat unstructured."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only for a student comfortable with philosophy. I don't think I would've survived had I not studied Plato prior.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students who are deeply interested in political philosophy. However, I highly recommend that you have experience coming into the course. I had no experience with philosophy and sometimes I felt like I was missing out on so much because I did not understand the references in the reading. However, if you are feeling adventurous, Professor Entel is more than willing to meet with students to discuss material and develop the essays for the course!",
    "I would highly recommend this course if it is taught again. I've never seen another class that gives students the chance to read famous interpretations of Plato. It is an invaluable skill for philosophy, political theory, and humanities more generally.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this. Lucas is extremely knowledgeable about work in this area and will expose you to a lot of scholarship on these subjects, especially if you want additional reading for essays, etc. Office hours with him were very helpful and he has a lot of insights into this material. The seminar is new, and some of the initial sessions felt a bit unstructured, but improved as the term progressed. I'm sure any future iteration of the course would be even stronger. If the authors on the syllabus compel you, definitely consider taking it. The seminar is a manageable amount of work that you can add as much additional reading to as you see fit. Especially if you've studied Plato in other contexts, you should find this a very intellectually rewarding experience."
