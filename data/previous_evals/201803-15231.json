   "comments": [
    "This was generally a very strong math class! A lot of time was spent discussing the finer points of proofs which could have been avoided and meant we soon lagged behind the schedule, but the material was really interesting and very well presented."

    "Yes.",
    "Yes, this is a great high-level math elective for undergrads. Asher is a wonderful teacher and the material is challenging but well presented, so it's easy to grasp if you put in the time. This comes with the standard grad class warning: do the reading and keep up on your own, because the lack of psets means there's little hand-holding.",
    "The topics we covered were all very important and I thought Professor Auel did a good job of explaining them clearly and making lectures interesting. However, I would have preferred some overview of how these topics fit into the subject of arithmetic geometry earlier in the semester, because it felt like we were discussing loosely related concepts for most of the semester until the very end when we turned back to applications to number theory."
