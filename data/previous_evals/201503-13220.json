    "well run course. Guest lectures were a nice addition",
    "we would appreciate if the instructor provided us with feedback about the four required papers during the semester.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I was thankful to take it and learn more about the art and science behind industrial hygiene. As someone interested in going into medicine, while retaining a public health perspective, I saw how much of the information is translational, in that I could easily apply lessons learned in the course to practice in a medical setting. I think it's useful to learn about other content areas, and I would recommend this course.",

    "Very informative, full of new things to learn"

    "Instructor: Howard J. Cohen \u00a0I really appreciated Dr. Cohen. I found him helpful, available on short notice, and willing to offer feedback. I also enjoyed his style of teaching, although, some of the lessons could be a little more linearly organized. In terms of his expectations for the course, I also appreciated his approach to assignments. I found I learned even more by going and having to do some additional research on topics, and that it reinforced what we were learning in class. I can also tell he has made high quality professional relationships, in that we had some interesting speakers, as well.",
    "Instructor: Howard J. Cohen \u00a0Funny guy, very up to date on the material, lots of experience, understanding towards students",
    "Instructor: Howard J. Cohen \u00a0Extremely friendly, has a great sense of hunour, very understanding, always makes sure we are comfortable with the work load, teaches well, great guest lectures"

    "Good opportunity to learn about the process of protecting the health and well-being of the working population. Dr. Cohen does a nice job of synthesizing the technical and relational aspects of industrial hygiene - that it's about the employees and employers, and that there's room to expand our knowledge about this particular population.",
    "Can be boring but an easy class that teaches you about industrial hygiene",
    "lots of information and new things to learn that are applicable at work place and home"
