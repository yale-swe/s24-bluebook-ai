    "My speaking skills improved drastically this semester. I learned a ton about Italian culture through the movies that we watched, the book we read, and the opera we watched. I thought the course did a great job of integrating culture and the grammar and structural part of the language.",
    "I learned all the Italian grammar necessary for fluent speech and writing skills in addition to learning new vocabulary and practicing conversation skills. We discussed Italian culture extensively, through cinema, art, music, and food.",
    "I learned several new grammar points. We did a lot of conversation practice and learned about Italian cinema.",
    "I improved my italian speaking, reading and writing abilities tremendously!",
    "I learned about the grammatical forms of Italian and new insight into the culture of Italy",
    "I really improved in NY conversation skills and listening abilities."

   "comments": [
    "The course was a wonderful, intensive study in Italian language and culture. It was very successful at bringing students to a proficient level of speech and writing. It could be improved by having more consistency in the work loads between sections of this course. Some classes had much more work than others.",
    "Sometimes there were too many handouts. Short quizzes were helpful in preparation for the tests. Sometimes conversation was slow and the activities seemed too contrived to take seriously. Otherwise, it was a strong class and moved at a good pace. I thought that the online workbook was busywork and could be eliminated.",
    "Strengths: effective Weakness: very fast pace",
    "I thought the strengths were the incorporation of film and the group participation. One area that I think could be improved is emphasizing how the verb tenses should be used in each situation",
    "I really liked all of the cultural and movie stuff but sometimes it was a little rushed."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. I thought it was challenging, yet I learned a lot. There was a lot of variety in the things that we did in class every day.",
    "Take Italian! It's a beautiful language and culturally rich. It's not difficult to switch from high school Spanish, Latin, or French to learning Italian, so I would highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn a new language that they can pick up fairly quickly.",
    "Yes, my Italian improved immensely over the course of the semester.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because from my experience, the Italian department has phenomenal teachers.",
    "This course was so good at teaching italian grammar in an easy to understand way while making it interesting."
