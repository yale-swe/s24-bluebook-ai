    "Absolutely essential for anyone interested in making organic molecules above a low threshold of complexity. For everyone else, a great exercise in logical thinking and creativity.",
    "Learn how to think about disconnecting molecules. Yes, I would recommend this to other grad students, the way the professor teaches also could help any undergrads who took the course",
    "I definitely will recommend this course to be continued next year, especially useful for the synthetic chemists.",
    "Great class",
    "Professor Phillips was a great speaker and made the class very interesting. I felt he could have made the class faster-paced though. I would certainly recommend it to a student who was not already very familiar with the field of organic synthesis.",
    "Would recommend--provides a broad overview of recent natural product synthesis. Learned about several useful reactions."

    "I've always loved total synthesis even though I am not working one of those projects; I enjoyed and benefited from seeing how a real total synthesis chemist thinks about molecules; I am sure I will find a reaction one day which professor went over in class and use hisadvice.",
    "Help me understand better pulse sequences used to generate the NMR readings",
    "I learned to think about how to approach the synthesis of complex natural products from a different perspective.",
    "Definitely deepened my knowledge; learned about many syntheses I had not seen before."
