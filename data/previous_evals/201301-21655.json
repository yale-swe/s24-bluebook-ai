    "Overall I would recommend it. I thought this course was great, but it seems to me like it has too many components in terms of work. Its strength is definitely its lecturers most of which were great. Its weakness is its sometimes counterproductive workload; with quizzes, primary lit, and midterm\/final in this kind of course makes it feel more difficult to concentrate on the interesting aspects of the material.",
    "Good class for students interested in the field.",
    "All the cool parts of biology (most of which have been published in the past 5 years!) Weekly quizes and two non-cumulative mid-terms. Weekly sections with paper summaries.",
    "Biotechnology is an excellent course and, in my opinion, one of the best biology lecture courses available here. The material is cutting-edge and the professors were engaging and fair. There are weekly quizzes on the lecture material, a midterm, and a final exam, and these should not be treated lightly as they can often be difficult. Each week there is also a section for which you must read\/respond to an article from the primary literature. It'sa little more work than I would have liked for my senior year, but overall I enjoyed this course and would definitely recommend it.",
    "I took this class to fulfill the above 350 requirement for MCDB. The first half was rather dull in a number of ways. In particular, the class puts alot of emphasis on the methods used in biotech research, which I found to be quite uninteresting.Wolenski's quizzes were also really annoying. Ostensibly, he designed them to make you \"think\", but they often times involved topics that I wouldn't have expected to be quizzed over.Issacs section, however, is by far the best. He goes over alot of modern research and I found his topics to be alot more interesting.Also, the class is overkill in terms of workload. Weekly quizzes plus weekly paper writes up coupled with two exams was a lot.",
    "Overall interesting material with a mixed bag of professors, with some very interesting and some boring lectures. The weekly quizzes keep you on top of the material and the journal articles are actually really interesting, and taught me how to read scientific papers better. Some of the exam questions are too vague or too specific, but decent class.",
    "This is my favorite MCDB course to date. The material is fascinating, the professors are very dedicated, and the TAs are awesome! Only thing to consider is that it is quite a bit of work although the weekly quizzes are a breeze compared to courses like cell bio and really do help you stay on top of the material.",
    "Since there are few upper level courses for MCDB majors I would recommend this course. The workload is a lot each week (quiz and reading response) and the tests are more difficult than expected. This course is not as laid back as other senior classes, but it is interesting and covers a wide range of topics.",
    "I'm a Junior MB&B major. HIGHLY recommend for the MCDB requirement. There's a bit of cell bio and a bit of organismal bio and a lot of (easy) biochem. It's SUPER interesting and though there is a \"large amount\" of work in terms of the amount of stuff you need to do for the quiz and the 1pg single spaced paper for section it's ALL you have to do. If you put in the time to review the lectures for the quiz and actually read the papers to write what is only a modified summary of them then when you get to the one midterm and one final you'll be amazed at how little you need to study. Wolenski is the ABSOLUTE BEST BIO PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER MET. He really cares and he's a genius, a combination Yale has thus-far made me think impossible. He deserves a raise and tenure for the fact that he doesn't even care about tenure and is just in it to have a good time and to teach us about ourselves, the world we live in and life itself. Nelson is an amazing and genuine person, I would have been glad to have him as my own father. He, just like Prof. Wolenski, are the best part of the course and a sheer joy to have as an instructor. IT'S THE BEST. TAKE IT. IF YOU'RE A JR or SR in MB&B or MCDB it's a MUST TAKE.",
    "It's an interesting course but involves a lot of busy work!",
    "Biotechnology was a very good course. The workload was very manageable. I would recommend the course to any second semester senior looking for a fun, easy way to fulfill the upper-level MCDB requirement. There are weekly quizzes that are very straightforward and force you to stay on top of the material. They make studying for the midterms and final much easier. Also, the final is non-cumulative, which is a plus. The papers to read for section each week are pretty interesting, and the summaries are really easy to write.",
    "It's got a lot of cool information and a lot of sort of dry material. There are more interesting classes above 350 in MCDB, but this is a solid group of lecturers. Exams aren't easy.",
    "An overview of recent developments in the field of biotechnology",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY without hesitation recommend Biotechnology. This has been my favorite science class at Yale. If you areinto biotech at all, TAKE IT. If you are an MCDB major and need a credit for the major, TAKE IT. Really, just TAKE IT. You'll learn a lot of material, and most importantly, you'll learn even more how to think like a scientist. I feel that my research design skills have vastly improved from this class.",
    "MB&B 370 is a great overview of different advances in biotechnology. Each of the lectures left me with different exciting ideas about future directions and future biotechnology projects. The only weakness of the class is that topics not covered by additional papers were never really studied in any depth.",
    "Loved the class and its content\/all the lectures! I honestly wish I'd had the chance to take this class before senior. Very applicable and engaging."
