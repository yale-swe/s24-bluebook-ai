   "comments": [
    "Great intro to bioethics. Really tough questions. Doesn't present you with answers, but gives you ways to think about them. Smith was a pleasure to listen to. He seems like an overall great gentleman, and you will enjoy his idiosyncrasies. The readings are interesting, and even if you miss some, you can catch most of the main points in lectures. Sections are great discussions. Great 4th or 5th credit.",
    "Definitely take it. If nothing else the lectures are great and make you think.",
    "Take it!",
    "pretty boring not too much work. tests are not easy though.",
    "its a pretty good class to take for credit. dont have to do much.",
    "Not a tough class and interesting, take it",
    "This was an interesting class about many different controversial topics. There was not much reading and debates that occurred throughout the course. It was a fairly easy course that had 2 midterms and a final. You had to write a little paragraph for each debate and go to section once a week, but it was still a very light work-load. I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "This is a fantastic class if you're interested at all in bioethics. Professor Smith is endearing and organizes his lectures very well. The readings are interesting, and in-class debates are a lot of fun. This is a great class to take with a full schedule because you get a lot out of it for pretty minimal work.",
    "Take it. Though the class can be a bit dry at times, you learn a LOT. The discussions in section are very fun and the TA's make it easy for you to communicate what you truly feel about the subject. The exams are based very much on the readings, so DO THEM. In class, Dr. Smith goes into more detail about what the books discuss. Take it.",
    "This class was easy. Some of the readings were interesting, others were not. Lectures were a joke. Professor Smith is very nice and enthusiastic. His lectures, however, often seemed like rambling about things he found interesting, and his mannerisms were hilarious (& sometimes very awkard). Exams were very easy if you did the (very minimal) reading the day before. Substitute a midterm for an in-class debate: even easier.",
    "the material in the class is semi-interesting, but the class overall is not great. david smith is not my favorite lecturer--he never gets to the point, and goes off on way too many tangents talking about unimportant topics. not a lot of work, but the tests are not very clear--multiple choice questions are poorly worded and essay questions are graded quick harshly. most of the readings are really terrible and difficult to get through.",
    "Take it!",
    "Looks at some of the prominent issues in medical bioethics such as abortion, cloning, telling the truth to the death and dying etc. I would definitely recommend this course because it grapples with issues that are extremely prominent in the community today.",
    "Good overview of ethics.",
    "This class is incredibly interesting and not that much work. I would highly recommend it.",
    "I took it Cr\/D just cause I needed a light fifth course in my schedule, and it worked perfectly. I definitely got some interesting perspectives out of it, and I certainly could have gotten more if I'd given the class more attention. Discussion section drags painfully, though, because much of the class is there because they know it's a gut. Which, in terms of workload, it is (you don't have to do the readings at all), though the essays on the exams required a bit more thought to get a good grade. Also, I highly encourage anyone who is able to participate in the debate aspect of the class--not only did it save me from having 3 midterms in 2 days; it also was one of the academic highlights of my semester.",
    "I do recommend it. Pretty easy class.",
    "An excellent credit\/d class. Not because its difficult to get an A but because you can pass without doing any of the readings or doing any work at all while still going to Prof Smith's awesome lectures.",
    "Great 5th class, interesting material and not too much work. Lectures are interesting, take it!",
    "Interesting couse material and not a lot of work. If you need a fifth class, this would be a great option! Or if you're interested in how morals, interests, and bioethics are applicable in relevant and controversial topics (such as abortion, death and truth telling, enhancement..etc) Iwould definitely recommend it!",
    "Issues in Bioethics was a fantastic class. The material was really interesting, the reading was light and usually fun to do, and the workload was minimal: two midterms and a final. This was one of my favorite classes that I've taken at Yale so far. I highly recommend it to anyone, but especially as a stress-free 5th class.",
    "No, this class is not as interesting or as easy as people say it is.",
    "I wouldn't take it. Not very interesting topics, and the professor is hard to follow",
    "Bioethics is such a large, interesting field, unfortunately this class focuses on the boring aspects. We talk about human subject research and animals in biomedical research for about one day each, but spend three weeks on dying. Review the syllabus before you take the course.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have an interest in bioethics, but do not take it just for fun because the tests are graded unfairly, kind of harsh. Lectures are tough to sit through and the readings are horrible.",
    "This is a good class. It's not difficult, you should know what's going on in the readings but if you do, it's very straight forward, and it covers interesting topics. The lectures though are just a summary of the reading which makes them fairly unfulfilling if you do the reading and if you don't do the reading they're helpful but don't give quite enough information to do well on the tests and are a little bit boring because they're just a summary. I really liked the class but it was because I am very interested in the topics and my section made it for me. If you have the chance, I would shop TAs or at least make sure you're with a talkative group because you'rediscussing things that everyone has an opinion on. I would recommend it but definitely see how you feel about his lecturing because it won't get more detailed or less based on the reading as the semester goes on.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend shopping this course. It is either two midterms or one midterm and an in-class debate and then a final. It gets a little rambly, but the exams are entirely reading-based, and section (at least the one that I happened to be in) isn't awful at all. It got a little religiously-focused at the end, so I would consider this when shopping it. The issues are really interesting to think about and discuss though, but I do wish there had been more perspectives given equal weight as opposed to just a few.",
    "YES YES YES. It's very informative, presents both sides of issues in innovative ways, and it's one of the few classes where I genuinely enjoyed the material. One of the books (by Ira Byock) actually made me cry at one point, some of the material is very personal.",
    "extremely interesting course. everyone should take it, especially pre-meds. not a lot of work, great lecturer, really interesting readings (for the most part). tests are reasonable.",
    "This course deals with a lot of intriguing topics that medical professionals and even the general population has to be aware of, such as abortion along with death and suffering. Professor Smith is a very engaging lecturer and he makes the lectures worth attending. The workload isn't bad either: 2 midterms and a final, along with section.",
    "Professor Smith paces his lectures well. He speaks slowly enough to allow students to write down and actually digest the essential principles but does not speak too slowly so as to impede the progress of the course. The readings for the course are interesting and there is not an overwhelming amount of work. The 2 midterms and 1 final are fair and it is a nice break in the regular course pace to hear classmates debate issues in class. The topics of the course are intrinsically interesting and mostly relevant to current event issues.",
    "PLSC 281 was challenging in terms of the various philosophical views espoused by different authors we read. It was sometimes difficult to organize authors' arguments. However, I did find this course very relevant to modern-day issues and felt like a gained a lot from this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Sometimes the lectures can be a bit dry, but there isn't much reading and the tests are pretty straight forward. The class overall is pretty manageable.",
    "I enjoyed pretty much every reading we were assigned. Take it if you want an overview of really key issues in bioethics, but don't care too much about the way it's presented. Don't expect to get the information from the readings through lectures. Get into a debate. It's the most you'll learn all semester, and a great way to access the material. The readings for the most part are really great, but their effect is lost in lecture. Smith is very dry and slow and I never left class thinking, \"Wow, that was a really great lecture.\" Make sure your section has a lot of people that really want to discuss the material.",
    "yes, if you are interested in bioethics",
    "Issues in Bioethics is a broad treatment of the some of the important topics in bioethics, such as research ethics, consent of children, abortion and physician assisted suicide. Professor Smith is terrific and knows how to teach the material at a level that you can understood if you're not a huge philosophy buff. The reading load is reasonable and discussion sections can be very good and interesting if you put in the effort. Also awesome is the ability to participate in a debate instead of taking a midterm. Definitely take this class.",
    "Take this if you are a polisci or if you want a fun class.",
    "Yeah I guess.",
    "Issues of Bioethics is an interesting course on the morality of medical decisions. However, much of the course can be boring with conflicting theorems that create perpetual debates on pretty unsubstantiated claims. Therefore, most of the material is very frustrating to try and learn and therefore, I would not recommend this course.",
    "Take it, a good so credit",
    "Issues of Bioethics was a great class. It was pretty easy but we learned a lot as well. I would recommend this class.",
    "Definitely take this class. It is a great way to inform your own opinions of bioethical issues. I does have a slight religious bend to it, but that doesn't detract from the richness of the material and the interesting issues discussed.",
    "I had never taken an ethics course before but this course made me want to learn all about ethics. If you have ever wished you knew more about the different perspectives and arguments surrounding life's bioethical issues such as physician assisted suicide and abortion, then take this course! The reading is light and the grading is very fair if you take the time to do the reading and grasp the material covered in lecture.",
    "Yes it was an interesting course that covered some great controversial topics.",
    "good class but really only doing the reading is necessary",
    "Yes, very interesting and not too much work",
    "This is a great course. If you have ever thought about abortion, prenatal testing, genetic enhancement, care for the dying, or a number of other biomedical issues, this class will give you interesting, in-depth perspectives on and ways of thinking about these issue.The readings are interesting, Professor Smith is a great lecturer and a sincerely wonderful person, and the class is not incredibly difficult. Take it.",
    "I only took this class for the easy SO credit. It's laughably easy, with two midterms and a final. Just do the reading (which there isn't all that much of), and pay attention in lecture. Don't bother studying for the exams since the essay questions are so open-ended, and the multiple choice questions so obvious. Having said that, it's probably hard to get an A in this class due to the large size of the class, and the fact that a lot of pre-meds take the class because they have somehow deluded themselves into believing that taking a \"bioethics\" class makes them appear more sympathetic and desirable to the medical school admissions people. Who knows.",
    "One of the most relevant class to our understanding of controversial topics in ethics from the past, present and the future. It helps you conceptualize what the controversy is and how to perceive each points. The class is open to any criticism and discussion of bioethics, even if it is really out there. In fact, TAs and Professor Smith encourages radical perspective and opinion on bioethics as long as they could be supported. I would recommend taking this class as an upperclassman because the topics are interesting to talk about as a mature student with some already developed opinions about things such as abortion, physician assisted suicide, environmental concerns, euthanasia, etc. If you plan to take this course, I recommend getting to know Professor Smith outside of class - go to his lunch meetings or office hours - as there are a lot to learn from him beyond his lectures and his books.",
    "It is an Ok class, but you don't really get the opportunity to voice your opinion, and most topics are covered only superficially.",
    "take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The information was interesting and applicable to everyday discussion and social hot topics.",
    "I would not recommend this unless you really just want an easy class. There are so many other ways to learn about these issues if you are interested in bioethics. The readings are really out of date even though the issues are so relevant (we read something from the 90s about stem cell research) and lectures don't really go beyond summarizing the reading. The midterms are a joke and the in class debates are honestly an excuse to only have an actual class once a week. The final exam absurdly counts for 50 percent of the grade, with a single essay counting for 40 percent of your overall grade,",
    "Eh. It's a good course, light workload, not too difficult on grading, and pretty interesting. Professor Smith is a solid lecturer--though somewhat boring at times--and his format is kind of cool (debates, midterms and a final, essentially).",
    "I loved this class. You look at bioethical issues - assisted reproduction, cloning, end of life care, research, abortion, enhancement - through a philosophical and religious lens. David Smith is an excellent lecturer, and the exams aren't too difficult. I would recommend signing up for an in class debate if you can. Not only do you get public speaking experience, but you get rewarded for the work you put into it, and it's a nice change of pace from constant exam-taking. The things you learn in this class you will likely draw on for the rest of your life, and it's the kind of course that can be a fifth class, though it's worth putting the effort into.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I loved lecture and the work load was very manageable. I took it as a fifth class and really enjoyed it.",
    "Sure, why not? Interesting issues in an easy to understand format. If you like bioethics take it, but be wary that you might be bored.",
    "Not too difficult, but definitely requires reading. Luckily, the reading load is not too heavy.",
    "i would recommend the course to anyone that is interested in ethical discussion. It is directly relevant to real life situations and the material covered is very interesting to consider.",
    "Bioethics is a great introduction to issues that you already know exist but an opportunity to investigate them further. There are 3 exams, including the final and required section. There isn't much reading, but the reading is definitely interesting for the most part. The debates are a nice option instead of the exam and were a nice change up to the lectures. A great course to take a s \"fifth class\" even as a senior.",
    "Bioethics was a very interesting course. We covered a variety of topics that are important to think about, like abortion, genetic enhancement and dying, and it was great to be forced to think about these important issues and learn some viewpoints on them and, more importantly, think more in depth about what I actually feel about them. Professor Smith was great- not the best lecturer I've had, but interesting and clear, genuinely cared about his students, and he was just so cute. The workload wasn't too bad, and participating in a debate was an experience you probably won't get in any other class at Yale. I would recommend this class to another student, but it's not necessarily a must-take- if the material interests you, go for it and you'll enjoy it",
    "Good class, not too much work at all. Interesting readings, interesting topics.David Smith is great. His lectures are mostly just recaps of the readings, but he summarizes them and puts together the important points well. He clearly likes teaching, and cares about his students--his lunch discussion programs are good (so I've heard, since my schedule prevented me from ever going) and he, amazingly, remembers people's names after calling on them in lecture once.",
    "There's good and bad - I'd recommend it if you want to take a decently interesting class that doesn't require a ton of work, but there may be better options for those looking for a class with more practical applications. The readings can occasionally be pretty interesting but are also occasionally quite odd, and overall you learn more of a vocabulary than anything concrete.",
    "Take this class if you enjoy some of the different philosophies behind what is and is not morally appropriate in medicine, research, etc.",
    "This class was interesting and easy. The tests are straightforward and do not require much studying. A lot of the readings are covered in lecture. Take this class as a 5 th class, it was perfect for that without being boring.",
    "Awesome class. Definitely take it. Smith is very interesting, the readings aren't too long and they are very interesting.",
    "A very interesting class going into issues in bioethics that have always been debated about. Not too much work, interesting readings, very manageable with only 3 tests. Fair class, take it if the topic interests you!",
    "Good.",
    "Fairly interesting class on Bioethics. The readings can be pretty dry, but Smith is a great lecturer (although, lectures were kind of a rehash of the readings mixed in with Smith's opinions). There's not much room for giving your own opinions - mostly you analyze the opinions given in the readings.",
    "I would recommend it as a fairly laidback 5th credit. Sometimes hitting everything for the essays on the exams is tricky, but that's just a matter of test taking skills. Other than that, the readings are interesting and the debates during discussions can definitely be interesting. It's up to you how much you get out of the class.",
    "If you need a relatively easy class, and don't mind the fact that it probably will not be all that stimulating or mind-blowing, take it. It was pretty interesting at times, and really not very much work. I always studied for the midterms and final the night before, and did the reading. Don't take this class credit\/d, simply because it is so easy.",
    "Issues in Bioethics was a mind-opening course in many ways - don't worry too much, it's not based just on theory. In fact, what made the course great was that many of the situations are what physicians deal with directly, such as caring for patients in cross-cultural settings and telling the truth to the dying. This was appealing to me as a pre-med student. Also Dr. Byock's book is something everyone should read - very interesting, and it made the end of the course the most interesting in terms of subject matter. The one thing is that you have to be good at synthesizing materialon the essays for the exam - do the reading very well but also be able to integrate the author's ideas well. (they didn't tell us the structure of the essays until after the first exam, which was a bit unhelpful). Otherwise, it is a nice survey of bioethical issues, and definitely useful knowledge for anyone to have.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are looking for a credit that you don't really have to work for. Maybe skip it if you are looking for a very intensive ad challenging bioethics course.",
    "Be forewarned that there will be a lot of Christian rhetoric towards the end of the course. This made me uncomfortable, but was not on the exam and may not be a problem for other people.",
    "This course is a lot of fun and really rewarding! Take it! I am a science student and thought anything to do with ethics would be really wishy-washy and hard to do well in, but Professor Smith organizes the class so that we can really understand the material conceptually and do well! Also the sections are helpful in that they teach you how to talk about your ideas in a constructive and informative manner.",
    "As a philosophy major and hardcore atheist, I was probably not the target student of Issues in Bioethics. When I signed up for it, I assumed it would basically be a philosophy class and managed to overlook the fact that its being in the Religious Studies department meant it would have a religious component. Don't do that. This is not a philosophy class - we are not being asked to create, or even evaluate arguments or premises; instead we are asked to summarize and sometimes apply the arguments of others, no matter how obviously flawed we might find them to be. It is also a class in which being an atheist can lead to frustration - almost every bioethical issue (abortion, death, cloning...) has a religious component and, rather than viewing religious premises as non-universal and thus unhelpful (as is often done in an academic setting), we focused on these issues; we read two whole books that emphasized turning to prayer at the time of death, something that I found quite inappropriate for a university class. If you want a class that gives an overview of bioethical thought and asks you to memorize, take this class. If you want to think about issues and not cop-out by relying on unprovable religious ideas or on the unfounded opinions of others, do not be fooled by the fact that this class has an enticing debate component; you will most likely find it more frustrating than rewarding. It also isn't an ideal fifth class - there is a lot of reading, and, though there are only three exams, they are graded very harshly and unpredictably (there are a lot of multiple choice questions and for many of them multiple answered could easily be defended, but only one is accepted as correct, no matter how many students provide proof of the accuracy of another option).",
    "Interesting course with not much work. take it",
    "I guess I wouldn't. I was told this class was one that you could put a lot into and get a lot out of it, but I don't think that's really true. It's just kind of unstructured and not great. Not a lot of work, though, if you're looking for a decently interesting, easy class.",
    "The class was fairly boring and not at all what it seemed like it would be going in. Rather than questioning the ethical framework that is to be used in determining decisions about medical issues, the class was much more focused on memorizing and regurgitating information about what individual writers thought. There was almost no thought of your own to be put in, which was annoying for me. That said, I attended less than a quarter of the class sessions and still did great in the course. It's very easy to skim all of the readings within 48 hours of the exams and get a high grade. Take it if you need a credit, but don't expect any value from it.",
    "If you like to debate, take the class.",
    "Great lectures. Easy exams. Definitely take this class. Smith is a boss",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. If you're interested in bioethics, you should take this class.",
    "It is class that evaluates the morality of different bioethical issues. I would recommend it to someone wanting to learn about how different people think philosophically about tough bioethical issues. The workload is manageable.",
    "It's a good, interesting class. Reading load is manageable, and section is actually interesting. Take it!",
    "For starters it is NOT a political science class; DEFINITELY an ethics course. Morally is explored in ways I never knew it existed before, but the host of topics ranging from genetic enhancements and abortion to truth to the dying and physician assisted suicide, this course offers the student many new ways of framing popular issues.",
    "Great class. Not a very heavy workload. Take it!",
    "Yes. Not a lot of work and interesting subject matter.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's interesting, you don't have to go to class, and it's easy.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone. Easy course, interesting, and not too much work.",
    "Not as easy as it used to be. Be warned.",
    "This is an excellent course. If you are interested in medicine, science or law you should take this class.",
    "Yes, it is an interesting class which gives unique perspectives on bioethical topics.",
    "I would definitely reccomend taking this class. It is not a lot of work, but it puts you to think. Prof Smith is quirky in a good way and his lectures are well structured. A very enjoyable class in all.",
    "This class is pretty interesting, although a little bit frustrating in the way that you are lectured on many different experts' opinions on abortion (for example), but never asked about your own. I feel like ethics is a topic that needs to be discussed, because it is very real in people's daily lives, but this class left no room for discussion. However, it is a pretty easy class, and the readings were incredibly interesting.",
    "It's a pretty decent summary course of issues in bioethics. The class goes through different authors and their viewpoints, and there's not as much room for \"what do you think about the issue,\" but it's still rather interesting. There might be a bit more of a focus on religion than some people might like, but it's certainly not all about religion. Two midterms and a final with the option of participating in a debate to replace one of the midterms, and they aren't too bad. Lectures sometimes feel like just a rehash of readings, but they're okay.",
    "PLSC 281 is a great class and is pretty straightforward as long as you go to all the lectures and participate in section. The lectures are great, but some of the reading can be a bit dry; however, one of the books in particular is absolutely accessible and very touching, and many of the journal articles are very interesting reading for anyone who's even remotely interested in bioethics. The class provides a sufficiently thorough and meaningful introductory survey of some of the major issues in bioethics today and also introduces you to several systems of moral reasoning through each of those issues. There are two short midterms (25% each) and a straightforward final (50%), and you can choose to substitute one of the midterms with an in-class debate."
