   "comments": [
    "Yes-take this course if you really want a great, in-depth class about learning and memory. Keep in mind though that there is definitely a lot to memorize, but Professor Brown is the sweetest professor ever!",
    "This course is a fairly deep dive on learning about memory circuits in the brain, and the various manifestations of memory we enjoy though we may not be conscious of them.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it unless you're in love with neuroscience. It's such an interesting subject, but this class really ruins it with its lack of discussing applications and its hyper-focus on unimportant details. A darned shame.",
    "Very challenging, but rewarding. Be prepared for the first half of term to be very neuroscience-heavy.",
    "Take it if you are interested in the subject matter. You will come out with a good understanding of how the mind works.",
    "Yes! It was really interesting to learn how you learn and memorize, and I found it so applicable to my every day life. We learn about different diseases and our brain's development and different ways we learn and memorize and what is more effective etc. It is definitely a cool class and not very much work!",
    "Recommended for psych and cogsci majors! Even better if you are able to take neurobiology concurrently. The material in the two courses really complement each other.",
    "Take it if you're really interested in upper-level psych! Not too much work for super interesting material, especially in the last third of the class. Tests aren't too bad if you really, really study the power points.",
    "This class was one of my favorites. You learn a lot of interesting material about the brain and learning. It's mostly a lecture, but there are small discussions maybe every 5 classes. And you can always ask questions, which is nice. Professor Brown is very sweet and smart; he also brings in cookies that is wife makes! Take if you're interested in the material and are good at memorization.",
    "This is a textbook class: Professor Brown teaches the entire semester from slides transcribed from the textbook. There is some peripheral discussion of free will, clinical studies, connectionism as well as some lab work, but they're not very well integrated into the class. There are three rather difficult tests and assignments\/lab reports assigned somewhat sporadically.Take the class if you're interested in the material, but try not to take it with Thomas Brown.",
    "If you're interested in the material and don't mind working hard, then this may be a good course for you, but otherwise, no. Personally, I didn't read the chapters of the textbook beforehand, because the lectures are pretty much straight from the book. It's hard to pay attention in lecture because they're really dry and boring. Come exam time it's like a high school biology class (but less fun) where you just have to put in the time and memorize tons of facts. That means to do well you just have to be really good at memorizing tons of things quickly (looking at all you pre-med people!). Doesn't really require any critical thinking and analysis.It's really not a course for everyone. After taking Learning and Memory, I learned nothing and remember nothing.",
    "I would recommend this class, particularly if you are interested in doing neuroscience research.",
    "Fun, interesting course, but pretty hard if you don't prepare well."
