   "comments": [
    "Huge overview of many books -- a ton of reading, but well worth it",
    "An accelerated overview of the ancient books of literature with continual essay writing. I would recommend this course only if the student is a good note taker and self directed learner.",
    "Lit is the DS class that will probably seem most similar to one of your high school classes. Don't let that fool you. Though you may have read a lot of the material before, college classes demand a lot more focus and detail - especially in your writing skill. Markovits does a good job bringing you up to that level.",
    "Directed Studies has proven to be one of the best choices I have made at Yale. I would heartily encourage a student to take it, provided that the reading list and speed was not too intimidating a task. Provided that the student can read and absorb the material at a fast rate, the student will enjoy contributing to discussions and succeeding on the final!",
    "I would say that this course is one of the most intense English courses I have ever taken, but it is worth the efforts of taking because it will help you achieve a survey understanding of ancient Western traditions.",
    "DS Literature sets the stage for discussion in all three DS sections - it isn't possible to understand ancient philosophy, political thought or literature without a solid understanding of works such as The Iliad and The Odyssey. The books and poems are all interesting and of all three sections they certainly make for the easiest reading.",
    "I would recommend DS Lit to someone who's looking for a good survey class. If you want to do a lot of close reading and stuff, take some other lit class.",
    "Challenging yet highly rewarding introduction into classical literature. Cover epic, tragedy, drama, sacred scripture, and comedic text.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS Lit to anyone who has an interest in the classic works of Western literature. It's a pretty good survey of the first and most important texts to influence the rest of the world, and the opportunity to discuss them with your fellow Yalies is an invaluable opportunity. This is clearly one of the defining classes that Yale has to offer, and I can't imagine that any lover of reading would dislike the class.",
    "The course is ideal for someone who is interested in humanities, but not a specific discipline of the humanities.The course gives one a sense of the history of western literature, and may inspire you to explore a specific branch of literature more in depth.",
    "Absolutely! Directed Studies is an amazing program in general; you read such amazing books and get to know wonderful people. The literature class can be a lot of reading in terms of pages, but compared to philosophyand history the reading is often easier and I've enjoyed every book we read this semester.",
    "I would recommend DS to another student if they really have an interest in the subject and willing to dedicate the time to the work.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, but only if you really like the subject. It is a lot of work, but the readings and discussions are very interesting.",
    "A brief crash course in Ancient European Literature Homer through Dante. I would absolutely recommend it to any major, because it gives a deeper appreciation of epic and an actual understanding of famous literary characters. (Odysseus, Achilles, etc.)"
