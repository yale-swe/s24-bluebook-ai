    "The problem sets are not relevant to the material that has been covered or the exams. Take orgo if you are premed or for your major.",
    "Ziegler is an awful professor and the TAs this semester weren't much better, but, chances are you're taking this course as a requirement, so nothing I say here will influence your decision.",
    "Orgo is a necessity for a lot of science majors and if you're pre-med. You should come in knowing that you should utilize other resources to learn besides just class notes, because other universities' orgo websites and videos tend to do a better job of delivering the information in a concise manner. Office hours\/peer tutoring hours help, but can take up huge amounts of time. It'll be a bit of a struggle, but you'll figure out a way that works for you.",
    "Only take if it is required for your major or you are premed. Be prepared to work harder than you have ever worked before.",
    "Yes- it teaches you how to survive and learn the inter-linked concepts.",
    "If you are taking this class, it is likely a requirement. Here is the thing: it is definitely not a requirement to take it with Ziegler. Avoid it if you can! Take it on an off semester, because Ziegler is by far the worst professor I have had at Yale.",
    "Take it with another professor. This class was frustrating and we weren't prepared for any of the problem sets and exams. The averages on the exams were horrible.",
    "It's Orgo. It's not as bad as all the horror stories. You know why you're taking it, just don't psych yourself outtoo much. Ziegler's not always terribly clear in his teaching, so it probably would be helpful to read the book. Don't even bother doing the problem sets alone, go to the peer tutor's sessions!",
    "I would not recommend it. He is a horrible professor. It would be easier to take anywhere else\/with anyone else. Do not take it. End of story. (I am not exaggerating =I saw last years reviews and thought he couldn't possibly be that bad, but he is.)",
    "If you like chemistry, it's a wonderful course and very fascinating, but if you don't, it'll be a lot of work and you won't enjoy it.",
    "I wouldn't recommend taking orgo if it's not required. However, it's not as hard as people make it seem as long as you keep up with the material.",
    "Honestly, if you're going to take this class, you probably have to take this class for your major. Don't take it otherwise. It's really pretty horrible.",
    "Holy shit. DISCLAIMER: I am one of those pesky non-science majors just taking orgo for med schools. Ispent the first two week of this class trying to figure out why orgo matters. And, to tell you the truth, the professor does not help one bit. The minute I opened the textbook (and Orgo as a Second Language) I \"fell in love.\" Not really, but I realized that it wasn't as dull and stupid as I thought it was going to be. Granted, I've never studied as much as I did for the exams, but orgo is manageable. Reading the book and OSL (Orgo as a Second Language) is the key to doing well in this class. Lecture not only is not necessary, it detracts. If Ziegler ever is replaced, I don't think this class would suffer. With that said, however, somehow Ziegler managed to get me, a completely disinterested student, to learn some organic chemistry.",
    "Chemistry 220 is a very slow-moving class that focuses a lot of time on general chemistry concepts than going in-depth into actual organic reactions. Over all, the class is an easy A, and the P-Sets aren't even worth much. Definitely take to fulfill pre-med requirements and get that easy A, but consider taking advanced orgo instead if you truly want to learn orgo reactions.",
    "Hard. Annoying. Not reccommended",
    "Orgo Chemistry is difficult because it is all new material. Make sure you devote time to the class and after understanding concepts, you must do practice problems. Not unmanageable if approached the right way.",
    "Do not take it unless you really have to",
    "If you put enough effort into doing well, the class is not bad at all. The psets can be unclear at times, much like Ziegler himself, but he is helpful if you go to office hours and is a nice person. Peer tutoring sessions help a LOT. I wouldn't recommend taking the class unless it's required or unless you love\/are really good at chemistry. Be prepared to put a lot of time into it.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone that wants to pursue further chemistry or biology. Interest in science is probably necessary to enjoy the class.",
    "CHEM 220 is Organic Chemistry. It is famed as the hardest class in the sciences for a good reason. HOWEVER, it doesn't have to be that way! I was frustrated all the way through this course. I put in endless hours each day to CHEM 220 and still felt that it was impossible. Students don't take this class unless they absolutely have to. Yale needs to change that. This class is poorly taught. With a new professor, the material CAN be interesting. CHEM 220 was absurdly challenging because it is unfairly graded, very competitive, and overall a difficult subject.Professor Ziegler is not an effective instructor. He is a poor lecturer who does not convey the main themes of CHEM 220 to his students. Instead, he is confusing and truly has no interest in teaching undergraduates at this point in his career. He is a nice man and approachable in Office Hours, but it is imperative that a new professor is hired for this class.",
    "A very interesting subject, I would definitely recommend taking the course BUT NOT WITH PROFESSOR ZIELGER. He ruins a perfectly beautiful subject with unnecessary convolution.",
    "it's really, really hard. but if you do the work, read the lectures beforehand and get help on the problem sets, you'll be fine. but you have to keep up with it, or there is no chance. exhaust all your resources; the peer tutors, for example, are great and can really help you. i also recommend you get a group going to collaborate on the p-sets together, it just facilitates the process. also you need to read, or at least skim, before each lecture, otherwise FEZ will just lose you.",
    "I mean, you have to take it if you're pre-med. If you don't need to take it, PLEASE don't unless you really want to. Also, take it with another professor. FEZ basically revolves his lectures, exams and discussions around the 2% of students who truly understand and appreciate organic chemistry. If you are learning the material for the first time, you will be lost in his lectures and will have an even tougher time doing the problem sets and exams. If it wasn't for study buddies, peer tutors, and TAs, I definitely would be getting a D in the class. Work hard from Day 1, don't slack on the readings, and make sure you REALLY understand all of the concepts.",
    "Everyone else will complain about Ziegler so I'll just say this: use the peer tutors. They are the best part of the class. And you will be ok - to study for tests, do old tests and read chapters and review problem sets - pretty straightforward but not an insignificant amount of work. Seriously, you will be fine.",
    "You're not going to take this class unless you have to, clearly. Professor Ziegler's lectures are awful, so make sure you read the textbook chapter every week (preferably before you do the problem set), or else you'll be totally behind and won't understand anything. The peer tutors are helpful, and so are the TFs, so go to them.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it, but you need it to get where you're going",
    "Such a great class! Though it usually gets a bad rap, I did not see any of that while taking orgo. The material is fascinating, and you learn really interesting reactions. The only problem is that the exams are mostly based on memory, which, depending on the student, is a good or a bad thing.",
    "Obviously, you're taking orgo because you have to. That being said, I would take this during a different semester if you can... knock out a physics or a bio this semester, and wait for a different teacher. If you decide your schedule is way too set in stone to follow this advice, just use the hell out of the peer tutors and hope for the best.",
    "It is very difficult and irrelevant to real life, but everyone in it is there for a reason. It gets better as you get farther into the material because things become more like puzzles and less fact-driven. I would not recommend this class as, but, as I said, everyone who is there is taking it for something else.",
    "I would not recommend it. At all.",
    "Most people take Orgo because it's required for pre-med or their major. That being said, if there is any way you can avoid taking it with Zeigler, I would suggest you do so. His teaching style is not conducive to people taking Orgo for the first time. To keep up in lecture you must have read the chapter(s) beforehand and fully understood everything in them -- something much easier said than done. Also, the book is poorly written and unhelpful. Problem sets take loads of time and are unnecessarily difficult. Exam questions are not modeled after those in the problem sets. On an exam you'll see things in a way that you've never seen before, so if you're not a good test taker to begin with, you're likely to freak out.",
    "Kim is very good, but the other ones are not.",
    "Only if it's required.",
    "Only take this if you need it for premed. Probably the worst class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Only if you have to take it (I'm a premed student) - if you don't have to take it or don't have a SERIOUS interest in orgo, then just don't. It will hurt me if you do. Why be so sadistic? I read all the course reviews over the summer, and everyone was like DONT TAKE IT WORST EVER BLAH BLAH. I thought they were exaggerating. I also thought like \"oh hey, if I have a good attitude and stay on top of it I bet i like it! Since I'm so math-science y...\" FALSE. Given I didn't have the best of attitudes, but I did try to stay on top of it and I definitely don't like it. It just doesn't come easy to me. And I can say that I have never hated or dreaded or disliked a class so much. It's like a constant cloud hanging over my head. The final is tomorrow, and I'm so burnt out slash given up hope that I don't even care anymore. I'm just gonna pull through it and take whatever grade I get and never look back at Orgo I again. The class has definitely made me say multiple times \"if only I didn't have orgo I would be so happy\" - at least there's that bright side. Cannot believe there is one more semester of this hell...it has to be better than this one.",
    "It's actually a lot of fun if you go into it without thinking it's going to be a terrible class. Ziegler's interesting and a lot of fun, but can be a bit scattered and hard to follow, so make sure you get a good TA. If Andrew Zhang is TA'ing, get in his section. He is the best TA ever. Also, be prepared for difficult problem sets, so get a good study group for Sunday nights. Exams are much easier than the problem sets, and the grading is pretty generous.",
    "IT'S ALL ABOUT YOUR ATTITUDE. If you're looking for things to hate about this class, you'll certainly find them. But stay on top of things, form a study group, ask questions, and it's not that bad. Ziegler can be condescending but isn't unfriendly. Lecture isn't great. The textbook was actually pretty useful; don't put off reading it. Do old exam questions. It really helped me to keep track of all the reactions as we went along, so I could go back to review them and have everything in one place. Also, Klein's Organic Chemistry as a Second Language was REALLY useful and definitely got me started on the right track for this class. Don't know if I would have done as well without it. The material is much more interesting than Gen Chem.",
    "Be prepared to do a lot of work and studying but it can be rewarding if you get it in the end.",
    "If it is not a requirement for your major, and you are not that interested in organic chemistry, don't take the course.",
    "Study hard if you want to master this stuff.",
    "D:",
    "For those who want a challenge, take this class.For those who want to get by, look at other options. Some sophomores even dropped the class in order to take the first semester of Organic Chemistry in the spring with a different professor.For those of us who took the class with Ziegler and made it through - the sense of survival and accomplishment is awesome.",
    "This course is very interesting but is unfortunately not well-taught (and is very difficult).",
    "Honestly, course evals won't determine if you take this course or not, I'm gonna guess you're taking it. That said, this class is hard, but not impossible. Zeigler is irrelevant (you won't actually learn in class). Make sure you stay on top of the material (read the book, take notes on the book, make flashcards\/charts, etc.) and it won't be too overwhelming. But... it's still hard.",
    "Take if necessary or interested and have A LOT of time to devote to it",
    "orgo is NOT that bad. the workload isnt horrible and the material is not that hard. just dont stress and youll do fine.",
    "It's orgo - it's going to be hard. But I would take this over freshman orgo because, from what I've heard, this class was taught better and wasn't as fast paced. Ziegler did a good job teaching the material, and even though it may seem like you haven't learned anything when you try problem sets and find them impossible to do on your own (1 pset each week), the tests are much easier and manageable. You'll realize by the Ed of the semester that you've learned a lot. 3 midterms, lowest score is dropped - its a fair deal if you put in some work. Take this class.",
    "I honestly would recommend this course! I know it seems scary, but it's actually really interesting, and the tests are very fair. I'm not premed or chemistry major, and I found this course to be challenging, but very rewarding. I feel like I've learned so much!",
    "it is a challenging course and it feels awesome once you work hard to understand it. get your questions answered and keep up with the material and it is worth it.",
    "There is truly no shortcut to being successful in Orgo. It does take a significant amount of time, effort, and head-banging, but it all pays off. It's rather--dare I admit--FUN (or at least interesting) by the very end because everything comes together. The difficult thing is understand how elements and atoms react and using your bag of reactions and mechanisms to change one molecule into the other--this is the fun \"puzzle\" aspect of it too, however.",
    "If you're going to take it, you're going to take it. But here's a preview of what you're up against: Unless you are really on top of your stuff, lectures are somewhat incomprehensible. The first two midterms are relatively straightforward if you do the problems from the old exams, but the third midterm and final will suddenly be very challenging (be prepared to learn a lot of reactions in a very short amount of time). Problem sets are impossible to figure out on your own (go to tutors\/office hours!!) and do not give you a chance to practice basic concepts before delving into some very complicated problems. Ziegler cares about organic chemistry and cares about teaching, but he assumes students can internalize new material more quickly than is perhaps realistic.",
    "Well if you're taking it, it's because you have to. Go to the peer tutors. They got me through this course.",
    "Chemistry 220 - Don't take it unless you know you really enjoy orgo already or you have to.",
    "If you are taking this course, it is most likely because you are either premed or you need it for your major. Don't take this course otherwise! Or take it in the spring.",
    "I went to every single lecture. It did not help at all. Read the book, more importantly do LOTS of practice problems, and use your peer tutors and TAs. Peer tutors were invaluable. Obviously haven't personally taken the spring semester course, but hearing of it, I would STRONGLY consider taking that instead. Organic Chemistry is incredibly interesting and seems like it could be fun to learn with a teacher that is more systematic in his teaching. Regardless of what professor you take this with, know that it'll take a lot of work on your part to truly grasp the material.",
    "Only take it if you have to. Organic chemistry is interesting but a difficult subject. Ziegler just exacerbates this. Try to taking it with someone else if you can",
    "I know orgo gets a bad rep... But trust me, if you keep up with it, it is super fun. I ended up loving the subject and I see many things in life as orgo reactions. I think you should do your best to understand material weekly. The more you internalize the main ideas (electron action, acids and bases, energy..) the more natural the rest will seem to you. I would actually venture to say that the first three weeks in a sense are really the most important. The exams are fair as long as you've made the effort to understand and practice with old exams, go to tutoring, and go to reviews. Orgo was my favorite class this semester, even though I fully expected it to be my least favorite. Honestly, you can love orgo too if you go in it with a positive and healthy attitude. Good luck!",
    "The class is the expected. The material isn't so much qualitatively difficult as it is quantitatively difficult; it's really just a lot of memorization. The way it is presented is very confusing, and while reviewing my notes for the final exam I was amazedat the order we learned things and how it differed from the chapters and material we were expected to know for each midterm. I felt that class was not very helpful, and my class notes were barely used at all in preparation for the final; instead, I went through the book's chapters, and reviewed Professor Ziegler's website, especially the reaction modules, which I felt were very helpful in preparing.",
    "only take this class unless you have to. terrible experience. will take up all of your free time",
    "Don't go to lecture without reading and really understanding the material before-hand",
    "It's a total gut.",
    "The lectures were disorganized and did not complement the textbook. The problem sets often included obscure problems not covered in class or in the textbook, and they generally did not help me understand the material in a systematic way or prepare me for the test. I always went to class but my class notes were rarely helpful when studying for tests. Overall Organic Chemistry was a frustrating experience because I thought I could have learned much more if the material had been presented in a systematic, straightforward way.The best way to do well is to use the peer tutors regularly, read the textbook before class, and keep a running list of all the reactions. Also, do the practice exams before each test because the tests do not reflect the way the material is presented in the textbook or the problem sets.",
    "If you are taking this course you are likely premed, a chem major, or a chem engineering major. I doubt that Ziegler will be teaching this course for long, but he is particularly disorganized which can be very off putting in the early semester. When you go to office hours, it is best to go with a very particular question in mind, and if you do Ziegler is the best of help and can provide you with tips that can help you on the test. Andrew was a fabulous TA and helped out alot. I would advise that you do NOT start working on your pset on Sunday night, but if you do trust me, you will not be alone. My test scores for this course greatly rose as the semester went on and by the time I was studying the final it was all a review. Exam averages for our class were only as high as 70 but as low as 59 with standard deviations of 23. You can drop your lowest of 3 exam scores and while I don't know how the curve will go, I know that I will be receiving a good grade in this course. I am by no means a chem genius, so for those of you willing to work your butt off and do well in this course, GET A TUTOR ASAP from the math and science dept and do so EARLY. you won't regret it.We had it particularly rough this year bc there was a change in textbook and old exams and psets were not reflecting of how the course was designed in previous years. The textbook was frustrating to us and to Ziegler and likely the reason for lower test scores this year.And DEF buy Orgo as a 2nd Language. It's a lifesaver! And go to the peer tutors! GOOD LUCK (:",
    "I would say probably 90% of people taking this class are either pre-med or are taking it to fulfill a pre-req for another major. Moral of the story is that basically no one wants to be there. If you want to do well in this class, you MUST stay on top of the material. The entire class is cumulative (that's the nature of Organic Chemistry), and so if you miss the basics, you'll be lost for the duration of the semester (take it from me).",
    "Organic chemistry is not as scary as it is made out to be. It was not easy, but I enjoyed it. I did not take general chemistry first (my only prior experience with chemistry was honors chemistry in tenth grade and a few weeks of reading a textbook last summer). After working hard to catch up for the first few weeks, I did not have any problems. I recommend reading the textbook chapter before coming to class; this will make life so much easier for you.If at all possible, DO NOT TAKE IT WITH ZIEGLER. Four months ago, I scoffed at the anti-Ziegler reviews, assuming that he was simply too fast and difficult for most students. That is not the reason people don't like him; people don't like him because he is a truly bad teacher. The most serious flaw in his teaching is that he assumes his students already understand all the material, so he doesn't bother teaching the basic ideas behind each new concept. For example, he once spent five minutes discussing what compounds make poor Grignard reagents before realizing that he had never defined a Grignard reagent or given an example of a good one. He often makes mistakes on the board, and he is unreceptive to questions in class.",
    "Well, chances are, you're pre-med. So really, it's a matter of surviving the material - whichisn't hard! Orgo is not hard. It just takes some time to get used to - so if anything, get ready to spend quite a bit of time memorizing. But once everything ties together, it's very, very rewarding!",
    "Obviously don't take it unless you're Pre-med or a Chemistry major.",
    "If you're going to be premed or a chem major you obviously have to take this course so you get over how horrible it is. If possible, it might be better to wait until second term to take first semester orgo because it's apparently a lot better.",
    "DON'T TAKE IT UNLESS YOU MUST. That being said, it's doable, so don't freak out either.",
    "Good class, needed for premed reqs, always reach out and ask for help and don't be intimidated by it",
    "I came into this course with an open mind, trying not to think about what I had heard from former students. But the harsh truth is that THEY WERE RIGHT. Ziegler's Organic Chemistry class has been the worst class I've ever taken at Yale. It requires a ridiculous amount of work for both the PSETs and thestudying, and in the end, all the things I learned I ended up teaching myself. If you can take it with someone else, don't take it with Ziegler. The lectures are horribly taught (he assumes you know much more than what's taught in the book and they're boring and repetitive) and office hours are not helpful either.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. The subject of Organic Chemistry is very interesting, however, Professor Ziegler does not teach it well.",
    "You probably have to take this class because you're either a bio major or pre-med, and you don't really have a choice. It's a tough class, and you have to be willing to put in the work\/time, even when that might not even be enough. Just don't panic and take the material slowly at your own pace. You should be OK.",
    "If you're taking it you gotta take it. A hard class, but not impossible if you're willing to put in the work. Good luck.",
    "don't take it unless you have to.",
    "Not an easy class; only take it if you must. Definitely not a course you would take for fun, although you do learn a lot.",
    "You're probably already going into this with a really negative impression, but try to keep an open mind. The class itself, especially if you have Ziegler, is pretty miserable. BUT the material was surprisingly really interesting and cool - once you understand it. I'm not a very science-y person, but talking purely in terms of the actual content of the class, orgo is probably one of the coolest sciences I've done. However, Ziegler's terrible teaching (quite possibly the worst teacher I've ever had) ruins what has the potential to be an awesome class. There is absolutely no structure to his lecture, the book doesn't reallyhelp, and you'll probably be totally clueless until right before exams. That being said, you should still try to keep up with everything - read the book before class, try to go to office hours, and try to actually understand what you're doing on the pset instead of just getting help from the peer tutors. My biggest advice would be to try and organize the material and structure it for yourself, otherwise you'll be lost in lecture. People always say to try and not fall behind, but realistically you won't be able to keep that up consistently. But don't worry, a few days or a week before the exam, you'll sit down to study and magically it'll all start to make sense if you stare at it and think about it long enough. And once it starts to click, you'll be shocked to find yourself actually enjoying it. Ziegler's a nice guy, just terrible teacher, so try to go to office hours if you have questions - try not to let your questions build up! Don't freak out too much - yes, it's a difficult class. Yes it's poorly taught. But you and all your friends are in this together, and you will all get through it!!",
    "As everybody says, orgo is definitely a hard course. Nonetheless, the more you put into it, the more you will get out of it. It is essential to develop a good study method and avoid cramming everything the night before the exam. Also, do buy and do use the molecular kit model, especially at the very beginning and during the stereohemistry module, because the ability to think 3D is crucial for the class. Take advantage of the class website, which contains useful additional information and past exams, which really prepare you for the upcoming exam.",
    "Chem 220 is a decent organic chemistry course. You can make the course much easier on yourself if you do the relevant reading before class, as well as utilize the Orgo as a 2nd Language supplementary book. Doing practice problems on the Old Exam section of the course website is very helpful! You can do it! Also, make sure to seek help from peer tutors, residential college tutors, and your TAs!",
    "Make sure you read the book!",
    "I would recommend only to students who have to take the course.",
    "Most people that take the class are pre-med or extremely interested in science...that's probably the only reason you would want to take it.",
    "This course is not too bad if you stay ahead of the class. Lectures are only helpful if you read the relevant sections of the textbook before each class. Problem sets are difficult but manageable if you go to the peer tutors for help. The exams were pretty straightforward and made easier by access to past exams on Ziegler's website. If you just do a bunch of practice exams before each midterm and the final, the tests are not bad. The course was alright with Ziegler but I would recommend starting organic chemistry in the spring semester if possible.",
    "No surprise: orgo is hard and a whole lot of work. It is also far from obvious. There is a huge gap between learning the material from the textbook and from lecture and putting it to practice in exams and problem sets. Reading the book and understanding is only a small fraction of the work. If you are reading this, you most likely have to take it anyways, so I recommend you just stay on top of it and do as many problems as you can. It's the only way to do well in this class. Good luck!",
    "Orgo is as bad as its reputation says it is. I don't think it's any fault of the course, though, but simply the subject matter itself. It is so boring and I couldn't find any way to make myself interested in it. So I would not recommend it, but I know you probably have to take it for premed requirements. Stick with it and study hard but don't let it eat up your life! You can get through it!",
    "All in all, orgo is much more interesting than general chem. If you come prepared to put 100% (read the chapter in the book before class, read notes afterward, go to section\/review sessions), then you should be able to succeed. Ziegler isn't the most fantastic teacher, but get over that in the beginning and just be prepared to give it your all.",
    "A general organic chemistry lecture - nothing more, nothing less. Read the book. Ziegler is a bad lecturer and difficult to follow even when you've read the section beforehand. If you keep up with the material and read ahead, you should be fine.",
    "It's going to be a difficult and necessary course for just about anyone who is even thinking about taking it. You probably wouldn't consider it if not for the requirements for medical school and certain science majors and it wouldn't be highly recommended either way. They need to have a much more enthusiastic group of teachers to breathe some life into the subject.",
    "I wouldn't take this course unless you have to (you're premed\/a chem major) etc. If a freshman, I'd definitely take freshman orgo instead.",
    "CHEM 220 is a very challenging course. By far the mostdifficult I have taken so far and my course load has been quite heavy all semesters. Lots of time studying alone is imperative, going to office hours and attending section are also important. It is very very easy to fall behind if you don't do the readings. They are supposed to be done before class for a better understanding. Prof. Ziegler is very organized but I have heard and do think that there are others in the department who have taught the course better. Definitely not a class to take just for fun.",
    "Moved way too fast, but I fear this is the nature of all organic chemistry courses. If we covered the same material in a semester and a half, it'd be a fantastic class. Except that Ziegler can't teach a lecture. He's great in office hours and has lots of them and the book is very clear, but he sucks at explaining concepts in lecture. Definitely read the book as youcover things in class or you will hate yourself before exams and the final",
    "Organic Chemistry is very work intensive - but you will learn a lot in the end. Make sure you read the textbook and understand the concepts well before the tests",
    "It is a tough class, and you must prepare a lot to stay ahead.",
    "This course is horrible. The professor is the worst I've ever had, the problem sets are not possible without the help of the peer tutors, and the lectures are useless. If you can, consider taking the course in the spring instead when the professor is better.",
    "Intro to the basic concepts underlying organic chemistry with emphasis on the various types of reactions. It's a tough course and requires a lot of indepedent study outside of class. Not sure if I would recommend taking it with Ziegler because he's not the best at explaining concepts and his lectures are kind of hard to follow. The material can be interesting though,and it really helps to do tons of practice questions on your own.",
    "Chem 220 is a lot of work, but I would definitely recommend it if you like chemistry.",
    "This class will be the class that breaks you.",
    "Organic chemistry is hard. Your life while taking organic chemistry does not have to be. Follow these steps for success: 1) Read the book 2) Find someone (TA, or Tutor) who really knows their stuff 3) Take practice tests and 4) Relax. I would recommend taking this course, but only for the bold and ambitious. If you are pre-med, well then you have no choice.",
    "Take it only if you have to. The book, professor, and psets all suck.",
    "If this course is not a requirement for a major or for the premed track don't take it. All aspects of this course are very poorly organized and taught. Towards the end of the course the problem sets are impossible to get through even if you have done the reading. This course is not enjoyable, which is to bad because the material, if presented correctly, could be very interesting to learn.",
    "We learn a lot about reactions and mechanisms. I think it's not too bad of a course, although a lot of people complain about it. As long as you understand how the reactions work, you should be fine. Spacial thinking and visualizations are very helpful. I wouldn't really recommend this course for those who aren't in the sciences though.",
    "Obviously, no one takes this class for fun. I think the course was especially bad this year because we were using a new textbook (which Ziegler didn't seem too fond of). I didn't skip lecture because I was afraid that I might miss something important, and I hope it did me some good. The book was often rambling and dense (personally, I thought it didn't have enough figures and pictures to explain concepts fully), and should not be used as a replacement for going to class. Even though Professor Ziegler's lectures might seem all over the place, re-reading notes after becoming more comfortable with the material can help solidify information. Ziegler is a really smart guy, but I think he has difficulty teaching organic chemistry novices. Go to the peer tutors, because they understand the challenge of learning this stuff fresh.",
    "You'll feel very accomplished at the end of it. But not something to take with a lot of demanding classes. Usually just becomes your main focus.",
    "Good material, crappy instruction. You have to take it, but just try to get as much outside help as possible.",
    "Orgo is what you would expect. The grading isn't as horrendous as at some other colleges because we get to drop our lowest test. However, once the class average on a test was a 59. If you're reading this you're going to take orgo anyway. You need it for pre-med, chem major, and MB&B. You just have to tough it out. Things I would suggest are a) taking orgo I in the spring rather than with the masses in the fall b) making a study group to do problem sets with c) getting a free Science\/QR tutor for orgo d) attempting to read the chapter before lecture, or at least during lecture week. Good luck in orgo.",
    "It's orgo. It's tough. Study throughout the semester and go to all the classes. The stuff makes sense, but integrating it all is pretty challenging.",
    "Totally doable if you have time to put in the work (though it is really hard in the beginning because it is basically a foreign language until you get the hang of it). That said, Ziegler sucks! He will literally make your life a living hell. I really think I could have enjoyed orgo much sooner (cause I kinda like it now?) had he not been teaching. Until he leaves, if you can wait to take it in the spring, TAKE IT THEN.",
    "I am divided.Why you should take it, despite the rumors:The material can actually be interesting if you devote enough time to it. In all honesty, I highly suggest reading the book AND doing the example problems throughout the chapter (buy a solution manual\/ share with the 200 others in this class) OVER attending class.If you ever have to choose between class or reading, read. Its great if you can do both, but for many, you are better off getting the notes from some less busy diligent friend and using that time to read in KBT or in bed.Class is very disorganized. Perhaps this is due to the recent book change, but regardless, organic chemistry isn't actually as complicated as people say it is. There are a select few rules that govern how everything works. Once you understand those rules and practice, everything else just falls into place. Yes, there is memorization, but still you will start to see the patterns, and the mechanisms will start to become second nature after a lot of practice.Order of importance: Read, Do practice problems, do homework on own\/ with Peer Tutors, TA sessions, sleep, then attend class. *Note, class is actually useful before midterm 1 because it has some stuff not in books, etc...Why you should not take this course:If you don't actually need this course for anything and don't think you can genuinely be interested in the material. Really you need some motivation. If your future plans can provide that for you, then it will push you through. If you can look at the molecules and be fascinated by how amazing this science actually is, then that will work too. BUT if you expect this class (if it is taught the same way) to somehow excite you through the class alone, I think you will be disappointed. I saw way too many people who had a lot of faith in Yale's teaching and\/or hopes of premed emotionally destroyed by this class. So be careful.If you give this class the proper amount of time and effort, you will be amazed at how much you can learn and how amazing the science is. But be aware that a lot of the learning will have to be done on your own or at least outside the classroom. Find a smart\/ interested study group and you will get through this and maybe even enjoy a bit of it along the way.",
    "The course material for organic chemistry was very interesting, however there are some points when the correct answer to a question can be ambiguous and even peer tutors and teaching fellows may not know the answer. The psets are difficult and sometimes require difficult jumps of knowledge or a key piece of information that is obscure.",
    "So, OBVIOUSLY the only reason anyone should take this class is for requirements of some type. MBB major, premed, something. If not, do not waste your time taking this class. Organic chemistry itself is dry and notoriously difficult, and taking the class with Ziegler only amplified these bad qualities. Lectures were unclear, disorganized, and unhelpful, and I can name a large amount of people that were wise and dropped or withdrew from the class. They made the right decision. However, if you do find yourself taking this class - know that in order to get anything out of lecture you need to read the corresponding chapter in the textbook beforehand. Best of luck to anyone who takes this class!",
    "It's required. Take it in the spring with a better teacher.",
    "Well, if you are premed you are going to have to take it anyway. So I suggest to audit doing the spring semester if you are beginning in the fall or audit it during the fall semester if you are taking it in the spring. Or possible take a summer course before taking orgo. Either way, make sure you do not go into organic chemsitry without going over it. It helps to have prior knowledge.",
    "People don't generally take this course just for fun, but it is definitely more manageable if you genuinely like the material. Most people don't love Ziegler, so I would not highly recommend his class because it will be frustrating. He is not very organized, and the way he evaluates\/tests can make it hard to show that you know the concepts even if you feel like you do know it. You will have to invest a lot of time in learning the material outside of lecture.",
    "Chance are you have to take this class for a major or med school. That being said I did enjoy the material a lot. And although as many people will say, Ziegler was not a good teacher, his website was extremely helpful to everyone and the textbook is also very easy to follow and very informative. Also the student tutors are all pretty good and were very helpful when it came to problem sets. The class consists of three hour longs tests, 10 problem sets, and a final. You get to drop one test, each test is 25%, the problem sets are 10% and the final is 40%. As long as you keep up with the reading, understand the problem sets and do all the practice tests you should be fine. Lecture was not that helpful for me but it was to others so would suggests going in the beginning to see if you can follow Ziegler."
