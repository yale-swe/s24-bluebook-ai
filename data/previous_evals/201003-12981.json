    "I would highly recommend French 110 to another student.",
    "A introductory French course, but it's a lot of work",
    "I think French 110 is a pretty good intro course. It takes some getting used to not seeing everything written at first, expecially when you are getting used to the pronounciation of the language. I think the videos we watch each week for French in Action are generally useful in getting you to speak from the beginning, although it seems to take a while before you can actually say anything that seems worthwhile. There is homework every night in the workbook, but it's not too challenging. I would definitely recommend watching the French in Action videos on your own, including the explanation parts at the end, as well as reading through the lessons in the textbook and looking up unfamiliar vocab. There is a weekly quiz and composition which aren't too bad. There is also a weekly test at the language center every Monday night, half of the grade for which is speaking. I think a lot of people in the class came to dread these tests, but they were not overally difficult. A good class overall.",
    "I found the premise of the course effective, and the videos entertaining. The weekly lectures are wonderful, but the section experience depends on the instructor. I would advise other students to get a sense of a section instructor's confidence and experience before signing up for his\/her section.",
    "It's a good class. Enjoyable and not too difficult. Sometimes the workload seemed to be a lot but it is beneficial to have the extra grades.",
    "Only take French 110 if you are incredibly well suited to picking up a language in context. French 110 strives to be an immersion class, but falls short. Each week you are expected to pick up different aspects of French by watching a video. The rest of the week will be spent reviewing concepts addressed by the video, but nobody will actually tell you what you are supposed to be learning or how to apply it. Also, every Monday night you will have a 30 minute test (but you still have to go to class 5 days a week!) Don't take this class unless you already know a romance language, and even then there are better alternatives.",
    "Yes, I would totally recommend it to somebody you wants to learn french quickly.",
    "Of all the foreign languages, French seems to be the most time consuming with the most work."
