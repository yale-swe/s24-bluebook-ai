   "comments": [
    "Sessions were very well prepared by the instructor, however sometimes presentation was incredibly rote. It was a struggle to take notes fast enough and in an organized fashion, which prevented me from really engaging with the topics in a more active way during the class.",
    "john's lecturing style, which was more talking than powerpointing, was very refreshing",
    "It was fairly clear when we were having a discussion, and when Jon was reading a list meant for the test. This was a weird split that was great for test prep, but less useful in terms of the flow of the class. Also, it was very easy to wind up very far off topic.",
    "No comments.",
    "A lot of room for in class discussion, which was great from a learning perspective. Hopefully it didn't cut out too much that was trying to be covered.",
    "Jon was always able to guide the discussion and get in the expected information and topics; yet was still able to let a free flowing natural conversation develop so we could address and additional questions we had.",
    "I think he did a good job meshing the previous professor's outline of the class with his own style of teaching. There were opportunities to develop conversations over many concepts, and I wish that there had been more time for that. There conversations are more helpful than lists.",
    "Jon has a good lecturing style, and did a good job of ending class discussions in time to finish the lecture in an orderly fashion. Lectures were extremely structured, which fit well with the format of the class.",
    "While I felt we covered pertinent information by going through notes, I think the most engaging points in classes were discussing stories related to production assignments.",
    "I had lots of fun trying to think about technical solutions for the assignment",
    "The best classes were when we were able to get into discussions or look at each others work and elaborate and clarify it. Some classes felt as if we were just being lectured at and had to write down everything as fast as possible, which doesn't let the information sink in."

I found the method quite rigid, not actual and also simplistic. I think it would be more useful to carry on with exercises covering multiples roles during the overall course.",
    "The information of the lectures was pertinent, however the listed nature of it was very frustrating. I feel like everyone in the class could talk about many of the topics well, but when it came to the specific language required of the curriculum, we could never recite it perfectly."

    "I appreciated that the majority of assignments happened in the beginning of the semester.",
    "I know there isn't real way around it, but just so I say it out loud. I HATE GROUP PROJECTS. It was good in that TDs were able to use it as a teaching opportunity, but frustrating if people didn't actually want to learn how to do it.",
    "I think we did exactly what should be done. The assignments made sense, and the tests were reasonable.",
    "The projects covered the most important aspects of the lecture without taking away time from other projects in other classes.",
    "While I understand why the homework is frontloaded the way it is within the context of the course as it is currently structured, it hit me particularly hard as I had a early production assignment which coincided quite nicely (not nicely) with all the homework for this class.",
    "The workload was heavier in the beginning of the semester, which allowed more time for discussion and reflection in the second half.",

Only thing I wish would be if we went over Ashomen before I had to use it, but it's probably better to wait for that in terms of arc of the class. Or maybe have the group project be done in Ashomen?",

    "This may be a personal preference, but I found it challenging that the class relied on pure memorization for the tests. If I didn't take the notes word for word, writing down exactly what the instructor said, it would have been hard to pass. The questions were looking for very specifically-worded answers. It was hard to keep up with the note taking to get everything down in class. If you fell behind transcribing the lecture, there was really no hope to catch up.",
    "the tests in this class were a little tough because of the rote memorization of lists",
    "I can understand the production planning process without memorizing lists.",
    "No comments.",
    "The first one I felt like I just memorized lists long enough to write them back down, but the second one had a little bit more general knowledge questions and less regurgitating lists which felt like I was truly understanding more.",
    "The tests definitely evaluated the material covered in class, but I frequently felt they were nitpicky to the point of absurdity. Things I was marked down for were probably valid (I didn't investigate too hard) based on what Jon actually said in class, but a lot of things I got wrong were not that I misunderstood a concept, but because I misremembered the exact phrasing Jon used when discussing said concept in class.",
    "The tests are structured very closely to notes that we may not have thoroughly discussed in class.",
    "Tests based on lists learned by heart are pretty old fashion system in my opinion that especially in entertainment, with really few time available to think, are not much help as don't confer confidence in problem-solving",
    "the grading was fair, however, wish the test was not so much about just memorizing lists of production planning process.",
    "Memorizing and rewriting lists is a basic way to learn something and easily forgotten after the test. The questions that we could elaborate on require a broad knowledge base and show more of what we will take away from the class into the world.",
    "This relates to my comment on Question 4. I think the course would really benefit from losing \"The Lists\". The information contained in them is vital, yes, but there are other ways to prove that we know the information (i.e. free-responses)."

Because no outline was provided, it was sometimes tricky to understand how to \"bucket\" or categorize the notes. I ended up with lists of 7 or 8 things instead of 9 or 10, if those lists were not clearly described as a list when they were lectured about.",

    "There may not be a great way to do this, but has anyone ever asked to make the planning of the Holiday Party the final for this class, at least for TD&P?",

    "Is it possible to get a working version of Haus and Ashomen for class so we can better learn the process for our future work. It would be a benefit to have everyone trained the same way so that there are no holes in knowledge or process by learning it from our TD's when on production assignments.",
    "One of the things that bugged me throughout the course was my awareness that we were learning how to plan for production specifically at YSD. While that information is very important for our work here, I think it also needs to be highlighted that things work differently at other organizations. We touched on that a bit, but I get the feeling that everyone graduates from here with a \"Ben-Forms or Bust\" attitude. Perhaps some classes could be spent looking at paperwork and work-flows of other organizations. Maybe visiting speakers that are NOT graduates of YSD?"
