    "Chem 117L is challenging but not too bad. If you do the work and come somewhat prepared before lab and focus, you will do well on both the quizzes and on the experiments. The lab reports were often long and tedious...be prepared to spend at least 4 or 5 hours on some of the longer ones! DEFINITELY take 116L before taking this course, as 117L is basically an extension of 116L, which is easier and gives you a better orientation towards the skills needed. I can see how taking 117L as your first chem lab course at Yale would be exceedingly difficult and stressful.",
    "It is great bc you get to work with partners, but the lab reports are just logn and annoying lol",
    "Chem 117L is tedious and tiring, but could be a lot worse. It's survivable if you have a friend in your section with you.",
    "Take it if you have to. It helps reinforce concepts from the associated lecture but that's about it.",
    "Dr. G is and always will be a total boss of a lab professor. Very helpful, understanding, and not too harsh of a grader. Though, the grading in 117L is much harder than the grading in 116L, so beware.",
    "Chem 117L is definitely a challenging lab course, but it necessary for most science\/pre-med majors. It really helps reinforce and demonstrate the concepts from the corresponding intro chem lectures. Take it!",
    "If you're taking Chem 117L, it's probably because you have to. There's no reason to take this lab for fun...",
    "Pain in the a**. Necessary evil, grade is completely TA dependent (for example, mine took off unnecessary points for the most minuscule details, whereas friends received better grades for clearly worse reports...). Dreaded going to lab, most incredible feeling leaving lab until I would realize that I'd have to be back in a week. Take it if you're premed or Chem major, otherwise, stay away. Wayyyyy more work than it's worth.",
    "I would take it only if you need it for a requirement",
    "It's an intro course. It is much harder than Chem 116 (in perspective if you took it in the fall), so take it only if you have too... like if its your major... or you're a pre-med.",
    "I would only recommend this course for a premed student...",
    "It's a fine gen-chem lab. Totally bearable, labs aren't hard, you suck it up in terms of being in there four hours in a row but it's really fine.",
    "I would not take it unless necessary. It's a tedious class and I did not learn all that much.",
    "Never take this course unless you have to. It was by far the biggest time commitment that I had this semester, and it's ludicrous that it only counts for half of a credit.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "Similar to 116L, though the techniques are a bit more difficult. High expectations with regards to experimental precision",
    "Some of the labs were really long and tedious but others were simple and You got out easy; You knew exactly what You were supposed to be doing in every lab. A lot of the labs are partner labs which is fun - but a USB is somewhat required for this lab - I borrowed from friends the whole time, but it's awkward when 3 groups are all using the same USB. Also because of all the school we missed we didn't get to do some labs.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it.",
    "I would recommend the class for someone who needs it as a requirement or just really likes hands-on class. Otherwise, the 4-hour periods and the long lab reports just aren't particularly worth it.",
    "I would summarize it as a general lab course to learn about the basics of lab. I would recommend Chemistry 117L to anyone who needs to take it for their major requirements.",
    "I would only recommend CHEM 117L if you need it for premedical requirements or for your major.",
    "A necessary evil... You will hate doing it, but you're going to have to.",
    "Chem 117 is a collection of 4 hour long labs. They require a lot of work, but the labs definitely reinforce concepts learned in class.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to. not particularly hard but the reports take some time. TAKE A NIGHT LAB. it sounds awful, but it's 100x more relaxed.",
    "This lab follows Chemistry 115 very well. I enjoyed this lab more than Chem 116L. Lots of titrations. A few of the lab reports were very time consuming, but the labs themselves were very manageable.",
    "Long, but coincides well with intro courses. Reinforces concepts from course.",
    "Great way to understand how lab courses are set up",
    "Do not take unless absolutely necessary.",
    "It's so much work for a 0.5 credit class.",
    "You should only take chemistry 117L if its required for your major or you are pre-med. Otherwise, I don't think the class is a necessary supplement to the gen chem courses.",
    "If you're taking it, it's usually because you have to. It's ok, not tough.",
    "Only take this lab if you need it for your major or to fulfill pre-med requirements. The work is tedious and often repetitive. It isn't horrible, but it's just not enjoyable.",
    "Pretty easy course to do well in. Dr. G gives you everything you need to know and then some in the lab manual. Don't be intimidated by the time limit; most labs are short or done with a partner.",
    "Chemistry 117L is a continuation of Chemistry 116L, and it is helpful in learning the material you learn in the course.",
    "DO NOT. Only if you absolutely have to.",
    "For me, this class was not to fulfill a pre-requisite - whether for my major or my distributional requirements or any pre-med mumbo jumbo. I took this class to explore the sciences, to engage in what (I initially thought) would be an exciting endeavor: learning how to use lab instruments, perform data analysis, and be independent in a laboratory. Although this class did teach me those things, I did not enjoy the journey, and am sorry to say this may be the end of my exploration of the pure sciences.No, it was not that I squirted my pipet at Dr. G during Week1, spilled sulfuric acid over my notebook during Week 2, or set my hand on fire with a Bunsen Burner during Week 3. Those experiences, I can look back on and laugh. What makes me want to cry, though, are the endless pointless hours spent re-formatting my graphs on Excel, seeing points arbitrarily taken off for a \"messy\" double cross-out (rather than a \"clean\" single cross-out), watching my final practical exam grade go up in flames (at least it wasn't my hand again...) for a single accuracy error, despite a semester's worth of good, honest work. This course was certainly an experience, but it came at a steep price.",
    "I would recommend Chem 117L to a fellow student because lab really helps with getting a better understanding of what is going on in Chem 115. Just make sure to always come prepared to lab and have your notes ready.",
    "As long as you read and prepare for the lab beforehand, it's not too difficult to carry out. If Dr. G posts information on classesv2, make sure you try to look it over before your lab day. The lab reports for 117L tended to be a little longer and more complicated than for 116L, so starting those early is important too.",
    "Yes",
    "Pretty annoying, lots of titrations and very repetitive but it does help elucidate some concepts from Gen Chem class (115)",
    "Take it only if you need to.",
    "No",
    "Helps a lot with the concepts learned in 115 but is definitely a full credit's worth of work. You will spend a lot of time on the lab write-ups.",
    "Lab should count for more than .5 credits. It's ridiculous that it counts only for .5. Anyone that takes lab would agree. Especially this particular General Chemistry lab. It's a lot of work, labs take forever if you want to get an A in them, the prelab quizzes can be very hard, so you have to study and prepare for them. Staying all those hours is exhausting. Lab is a pain, it can be fun at times but it is mostly a pain. I suggest you find a partner you feel comfortable with, and stick with your partner the entire course, become friends with them, and help each other out on the labs. By doing this you can complain to each other, share the pain, but most of all, help each other out to make lab more bearable. This course should be atleast .75 credits or 1.00 credit. .5 doesn't cut it.",
    "It is a very tough course. I have been told that this general chemistry lab is the hardest at Yale because of the prelab quizes and the amount of time required to complete the lab write ups.",
    "I would not recommend Chemistry 177L to another student. Unfortunately, most of the people taking this course must do so for a major, so whether or not you want to take this course is usually not a deciding factor in whether or not actually do. This was probably my worst class of freshman year, and made the beginning of my weeks dismal and burdensome. If you have to take it, you can get through it (it won't kill you or anything) -- it's just not fun.",
    "This class is satisfactory at best. You will learn a lot about experiments and experimental procedures but for the amount of work and studying this class requires it is worth way more than half a credit. A lot of work, not a lot of help from the professor (who is rude) and a very frustrating and unforgiving grading system. Only take it if you have to.",
    "Yes, it's a good course. A lot of work for 0.5 credits but easy",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. Plain and simple.",
    "The course was very similar to CHEM 116L, which I took last semester, so I knew what to expect. Some of the lab reports were extremely time-consuming and difficult, and I thought the grading was much more harsh than it was for CHEM 116L. I would recommend a lot of preparation for the final lab practical.",
    "If you need it, then take it but if you don't, stay away. stay far away.",
    "I recommend this lab course to another student. It is manageable and a great introduction to more chemistry labs.",
    "Very tedious",
    "Chem 117L is a standard chem lab course. Take it if you think that you'll need it for your major, otherwise, there is no point in taking it. Having worked in several modern science labs at top tier universities, I can confidently say that most of the skills that you learn in this lab are not useful or applicable to research settings. Many of the lessons either use outdated and inefficient methods or outdated equipment. Essentially, this is a course is just a hoop to jump through for your major.",
    "Just your basic chem lab. You probably wouldn't take it unless you had to for pre-med or major requirements but it wasn't terrible. Just a little frustrating at the amount of time it takes up for just half a credit.",
    "I would recommend this to any student needing a gen chem lab requirement or even just looking to experience a lab.",
    "An interesting lab course that goes with the lecture fairly well. If you're thinking of taking this class it's probably for a requirement, so I'll refrain from describing why there are better lab courses to take. Just know that you will probably have to put a decent amount of time into this class despite its half-credit status--the lab reports and experiments are very meticulous and emphasize accuracy. I'd say I put about the same amount of work into this class as I did into chem 115.",
    "I would recommend this course if you need it for pre-med credit or whatever. This is not a course you would take for fun so don't. Take it only if necessary and you will be fine.",
    "i would not recommend this course unless it is a requirement. the vast majority of people who take this lab course are required to take it.",
    "Only if it is required.",
    "117 was an interesting experience that I would recommend if you are legitimately interested in chemistry. If not interested in chem or fulfilling a requirement, avoid the lab.",
    "Only take this class if you have to. It isn't terribly hard but it is a lot of work having to do a lab report and prepare for the next experiment every week. Things can be graded sometimes rather harshly and there is a lot of subjectivity when it comes to grading between different section TAs. A huge downside to the course is the instructor, Dr. G, but there isn't much you can do about that. He is unforgiving and will make you feel bad if you make any sort of mistake. But, like I said, if you're required to take this course then take it and go in being very prepared.",
    "I would not recommend the course for anyone who's just looking to get half a science credit. It's not worth the time if you're just looking for distributional credit, especially since 4 hours at once is a seriously long haul. For all you pre-meds and chem majors out there, it's not actually that bad. I rather enjoyed it, but that's because I enjoy science. If science is not your thing, then chem lab is not the best option for you. There are more fun science credits out there.",
    "I would recommend it to another student trying to fill lab requirements or even to a student just looking to take a Chemistry Lab for fun. It's better than 116, though it would have probably been impossible if I hadn't taken 116 first.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. It is a fair bit of work between the labs, the lab reports and the prelab quizzes. I found the class to be quite stressful because of all of this but if you get a good TA, lab itself can be quite enjoyable. You should try to take it with friends.",
    "I thought it was better than Chem 116L because, by this time, you were more familiar with the techniques and understood why you were carrying out the experiments and the importance each experiment had in the realm of chemistry. I would recommend it to another student for basic lab techniques and a nice supplement to the Chem 115 lecture class.",
    "I would not take this class if I didn't have to for Pre Med requirements. Some labs were long, others tedious. It wasn't anything so special. It was nice to have some reinforcement from Chemistry class.",
    "This class was fine. It's a generic laboratory class, wasn't too bad.",
    "CHEM 117L supplemented CHEM 115 nicely, reinforcing the concepts learned in lecture. I would recommend taking CHEM 117L only if you've also taken CHEM 116L. Some of the lab skills learned from 116L are required for 117L, and there isn't much instruction in 117L for those who need to learn these skills from the beginning.",
    "CHEM 117L meets once a week for 4 hours, and is a series of mandatory lab experiments, typically spanning one or two classes. For each experiment, youmust complete a pre-lab before class, sit through a brief in-class presentation on the experiment, go into the lab and conduct the experiment (usually with partners), and then write-up the experiment in the lab report, due the next week. I'm pre-med, though not a science major, and I enjoyed this class a lot, probably because the precision required appealed to my OCD tendencies. However, I wouldn't recommend this class to a student who is not required to take it -- it is very rigid and demanding.",
    "Chemistry 117L is a very straightforward and informative chemistry lab class. The main difference between 117L and the 116L counterpart is that the quizzes tend to be more difficult. I would recommend preparing for them by using the sample quiz questions provided on Classes V2. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "CHEM117L was a fun and more challenging lab course. For me it was mandatory but I think it was a good experience nonetheless.",
    "Good course, a fair amount of work and commitment required and it can be somewhat tedious.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed Chemistry 117 because I thought the course gave me an opportunity to test what I was learning in the classroom in a laboratory setting, and that was a great way for me to solidify the concepts I learned in class and really understand the material. Chem 117 is definitely a lot of work though with preparing for weekly quizzes, reading the pre-lab, and writing lab reports. Therefore, I would only recommend taking the course if you are very passionate about the material or if it's a pre-req.",
    "There was an extensive amount of work for this course.",
    "If you have to take a gen chem lab requirement, then Chem 117 is as good a class as any. It is well-structured, the teaching is very clear and concise, and you learn proper lab techniques.",
    "It complements the general chemistry lecturecourse really well. Make sure to read the labs before your lab day, and make sure to read over the mistakes in your previous lab reports and fix them on all of your following ones. Dr. G is very good at having students understand the lab materials.",
    "It's pretty much what you'd expect from a chemistry lab. You'll have experiments in a variety of different topics, and you'll use a bunch of different tools. Dr. G is great, and the TAs are usually pretty helpful. It's not too difficult, although the lab reports can be time consuming, so it's best not to start them the night before they're due.",
    "This lab is a bit harder than 116L. The quizzes require you to know more material from gen chem. There is a considerable amount of work for a half credit course but its not too bad."
