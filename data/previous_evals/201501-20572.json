   "comments": [
    "This class is an in-depth examination of the Native American social histories relevant to understanding American historical development. By engaging the ways in which Indigenous communities negotiated the presence of multiple Imperial powers over the history of the continent, national narratives are critically unpacked, historical narratives are explored with a finer lens, and gaps in American history are better accounted for, resulting in an advanced understanding of historical rents and their impacts. I would highly recommend this course to any student.",
    "Indians and Empires was an opportunity to explore the literature regarding the history of the colonization of the Indigenous people on the North American continent and beyond. it took special care to emphasize the historiographical developments and disagreements surrounding the content area. It emphasized strong critical thinking skills to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of histories and theories. I would recommend this course to anyone with a strong interest in Native studies and a willingness to engage with higher order critical thinking. This class is not for the faint of heart.",
    "I would recommend this course to fellow students with an interest in the history of Native peoples of North America. Obviously, the lens is historiography, so one should be interested in that, as well.",
    "I would highly recommend the class to anyone willing to put forth the time and energy (much of is required!) to anyone interested in the field of Native American studies."

   "comments": [
    "I am not in American studies or the History department, but I would consider this course invaluable to a graduate student in either program. As an art historian, it was eye opening and methodologically valuable. As a student, it was immeasurably useful for developing my critical reading abilities.",
    "This was very helpful to my research--it introduced me to a relatively new collection of authors\/readings and the course provided a good overview of currents in the discipline.",
    "I have a veritable library in the field now! This has been very helpful, foundational even."
