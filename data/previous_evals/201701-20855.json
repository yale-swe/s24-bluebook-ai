   "comments": [
    "The material is interesting but because it is complicated very little is seen in each class which makes it easy to lose focus. Also, none of the practice exercises are similar to the exercises we are expected to solve in the exam.",
    "A lot of the time in this class, I found my self wondering why we were doing what we were doing or why we were able to. I understand that it goes beyond the scope of the course, but it might have given the whole course more cohesion.",
    "The material is good, but it is also very hard. The class also moves pretty quickly since there's a lot of topics to cover. Office hours and review sessions are very helpful and necessary.",
    "I really found the online videos and resources of Math 115 to be very helpful. I think finding a way to provide those resources for Math 120 could be extremely helpful.",
    "If you don't have Miki the course is extremely difficult to do well in. If you have a bad teacher and they don't teach the way Miki writes the exams, it's virtually impossible to do well.",
    "This course is exactly what one would expect, no surprises here.",
    "This course is well taught - I think it could be improved if technology was integrated into the teaching (for example, being able to project the 3D images we discuss onto a screen instead of trying to draw them). I liked that it was split into three parts naturally, with the three-dimensional material at the end; however, this made it so that the rigor of the course increased disproportionately at the end. Overall, everything is good, the course just might benefit from more time on the material at the end.",
    "This course is not taught well and I felt very confused and behind for all the material.",
    "I think the teaching is not very good, I relied almost solely on my self to learn the concepts. It also moves too fast and virtually guarantees that the student will have to learn a lot on his\/her own.",
    "The course is often not taught at the level of difficulty that the tests are at and the problem sets share a similar problem.",
    "Strengths: well organized and lots of support Weaknesses: some of the questions on the final were pretty different than the problems we were doing as practice",
    "Strengths: very complex material Weaknesses: very complex material",
    "The quality of the instructor's across the different sections is inconsistent, but there is plenty of support available for students. The textbook has great examples that are explained, but not in easy-to-understand language. The material is often very difficult, especially when not explained well. Generally, it could be improved if there were more practice problems integrated into the lessons. As it is now, or at least in my section, the professor or lecturer does a practice problem to demonstrate the concept and then does another and moves on. Instead of doing that, I wish the lesson was organized as follows: the topic or lesson is taught with one or two demonstrative examples done on the board, then students are given a problem to try on their own to test their comprehension and to consolidate\/solidify their knowledge, and then the professor would go over that problem together with the students. Without that practice problem for students to try with the review afterwards, I often forgot the knowledge or did not know how to apply it myself. I would go to class, understand or think I understand the material when shown to me on the board, then go home and be lost when I begun the problem set on my own. Because I hadn't been able to practice a problem right after we were taught to, I hadn't consolidated the information enough and felt totally lost on my own. As a result, I ended up relearning the lessons (or tried to) by reading the relevant textbook chapters. I understand that this would require more class time, but I also think it would be extremely beneficial to students. If it isn't possible to accommodate this, then perhaps one of the office hours could be dedicated to this sort of knowledge-consolidation work. I know I didn't go to office hours because often I didn't understand the concept and it seems unfair to have the TF or professor explain entire concepts to me. In other classes where I thought office hours were the most helpful, the professor set up a designated office hour where he systematically went over practice problems and answered relevant questions afterwards. Many students, including myself, showed up to that office hours every week, and it didn't seem daunting because it was structured and went over problems that students were encouraged to try on their own first. Since I had already tried to process the material, I knew exactly where the gaps were and it was nice to have them filled by the professor, but in an impersonal way, since he was going over the problems for all the students there, not just me. MATH 120 could have a similar review office hours every week where we went over the problem sets methodically, and if not the problem sets, then the practice problem sets. Because students have different learning styles, I wish that there was a way for students to shop around the different professors. It would be wonderful if there was an initial lottery for all MATH 120 spots, and then after a period where students try the different professors, there could be a lottery for the specific section. Or, it would be wonderful if there were a streamlined way to switch between professors."

    "Yes, the class is very interesting and if you're interesting in anything Math related is probably a necessity.",
    "If the course is needed for your major, you should take it. If it's not needed, you should still take it. It really depends on how comfortable\/dedicated you are to keeping up with the material.",
    "Don't take this unless you literally have to.",
    "No, definitely not. Take ENAS 151 if you can",
    "I would recommend to any student that needed or wanted to take multivariable.",
    "It is a prereq so yes but it is a tough course to take as well.",
    "Yes, but only if they try to get in to the classes of a teacher like Miki. I don't think grad students are the best choice to teach this course.",
    "The content is valuable but the class is pretty hard so take it at your own risk.",
    "If you want to learn multi variable calculus, math 120 is a pretty good course",
    "Yes",
    "This is quite a difficult course that can be amazing and intellectually stimulating if taken with the right professor, but unfortunately, I didn't have a great professor. Don't get me wrong. Dan Corey is extremely passionate about math and multivariable calculus an it shows in class. He is also very accessible to students through office hours and one-on-one meetings. He likes to think about concepts geometrically and tries to give us a (geometric) intuition of the concepts. However, he's not great at conveying his knowledge to those of us who might not get the concepts as intuitively as he does. For example, he often only explains to us the geometric connection between things, but not the arithmetic, physics or abstract connections between concepts in a very coherent or easy to understand way. Although his lessons are organized, he teaches lessons by showing us examples rather than by breaking down the concept into pieces. In other words, he often does problems on the board without ever showing us which steps he used to solve the problem (or labelling the steps on the board). I wish he abstracted the important points from his examples to say: to solve this type of problem, first you do this, second that, and lastly that. He also often did problems \"fast and loose\" on the board to save time, but it always ended in me and, by the looks we passed in class, many others being thoroughly confused. We ended up just learning the topics and the appropriate problem-solving steps from the textbook. Also, no matter whose section you're in, Khan Academy has some great videos that were so helpful in explaining some of the concepts."
