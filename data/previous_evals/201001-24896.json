   "comments": [
    "This class is AMAZING. If\/when it is offered again, and you are an Austen and\/or Bronte fan, you are missing out if you do not take it. Even if you've read 75% of the reading list, and you've read Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre 6 times each, you should still take it. Prof. Trumpener is amazing and leads terrific class discussions, such that I continued to get things out of books I'd read multiple times before (even some that I'd read in other classes). She also brings in some newer novels that you might not have read and that are definitely worth it (e.g. House of Mirth). Plus, everyone else in the class is just as obsessed with Austen and Bronte as you are, so there's a great community and really awesome conversations. There are only two 10-page papers and the reading is totally manageable (and, dare I say, does not usually feel like work). I looked forward to this class (and the reading for the class) every week -- the highlight of my second semester senior year!Bottom line: TAKE IT!!",
    "=D =D =DWhat can I say? This class was amazing. We read Austen (P&P, MP, Persuasion), Bronte (Jane Eyre& Villette) and 20th Century Women's Novels (house of mirth, the rectors daughter, prep, brontes went to woolworths, rebecca).We wrote two 10 pages essays. It was really fun.Professor Trumpener is a gem, and really cares about her students. I was impressed at how well she directed discussions. Take a class with her if you get the chance.",
    "if you can get in and you have a passion for the subject TAKE IT.",
    "Take this class! You'll get to read all of your favorite books and discuss them with other people. Also, you'll read books that have some of the same themes as Austen's work, but that you may not have been familiar with, which is great.",
    "This is a great review (if you're an old Austen\/Bronte fan) and a great introduction (if you're not) to some old favorites and some newer novels in the same line. Tracing the influence of these two prolific writers was fascinating as well as fun. It never felt like work to do the reading, write the papers or go to class. I loved every minute of it.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this class to another student. Thought provoking discussion on some classic texts. Also, introduction to some lesser known texts that really shed new light on some standards that could otherwise seem well worn. Class discussion was lively - never dull. the two papers were reasonable, and the prof gave great feedback.",
    "Yes, if you think you'll like the reading. I think it was a great course. Good reading. Really nice, understanding professor. Discussion could get a little slow or seem pointless at times, but definitely a good class.",
    "I loved this class, and would recommend it to anyone. Exploring books in the context of Austen and Bronte was really interesting. I've really continued to find Austen and Bronte's influences in books I've read since. The reading list is really great. It's a lot of reading, but it's all really fun, so I never minded doing it.",
    "Really enjoyed this class. Friendly to non-lit majors, completely manageable workload and you'll actually enjoy what you're doing without feeling like you're wasting your time. Highly recommended.",
    "I can't say enough good things aout English 305. It's a wonderful seminar that begins with Austen's and Bronte's foundational works (Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre, Mansfield Park, and others) and follows themes established in these works through novels written by women into the 20th century (including Prep, Rebecca, and the House of Mirth). Definitely, definitely take this class if you are an Austen or Bronte fan! Although some of the texts were long, the reading pace wasn't too fast. Anyway, no homework's better than reading one of your favorite books!",
    "Definitely highly recommended. Professor Trumpener is fantastic, the readings are (obviously) great, discussions are awesome, and the workload isn't bad."
