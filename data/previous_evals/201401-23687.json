    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student! Psets - 50%, Final Project - 50%. Basically, no exams (which is great, because the material is really hard). Prof. Tatikonda is super flexible when it comes to the final project and I really enjoyed working on it. Psets are hard, but doable if you go to office hours. Workload not bad at all! AMTH class without exams, what are you waiting for???",
    "I would recommend this class to a student, because optimization is an extremely important field and this course will give you a comprehensive overview of it. At the same time, the material can be hard to follow in lecture especially at the pace presented, so one needs to really pay attention closely. I found the course a bit theoretical for the applied math department, so the problem sets can be rather challenging, but overall they were rewarding. Fortunately the course had no exams, which made it much less stressful than some other math classes, and being able to work on your own project for the final was a nice touch.",
    "Definitely.",
    "Only take this if you know linear algebra really, really well. The concepts in this class are very hard and so you have to know the basics to understand the more advanced stuff. Sekhar moves very quickly so if you don't understand the underlying stuff you will be totally lost.",
    "Optimization is an overview of different optimization theory and algorithms. You learn about how to solve a variety of optimization problems. There is a lot of math.",
    "Take this class. Convex optimization is such an important class to learn. Take it with Sekhar.",
    "Good class. Take it if you're interested in classical and current optimization techniques. Sekhar is wonderful and the class was interesting. Sometimes the textbook was difficult to follow and the homework problems were difficult but worth it.",
    "Take this class. Sekhar is wonderful, the material is interesting, and the class is very stress-free. There's no final exam but a project, which is great because it allows you to pursue your own interests. Definitely a wonderful class. Sekhar is one of the most wonderful instructors at Yale. He gives great research advice, is very hands-off but still provides students with a lot of help if we go to him. That's exactly what I look in faculty members when I'm taking classes.",
    "As it stands, this course is reasonably easy and reasonably interesting. The professor is excellent, but the course material is poorly structured.",
    "Great course, math is a bit tough but project was chill.",
    "A challenging but rewarding course. For the engaged theoretical mathematical student",
    "I think this is a very valuable course to take, but I'd recommend knowing something about optimization before coming in. The beginning of the course was very technical and abstract, and the course only really blossomed into something cool toward the latter part of the semester. It's like eating vegetables before desert -- important but a little tedious. I would recommend it to anybody who is doing research that is mathematical in nature. Sekhar is a phenomenal teacher and a very approachable friendly and humorous guy."
