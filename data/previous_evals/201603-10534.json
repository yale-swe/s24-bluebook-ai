   "comments": [
    "In order to evaluate works within their proper contexts, I learned a lot about various time periods and traditions. Additionally, close-reading was a major component of the course, so those skills developed, too.",
    "Thinking critically about literary texts, especially what makes each work \"cohere.\"",
    "I learned how to deeply analyze texts and make controversial claims from them. I learned how to close read better and look for ambiguities in the text. I am able to identify literary tropes and allusions better. I also learned to write a cohesive, persuasive literature essay.",
    "I learned how to closely read a passage. My analysis of works of literature was also improved. I also learned how to better structure and organize my papers.",
    "Critical reasoning and argumentation skills.",
    "The Literature thread of DS provided an overview of key literary texts from the classical and medieval period of the Western Canon. It also provides a pretty rigorous introduction to good paper-writing, although no secondary sources are allowed.",
    "During this course I developed close analytical skills through reading, annotating, and discussing various pieces of literature.",
    "I learned how to acutely analyze literary texts, voice and consider multiple perspectives with peers, and construct logical arguments in papers.",
    "During this course, I developed many of the technical skills required for studying literature. Performing close readings, tracing similes and images through various works, and asking questions about coherence and function are all essential parts of analysis that I learned how to do and write about in the assigned essays. Above these technical skills, I gained a great appreciation for ancient literature. Coming into this course, I was afraid that what we read would either be stale and dry or facile. Subtlety was not a characteristic that I associated with Greek and Roman writers. This course corrected my mistaken belief. By its end, I was left in awe at the nuance that ancient poets and dramatists were able to include in their works. This appreciation, along with the technical skills acquired, made the course worthwhile.",
    "DS Literature was the most rewarding class I've taken. I learned how to analyze texts in a completely new way. Even when I think I've gotten the most out of a passage or sentence, the professor helped me realize that there is still more I can take away from it. This class took my writing to a whole new level. I've never been challenged this much about my ideas and as a writer. DS Literature demanded more of me than any other class I've taken, and in the end I truly appreciated that.",
    "I gained a wonderful introduction to examining works of literature, an increased capability to put literature in the context of socio-political events of its time, a greater comfort with failure and a better understanding of how failure can work to my benefit if I address it correctly.",
    "I learned to rigorously analyze literature, paying special attention to the significant themes. I also learned to compare entire works to one another, and to track the development of thought and the approach to epic and other forms of literature over time."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Slanski's class featured lively discussions about themes (supported by analysis of passages) which were then extrapolated to address two questions: \"How does this affect our reading of the work? What is the author asking of us as readers?\" This approach forced the class to engage with the text and learn from it. However, the works were always far too long and far too intricate to discuss properly; either minuscule passages were analyzed at satisfactory depth, or the work was discussed broadly but superficially. Readings should be made shorter.",
    "This course is unique in the sense that one can cover most of the major Western literary texts from The Iliad to Dante's Divine Comedy. However, as with most DS courses, there is little time to analyze some of the texts. For example, for each Greek play we covered, we only spent one hour and fifteen minutes analyzing them. This course teaches students to deeply analyze texts beyond a superficial level, as well as learn to find hidden connections in the text. One learns to write in a more persuasive manner as one will be forced to write about controversial claims. I enjoyed the seminar style of the course, as it was valuable to engage with other students' perspectives on the texts we were all reading. This makes DS a very unique and valuable course as students are all reading the same texts and discussing them in a controlled and educational manner. However, the program could definitely be more organized, especially at the beginning of the semester when we were placed in sections, and had less than 24 hours to switch sections if there was a scheduling conflict. I wish there was a similar program with a different selection of texts, as it would be interesting to cover ancient literature besides Western texts.",
    "Of all the DS classes, DS Lit has the most manageable reading assignments.",
    "Moves too quickly through very complex texts. It would be appropriate to spend upwards of a week on one canto of Dante's Inferno, for example, but we get two class discussions on all 34 cantos. Although, the quick pace is necessary to cover the large amount of material. A discussion could be had on whether or not the amount of material is appropriate.",
    "It would be a mistake to think that DS teaches to any penetrating degree of depth; the literature course is very much an overview and not necessarily more than that. As much as we were getting through a lot of material each week via often well-paced discussion, two seminars can only go so far - which of course can't help but feel like a shame when you're reading such incredible texts. We also do just one medieval text right at the end of the semester which is a bit of a shame - although that medieval text is the Divine Comedy so hm, what more can you ask for. I do think that the best discussions, broadly speaking (though not without exceptions), arose from texts with which we spent a bit more time, e.g. two weeks with the amazing Aeneid. I'd rather spend more time with slightly fewer texts, so as not to feel rushed, than to just talk about themes in broad brushstrokes. I have mixed feelings about the lack of secondary sources. It's nice to meet such texts face to face without the burden of centuries of scholarship, and be expected to produce interesting and personal interpretations. However, I also love literary theory and think that discussions could have been made less one-dimensional if students were provoked with less standard, basic interpretations, and more slightly \"wild\" ones.",
    "The seminar was very intimate and thought-provoking. The discussions were challenging and illuminated at first unseeable facets about the works of literature.",
    "Strengths of this course include the intimate discussion sections, the investment of the students, and the appropriate choices of interrelated texts. The course could perhaps be improved by reducing the amount of reading and introducing variety in assignments other than reading and writing.",
    "The chief strength of this course is the caliber of the works that we studied. Everything that we read deserves its status as a classic, in addition to classical, work. Moreover, the ability to trace the influences of early works that we read on later ones is a fascinating trait that is relatively peculiar to this course. The only weakness of this course is that at times the emphasis placed on certain works was too much or too little. For example, the Oresteia did not necessitate two class periods to discuss, especially since nearly everything that was discussed came from the first play in the trilogy, the Agamemnon. Reducing the discussion, or perhaps the trilogy to the Agamemnon, would have given us more time to talk about Dante, Sappho, or Ovid.",
    "The way the class was facilitated was very effective. But what's more is that students are asked more than to just make a mere comment. Everything said in discussion was the product of careful thought and analysis because we know the professor will not be impressed with a just a slide-by statement. The class is demanding, but the rewards reaped are high. The only downside is the size of the class. I think we can benefit from a smaller class size to create an even more intimate section setting where everyone feels more comfortable to share their thoughts.",
    "Strengths included the works selected, the format of the discussions (leading questions prompting responses; an intermediary level of tolerance for digressions), the feedback for papers, the paper topics- absolutely everything. I honestly cannot pick out a weakness with this course.",
    "I particularly liked it when we do group work. I also liked the author bios that we did. Not a fan of the starting system, but I did like it when Professor Slanski would email out questions the night before, as our discussions always felt more focused the next day. The weaknesses of this course are the same as with all of the DS classes: simultaneously too much and too little reading.",
    "The text selection was absolutely wonderful, and I wouldn't change any one of them. In our Greek tragedy and Dante units, however, I believe we didn't have nearly enough time for thorough analysis, even by DS standards."

    "Directed Studies is an excellent program for those willing to devote themselves to doing readings and completing all of the work. The program will not benefit those who participate half-heartedly.",
    "Yes, if you're doing DS, Professor Slanski is an excellent choice. She also knows just about everything about DS, so it's really helpful developing a relationship with her.",
    "I would recommend this course to a person who is interesting in pursuing a career in the humanities. A student taking this course should keep in mind that only Western texts are covered in this class.",
    "I would highly recommend DS and DS Lit to students. The reading is manageable and you really learn how to analyze texts. The professors also work closely with you to improve your writing.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes - great course with excellent texts",
    "If the student knows exactly what they're getting into - broad overview, loads of reading, meeting texts only briefly but through potentially interesting discussions with amazing professors - sure.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I had never done close readings before taking this class and Professor Slanski helped me improve my ability to analyze and write about literature.",
    "I definitely would, it's one of the more enjoyable DS classes of the three.",
    "I would recommend this course (and Directed Studies) to any student who wishes to explore the humanities and who is willing to fully assume the hefty workload.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking to study literature or who has the most marginal interest in the Western canon. The books that we read were phenomenal, and the seminars in which they are discussed left me often awe-struck at the brilliancy of my classmates. Most importantly, the quality of instruction in this course is superb. The professors alone make the class worth taking.",
    "Yes, I will definitely recommend this class to another student. This is the perfect class for students who want to be challenged and for those who want to gain a new a perspective on analyzing texts. The discussion-based sections are what make DS special because from there, we learn that our peers are equally as passionate about the humanities as we are ourselves.",
    "YES. Absolutely. This class was essential.",
    "YES. DS Lit was the best part of first semester, and I really do feel like I learned a lot.",
    "I would unequivocally recommend this course. The texts are amazing, the size and structure of the class is intimate, and the discussions were insightful and fascinating."
