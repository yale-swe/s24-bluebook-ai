    "This semester in THST230, Professor Joan MacIntosh and the student ensemble chose to study and perform SAVAGE in LIMBO by John Patrick Shanley. A close reading and analysis of the play was paired with rehearsals and studio work in preparation for a showing of the play at the end of the term.Rehearsals only occurred during class hours, and minimal set and props were used in order to spend the most amount of time preparing scenework and working on the physical and vocal embodiment of the characters.One of the great strengths of the course was the sense of ensemble. There was a real sense of class ownership over the material and direction of the syllabus. The class decided together which play we wanted to produce, and it was enormously helpful for us as young actors to prepare a character\u0092s full arc over the course of a play as opposed to scene study, which is common to previous offeringsof THST230.Joan was an incredible guide and director for our studies. Her support of our development as actors, and the personal attention given to each student, was outstanding. Her direction was first-rate. If you have the opportunity to study acting with Joan MacIntosh during your Yale career, jump at the opportunity. You will not regret it.",
    "An advanced course in acting--this semester we staged a play of our choosing, John Patrick Shanley's Savage In Limbo."
