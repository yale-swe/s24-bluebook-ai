    "If you want to take a fiction workshop, Jones is warm, caring and incredibly wise, as well as completely hilarious. I had been in other workshop courses that were far less productive because the instructor simply sat back and let students say random things. Jones does an amazing job of structuring the discussion and making problems in students' own work into teaching opportunities, so that each workshop feels helpful to the entire class.",
    "Any writing workshop is a function of both the professor and the students that end up in the workshop. I think we were fortunate to have a very small group that was very committed to the task of workshopping and the craft of writing, which made this class so enjoyable. Professor Jones is fantastic, detailed feedback, helpful and practical advice that is actually useful for improving your stories, and also hilarious at that.",
    "Awesome. Take it with nalini. She's super funny and has really interesting work of her own. She is mainly focused on character writing and lives to see her students take big risks.",
    "Nalini's philosophy on fiction is VERY character-driven, which can be a little alienating at first, but it turned out to be very helpful in the long term. She's very available and gives great feedback."
