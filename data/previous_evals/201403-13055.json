    "Absolutely, if you want to get better at econometrics. Professor Weese is great. He deserves a prize. He worked extremely hard from the beginning after he told us there would be neither a grader nor a TA. He had extensive office hours and was ready to help us at anytime. My one criticism is that he teaches by saying \"ok, let's make up some data and see what happens\" and that was sometimes very hard to follow. He also let the one student in the class respond to every single question he asked, giving the rest of us no time to think about his questions. Workload is doable: one weekly pset (12 total and he drops 2), one midterm (super easy), one final (easy as well) and one final project (extremely hard). Learning R is cool.",
    "The quality of this class depends heavily on its instructor, and it seems like the instructor varies from semester to semester. The techniques learned are most certainly very useful, but if you're more interested in learning econometric techniques you are driven, you can probably learn all this stuff on your own with the Wooldridge textbook. When it comes to Weese, to be perfectly honest, you'll do most of the learning on your own. He's not very good at answering questions, even though he certainly tries his best to help. It's an okay class at best. Get a good study group together and you'll be fine.",
    "ECON 132 is a great way to learn the \"art\" and \"science\" of econometric methods. If you think you are probably going to get a phd, you should probably learn linear and do the other econometrics track. Otherwise, this course is a great way to become an informed consumer of regressions, and you will also develop some useful skills to create regressions of your own. This course is waaaaaay better than 131, aided by the great professor and small class size.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone who wants to do a senior project or understand econometrics better. I thought Professor Weese was great. He was a very clear lecturer and was extremely dedicated. Since the class was small, there was no TA so he had regular office hours during which a group of students would show up to ask questions about lectures and the problem sets. I only have good things to say about Professor Weese and the teaching of the course. The course load was also very manageable. While there was a supplementary textbook for the course, we learned all of the relevant econometrics, data analysis, and R code in class. Learning R vs. another language was a huge plus of this course. The course didn't assume previous knowledge of the language.",
    "Take if you plan to do anything related to economics\/finance. It teaches valuable lessons in making sense out of numbers and equations.",
    "Econ 132 was a pretty useful class and was helpful towards my senior thesis. Econ 131 is just an intro stats course so if you want a better understanding of more advanced regression concepts then I definitely recommend this. As the downside, some of the concepts actually were more theoretical and esoteric than I imagined and thus the class went beyond the framework for what I wanted a a practical resource for my senior thesis. Some people may want\/need this extra depth so it might just be a personal complaint. I think some people will give this class unfairly low reviews this semester because the Economics department screwed all of us and took away our TF after the first week of class. While Prof. Weese did a good job nonetheless, you really need a TF in a course like this as the class time is devoted to introducing the concepts and the theory and the section is supposed to be there to help guide you through some of the difficulties of using R and for giving extra practice problems that help reinforce what we learned in class. The class was not proof based and so was very manageable from a mathematics standpoint. It is rather self-selecting, but if you do relatively well in your intermediate micro.macro courses you would be fine here."
