    "Yes,absolutely. The workload is a little bit lighter than 151, and Zhou Laoshi is great. He is on your side and wants you to do well, which is a really nice change from status quo in languageteachers. It's still a language class of the textbook-and-vocabulary-list variety, but the content is slightly I elevated from previous classes and the discussions we have are often substantive and interesting.",
    "If you are coming back from a Light Fellowship, prepare to be very shocked at how slowly you will go in this class. Some of the chapters were covered in the 3rd year class at HBA, which was also frustrating. However, if you do all the extra practice and are proactive in class and at tutorials, you will learn a lot of useful grammar and vocab, and you will be better able to read Chinese sources like newspapers. Zhou laoshi is amazing and keeps things really low-stress.",
    "Easy course, but I didn't learn much. Zhou Laoshi never corrected students' tones in this class, which disturbed me sometimes. Although he is definitely one of the better Chinese teachers at Yale, this was a very disappointing experience for me personally.",
    "Take it if you want to continue studying Chinese! Zhou laoshi is very nice and the class is not too intense.",
    "It's pretty much exactly what you would expect after other Chinese classes. You have to take this first semester to take other off the normal track Chinese courses in later semesters, which makes this class worth it. Slightly more work than you might expect but still pretty reasonable.",
    "Yes! Would definitely recommend, even if it's a lot of work for one credit. But the work is very manageable. The professor is incredibly understanding, helpful, and nice. Not to mention his English is flawless compared to most Chinese instructors. The one drawback is, there is constant work. Homework is very manageable, but it is daily, and for a one credit language class, can be a bit much. The midterms and final are very doable though, and if you study moderately you'll get an A. This class examines highly charged social, political, and economic aspects of China's development, such as the hu kou system, marriage and divorce, and social networking\/internet trends. They are all very relevant and useful to colloquial and formal Chinese usage. Take this, and 155; if not for Zhou Laoshi, because the course is so helpful to your Chinese language and culture understanding.",
    "This is pretty similar to the other Chinese courses you will have taken at this point. I found it to be slightly less work than 151, although I guess that's to be expected since it's only 1 credit and it meets M\/W\/F. Zhou Laoshi is an excellent professor, and if you put a little work into the course every couple of days, you'll be totally successful.",
    "This class follows a similar pattern to the Chinese classes before it. Zhou laoshi is great.",
    "Zhou Laoshi is the best. That's all you need to know."
