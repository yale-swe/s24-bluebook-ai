    "Interesting class - you read Bleak House, Middlemarch, and a bit of early Tennyson and study a variety of Pre-Raphaelite paintings. Be ready to spend a decent amount of time in the YCBA. Sometimes the connections between the two forms took some work to make make sense, but the readings are of course excellent and Professor Carlisle is well worth studying with.",
