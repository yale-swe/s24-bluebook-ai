    "This class covers Spanish literature from the early middle ages through the late Baroque period. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in Spanish literature.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class with Prof. Poole. The workload is very much manageable and the material is interesting.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course for students who are looking to get a general overview of some of the most important medieval\/renaissance\/baroque works of literature from Spain. What is great about this class is that in addition to reading and learning about the literature, you will also get to learn about the context in which it was produced (i.e. societal ideals, theology, religion, etc.)",
    "It's a cursory survey of medieval and renaissance Spanish literature. I'd recommend it to someone looking for a background in the time periods."
