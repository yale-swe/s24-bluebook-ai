    "It was alright. The texts and films are pretty good, but it is also a lot of grammar which gets tiresome.",
    "I mean, it's pretty likely that if you're considering taking this course you have to either way, either to get the language requirement to graduate without starting a new language or just to be allowed to start the French major. So, you should take it. It's not super awesome in content but is a magnificent course in order to review French grammar\/brush up on your reading\/writing skills before doing something more intense.Go for it. You'll be fine, and if you actually pay attention\/show up\/do you're work it's hard to do poorly in this class.",
    "A good solid way to consolidate skills in French. It was very writing intensive, we wrote 5 redactions and both my grammar and writing have improved a lot. You also walk out of the class with a repertoire of french short stories, films and plays under your belt. My oral, although it did improve, did not improve as much as my writing.",
    "A run of the mill language course that truly challenged my writing ability, though I still wish we had done more work on conversational skills.",
    "If you don't keep taking a language class, at one point you're going to completely forget that language so yes"
