    "Great course on signals and imaging. Definitely not too complicated, but also not super easy and boring. I think that the lectures were fine, and the professors were really nice and tried to help as much as possible. For grading, we had a midterm, weekly problem sets, and a final. If you're looking at the class, you probably have to take it. Just know that it is way better than 351!",
    "If you're looking at this, you're taking it. Duncan&Staib are good professors, although the material can be dry and you will feel like falling asleep multiple times. It's a pretty straightforward class though and it was a lot better than 351. Just don't fall behind on your psets and if you can do those, you'll do fine in the class.",
    "Not really much to recommend since it is a required course for BME's. I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone else though. A working knowledge of matlab is helpful (shouldn't be a problem for those who took 249 or a programming course), and the midterm\/final is open note.",
    "If you are really interested in the BME imaging track, you will probably like this class. Most BMEmajors are not, and so the material can get a bit dry. There are only so many interesting things about convolving two things or looking at bode plots. That being said Duncan and Staib try really hard to make it interesting and the problem sets are not too bad - a couple are but just start it early. And work in a group - lots of tedious things. Final seemed fair except for one question, midterm was very doable.",
    "This is a mandatory BME class. The course helps you understand the BME labs and applies some of the math you learn in diff eq. It's not all too difficult, but the material isn't the most engaging, either.",
    "If you're taking this, you are probably a junior bme and this is required. It's a fine class, not too exciting, not too much work, not too difficult. It's a nice overview of signals and system, so if you're into that you'll probably enjoy it more thanI did. There were 9 problem sets (about 1 each week), one midterm, and one (basically non-cumulative) final. Duncan is great and Staib is fine just a bit boring at times. Overall, it's a decent class.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is taught by great professors, however, the material is not very interesting.",
    "Good engineering course. The material is not particularly stimulating but is quite important for BME. Duncan and Staib are better lecturers that many other science professors- they stick closely to the book and explain everything slowly and clearly (though lecture was usually pretty dry). They're also really sweet professors who genuinely want everyone to do well, so tests and homework assignments are not difficult. Overall this was one of my better experiences in the major.",
    "This is a really good core course that is both interesting and manageable, even for non-imaging tracks. The professors are both very good at what they do, and cover the material thoroughly and at a reasonable pace. Problem sets and exams are fair, and the expectations for both are made very clear. I wasn't expecting much going into the course because it was just another required core course, but it turned out that I found a lot of the material (especially the imaging stuff, and a lot of the material at the end when you get into applications) to be really cool because it is so applicable to current technology, both medical and non-medical. It will provide you with a lot of good mathematical tools that you'll use in future classes (or may have already used in previous ones, but never really learned). While the lectures are not always the most thrillingof lectures, you'll appreciate at the end how thorough and empathetic the professors are, and how much they care about individual students. They sent out individual emails after the final with the grade breakdown of the final and a summary of your performance throughout the term, which really emphasized how much effort they put into making this a worthwhile core course.",
    "Great class overall, major concepts were clear and I walked away from the class having a clear idea of what I learned and its applications. The lectures can be a bit dry at times but very interesting for the most part. Duncan is a great professor who really cares about his students learning and goes out of his way to make sure.",
    "This class was not as frustrating as BENG 351 Biotransport and Kinetics because the TA and the professors were able to explain the concepts more readily. If you work hard, take the time to understand the homework, and attend class (even though it may seem dry at times), you'll do well. Overall, I felt like I learned some really cool concepts.",
    "This course is a lot better than 351, in my opinion. It is a bit challenging, but not too too difficult and the professors present the information super clearly- you can tell they really want you to do well. I was a huge fan of this course!",
    "I would recommend",
    "Not too hard."
