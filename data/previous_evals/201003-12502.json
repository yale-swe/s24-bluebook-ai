   "comments": [
    "It's an okay class, not spectacular.",
    "If you are interested in the subject matter definitely take this class. There are four papers and the topics are really flexible. He does pick on style though, so to get an A you would definitely need to adjust to the style he likes.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're looking for an easy class. Don't expect to be particularly inspired.",
    "Only take this class if you are sure it is something you are interested in. It is very linguistically and anthropologically technical, and does not relate to culture and identity as much as I thought it would. As a freshman, I was a little over my head in a class full of anthropology majors, and while I got good grades in the class it was not something I appreciated taking. As far as the workload goes, it is pretty light, and it isn't necessary to go to every lecture or discussion section, but I would seriously only take this class after having taken several other more general anthro courses and officially declared an anthropology major AFTER trying out the subject. Because I have decided not to be an anthropology major, I feel a little that I wasted a semester on a very technical course, and I don't think I gained much from it. That said, the final paper topic is open so at least that was a chance to get what I wanted regarding culture and identity from the course.",
    "I would recommend this class for another student who hasn't taken that many linguistics classes. It's not too much work because most people don't do all the readings (which can make for kind of painful sections) but the essays are interesting because you can pretty much write whatever you are interested in. And the things you learn in this class are really applicable to how you interact with others in society.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in linguistics and anthropology. The readings were pretty interesting and the workload overall was fairly light compared to other classes. I would definitely give it a try.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The class was well structured and quite stress-free. It was arranged into four or five distinct units - the lectures and readings all focused on the same theme. After the unit was completed in class, you had one week to turn in a short paper of 3-5 pages. These papers were gradely pretty strictly and most people didn't get As (more like B+s and A-s) but at least they weren't stressful to write. As long as you had done the reading and paid attention in lecture, you could write a meaningful paper. The readings and the lectures (which pretty much summarized and expounded upon the ideas in the readings) were SO interesting! This was my definitely my favorite class of the semester, and I would take another class with Professor Errington again in a heartbeat! If you aren't concerned about getting straight As on your papers, take this class! You will not regret it.",
    "Sure if you want to learn about a subject that will really help you learn more about the meaning behind the ways we communicate with others.",
    "This is a class about Language, culture, and identity. It isn't a linguistics class, but it does provide some interesting perspective on language. Mostly, it is a great fifth class. There are only 4 short papers throughout the semester, so I would stress out about the class for just a couple of days at a time, rather than for the entirety of the semester. Also, it's a good way to get to hear about facets of language you don't usually get from other linguistics classes. The readings aren't bad, and, since you can choose your topic, they're pretty optional.",
    "I was lost and bored from start to finish. Seemed easy enough to get B's on the papers but I don't know what I would have done to get an A, siince it is difficult to come up with solid ideas in a class that lacks direction. I didnt mind particularly since I took it Credit D but i found the material boring and stopped going to class. Prof. Errington is very nice but lectures didnt have much spark.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student because the material is really interesting. I think that everyone who takes it will end up examining his own use of language in different situations.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it. It's the ideal class: fascinating and thought-provoking, yet little work. It's a class that makes you think about language, its place in culture, and how it affects your life.",
    "An objective look at language, and the various ways people confuse it with different aspects of culture and identity. I would not recommend ANTH 120 itself, although it did leave me with a greater desire to pursue anthropology courses. The reason I would not recommend it is because throughout all of the reading and lectures you are never going to be aware of what exactly you should be learning - the older, more biased perspective that people had regarding learning, or the newer viewpoint which could be just as incorrect? Perhaps Professor Errington was right not to show an obvious bias towards one interpretation, but I ended up confused.",
    "Not recommended.",
    "This is a good course in linguistic anthropology. The class is well taught but also requires a significant amount of reading. However, the papers are fairly short and manageable.",
    "It is a good introduction to what anthro is as a subject. While the subject matter is specific, I found that I could relate the concepts to my other classes. This is a really good course to take.",
    "yes I would. Great class - really interesting material - but it's definitely a take what you get out of the class. If you're looking for an easy A, redirect your interest becasue you may findthis to be a long semester. However, if you're actually interested in the material, definitely take it. I read almost all the readings except towards the end, attended 85% of the lecturers, and put a lot of effort into the papers, not for the grades sake, but to actually udnerstand the class. And now I feel that I can better understand why people talk the way they do in certain situations. Like I feel that I will be using what I learned in this class way past the class alone. It will give you a new understanding of how to look at language and speech patterns.",
    "Interesting class with cool readings about language and how it shapes the way people interact. Gets boring in the middle, but not too hard.",
    "I would recommend it",
    "Class has a light workload (three 3-5 pages papers and one final 5-7 page paper). Parts are kind of interesting, parts can be dull.I have a generally neutral take on this class. I learned a bit, but was bored a bit. It is pretty easy and the professor\/TA present everything you need to know. You are not expected to do any form of critical analysis. I would neither recommend it or not recommend it. I don't really have any feelings toward this class. It was fine.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. Interesting material, light work load, and easy to get a good grade without substantial effort. The only downside is that lecture is 3 times a week.",
    "If you've taken other linguisitics or advanced anthropology courses, don't bother.",
    "It's a fairly easy class with a pretty easy workload (3 small papers and 1 final paper) and it covers interesting material.",
    "A good lecture course, especially for those not familiar with linguistic theory. If you keep up with the readings it's definitely worth it.",
    "Yes! Do it!!"
