   "comments": [
    "I would finitely recommend it because it is a good class",
    "Probably only worth it if you're planning to be an economics major. The class is mostly theory has does little real-world applications.",
    "If you have already taken econ before, this is a good review and you'll learn some topics a bit more deeply and gain a better understanding. If you haven't, that's fine as well, just make sure you are proactive at the beginning of the course to understand the fundamentals.",
    "I would recommend. Just take it it's not that hard at all.",
    "If you took econ in high school, it's boring. The problem is that many people, myself included, already had learned the majority of the concepts taught in this course, but couldn't place out because of math.",
    "Don't take this class if you don't need to. Berry's lectures are very unstructured and hard to follow, and content is honestly quite dry.",
    "Definitely take this class even if you're only slightly interested in economics; it's great for helping you decide if it's a path that you would want to pursue. I would even suggest taking it if you have already taken AP Micro; I know some students who have taken AP Micro or a simial course before have said that it got repetitive at some parts, but that new information was introduced towards the second half of the course.",
    "Intro econ course -- second half of the course is a lot more fun. Professor Berry is superb.",
    "I'd recommend it to students to have a basic understanding of econ.",
    "Top 20% get As, next 10% gets A-, and a vast plurality of the class gets some form of a B; so I wouldn't freak out about grades. You're probably going to need to take this because it's a pre-requisite. If you're very interesting in Econ, try to get in the seminar. The lecture is easier, but also more boring and you'll learn more in an environment that isn't filled with sleeping people in a dark auditorium.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student because it is a great way to see how the economy works. Also, it fulfills a req which is good.",
    "Problem sets predict how actual tests look like. The math is really easy and with the help of the TA you can tackle the harder topics. As long as you understand the basic concepts in the beginning of the semester the class will go fairly smoothly.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who needs to take Intro Micro but only if they really like economics. The Seminar might be a little better. This was a long semester with this class. I didn't enjoy the class but others didn't mind it as much as I thought it was a pain and a struggle.",
    "If you're looking to go into economics, it might be a good class for you as it gives a sort of groundwork. Otherwise, it's a relatively easy, but not especially interesting class.",
    "It is a great course for the subject it teaches.",
    "I would, but expect to understand yourself; lectures are not enough for understanding the material.",
    "A class in which you learn the basic foundations of what economics means and learn some cool math. Yes I would.",
    "If you haven't had any kind of economic background (which I hadn't), this class will be hard. You'll have to do a lot of work outside of what's recommended if you want to understand anything. ACDC Leadership makes some killer videos for both micro and macro. If you don't know any econ, I recommend those videos as a complement if you take this course.",
    "This is an intro econ course. You will probably use it to fulfill a distribution requirement or as a prereq for a major. Psets aren't too bad and if you study neither are the tests.",
    "This is your basic microeconomics class. From what I understand, the large lecture can be a bit easier than the seminar class. The only work required is a weekly problem set, two midterms, and a final. That being said, it can be tempting to not go to lecture or section. If you haven't taken economics before, doing the textbook readings in the syllabus is a necessity. Otherwise, the course is relatively straightforward. The problem sets can be difficult, but any TA will be more than willing to help you, as will the professor. If you can take this class with Professor Berry, definitely do. He's inspirational, charismatic, and very knowledgable on the subject.",
    "This class is a prerequisite for a lot of majors, so you might have to take it, but I would taking it if it is not required. The class is fine, but in the end, I do not feel like I got any more out of it than if I had read an economics textbook. I would have rather taken a different class that was more challenging, but would have taught me better skills as well. The math in the course of elementary, so if you have any experience with calculus or higher math, I would consider going straight to intermediate microeconomics, because the actual economics concepts are not hard, and the math will be more fulfilling. Professor Barry was a fine instructor, and probably one of the better introductory economics instructors, but he was not special. My best advice, if you do take this class, is to find a really great TF, even if you are not assigned one, because some of them are amazing and you will get a lot out of going to one of their sections. The class is also very little work; the weekly problem sets do not take more than a couple of hours. Maybe take this class if you want to learn the basics of economics without much rigor; if not, look for a better class.",
    "It is a solid introduction to microeconomics. It mostly focuses on its concepts rather its applications in the \"real world\" (though the course briefly touches upon welfare, taxes, and pollution), but it appears to be a good foundation for intermediate microeconomics. I would recommend this course, but I would warn that it will take a lot of additional studying and practice outside of class, especially if he or she hasn't taken an economics course before.",
    "If you are considering majoring in econ, you will obviously need to take it. If not, you probably won't find it that interesting unless you like math.",
    "I recommend this class to those who wish to major in Economics.",
    "Definitely one of the most boring classes I've taken. Definitely would recommend this to anyone who needs to catch up on some sleep during lectures. At least until your lecture attendance drops significantly after the first few weeks and you can just sleep in your dorm! Econ is not a boring subject itself but everything in this class is theoretical, so you are constantly dealing with unrealistic situations and what fun is that.",
    "All-around a good class. Professor Berry was great at explaining the concepts and always reviewed past concepts (sometimes in excess of what was needed). Concepts were a great introduction to Micro leaving me a strong interest to take more economics. From the perspective of someone who is interested in this class as a good way to become a more informed citizen, the concepts covered by Professor Berry were great. Main additional topics past the basics included a heavy focus on market failure and correction, public goods, voting economics, and political economics. In my personal opinion, while I know there is a lot of hype about the seminar intro classes, this class did a better job at preparing me to be a global citizen (as compared to my sense of the seminar from many friends in the class). Workload was extremely easy for someone with any inclination towards math at all. P-sets took an average of one hour per week. Tests were generally fair with some iffy grading by TFs, though there was the issue with the complete loss of my midterm. One note, this is coming from someone who took AP Macroeconomics and thought it was easy. Also, for all those who have experience with macro, be assured that by far the majority of this class will be new material. Grading: very fair; Workload: low; Knowledge: good widespread exposure to important concepts. -He who shall not be named",
    "ECON 115 is a good enough course if you plan on taking further Econ classes, need Micro for a major requirement (Global Affairs...), or if you're weird and just want to learn Econ. The seminar is probably better if you actually need to understand the material for later classes like intermediate Micro, but the curve for 115 is much more generous. That being said, don't expect to get an A just because the curve is more generous. None of my friends got A's. Some got C's. However, if you're naturally gifted at math and aren't too lazy to read the textbook (the textbook was the the only way I understand anything), then it shouldn't be too bad and you may do well. Absolutely do not take if you think it'll be an easy QR credit. It is not easy. If you don't like math, take something else to get the QR credit (like fractal geometry). If they teach it the YUAG auditorium again, abort mission. Yo ass will fall asleep, no matter what. There aren't even desks so you have to write on your lap, which sounds like a bitchy complaint but it's actually really annoying. Also, Steven Berry kind of sucks.",
    "It's a big lecture class on economics. Nothing really special about the curriculum as far as I can tell, but I found it interesting. I'd recommend it. There is some math but no calculus and it's mostly theory.",
    "Take it. However, if you have the time and are truly interested in Econ, take the seminar.",
    "I would recommend Econ 115 to another student. To me it was very helpful learning economics for the first time in a large lecture format. Even for people not interested in majoring in economics it was a fantastic course that I can see a lot of real life application for.",
    "Your typical intro-level econ class. Take this class if you want a basic exposure to economics.",
    "Berry is a great lecturer. The material isn't always the most interesting, but he covers every topic the best he can and makes lecturers as entertaining as possible. Tests are fair and problem sets are of appropriate difficulty. As good as a 400+ person lecture can be. Take ECON 115 with Berry. Go to lecture though, as all the psets and tests are based off class. I never bought the textbook and it wasn't a problem.",
    "If you are interested in Econ, take it.",
    "It is a good course, but it is not as easy as it may appear. I would recommend people to try and get into the seminars.",
    "It is a fine class. I imagine most people take it because they have to. I would not take it just for fun, but it is not a terrible QR and has its interesting moments. Berry is a good professor, and, overall, the class has pretty interesting subject matter.",
    "A good introductory economics course to take if you think you may be interested in the field. Not exactly the most exciting class ever, but Professor Berry does a good job of keeping things interesting. The workload isn't killer, and they're quite fair about grading.",
    "Definitely a class you want to start with if you are thinking about majoring in Econ, even if you have already taken Econ during high school.",
    "It was an interesting class and would definitely recommend it, econ major or not.",
    "An important class to take if you're interested in Econ but have never taken an Econ class before. It's true that the curve is easy, so don't worry about doing well. Some people didn't like the class, but most people (including me) loved it and thought the material was really interesting. This class and Professor Berry made me want to take more Econ courses.",
    "Very boring and pretty hard at the start of the course. But it does get better, both in terms of interest level and your understanding of the material. Its also pretty important if you want to do social sciences, in ways that you don't really realize until after you've finished the course.",
    "Good course for learning basic Economics and getting a QR in. Honestly, I would so much rather take this than some math class if all I wanted was a QR out of it--you learn a lot about how the world works. I went to every lecture, didn't buy the book, my grade should be just fine. The curve is very helpful.",
    "I think it's important to take microeconomics, and this is a good base to see if you like it or not.",
    "It was an overview of concepts in microeconomics that I felt provided me with a basic knowledge of production and consumption behavior. It was much more theory-based than focused on real-world behavior or applications. I didn't think it was too difficult, but if you don't understand something, many of the topics are not isolated, so it could become a problem if you don't take the initiative to go to office hours and figure it out.",
    "ECON115 is a huge, survey lecture and as such, it's not particularly inspiring. Professor Berry is an entertaining enough lecturer, but the nature of the introductory material isn't especially palatable for students not interested in economics. Some students found section very helpful, while others found it a waste of time and opted not to go - it varies depending on teaching fellow. It's easy to put very little time into work for this class - the psets are manageable enough - but as a result, I found it very difficult to hold myself accountable for actually learning the material we went over in class, until exam time, when I frantically crammed. That said, the grade curve is very generous, and so students shouldn't avoid this class purely because they don't want a poor grade on their transcript. I would recommend this course only to students who think they might want to pursue economics at a higher level, or are trying to fulfill a QR credit or prerequisite.",
    "I would recommend ECON 115 to students who wish to learn economics. I would advise to be prepared to teach yourself a lot of the material, as I often found myself doing.",
    "I would definitely recommend ECON 115 to any student interested in economics or wanting to fulfill a QR requirement or thinking about it instead of the seminar. I shopped ECON 110 and although it was an intimate setting ECON 115 was a lot more engaging and had a more generous curve considering the size of the class. It is also better to work with classmates to study and prepare for exams.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would not recommend ECON 115 to another student if they are someone who is interested in truly immersing himself in the topic. For this individual, I would recommend ECON 110.",
    "I would only recommend this course if someone is interested in pursuing economics or a related field, not if he\/she is just curious and looking for another interesting class.",
    "This is a challenging economics class that requires you to pay attention in lecture and go to section. If you want to have success in this class, you need to apply yourself and spend time looking over material and working through problem sets.",
    "Though it is useful for everyone to take an intro Econ class, in my opinion, you should have a penchant for Econ if you take this class. I would recommend it to other students only if they do enjoy Econ, because otherwise they will most likely not enjoy the class.",
    "Basic economics course. Reasonable workload, but make sure you stay on top of the concepts before the exam.",
    "An easy and interesting class. Worth taking.",
    "Yes, especially as a intro class",
    "Take it if you have to, its not great but not awful. The end of the course, where you start to apply all the theoretical graphs you've learned to actual policy, is actually pretty interesting. I never went to section, or used the textbook, although perhaps I should have as I often struggled to stay awake in class. Professor Berry is a nice guy, and occasionally very funny, but the material he was teaching could be incredibly dry.",
    "Not difficult; standard introductory economics class. Could be more challenging but at least gives a good foundation in many concepts. Useful as a prerequisite or if you think you should just know more about this subject. it is definitely useful knowledge.",
    "Although some of the material may seem to be unfeasible in real-world situations, I believe it is still important to take Econ 115 to gain a fundamental understanding of how the markets, taxes, supply, and demand work. The lecture is huge, but there is a decent curve, which makes this class excellent for someone who has had no previous econ experience whatsoever. The workload isn't that bad, and you end up with a much better view on perfectly competitive markets and monopolies, etc. Professor Berry is a very lively lecturer, and often works to keep the students engaged during drier parts of the course. Overall, Professor Berry does a great job of explaining the material, though his handwriting could be neater at times. The lecture is so large that it's often helpful to attend section, so TAs are the main source of contact when you need help, rather than Professor Berry.",
    "Exactly what you'd expect from an intro micro course. Fair grading, great lectures, and decent sections to help you understand everything. The lack of calculus, though some people may like it, takes away a lot from the understanding of some concepts, but those who have learned calculus can also take the time to extrapolate if they want to really understand things.",
    "For a 400 person class, Intro Micro does a great job. Professor Berry is an excellent lecturer, and class was enjoyable. Section is not very helpful, but most of the TAs are willing to explain something if you ask.",
    "The unfortunate thing is, Econ is a prereq for so many courses, so you will probably have to take it. However, if you do not need to take it, then simply don't. The class is both boring and challenging and I would not recommend it to anyone who does not have to take it.",
    "Yes. I'm glad I took this class as I feel it gave me some fundamental knowledge with regard to microeconomics.",
    "Econ 115 is not as bad as you think. Go to lecture, take notes, study, and you'll be fine. Prof. Berry is actually pretty entertaining, although and hour and fifteen minutes gets long really quickly.",
    "Yes, take it. A requirement for a variety of majors and not at all difficult, but also incredibly useful as a series of concepts to think about in your daily life. I think more people should have to take intro micro, actually, as you learn things that will be useful no matter what you major in or what your career is. Berry is fantastic, so take it with him if you can.",
    "Econ 115 is a prerequisite for many other classes, and for that reason cannot be avoided. It may seem difficult to relate to real life at times, but as the semester goes on the information becomes more useful. It is annoying not to be able to use calculus because bridging economics and calculus would make concepts simpler to understand. Still, it is a worthwhile class for all majors.",
    "A good introduction to micro. Berry is engaging and keeps the lectures interesting. The exams are fair and there is a great curve (20% A, 20% A-). You should definitely take micro before graduating from Yale.",
    "It's a good intro class: not too hard, not too much work, but still gives you a good basis of economic concepts. Sections are worth it and help a lot with completing psets and going to lectures help a lot as well. You really don't need the textbook.",
    "I would recommend ECON 115 01 to students who are interested in majoring in econ. Other than that, there are more interesting and easier QR and Social Science courses.",
    "Not a particularly thought-provoking class but good to have the background on micro. Take it regardless of your major.",
    "Take the lecture over the seminar unless you are an economic genius",
    "A tri-weekly large lecture. Weekly problem sets. Two midterms and a final.",
    "A course good for students who might not take econ again, but lacking for those who want to go to a higher level.",
    "Take it if you're an Econ major and don't want to skip up to the next level. It's not really a fascinating course (it's basic microeconomics) but you'll learn what you need to in there. One advantage to taking it over 115 is that it's curved much more nicely, and you'll probably learn the same stuff in both classes.",
    "The class is mainly just the readings and the lectures with a weekly problem set. The tests are rather short and require the problem solving skills presented in class. You definitely need to grasp the concepts to do well.",
    "I would recommend Econ 115 to another student. It is very intellectually stretching, especially if you have no prior experience in economics or other classes that involve the same type of thinking. It does not come naturally to everyone, but is a manageable course.",
    "Great lecture course. Easy to catch up if you fall behind but stimulating nonetheless by lecture standards.",
    "Professor Berry clearly takes economics seriously, and he brings that passion to his lectures. But, the curriculum needs to be seriously reimagined before I would recommend the course. It serves as a basic review of common economic equations that lacked pertinent reflections on world markets economics that would inform students perspective on the world. I would urge the economics department to reimagine its introductory course work; it should not be just a required step before reaching interesting economics classes but rather an exciting introduction to the field. Perhaps this is possible if the introduction was taught through a thematic lens.",
    "There are 500 of you who will take this course, so who knows if you'll even be reading this, but I'd recommend the course. If you're a STEM major, you'll be frustrated by the lack of math, and if you're humanities you may find yourself overwhelmed. This class aims for the middle and ends up hurting everyone. It's still a good course, and I did learn a lot, but just be careful. This is not an easy class.",
    "Take this course! If you have even the slightest desire of going into anything that remotely relates to economics, ECON 115 is the class for you. Some of the material was a little dry in my opinion, but you will leave the class feeling like you have a better understanding of the basic concepts underlying microeconomics.",
    "I would not recommend it for another student unless they were certain in majoring in economics.",
    "ECON 115 01 is a good class and provides a good basis for understanding microeconomics. However, if you are not a very mathematically minded student, you may need more help than you expect with the course material. I felt that, in general, the workload of the course was greater than its online evaluations indicated.",
    "I would not reccomend this course because I felt the sheer size detracted from a deeper understanding of the material.",
    "Econ 115 is an excellent introductory course to the study of microeconomics. Because it is a large lecture course, the material is covered quickly making it important to attend sections and keep on top of the material. I would definitely recommend this course to all who are interested in learning the basics of economics.",
    "You have to take this class if you have any interest in studying economics\/finance. If you're like me and are just looking for a good QR, this is a solid class to take. It's definitely not a gut (there are easier classes if you just need a QR) but the material isn't overwhelmingly difficult if you stay on top of it. Also, the quantitative work isn't too intimidating so if you're not super confident with numbers, this class is still very manageable. The exams are all fair so if you study and sleep, you should be fine. I also think the material is really useful and important to be familiar with, even if you don't plan on studying economics further. I found myself thinking about opportunity costs, diminishing marginal returns, etc. quite frequently throughout my daily life once I became familiar with those concepts...",
    "I would say it is a fair class, especially if one is ready to review material at least every other day to stay on top of it all",
    "This is a good course for learning the basics of Microeconomics, it's broad and not really rooted in reality, but still a good course.",
    "take it, because intro economics is essential to your education no matter what field you pursue. And as far as intro economics courses go this is one of the easiest yet most rewarding options.",
    "Econ 115 was a well organized, structured course that taught me the fundamentals of microeconomics. I feel thoroughly prepared for Econ 116. I would recommend taking this class to anyone who is exploring the field of economics or who is simply curious. It is an interesting and worthwhile course regardless of whether or not it is taken as a prerequisite for higher level economics courses.",
    "Yes. If you want an introduction to producer and consumer behavior in different markets - perfect competition, monopoly, and oligopoly - take it. The workload is very manageable, and though it helps to have some prior econ experience, it is wholly unnecessary, as the course assumes nothing more than basic algebra skills and common sense.",
    "I would recommend the course.",
    "I had never taken an Econ class before ECON 115. Steven Berry is good at explaining concepts, but during the lecture you have no idea how the concepts relate to anything. I struggled in the beginning and my TA was not very helpful. It was only about midway through the semester I decided to go to another TA's section because my friend was in it. This TA was very good at explaining things and he probably taught me more in sections than Steven Berry did in lectures. What I did was I went to both my friend's section and my section. Sure it took up 50 more min. out of my week, but I felt on top of the material after I started going to multiple sections a week. The TAs didn't even care that I was in their section, they were extremely chill about it. Also, trust me when I say DO NOT READ THE TEXTBOOK. Only use the textbook for definitions and for example problems. Look at the Figures in each chapter and read them, the graphs and explanations will be helpful. The midterms are easy, but the only way to do well on them is to study from previous midterms and psets that will be available to you.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. It's a serious pain. The strengths of this course are in Prof. Berry's lectures. He is a very dynamic, entertaining lecturer who is good at explaining the material. However, he does tend to rush through the first time he teaches a topic but then goes back to review them in more detail later. The sections were also well designed and helpful. Its fatal flaw is in the seemingly inevitable quality that everyone's grade depends on everyone else and therefore those who've had preexposure to economics will always do better. That said, if you're looking for a QR credit, this is definitely a fascinating one and one that I am better for having taken, at a probable big expense to my grades. I'd recommend auditing it if you don't need the QR nor the pain.",
    "Introductory Micro is a solid course in microeconomics. The material can be difficult and complicated at times but it makes sense once time is put into figuring it out. Professor Berry is a good lecturer, but not amazing. The worst part about the class was that it was in the art gallery. Hopefully it won't be in there next semester, because the combination of poor lighting, no desks, and occasional lack of a microphone really made the lecture less enjoyable. Nonetheless, if you want a rigorous introduction to economics, this was a good course.",
    "Interesting intro class. I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in economics, however not to those who need to asks questions. If you can learn a math course from note taking, definitely take this one, but be ready to go in the book and teach yourself some things also",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who is interested in economics. If you like writing papers and thinking in an abstract way, this class probably isn't for you. If you like learning concepts and applying them with math, this is a great class",
    "Definitely take it, even if you've taken AP Micro in high school. Not hard, and you'll get a lot out of it. Knowing some calc will put you at an advantage.",
    "ECON 115 is an introduction to the basic facets of microeconomics, with some more complex material added in toward the end of the term. I would highly recommend it for anyone with any interest in economics, because the math required is fairly simple and the concepts are, in general, not terribly complex.",
    "A pretty good intro to micro",
    "ECON 115 is a good introduction to microeconomics. Take it!",
    "It is a difficult class if you have no prior economics experience, but if you can truly do and understand the problem sets through focused learning in lectures and on your own then it is manageable.",
    "This course was informative and very enjoyable. I absolutely recommend this course to my fellow students!",
    "Good introductory course into economics.",
    "A straightforward introduction to microeconomics from a great professor. I took this course as a sophomore, not expecting much, but ended up loving it (and am now thinking about being an econ major). Professor Berry takes graphs and econ terms and makes them applicable to today in a way that is interesting and fun. I had a great TA, though I did shop around a bit at first. If you are interested in how the world works (really, I think it's that broad) you should take this course. Everyone should take this course.",
    "It's a great class to take and I would strongly recommend it to any student.",
    "Good intro course.",
    "It's what you'd expect from an intro class: huge, impersonal, and a ton of kids are on their phones the whole time. Berry makes it pretty easy for those who care to follow along and learn a lot. Getting a solid A is kind of hard but getting a decent grade (B and up) is easy.",
    "I would recommend this class as a simple and straightforward way to learn some basic economic concepts which will likely come in handy later in life. I think this course is a must-take for Yale students.",
    "Not the most fun course I have taken at Yale, but I would recommend for a good beginners introduction to an interesting topic.",
    "Econ 115 provides a solid basis for understanding microeconomics. I would absolutely recommend it to a fellow student because the professor is excellent and the material is applicable to many fields.",
    "Econ 115 takes introductory microecon courses and goes in depth, applying them to real world situations and examples. I would recommend the course even to students not majoring in economics solely because it is a good basis for understanding human decision making in the real world.",
    "Only if you plan on majoring in econ.",
    "Yes I recommend this class. Berry isn't terrible and the material is interesting and good to know.",
    "It's ok if you have to take econ, or want a solid intro level understanding of econ.",
    "I would recommend Econ 115 to another student. The course is a great introduction to microeconomics, and I felt that I learned a lot about the way firms and individuals operate in markets. I feel that I will be able to use the knowledge from this class as a foundation for future classes or majors I choose to pursue.",
    "A mostly conceptual introduction to microeconomics. I",
    "Boring and pedantic but not too much work and a good intro.",
    "It is a good intro to micro economics.",
    "It will give you a good basis to the rest of economic material. I would recommend the course even to non-economic majors.",
    "Recommend it for anyone interested in economics!",
    "I would recommend the course. It is challenging and requires extra time put in to make sure you stay on top of the material, but you learn a lot, coming from someone with no econ background.",
    "I would say that it is a course that makes you think, learn a lot of new things, and is very enjoyable. I would highly recommend it to a peer.",
    "I took Econ 115 because I felt it necessary to leave college with some background in economics, just as a matter of common sense. I think Econ 115 is a fine introduction to economics. Definitely not a life-changing course or even one of my favorites this semester, but to know these terms and to be able to speak the language will most likely be very helpful in the long run.",
    "Yes, definitely take it, even if you aren't using it towards your major. Its a good class and teaches you important things.",
    "It is an effective class that was challenging and interesting.",
    "Good challenge",
    "I would definitely recommend taking Econ 115 if you are looking for a standard intro course and prefer big lectures to seminars.",
    "Worth taking if you are at all interested in how the economy works. I would recommend doing the reading, as it made lectures a lot more clear to me.",
    "I feel like most people take it as a requirement. But if you didn't have to, I would still take it because it gives a basic economic overview of important social topics such as welfare, taxation, and pollution.",
    "Big intro class",
    "Dry at points but overall a solid foundation to micro economics",
    "It's fun but make sure you stay on top of things.",
    "Take the course! The concepts you will learn are extremely important.",
    "I would recommend it only if they had to take an economics course.",
    "As someone who has never taken an economics class, I feel as though the course provided a solid introduction in to the field. I am intrigued and wish to take more economics classes in the future, so yes I would recommend it to a friend. (Unless they are looking for a smaller class size in which case I would avoid this lecture).",
    "A good introduction to microeconomics and an excellent way to start covering material for those interested in the major or simply looking for a basic understanding of economics principles.",
    "It's basic microeconomics and you should probably take it.",
    "It is an essential and excellent introduction for any student who wishes to learn more about or major in economics.",
    "Prof Berry made the class interesting with good lectures. Im glad I learned the basics of economics. The course is deceptively easy, don't slack off or midterms will be a tough wakeup call",
    "If you are possibly interested in econ, take this class, but don't be scared by the abstractness of some topics. Professor Berry and my TA, Matt Hom, really help you grasp each topic. Do the problem sets and try to understand them, rather than just memorizing each answer by looking at past problem sets. The midterms and final are very fair, and if you work to understand the concepts, you should do well in the class.",
    "Eh. A good start, but unfortunately it's not enough to really understand much of anything about econ, and it obviously suffers from being such a huge lecture.",
    "Fantastic class! Good overview of econ. My favorite class this semester",
    "Econ 115 is a good overview of microeconomics. It goes over all of the basic models, which are essential to further study of the topic. I would definitely recommend the class to another student. The material was very relevant and extremely interesting.",
    "In Econ 115, you will get the solid ground on what microeconomics is all about. It will challenge you, intrigue you, and challenge you. I would definitely recommend this course to any other student because of its relevance especially in today's dynamic world economy.",
    "Definitely! Unlike other intro classes that can often be a grind, intro micro was a fantastic class for Econ majors and non-econ majors alike. Taking micro was what convinced me to switch majors and study Econ--it was a great introduction to the course. And Berry is an incredibly engaging professor--take this class!",
    "I would say it's a very good intro class that sets you up with skills in a lot of areas.",
    "Yes, it's a good introductory and everyone should know the basics of the market they function in.",
    "The only true benefit of this course is its generous grading curve; Yale grade inflation really applies to this course. Take the lecture over the seminar; you will appreciate the lighter workload of just one short (usually 5 question) problem set a week. Two midterms and a final. Since it is only an intro course, don't expect to learn much; just study the problem sets and you will do fine on the midterms and final. My TA was John Calhoun, who is hands down one of the best I've ever had. If he is available, be sure to get into his discussion section. Professor Berry is not the greatest lecturer; most days are really dry and dull. However, I appreciate that he doesn't make us read the textbook; you could get an A with just the practice problem sets and lecture notes and a good TA. Decent course that many will be forced to take for their majors; I can't complain too much, there are much worse courses out there.",
    "I would not recommend this course if you do not have any familiarity with the subject matter. If that person needs to take the course than I would recommend getting a tutor right away because the more I was able to try and explain the topics out loud the greater my own understanding became.",
    "Economics 115 is a good introductory course which only requires very basic maths.",
    "Try to take Econ 110 instead.",
    "you probably have to take it",
    "Pretty boring, although you might need it for more interesting econ classes if that's where you're headed. Unless you want to do that, I wouldn't recommend it",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get a feeling of what economics is really about. I thought it was a very good course.",
    "A good introduction into economics in general. Not too much work and pretty clear. The midterms and final were like the Psets and previous tests online, so they weren't too bad. The Psets were also pretty short; at first really easy but later in the course they get harder but rarely bad. A QR with not very much or very difficult math. Towards the end the material felt rushed, but between the section and lectures it was fine. Overall a course I would recommend.",
    "Yes. All students at Yale College should be required to take Econ 115, it is so fundamental to almost any kind of thinking."
