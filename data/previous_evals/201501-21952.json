    "A really intellectually challenging class. I felt like I learned a lot, but not nearly as much as I could have, had I been more prepared in certain areas. The readings were incredibly dense, and I felt like they helped me grow as a reader. The grading was really difficult and stressful, but I think I deserved the grades that I received - it was nice to not be coddled and to be forced to really engage my writing. I think I learned a lot about precision of language and arguments, but less about other writing skills (like organization). We did less writing practice and workshopping than I would have hoped for, but apart from that, this was a great experience.",
    "If you like philosophy, I would recommend.",
    "Lots of work, but well worth it",
    "eh, you're probably taking it for a writing credit, it's okay, im sure there are better more interesting english classes though"
