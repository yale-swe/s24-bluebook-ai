    "Strengths: introduced me to many of the capabilities of solidworks Weaknesses: professor often got stuck on in class examples. If you didn't take meticulous notes for which steps to take during in class examples, it was often very difficult to replicate the processes on homework assignments. Also, for the two coding homework assignments, we were given little structure or direction and left to figure out a lot of it ourselves. Could be improved by giving us more detailed roadmaps of how to perform certain processes on the solidworks software."
