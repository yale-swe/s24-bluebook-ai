   "comments": [
    "A nice little seminar course. Professor Samuels does a good job selecting texts and explaining them. Discussions were well led.",
    "French 353 is a course that looks into the interplay between the French and the French Jewish community through literature, pamphlets, and articles. It is a lot of reading, but the class is very interesting (even for those who aren't Jewish) and rewarding. Prof. Samuels is a great teacher, his French is clear and easy to understand and he's very knowledgeable about the subject. Classes tend to follow the same pattern at every meeting (introduction to the homework and then an open discussion). I'd highly recommend this course.",
    "This is a great course for anyone interested in French culture, and particularly the treatment of minority groups in the Republic. There's a good balance of history and literature, though perhaps not enough background on religious practices. It's got a good amount of reading, but all is very relevant to the course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to take a French class that somehow relates to Judaism as well.",
    "Absolutely take it if the name appeals to you - it's one of the best. Professor Samuels makes the course fun and enjoyable because the atmosphere is relaxed, and you end up learning a lot about French Jews, diaspora Jewry, and major events in French history.",
    "I would recommend this course without hesitation."
