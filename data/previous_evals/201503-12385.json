    "The class was okay. Professor Magee didn't really know what he was doing, but I doubt he'll be teaching it again. It wasn't a lot of work (only 5 problem sets, each of which took about 10-15 hours to complete), but the material was fairly difficult and wasn't explained well.",
    "I think this class would've been worth it with a different instructor. The actual content is not very difficult, but I had to teach myself most of it from the book. Weighting of questions on exams seemed to be at random, and we were tested on very little of what we spent most of the class covering and extensively on things we barely talked about. I would recommend it, but not with Professor Magee.",
    "Math 246 (at least under Magee) is not very hard. I'm a physics major and took it so I could combine it with 247 (Partial Differential Equations) for a slow but in-depth differential equations track, and it was exactly as casual as I wanted, with only five problem sets and easy computation-based exams, but still with legitimate material. You can pull it off without buying a textbook which is nice.",
    "Do not take this course. Do not take this teacher. End of story. A wholly inadequate introduction to the topic. You will likely learn more from simply picking up the material as you need it throughout your career in other fields. A sad disappointment emanating from an otherwise good department. Lectures were unclear and disorganized. I probably should have decided to stop coming to lecture early in the semester, but I stuck it out hoping it would get better (also, I think being in lecture is the best way to determine exactly what will be on the test, so I would never skip anyway). It did not.",
    "Great course",
    "It was a pretty chill class (especially for math). I feel like I walked away with a good knowledge of ODEs. Michael Magee is a sweet guy but a bad teacher. Based on what I hear about ENAS 194, I am glad that I took this course, but it won't be on my list of all-time favorites.",
    "This has been my worst class at Yale. The material itself is boring: you learn a set of tools and how to apply them, very plug and chug. For all that this is advertised as the more mathematical version of DiffEq, I felt like we got no sense of the math underlying the processes we were applying. If you have a chance to take ENAS 194, strongly consider doing that instead (if you are interested in PDEs, it is not uncommon to do ENAS 194 and the Math 247 PDE, since ENAS 194 covers PDEs so quickly you wont understand them the first time around anyway). Magee is a terrible teacher. He was boring and bored. He was confusing, didnt really answer questions, spent a lot of class doing out BC Calc type problems, and hardly went into deeper math at all. The only good thing about this class as that we only had 5 problems sets and one midterm (mercifully little work). Even then, because we has so few problem sets I feel like Im quickly going to forget the entire class. Do not take if you can avoid it.",
    "Exactly what you'd expect, Magee is pretty dreadful (I don't say this lightly, although it was his first class) and didn't cover as much material as I'd have liked (made the class pretty easy though). I'd still recommend the class if you need diffeqs and want a low time commitment class in the schedule. If that's not an issue, you should probably take the ENAS class.",
    "It's a bad class about great material. Don't take it for the class, take it for the math if you can learn it yourself outside of lectures.",
    "My impression is that ODE is a difficult course to teach without it being dry across the board - and sadly, Yale's offering is no exception. Still ODE's are important so..."
