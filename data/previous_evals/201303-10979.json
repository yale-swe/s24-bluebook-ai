    "ENGL 125 covers Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Donne. There are readings for each class and students are required to write at least 10 blog posts throughout the semester about the readings. Each unit (or author) is linked to one paper, generally between 4-6 pages, though the final paper is longer. This class very much looks into the form of poetry and how each author achieves different things with it.",
    "ENGL 125 provides a strong grounding in some of the major canonical English poets, with a particular emphasis on developing close reading skills. If you already like this sort of thing, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be enthralled; but even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dreading the requirement, allow yourself to be surprised. This poetry is alternately wonderful, horrifying, bizarre, sexy, hilarious, and shocking, and you get to read it in a small seminar environment with a brilliant professor and detailed writing feedback. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to like? The class is probably best for English majors, but I would recommend it to anyone interested in thinking intensively and extensively about poetry. If you can, take it with Professor Glaser, who is incredibly smart, generous with his time, and a wonderful seminar leader.",
    "Pretty much a study of famous poetry",
    "English 125 - a prerequisite for the English major - is a great course that exposes you to important, classic poets: Caucer, Spencer, Shakespeare and Donne. I really enjoyed the poetry we read and our class discussions. Because it is a small group of poets, you get to go into each in depth, and compare and contrast among the four which is very interesting and valuable. I would recommend this class to another student who is considering or interested in the English major.",
    "A necessary and fairly interesting summary of early poets",
    "Honestly, I really disliked this class. I think your enjoyment of the class will depend on your professor.",
    "I would only take this class if you are genuinely interested in old English poetry or if you need to take 125 for the major. I was not a huge fan of the works we read, with the exception of Shakespeare and some Donne. The class was taught pretty well, and we did do some fun things in class such as recitations and acting out scenes. However, the grading was pretty harsh and a lot of the poems we read were pretty difficult.",
    "I would only recommend English 125 to someone becoming an English major. While the class will teach you to think and understand poetry in general, Spenser is simply too dense to expect anyone but a prospective major to maintain any level of enthusiasm.",
    "If you're an English major, you'll have to take it. But don't be like me, don't go into it grumbling about the English major's stubbornly anglophilic pre-reqs. This is a really good class, and is great for anyone who wants to learn more about the ways in which poetry works. Reading Spenser and Donne can be tough as nails, but ultimately it's really rewarding. ProfessorGlaser is great."
