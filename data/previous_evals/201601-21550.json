    "Really an incredible opportunity to go behind the scenes at the YUAG conservation department and get an up close, hands on experience of what it's like to technically examine a painting. Prof. McClure and his many colleagues are amazing and so open and willing to share their knowledge with students. There's a refreshing and unique mix of scientific analysis techniques and art history, but as an art history major (who knows nothing about science) I had no trouble keeping up and understanding everything. This course really opened my eyes to a whole other side to the field of art history!",
    "I recommend to anyone looking to pursue work that may be in a museum. Wonderful to meet so many people who works behind the scenes.",
    "Thrilling class. Best course I've taken so far: you get to really use the INCREDIBLE resources Yale has to offer, and I learned so much. Office hours were wandering around the gallery with the head conservator as he told you about paintings he'd worked on."
