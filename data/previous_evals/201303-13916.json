   "comments": [
    "YES! I was never an English person, but this was my favorite class. The reading is fun; it never felt like homework. It has definitely improved my writing and has made me think of writing in a different light. It's fun.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. I think it helped my writing a lot, and all the readings and discussions were very enjoyable.",
    "This course is a must take and if possible, get the section with Professor Sexton. The type of writing taught is very relevant to this time and day, and the readings are fun.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in a different kind of writing. This is less of the typical essay for a normal class and more realistic form of what one may writing for a publication. I really enjoyed how this class was set up and I really liked Professor Sexton, thoughI heard really good things about pretty much all of the others professors as well. Sometimes it is weird to try using techniques you see in famous works in your own work, but, despite the difficulty, I learned quite a bit and I think it is a really good class to take.",
    "English 120 17 is a great course for students who enjoy writing and for those who want to improve their writing skills. I definitely recommend it.",
    "English 120 is a great nonfiction writing course. The readings are interesting and not too long and you only have five writing assignments, which all have interesting topics. If you are an inexperienced writer, it might be better to take 114 first, but I didn't think 120 was overall very challenging.",
    "This was a challenging intro English class that focused on modern essays (such as those found in The New Yorker, etc.) as opposed to traditional literature essays. I would definitely recommend it to any student who is looking to improve their writing for whatever purpose.",
    "English 120 is a great class for anyone who enjoys writing and would like to experiment with different forms of it. Specifically, Professor Sexton is a really engaging teacher, and does a good job in assuring that the workshops, which can be intimidating, are always constructive. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Take this class! You'll end up a much better writer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to my peers! Even though you work on your essays almost every week, you get a hang of the process and before you know it you will get excited to prepare\/conduct research for them! Loved interviewing people for my essays and feeling like a journalist at times!"
