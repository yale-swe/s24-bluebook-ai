   "comments": [
    "It's ok. If you want to read Camus, go for it. The class structure is not the greatest if there is still a lecture and then \"sections\" half way through. I'd say take it only if that is all changed, because it made for a really disjointed class. It's not a lot of work, other than the readings. Discussions were kind of frustratingly low level.",
    "I would recommend this to a French, literature, or philosophy major. Know that taking a course focused only on one author is a very different experience from taking a more general lit. course.",
    "This is a fantastic syllabus, but be careful about the structure: as a hybrid English\/French lecture\/seminar, the lack of consistency and the bifurcated class grew frustrating at times. Overall though, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Strongly recommend if you have French; reading the books in translation just ins't the same as reading in the original.",
    "Yes! It's a lovely class and not stressful at all. Camus is so multifaceted - I would never have read so much of his work on my own, or understood it to the extend that I do now.",
    "Camus is my favorite French author, so this will probably be somewhat biased, but DEFINITELY take this class if you read The Stranger or any of his other works and liked them. You will truly feel like you understand Camus's oeuvre and the themes he takes up, and come to appreciate the different genres he writes in.",
    "Nearly impossible to get in, very relaxed, low workload (no papers), Camus is a great writer but it does get a bit boring talking about the same guy every week for a semester.",
    "I would absolutely recommend any course taught by Professor Kaplan. I do hope, however, there there will be enough demand to offer this course exclusively in French, as a seminar, in the future.",
    "YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm not a French or literature major and I'd only read one Camus novel before this class, but this ended up being my favorite class at Yale. Alice Kaplan is amazing and so knowledgeable, the workload is really reasonable, and you will WANT to do it. TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT!!",
    "The course is a lecture\/seminar on Camus, looking at his oeuvre from a historical and biographical standpoint. I would definitely recommend it, but would warn students to think first if they want to spend all semester with a single writer.",
    "The life and work of one of the greatest: Camus. Definitely take it if you are interested at all in French history, the intellectuals of Paris, or philosophy\/literature in general.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone with an interest in Camus. Even though you only read his works for the whole semester, the variety in genre within Camus's corpus makes it impossible to get tired of one author. The reading can get heavy for some weeks, but it's consistently interesting. There also no papers in the class, only two manageable exams.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student at Yale. If you love Camus, you will surly benefit a lot from the class; if you don't like Camus, well, you'll start to love him by the end of the class."
