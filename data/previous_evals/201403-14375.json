    "If you're interested in arranging for instruments and voices. professionally or otherwise, you should definitely check out this class. It's a real workshop class that hones a practical skill. You get a glimpse into how professional arrangers work in different settings (recording, cabaret, musical theater), but more importantly you just get to complete a bunch of specific arranging assignments and get feedback.",
    "Wow! A wild ride through the practicalities of arranging music for ensembles with vocalists. The class delved little into the specific challenges of writing\/arranging for voice (one assignment was for a cappella choir). We focused more on how to make an arrangement in general. Jeffs theme was always to simplify, to make more singable\/playable, to develop a single idea to its denouement. There were four arrangements assigned throughout the semester, with many classes devoted to workshopping by Jeff in front of peers. Work throughout the semester was frontloaded. Each class was hilarious, due to Jeffs insanely funny personality, and it included perks such as a field trip to NYC to hear him perform, a skype session with a professional music copyist, and a final performance where he hired literally the top people in New York to come in and play our arrangements. No clue what my grade will be, but Im not too worried.",
    "This isn't an a cappella arranging course. The assignments require you to arrange for voice, sometimes multiple voices, plus certain instruments, which are often left up to your own discretion. This was a useful lesson in orchestration as a composer. You learn a lot of important practical stuff about formatting and music prep. We had to go through many drafts of each assignment, which at times could be frustrating because it was easy to get sick of what you were working on. But that's the reality of this field. So the work was front-loaded with each assignment, and in the course in general. There was a lot of reading at the beginning and none after the first few weeks. I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "Take it take it! You get better at important little things you didn't know you were bad at.",
    "Definitely take this class if you get a chance to take it! Jeff Klitz is a hilarious person, fun teacher, and brilliant musician and this is a useful course for arrangers, musicians, orchestrators, composers, and songwriters alike. Strengths: -You'll walk away with a solid understanding of how to format your scores in a professional-looking way according to the Broadway industry standard. -Jeff is a fun, engaging, and brilliant teacher. He's a great person to know, both as someone to be a guide for your career goals and as an inspirational teacher who you can have a relationship with. -Just watching Jeff critique work and think musically at the piano or as he reacts to a score you hand him is enough to make the class worthwhile. He's incredibly brilliant, and the little (albeit unorganized and scattered) blips of advice you get from him are TREMENDOUSLY valuable. -the class trips and special guests are amazing--unparalleled experiences for an undergrad -The class is fun! Jeff makes the discussion atmosphere largely pleasant and respectful, and this makes a nice setting for learning. -Jeff really teaches you how to make an arrangement much simpler and more effective. His method of working on one piece for a number of weeks really teaches you how to work hard on one piece to polish it. -Jeff's life experience and career path is extremely valuable to learn about. He is so tremendously talented and brilliant and being around him makes the class worth anybody's time. *Note: -It's hard for me to isolate the course from Jeff's teaching--I think another teacher would create a completely different type of course. Weaknessess: -there is little to no structure to the course-->the assignments could be given in any order and it wouldn't really make a difference -Jeff is often inconsistent and unclear in his advice. One week he'll tell you he wants one thing, and the next week he might change his mind and want the opposite. This can be very frustrating because it's hard not to take his critiques personally as a student and hearing him criticize something and then praise it (or vice versa) and not knowing whether he's using the judgements to lower your grade or judge your abilities is stressful at times. However, this is probably just the nature of a class like this or just judging music in general. All the assignments can be seen as somewhat subjective, so it's hard to show that one answer is clearly the best to all the problems he gives you to deal with. This may just be the way working on arrangements in a class setting has to be, but I think there are probably ways to reduce the hurtful inconsistencies at least in Jeff's own teaching approach (e.g., acting like he doesn't care what you do and then being upset when you don't do exactly what he wants can obscure the learning process and upset students) -The class feels a little long...3 hours can be hard to sit through when only 30 minutes of the class seems to directly apply to your work (though of course watching Jeff in action can be very valuable on its own) I'm not sure the title of the course is appropriate. While all our assignments included arranging for voices in some fashion, the course was really just about arranging in general. At one point, Jeff threw in a \"quiz.\" I studied pretty hard for it, but it ended up not being graded and when we verbally talked about how we did, I felt he was unfairly judging us often. I think Jeff needs to lay out his expectations for the course more clearly at the beginning of the class. He puts forth a very laid back persona and seems to think of the course this way, which is fine, but then sometimes seemingly arbitrarily seems to raise the stakes and get upset. This is very confusing for students. This happened a lot especially at the beginning of the course (when there were all sorts of assignments and expectations that seemed to disappear later in the class...), but improved through the semester."
