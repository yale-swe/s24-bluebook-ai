   "comments": [
    "It's an incredible interesting class and it will tell you a different Japan. I will recommend this class to others.",
    "Great idea course. The readings are all very interesting, though a good background in medieval\/early modern Japanese history and historiography would greatly enhance the amount one gets out of the material.",
    "I would not hesitate to recommend History 886 01 to any student with serious interests in either Japan or maritime history. This course is not a repeat of readings found in other history seminars, and offers a fascinating and fresh perspective on a topic with growing appeal. Students with Japanese reading ability will be able to gain access to a much wider variety and depth of resources than others, but I don't think this is reason to avoid the course."

   "comments": [
    "This class taught me a lot about Japan. It broaden my horizon and provided many potential topics to me.",
    "Deepened knowledge of Japanese historiography and theoretical issues. Although not directly relevant, it gave me a broader framework within which to position my own research, as well as some fresh new ideas.",
    "This course was directly related to my dissertation interests, and I am certain that I will frequently refer to the syllabus, notes, and readings in the future. The seminar provided me with the perfect opportunity to explore the historiography of Japan from the sea (particularly its social history), and I've been able to generate a great deal of momentum in my research. I am extremely grateful that this course was offered."
