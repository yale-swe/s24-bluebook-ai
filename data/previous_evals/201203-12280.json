   "comments": [
    "Take it for the speakers! For the 2hrs they come to speak, they could be getting paid thousands elsewhere. Other aspects of the course leave something to be desired, but if you don't really care about grades too much, it's worth taking for the speakers.",
    "Worthy experience",
    "Awesome class. If you can get into it you are silly not taking it. Great guest talks with the likes of Seth Klarman.",
    "Amazing opportunity. 4\/5 short papers,a final paper, and some in class presentations. Take it if you can.",
    "This is a fantastic class that opened my eyes to the investing world and the in-depth thought and analysis that goes in behind it. Dean Takahashi and David Swensen bring to the table a tremendous amount of insight and it is always inspiring to hear the work they do with the endowment and with their managers.",
    "A course about investment management with a focus on endowments for half the class. The other half includes speakers from \"buy-side\" finance... hedge funds, real estate funds, VCs etc.",
    "Absolutely. A must take for anyone hoping to manage money one day",
    "Great class. Incredible class speakers. Gutted that it had to end and wasn't a full year long instead of a semester.",
    "Possibly the most important class ive taken at Yale. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone remotely interested.",
    "Take it only if you are interested in the discussions with the Investment Managers. They are star investors and for that reasons alone, it's worth taking the class. The rest of the class assignments and discussions are bearable, but far from great.",
    "I would recommend it, at the very least for the high-profile, memorable guest speakers. You learn a lot about endowment management and investing in various asset classes (hedge funds, venture capital, short investing, and real estate, to name a few). It is literally learning from the best, from Profs. Takahashi and Swensen and from some of the best investors in the world.",
    "Extremely enlightening if you have any interest in investments. Well worth the price of my Yale education",
    "If you can get in its easily the best econ seminar learn about investing from so many different angles"
