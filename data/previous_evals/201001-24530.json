    "A fine class. Because ER&M is only a second major, your senior essay schedule will probably be set by your other major. This class had very little structure (maybe too little), but it works out because you are still on track because of your other major.",
    "If you are interested in grad school, take this class. It's a great way to bond with the other majors and get to experience a cohort. I gained a lot of insight into my own project from listening to my cohort's projects. And, more than anything this was a support system for me.",
    "YESSSSS. Do ER&M!!! It's the most underrated yet rewarding major at Yale that deserves more attention. The strength of the program lies in its interdisciplinary nature and academic openness."
