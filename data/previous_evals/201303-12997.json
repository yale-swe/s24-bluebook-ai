    "I would recommend it to people who enjoy either engaging closely with particular objects or thinking through ideas and theories around them.For a student of history, however, the theoretical engagements of the course, along with the short period of time needed to write a successful paper, would have not allowed for in depth historical analysis.The course, however, can be very productive in generating new ways of engaging with objects and their movements across boundaries.",
    "HSAR 602 01 begins with a reading of Marcel Mauss's THE GIFT and its critics, then moves on to applications of gift theory in Byzantine, Medieval and Early Modern art historical studies.Yes, I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would consider it a course that offers a strong theoretical background with a sampling of various applications from many time periods and cultures. I would recommend History of Art to a student from almost any discipline, because I think this course has substantial disciplinary range.",
    "I would, especially to art historians because it provides a window into a different field (anthropology) which I found very useful for other projects, as well."

   "comments": [
    "By the end of the course, I wished scholars of the field engaged with the fundamentals of the course more in this field. We seem to be easily forgetting or ignoring the materiality of the objects we discuss.",
    "This course was a good introductionto gift theory, which has been employed by a variety of art history scholars.",
    "I felt that this course opened new possibilities for my research--both my existing research and possible new avenues for me to explore.",
    "As mentioned, the interdisciplinary approach was great for me, as this is something I wish to pursue. The flexibility of the final paper topic also allowed me to hear many different and new (to me) ideas, as well as getting a chance to pursue a new area."
