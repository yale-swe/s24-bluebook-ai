   "comments": [
    "Good Sc credit that applies to products you'll encounter in everyday life. The problem sets and the midterm should be taken seriously. Sections include interesting demos and activities, e.g. a tour of the MRI center. Prof. Saltzman really cares about his students.",
    "Great intro course. Be prepared to do some math though in addition to learning about concepts.",
    "Intro to Biomedical engineering, with problem sets. The problem sets were horrible, the book didn't cover anything that was necessary to know to complete the problem sets. I don't know if I would recommend it.",
    "It's really excellent. The homeworks are strangely hard in comparison to the class, but get a study partner and just do your best. It's a great intro to BME, and professor Saltzman is someone you do not want to miss out on! If you do the reading, watch the videos, and do the problem sets, it can seem like a lot of work, but you just have to figure out how to use your time (read and watch at the same time?). The paper and the midterm are the only other graded things, and they're not so bad. Just study. The labs and activities are so worth the class.",
    "I'd recommend it if you're looking for a science credit that isn't too gutty. It is a survey course, so I wouldn't recommend it for serious science students unless you're looking to get a taste of BME as a freshman.",
    "Great class. I very much enjoyed going to class every day. However, I feel like Prof. Saltzman's book isn't particularly that great because it's not that clear. Also, the homeworks didn't correspond to the lectures and were unclear and difficult.",
    "BENG 100 is a survey of the field of biomedical engineering. We talked about everything from drug delivery methods to tissue engineering. I would take this class just for the section and in class activities. The lectures can get tedious, but I am still glad I took the class. And professor Saltzman had Froyo World cater for our last class!!!",
    "I really liked this course. It gives a good background in biology to people who haven't had much exposure to the subject, and we learn about some cool things. Saltzman is an awesome professor who really cares about his students and even makes an effort to get to know each of them. The section for this class was actually super interesting. At each section we did a bio-type lab, and all of them were engaging and fun to do.",
    "BENG 100 is certainly not the hardest class at Yale, the subject material is interesting, and the professor is great. What's not to like?",
    "Watch and note take on the videos before class(50 min to 1 hr) Go to class(2x per week,50 min each) Go to section 1x per week( 50 min - 1 hr) Pset 1x per week(2 hr MAX) Time commitment was pretty low. It made the class a LOT easier if you had a stronger background in biology, but it was that necessary",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Before the class I was unsure if I wanted to major in biomedical engineering. It gave a great overview of what kinds of things you would be studying as a BME student and what work was being done in the world today. It's a great course if you are on the fence about BME like I was.",
    "Great class, professor Saltzman is a BOSS , labs are fun, and hw is all right, although sometimes answers not in the text or class. Lots of support and help though from TAs and professor Saltzman helps with this though",
    "Beng 100 is a really interesting survey for Biomedical Engineering. It has a unique set-up in that it's not a traditional lecture course. If you're interested in biomedical engineering or need a science credit, it's a great class! We even got froyo on the last day of class, which was awesome.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class because you learn so much from it, and the psets may be difficult, but not undoable. This is a fun and good class.",
    "If you're even slightly interested in biomedical engineering, TAKE THIS CLASS. I went into this class taking it just to get another credit, but I left the semester with it being my favorite class by far. Professor Saltzman is an unbelievable professor, the material is extremely interesting, and the work load is very manageable. This class is perfect for anyone interested in the field or even anyone who needs a SC requirement, as it is a great inventory of what is contained within the biomedical engineering field.",
    "Introductory biomedical engineering class that is very interesting and engaging. There is a lot of material and the assignments require some time, but overall, it is a very rewarding class.",
    "Advertised as a \"science credit for non-science majors,\" BENG 100 does attract people from all majors. Granted, you will have a few people in the class who are much more experienced and knowledgeable in the sciences, but it isn't necessarily difficult for non-science majors. The midterm exam was very difficult and the problem sets can sometimes be tedious and irrelevant to lectures, so this class is probably harder than other science classes geared towards non-science majors. Saltzman is a fair and good professor (even though his problem sets suck) and he cares a lot about his students. I really liked the class also because we had the opportunity to perform quick,one-hour experiments in the Malone engineering building that reinforced the material but were also fun.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was one of the best I have taken at Yale, both because of the material and the way it was taught. It gives a great overview of many aspects of biomedical engineering, applications, and the types of projects that biomedical engineers work on. Great for science and non-science majors.",
    "I'm not a science major, so I don't know in what cases science students ought take this course. However, I think Professor Saltzman is correct when he said on the first day that this class is best for freshman science majors, freshmen interested in BME who want to learn more about the field, and non-science majors of all years who have an interested in Biology or BME.",
    "BENG 100 is a broad overview of biomedical engineering that allows you to learn about many fields within the field and eventually focus on one sub-field for the final paper. The material is decently interesting (as a non-science major who at one point contemplated majoring in science), but it's Professor Saltzman who really makes the class what it is. He truly loves his field and loves teaching students the basics of BME. He made sure that we learned but also made sure that class was fun and engaging (like spreading a mock virus through the class to look at how scientists study disease outbreaks). I would recommend the class to another student with two caveats. One, that you have a half-way decent background in biology. I had taken AP Bio two years prior and didn't have a problem, but some of my friends who weren't as well versed in bio felt they had a lot of catching up to do. Two, that you can put up with hard problem sets. The material in the class wasn't too hard, but the psets were often vague or not fully taught before they were due, which could be frustrating."
