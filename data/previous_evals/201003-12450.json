    "I would definitely recommend this class. The workload is definitely manageable. Also, if you can get Andrew Horowitz for your TA, definitely do.",
    "If you have ever questioned who is controlling messages about the media and how much power you really have over medical related issues--TAKE IT.",
    "It plots the courseo f the concurrent rise in modern media practices (from print to film to television to internet and more) with the rise in the status and fall in status of the medical profession. the first lecture of each week was taught by Warner, who gave us the historical background to that period in medicine, and the second lecture of the week was almost always taught by Berland, who aimed to talk more about media and show us current example of the medical historical trends Warner reference two days earlier. I'd recommend it for an introductory American Atudies course or anyone interested in visual advertising or public health in America. Great Credit-D course if you like it but don't desperately need to add a Social Science to your transcript.",
    "Great class, take it!!!! But, pre-meds are screwed.",
    "Definitely. Not too tough, and the readings and lectures are all really interesting and relevant.",
    "Interesting and not too much work.",
    "Really great and interesting class, I did not mind going to lecture at all. We watch a ton of amusing clips and talk about really interesting topics. The midterm, paper and final are all very reasonable. Section is kind of a drag though.",
    "Take this class very easy if you have common sense you will do fine",
    "Interesting teachings on the media and how it has affected the medical field. Make sure to attend lectures and keep up with readings as each week is geared toward a specific topic.",
    "DEFINITELY RECCOMEND! Especially if you are interested in medicine or science or public health or policy or media (or neither!). Its a great course to take as an AMERICAN (or not american) to learn about our unique culture and how health and the media have interplayed over the past century. Also its not that much work, stay on top of the reading but maybe split them with a friend and it will be great!",
    "Great class to take. As interesting as everyone else says it is",
    "Take the class--it is not incredibly demanding and the topic is very interesting. It is a good option for a fifth class.",
    "Take this course, and tell everyone you know to take it as well. The topics are amazingly interesting, the workload is not too bad, the final paper is not too long, and the professors are delightful. One of my favorite classes thus far.",
    "Yes, take it if you are interested in the topic.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Media + Medicine to any student. The work's really not bad and very interesting. Love it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It's a very interesting class and not too much of a workload.",
    "Media and Medicine touches upon several issues in modern medicine and their perception in the media. Sometimes, the material will be seem painfully obvious. Other times, it will be new and interesting. It's kind of a mixed bag. Professor Berland's lectures were more interesting than Professor Warner's. There's a lot of assigned reading (~700 page course packet) but for the most part, doing the reading hasn't really necessary if you attend lecture and take notes. A midterm, a 10-page paper and a final. Not too challenging. A good 5th course.",
    "Take this class! The course covers such a wide variety of material (from the anti-TB campaign to TV doctors to AIDS to health care) that something (if not the majority of the lectures) is bound to interest you. I found nearly all the lectures interesting, many to the point of being fascinating. You certainly begin to notice the connections between medicine and media in society today. I definitely looked forward to this class, and to section as well. The readings were generally not too long, and except for very few, were not a chore to read. I enjoyed most of them, so although you could probably get by with not reading all of them, I would recommend reading them all just because they're generally pretty engaging. The class does not require much work. There are the weekly readings, one 10 page paper on pretty much any topic of your choice related to media and medicine, and a midterm and final.",
    "I would recommend it for an easy humanities. there's really not much work at all",
    "Yes. It's definitely an interesting class and you learn a lot from it. You don't have to do all the readings because the lectures talk about the same things and they are well organized and presented.",
    "Not if youre not used to history classes",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it is an interesting, and well-organized way to think about how the media influences our day-to-day lives.",
    "Eh. Probably not.",
    "It was a study of the relationship between media, and particularly advertising, and health related topics. I would recommend the course to another student because it was genuinely interesting and drew on themes from life today.",
    "This class, though interesting, got progressively more repetitive ad the term went on. It was a good, low-stress fifth class. Not amazing, not horrible.",
    "This is a wonderful class where though the workload is not too heavy, you learn a lot! For premed students, it's a nice break from the monotony of science classes and a fresh perspective on the reality of being a doctor. Both professors are great lecturers and Tom is an amazing TA if you can get him!",
    "This is a very basic class and you won't learn a lot of hard facts. It shouldn't be hard to pull off a decent grade, but I doubt you'll walk away feeling like you learned a lot. Probably good as a fifth class... pretty boring if you consider if a full class.I'd recommend the course anyway b\/c it's certainly not painful and definitely interesting at times.",
    "A good class if you don't want too much work and want a class that just requires you to use your brain.",
    "Very interesting and relevant class. Low key and influences your own life--how you perceive advertisements and interact or view your own healthcare provider. Very rewarding! Take it!!",
    "It's a great course! Take it if you are interested in this subject. The lectures were very interesting and the readings as well.",
    "Media and Medicine is a very interesting class, and all the readings are extremely relevant and not boring. Classes could get a little dry at times, but the content of the subject generally made class enjoyable. I would recommend to another student.",
    "I definitely recommend it as an easy 5th class. You can do pretty well with a fairly low amount of work. It's a lot of fun, I enjoyed going to class, and I also learned a lot.",
    "This is a course that is generally very interesting. The reading can get a bit dry at times, but overall the relevance of the material makes it consistently enjoyable. I recommend if you are looking for a good lecture course without too much work.",
    "Lectures summarize the obvious about media and medicine, readings are often interesting but not life-changing. One paper, two exams. I think there are courses at Yale that are more worth your time: most of what I got from this class could have been found on wikipedia or simply understood from personal experience.",
    "it's an interesting course about how the media influences and portrays the medical world in America over the course of time. I recommend taking it if you're looking for an interesting and a bit more laid-back class. Just remember to make note when professors suggest paper topics.",
    "Absolutely take this class. You will want to listen and do the work for it. You'll learn about big time news scandals that have brought about change in our nation's healthpolicy. It's fascinating.",
    "Wayyyyy too much reading for an otherwise simple class. The biggest course packet I have ever seen in my life.",
    "This is a great class to take if you're looking for an HSHM lecture. It's a great intro class, but it's also a fun lecture to take if you're in the major and just looking for a fun elective.",
    "It's a good course covering the relationship of media and medicine throughout the 20th century. Interesting if you're interested in the subject. Not too much work, just a midterm, a 10-page paper and the final. Lots of reading if you actually do it, which I did, only to find that some sections put together summaries of the readings before the tests. I would say it's a good lecture and I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Take this course if you are looking for an easy class with minimal requirements. There is actually some interesting material to be learned and the amount of work you need to put in to get a good grade is atypical of many other Yale courses.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The lectures were interesting, and most of the readings weren't bad either. If you pay attention in lecture, it's mostly enough to get by in section, and almost every lecture includes a few video clips.",
    "This is a fun, light course for those seeking a humanities credit. If you're interested in really delving deep into the many relations of media, society, and the medical professions, this course really only lightly skims the surface.",
    "Really awesome course. You will find yourself looking forward to going to class. I would, without a doubt, recommend this course.",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. Good workload, extremely interesting material with knowledgeable professors, and fair grading.",
    "Fun class. Not too hard. I really enjoyed it.",
    "This course is good if you are looking for an overview of media and medicine. You watch a bunch of interesting clips and the lectures are interesting. Requires minimal work aside from the paper and tests.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. There is not as much material as some other HSHM classes like Naomi's Public Health In America, which can make the lectures\/readings a little repetitive but also makes it less work. The material is definitely interesting for anyone interested in medicine, media, public health or history.",
    "Super interesting class, if you are at all interested, take it. Material is NOT difficult at all, but of course, your grades will also will depend on your TA. HSHM majors would benefit from this. Midterm and Finalwere both essay-based (they ask you to cite readings in them but also provide a list of the reading titles\/authors) and there's a course paper.",
    "Great class, but it is what you make it. The total amount of pages to read is over 700 in the semester, which doesn't sound like it is a lot, but it adds up. You can skim some of the readings, but I think an important part of what you get out of the class comes out of doing the reading in addition to lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to people interested in history and medicine. I loved learning how the media can influence society.",
    "i would recommend it. very interesting.",
    "This class is history of public health with a twist. It really focuses on how medicine and media co-evolved, and it feels like you're not learning very much until you're forced to write about it. Then you feel like you learned a lot. It's interesting and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an easy credit, easy insofar that the concepts are easy to grasp and as long as you put in the work, you'll be fine.",
    "Take it for Hu cred, its a nice 5th class.",
    "definitely take, you learn a lot and look at things differently now related to medical advertising",
    "This was a really interesting class. I never had any trouble paying attention in lecture. The reading isn't too heavy and it's not necessary to do all of them anyways. The grade is based on a midterm, a final, and a 10 page paper.",
    "This class will change your understanding of the health industry in America today in a way that is applicable to anyone's life. I highly recommend this course, even if you just go sit in lectures to listen, you will take away important knowledge about medicine today.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student. It was very interesting, there was only a midterm, final paper, and final, and it was very worthwhile.",
    "AMST 247 is a well-balanced course, presenting a number of different perspectives on the relation between the modern media and medical practice and prestige. The two professors (if it's still Berland and Warner) alternate lectures, so within one week, you'll often get two complementary viewpoints on one major topic, such as the portrayal of doctors in the mass media. The reading for this course can sometimes be rather extensive, but it is rarely unmanageable. The midterm and final are both essay-based and focus on major themes of the course, not requiring comprehensive knowledge of specific details. The paper is ultimately not too difficult to write, though it can be intimidating if it is your first paper at Yale. Luckily, the TAs are very helpful both in the research process and the actual writing of the paper. Take this course if you're interested in having a new perspective on medicine. It's also a good humanities credit for pre-meds that won't take too much time away from all your hard science courses.",
    "I would recommend it. just know that if you're taking it as an easy 4th or 5th class, there is more work involved than you'd expect. A midterm, final, and a 10-pg paper.",
    "I would definitely would recommend taking this class: interesting and not much work!",
    "I would recommend it if you want something pretty interesting with not much work.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if he needs an easy way to get whatever distributional credits this class covers. This was an easy history class. You could *either* show up to class *or* actually do the reading. I did the former, and I got by fine. It's definitely low-stress and also mildly interesting.",
    "Take it if you are into politics, American studies, or medicine. It is also an easy-enough class.",
    "Yes! This class covers some very interesting material, and the workload is very manageable.",
    "HSHM 202 is an interesting course without too much work. While the lectures cover a variety of fascinating topics, the lectures themselves could sometimes be a little dry. There is only a midterm, a final paper, and a final exam. The weekly reading is very interesting, so it is not hard to keep up with. I enjoyed the course, but it was not as great as I had expected given the wonderful reviews I had heard.",
    "An interesting, fairly easy class. Lectures can get a bit repetitive, but they're usually interesting. Very light on reading, with a paper, a midterm, and a final.",
    "It's an interesting course because of its material. The professors do a good job trying to organize the course, but as a relatively new course, it still has a ways to go.Take it if you want a fun and easy class to round out your heavier course load, but don't expect it to be mind-blowing or brilliant.",
    "Take this course for a taste of hat HSHM is like.",
    "Very, very easy",
    "This was an amazing class. If you're interested in pop culture, medicine, media, history, or even development this class will satisfy you. It covers such a wide range of topics and truly hits on the most important aspects of history you always knew existed but never truly knew enough about. The professors are amazing and the lectures incredibly interesting.",
    "Interesting lectures!",
    "I would recommend this class, if you are interested in the subject matter even very vaguely. It was very interesting and the topics discussed have real world relevance. I enjoyed this class, with the exception of maybe 4 lectures. Its main strength was that the subject matter itself was really interesting and Dr. Berland is a fascinating lecturer and so is John Warner, to a lesser extent. The readings were also interesting, and got more so towards the end of the course.",
    "Media and Medicine is a really good class, really for any student, regardless of major. There's a manageable amount of readings, and the lectures are always really interesting. There are two professors who alternate between more of a historical perspective on American medicine and more of a modern-day perspective on contemporary issues, which I found extremely helpful. They also make their lectures interesting through video clips, etc. I was fascinated by the material -- I think it's really introduced me to a lot of important issues and changed my perspective on health\/medicine in America. I've started to look at drug ads, primetime doctor dramas, cancer, etc. completely differently. It's a great class -- I'd really recommend it. It's not too much work, and it's material that's crucial for all Americans to understand. Definitely take it!",
    "I'd recommend it to anyone. Fun, very interesting, informative and not at all demanding",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student, because it is not a lot of work and the course material is really interesting.",
    "Good if you like media, medicine, nutrition or any issues related to health. Take it.",
    "You could get the basic gist of this course in about half a semester, but it IS interesting.",
    "If you are pre-med i would recommend it. If you are not pre-med i would still recommend it. It's a really fascinating subject and the material is not dense. The demands of the class aren't heavy and it's taught well.",
    "Really interesting class. Really laidback. Easy, light and interesting reading. Highly recommend.Easy B+ class. Grade depends on your TA though, so it might be even easier if you have a chill TA.",
    "Yes! Very interesting. Midterm, 10-page paper, final.",
    "No. It's definitely a class to take if you want to take an easy lecture but not if you really value the classes you take and how you spend your class time at Yale.",
    "HIST 147 is a pretty standard lecture course with a relatively easy workload. You cover some pretty interesting material with a lot of current implications. Professor Warner, who focuses on the historical side of the class, is a great lecturer and really makes the topics fascinating for the class. Professor Berland, who covers the contemporary issues, isn't as engaging. I think a big part of the class depends on how your TA runs section - if you get a good one, the material is so much easier to go through and understand. In terms of workload, it's really light - midterm, final paper, and a final, none of which are particularly hard. A solid class, overall.",
    "Yes, definitely! If you are pre-med or plan on having a career related to medicine or patient care or policy, this is a class you have to take to better understand the past, present and future of the field you are about to enter.",
    "definitely take it! the lectures and readings are actually fun and it's not stressful at all!",
    "Media& Medicine is very interesting and is not too much work. Take it if you are interested in the topic!",
    "Interesting class dealing with relevant topics and not too tough if your good at writing this is a gem.",
    "A study of the co-emergence of media and medicine since 1882.",
    "If you're interested in the power of the media. Take it.",
    "a class on how media tackles medicine in america (just what the title says)",
    "I'd say it's not too intense of work, but I wouldn't recommend it from my own personal experience.",
    "Yep, this course covers interesting material and I enjoyed it.",
    "It's not a lot of work and a humanities credit for anybody who needs one. Don't wait to long to research for the paper and you'll be fine. Some topics are more interesting than others but the tests are in essay format, so you don't need to know everything, just what you want to write about."
