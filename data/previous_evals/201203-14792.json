   "comments": [
    "Yes. If you want to improve your thinking in terms of the logic behind your research ideas, I would highly recommend this class. It helps you see the forest through the trees of the research process.",
    "I would strongly recommend MGMT 733 to other students in the social sciences. The course helps develop the skill of theory construction, which is essential to scholars in all disciplines, and yet overlooked by many programs.",
    "I strongly recommend other students to take this course, especially students in sociology and management doing empirical research. It is a very unique and helpful course to learn how to write the theory part of a paper. So far as I know there is no other courses offered at Yale to learn this. Especially no other course instructions would have gone through each step of writing the theory part of a paper with students.",
    "I would describe the course as an experience of identifying and crafting the building blocks of theories. I would recommend the course to any doctoral student who desires the tools needed to develop one's own theories as well as those who wish to be better consumers of management (and other academic) literature.",
    "The course teaches techniques for the construction of verbal theory, both the formal construction of logical arguments and also the informal writing style and presentation of theory in a way that is convincing and enjoyable for the audience. The format of the class is class discussions of readings (articles and book chapters) and small group critique sessions of assignments.I would recommend this course to anyone who is pursuing a PhD in the social sciences.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes, very useful and interesting and memorable course"

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Yes it helped me become and better thinker and writer.",
    "The course was very helpful in deepening my knowledge, and even more so in developing my skills as a researcher\/scholar. It helped develop an ability to both critique the theories of others and construct theories related to my own research.",
    "Yes, this course deepen my knowledge of my discipline. Especially it enables to learn the logic of good arguments and the essence of good ideas. Since I am considering writing my dissertation in the area of economic sociology and organizations, this course fits very well with my research, as the course materials are main in the areas I am interested. Also, I am considering to base one of my dissertation chapters on the paper I wrote for this course, so it is very helpful that the course instructor gave me very detailed feedback and gave me very helpful suggestions on how to improve the paper.",
    "I thinkthe course has made me more confident in reviewing theoretical literature, and applying a methodical approach to idea development and writing.",
    "Yes! This course was one of the best courses I took this semester and a great foundation for future research.",
    "The course provided rare insights into academic customs, from theory development to manuscript submission. The final paper serves as a vehicle for setting up a research paper. Overall, this course advanced my understanding of theory and how to translate it into hands on research."
