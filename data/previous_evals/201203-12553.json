    "No, it is a perfect example for why so many students dread math class, when its explained simpler, it becomes easier to understand and enjoyable.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you have a strong background in calculus.",
    "Again, don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "not extremely hard material just get a good teacher...",
    "Math 112 is not too conceptually daunting, but the specific problems on the tests are often arcane and challenging. Whether or not the curve compensates for this, I do not know, as I completed this evaluation before grades went final. All the same, you will see your learnings of mathematics increase greatly if you pay close attention. Additionally, though all Yale professors are well-known for their abilities and kindness, I highly recommend you take this course with Professor Andrei Osipov.Any student can bring a question to him at almost any time, and he will help. He is one of the sweetest people you will ever meet, but he is very smart in terms of mathematics as well. I think he would be a good person to sit next to on a long bus ride but also just be a good person to learn mathematics from, particularly if you are having trouble learning as he is willing to see you outside class to offer a helping hand.",
    "It's a course where you learn AB Calculus. There are problem sets every week, which is basically how many courses are. Yes, I would recommend this course to any student that isn't very good at math but wants to take a math course.",
    "If you've never taken calc before this course will be a struggle.",
    "Take it if you need it for your major.",
    "Only take it if you have taken it in high school",
    "I would recommend the section with Professor Osipov to anyone who has to take Math 112. However I would not recommend the class to someone who does not need the class.",
    "If you don't need much interaction or help from a teacher, then this class should be fine for you.",
    "Math 112 mainly covers derivatives, antiderivatives, and integrals and is a prerequisite for many upper level math and econ classes. I would recommend it, even if you took Calculus AB in high school."
