    "Basically, this is a survey of classic and recent texts in the history of New World slavery before 1800 or so. Because the subject is so important, I would recommend this course to any Americanist.",
    "I would, and have, recommended History 717 to other students. I did so primarily because of the professors, actually. I don't think I've felt that comfortable in a seminar here at Yale, and as I wrote above, many of the discussions were extremely engaging.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend History 717 01 to another student: It gives a state of the art-overview in American slavery, engages critically with the central questions in the field, and points to potential paths of future research."

   "comments": [
    "I came to this class with little knowledge about slavery before 1800, and even less about the institution outside of the United States. So this class gave me a deeper and broader grasp of this subject.",
    "This course touched upon several of the themes that I will encounter in my field and in my dissertation research. However, its greatest merit was that it introduced me to a much broader corpus of literature than I would otherwise have read."
