    "Yes, everything was available that we needed.",
    "There was little need for outside resources. I will say that the small chairs with attached folding desks are not particularly conducive for exam writing.The fab labs were useful for our bridge and column projects, particularly the crusher\/compactor, but other than that were rarely called upon.",
    "Given that the students had all of the resources of the architecture school available to them, from computers to the wood workshop, the projects allowed for greater exploration in the design of the pasta bridge and column, for example. Students were not limited due to lack of ways to execute the design and could play with mundane materials in creative ways. The class is all the better due to the resources."
