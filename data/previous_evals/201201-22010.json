    "If you survived L1, then you'll be fine. The workload is manageable and a lot of the grammar is actually stuff we touched upon in L1-- a lot of it is reinforcement or expansion of grammar rules and usage. You will actually be surprised by your ability to read longer texts by the end of the semester. I wouldn't say my speaking ability has benefitted greatly, but there is definitely some improvement compared to last semester. If Hasmik were sticking around I would say try to get into get section, but alas . . . shop around for a good professor. That's super important.",
    "The course is fantastic for those who truly want to learn Arabic and put up with its idiosyncrasies, as well as the occasional disorganization of the department. If you love the language, you will be willing to put in the time and achieve results.",
    "You might as well take this if you took ARBC 110 so you can get your credit! It's a continuation of ARBC 110 and you build on grammar and learn more vocab.",
    "YES! If you want to learn a lot of Arabic and work hard, take this course.",
    "Arabic 120 is a significant time commitment. You meet everyday for fifty minutes and have a significant amount of homework every night. The work is very manageable however in a regular course load. If you keep up on the work, you shouldn't need to study much for quizzes or exams, a bit of review will suffice. Also make sure to get a good teacher. Some don't know how to effectively teach beginners. I suggest Haskmik first and foremost and then maybe Sarab. If you have an interest in the Middle East or International Relations, I would definitely suggest taking Arabic 120. If you don't though, I might reconsider. In Arabic 120 you learn Modern Standard Arabic, which isn't spoken in any Arabic-speaking countries. For real-world Arabic, you'll have to learn specific dialects. MSA is a good place to begin however if you know you want to learn Arabic in the future, or if you want to read the Qur'an.",
    "Definitely go for Arabic. It is very manageable and you can tell that you are improving every day.The experience, however, greatly depends on the teacher. I had a great teacher this year, but I am not sure what to expect next year when she is no longer teaching.",
    "I would recommend Arabic 120 if you're committed and serious about learning Arabic. If it's just a casual interest, take a more casual language. It is rewarding if you are committed and interested."
