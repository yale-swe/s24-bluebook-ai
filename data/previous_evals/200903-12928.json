   "comments": [
    "If you love humanities and want to make the most out of your Yale experience, you take DS. The program is extremely rigorous, but is well-organized and extremely rewarding.Kronman is a big name, but I wouldn't fight to switch into his section. Enjoy his incredible lectures - but discussions in section often get lost in little details, and they don't always feel on point. He is extremely accessible and intelligent, however, and gives great feedback on papers.",
    "Like any DS course, DS Lit is a fast-paced run through of the most major works of literature in the western canon. That being said, if you care about the humanities at all, this course is worth taking.",
    "I would recommend DS to every student at Yale. I think that the foundation and modes of thought that it promotes have changed the way I look at the world. I think that understanding the tradition and history of some of the most important thoughts in human history is invaluable and changes the terms of all thoughts.",
    "It's an amazing class. There are a couple of problematic weeks, and you won't quite get a feel for it until it's almost over, but it's great.",
    "The curriculum is fun--not terribly inspiring on its own--but solid. But Professor Kronman brings everything to life. His lecture on Odysseus' great rooted bed was brilliant and made me suddenly love the Odyssey. In class, he talks a fair amount, then asks questions and allows discussion. It's a nice blend, and it seems to satisfy the kids who want lots of conversaion and the kids who want to just hear what a brilliant professor has to say. He ties in other subjects beautifully, and class is generally a lot of fun.",
    "DS Literature with Professor Kronman will be the highlight of your first semester, guaranteed. If you have the opportunity, you MUST take it. The class takes you through the greatest works of the classical and medieval eras - Homer, Greek Tragedy, Greek\/Roman Lyric, Virgil, the Bible, and Dante. The readings are truly a pleasure (especially compared to some weeks in philosophy and history), and the papers were great to write (Kronman asks fairly simple questions and lets you develop the complexity). You will find yourself noticing references everywhere, making awesome DS jokes, and generally becoming a better person. And Professor Kronman is simply phenomenal - he's brilliant, passionate, eloquent, inspiring, but most importantly extremely nice, so section is really open to your ideas and never intimidating. Get his section if you can...he's one of the best, if not the best teacher in the program.",
    "I would take this class with Professor Kronman if possible.",
    "Yes, this class was incredible and I learned a lot.",
    "Literature is one of the more enjoyable courses of the DS curriculum, but there is not enough time to read all the material and truly enjoy the works. You will also get a new understanding for Greek& Roman literature and how it all ties together. Also, Anthony Kronman is a spectacular professor.",
    "The Directed Studies Literature section is what one would expect - a survey of great works of the Western cannon. The course's only weakness is an inability to cover each piece in depth. However, I still found the course extremely rewarding, and it has affected the very way I think.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend it. I would explain that it gives one a good toolkit with which to unpack themes in literature I certainly did not fully appreciate until taking this course.",
    "I would recommend this literature course even if it was not held within the trio of Directed Studies, but I do feel compelled to extol the value of spending such a large chunk of freshman year devoted to the Western Canon. This is an essential part of one's education - not only for the references one will understand coming out of it, but for the questions one is forced to ask while reading these works. I have challenged myself as a reader, an intellectual, and a person.",
    "DS Literature is somewhat like a crash course in Classical Western Literature. In the first semester you start with Homer's Iliad and end with Dante's Divine Comedy. Throughout you are expected to read a good amount of texts, averaging about 50-100 pages for each section meeting. It seems like a lot, but you learn how to manage your time and how to read texts with the ability to absorb important themes and messages. The essays might also seem daunting, but if you start working on them at an earlier time, so that you at least have a thesis to discuss with your professor, you will be in good shape.I would definitely recommend this course to another student. While it is a large work load, you will be able to read a series of Great Books with your peers where you will be able to discuss these books throughly and bring up ideas completely new and intriguing to you. It's a completely different experience than if you were to read these texts on your own.",
    "On the first day of class, Professor Kronman sat down in the classroom, surrounded by gothic windows allowing a view of old campus basking in sun and looked out at each of us with our copies of the Iliad, smiled and said, This is the perfect room, the perfect day and the perfect book with which to start western civilization. Life doesn't get much better than this. From that day on literature was among the highlights of my week. A classmate described it best as we walked out of class one day, noting that when not immensely fun the class was sublime. Kronman brings out the joy of studying literature in class and you rarely leave without a smile. Truly among my favorite classes; it's all books you know you should read at some point in your life and you get to read them with brilliant people with which to discuss and explore the reading and the cream of the crop when it comes to faculty. Kronman's literature class stood as an ideal example of what directed studies is all about.",
    "Professor Kronman knows how to skillfully run the class discussions, and he will make you excited about the texts you are reading, which is not always the case in other DS classes. He is a very kind and helpful teacher, and I am very glad he was my professor--his class helped me see that DS could be fun, exciting, and understandable!",
    "If you have had the privilege of being placed in Prof. Kronman's class, TAKE IT. Even if DS seems impossible or difficult, at least trudge through the fall semester, and you won't regret it. It will affect you for years to come in ways you can't even imagine. He is your Virgil."
