    "The course was well done, but it definitely is not for beginners. I could tell very easily that most of the class had been exposed to spanish before. I feel like the class needs to better weed out those who have already seen the language in order to get a better grade distribution.",
    "It's a very good introduction to the language. I would recommend it although I would warn of the possibility that other students in the class may have background knowledge and thus the class may move at a pace above them.",
    "Great intro Spanish class. Very fast paced but the course is enjoyable and you will definitely learn a good amount."
