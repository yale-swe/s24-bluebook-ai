    "you read some wonderful novels in a casual environment",

    "The class is great. Lectures were interesting, seminar participation was fun and informative, and the books were great.",
    "howard is amazing, books can be a bit repetive",
    "Strengths include great reading list, interesting discussions and moderate workload (a book a week, 2 papers). Weaknesses - was pretty repetitive.",
    "I really enjoyed how cut-to-the-chase this course was: you read the book, you come into class and discuss it. I found the workload to be very manageable and was therefore always able to come to class prepared, which is not always the case for seminar courses. The discussion of the text in class did not always feel cumulative, more linear, but other than that I very much enjoyed and learned from class sessions, which is also not something to be said for all seminars."

    "A great course. Take it if you can! Prof. Bloch is a great resource, and it is amazing that he takes the time to teach a seminar.",
    "YES",
    "Yes, I would urge other Yale students to take this course or other classes with Professor Bloch.",
    "yes",
    "I would highly recommend it. Professor Bloch is an extremely interesting character but very knowledgable, passionate about his field and very engaging.The readings are super interesting and more fun than work to be honest. SIde note,this class is also highly dependent on the classmates and their level of enthusiasm or interest in the course. That being said... Take this class. Take it. There is no way you will regret taking this course.",
    "If you like any kind of literature, you will love this course!",
    "If you want to hear one of the most brilliant minds on the subject of French lit out there, and are also tired of reading French novels by men, do take this. Professor Bloch is one of a kind and undergrads are incredibly lucky to have access to his scholarship. The books were also fun - mostly novels - which made things easy to read and enjoyable to discuss in class.",
    "Yes. I think it touches on a lot of literature that might be otherwise neglected in one's course of study."
