    "It's a required class, sometimes helpful, sometimes not exactly. But it is a great way to get to know the people in your major better.",
    "This class is mandatory for all EVST majors. It is not a demanding seminar and is a good way to get to know your fellow EVST seniors.",
    "On the positive side, the colloquium was a nice weekly (or semi-weekly) opportunity to check in on our papers and a great reminder to keep making progress. However, much of the content and advice given was necessarily so general that I sometimes felt that my time in colloquium could have been much better spent actually working on my project.I would strongly suggest that many meetings of the colloquium be turned over primarily to research and writing.That said, it was helpful to meet, commiserate with other students about our progress on our projects, and we had a couple of nice sessions where we shared our research with each other."
