   "comments": [
    "We read a variety of American literature, starting with early colonial speeches and sermons and ending with post-modern novels, in order to analyze them both as individual texts and within the greater sphere of the progress of American literature and authorship.",
    "Pretty nice survey of American Literature. It helps A LOT with discussions if you actually read the books beforehand. The course is worth taking.",
    "American Lit is a great course. You'll read some classic novels and poetry and also learn some American history.Personally I was more interested in the literature than the poetry, but I enjoyed all of the reading we did. In general, introductory English classes at Yale are very enjoyable and well-taught.You will certainly enjoy this course if you take it with Prof. Goldsby.",
    "English 127 with Professor Goldsby is one of the best classes I have taken here at Yale. Prof Goldsby absolutely loves what she does and really cares about her students. There are 4 shorter \"classesV2 posts\", 2 papers, some \"pop\" quizzes (nothing to worry about if you've read), and a final exam. While this class meets at 9 am and the work load seems to be a bit more than the other sections, do yourself a favor and takeit anyway!",
    "If you want to come out of Yale writing good analytical\/comparative essays and have a working knowledge of the American canon, at the VERY least, take this class (with Goldsby).",
    "Easily one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Every single class discussion was engaging, and I left every class with a widened perspective on the reading. I was apprehensive at first about the 9am start time, but I had never been so motivated to get up so early before taking this course. The workload is reasonable -- a solid amount of reading but not so much that you won't enjoy the texts or have energy to analyze them. The writing assignments are evenly spaced with short 1-2 page responses and two 4-6 page papers, so you get to do a good amount of writing (all with great, detailed feedback given by Prof. Goldsby) in very manageable intervals. I would recommend this class to English-y people and non-English-y people alike (I'm a science major) because pretty much everyone can appreciate the wide-ranging literature the course offers.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone really interested in American Literature - I went in wanting to learn more about a different kind of literature (I'm international and was mainly taught British lit before), and ended up learning more than literature - I learned some cool things about American culture, history, and ethos as well. The course is not easy, grades are not easy (though fair), and be prepare to spend more than just a couple hours (especially when you start reading Sound and the Fury and Moby Dick) hammering out the readings. There are two major essays per semester, but a lot of smaller 2-3 pages assignments that doesn't seem like a lot, but take a while to write because deep and insightful analysis is expected. Since I had no prior exposure to American lit before, it was tough for me to get used to a lot of the pieces we read since I had no background or cultural immersion that would prepare me for the of work I would be reading.",
    "It's a good course. Sometimes the readings can be long but they are interesting.",
    "You do not want to grow up without reading these works! You have to take this class before leaving Yale. The themes tie together many of the ideas you have learned in other classes, and Professor Goldsby does an awesome job in guiding you to larger and overarching thematic points.",
    "ENGL 127 is a great seminar class with a phenomenal reading list. Granted, there is a lot of reading. But if you have the privilege of taking ENGL 127 with Professor Goldsby (hint: TAKE 127 WITH PROFESSOR GOLDSBY), she will inspire you to think differently about the works and about literature, and after awhile, the work load will not seem that bad. Professor Goldsby gives ample commentary on every writing assignment, and unlike the other ENGL 127 professors, she assigns only two major essays and multiple small writing assignments. I preferred this to the 4 essays of the other ENGL 127 classes because it allowed me to think more deeply about each major work of literature we were assigned. Again, take 127 with Professor Goldsby. You will not regret it.",
    "Broad range of texts and genres; very manageable workload (we only wrote 2 essays the whole term, plus 4-5 2-pg \"essayettes\"). Professor Goldsby is a brilliant scholar, but I didn't love her as a teacher. Class felt more like a lecture than a seminar at points; keep that in mind when choosing professors. Also look at the syllabi before choosing a section, because the texts differ a lot depending on the teacher.",
    "I really, truly enjoyed this course. You read a wide breadth, chronologically and stylistically, of American literature. The semester begins with a short story unit, where you read 8-10 short stories that range from Winthrop's \"City Upon a Hill\" sermon to stories written in the last fifty years. You also read several great American novels, many of which are classics (like Moby Dick) that I wouldn't necessarily read on my own, so I'm glad I read them in a class. While there are quite a lot of writing assigments (two big essays on the books, one big essay on Walt Whitman, one big essay on a Dickinson poem, and almost weekly (but short) 2-page reading response essays), I definitely feel like my writing improved. Professor Goldsby did a great job of leading class discussions; while she shared her own insightful commentary, she made sure student commentary guided discussion. She was also always available to provide help on essays and would even read entire drafts.I think what made this course especially interesting and unique was Professor Goldsby's emphasis on examining American literature from an almost \"historical\" angle. One essay assignment required that we examine several editions of Whitman's \"Leaves of Grass\" and assess how the changes made to each edition influenced the meaning of the poems. We also read two versions of a Raymond Carver short story -- the original and a version that was edited extensively by Carver's editor -- and then assessed how the edits changed the meaning of the story. I had never done an assignment like this in an English class, and I really enjoyed it; these types of assignments forced me to examine literature beyond the words on the page and to address questions of authorship and how literature changes of over time.",
    "Take ENGL 127 with Professor Goldsby! She makes the 9am time slot totally worth it. Great course."
