    "The title speaks for itself. This class is about what ethnography as a discipline is (from the sociology perspective) and provides a detailed survey of the African-American experience. In this particular semester, Professor Anderson is preoccupied with his new book \"The Iconic Ghetto,\" so I'd rename the course \"The Iconic Ghetto.\" This is the real content of the course and he brainwashes people with the themes from his book. It gets repetitive so bring something to do during the class once you've gotten the concept. There's also no need to read the books. He will start talking about his new book so don't waste your time.",
    "Begins to give you an understanding of the race relations in inner-city ghettos.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course in its current state, however its potential is high if Professor Anderson tones down his personal level of engagement and opens it up to his students.",
    "Sure! Classes are low pressure but you still learn a lot by the end. Additionally, Professor Anderson is so so knowledgable in the field so he's a great resource even outside of class."
