    "There's no real point in evaluating this because Amy Bloom has gone to Wesleyan. Overall, adv. fiction is good but she was very uninvested.",
    "I would say that you should only take this class if you are really serious about being a fiction writer. Amy Bloom is a tough critic and she is hard to please. She will make you work hard to improve your writing, so if you are just trying to take a fun, easy class in which the professor will tell you how talented you are, I would take something else. That said, if you are willing to accept some criticism and work hard to improve your writing, then you can get a lot out of this class. Amy really knows what she is talking about, and she is really friendly andwarm-hearted once you get past her tough exterior.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Depends on the teacher and your classmates",
    "I would recommend this class if you aspire to write like Amy Bloom.",
    "English 465 is an intensive, advanced fiction workshop. Classes were conducted workshop-style. Take this class if you are serious about writing and want to produce two short stories over the semester. Like all workshops, depends on the teacher and other students. Little to no emphasis on assigned reading; all emphasis on your own work and the other students' work. As far as workload goes: you will get out what you put in."
