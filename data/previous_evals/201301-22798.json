    "Yes. Definitely take it if you're even remotely interested in Freud.",
    "This was a endowed class so it will probably not be taught again. Class met one a week and there were about 5 or so extra mandatory lectures with accompanying dinners. Most of the speakers were interesting and engaging --although some were harder to understand, especially since we were learning topics for the first time that they are experts in. Seminar sometimes dragged a little long (2 hrs). Readings also took a considerable amount of time but workload besides that was manageable (midterm paper, final paper, online posts, 1 topic worksheet). Overall I am glad I took the course. I learned a lot about Freud that I didn't know and a lot about other topics. Small class size was a bonus.",
    "A wonderful course that puts Freud in conversation with contemporary neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, and psychoanalysis. The readings, while certainly dense, are not overly burdensome, and the two papers (8-10 pages and 12-15 pages) are open-ended and enjoyable. It was nice having someone present on the readings each week, as this allowed for greater elucidation of the material. Also, Professors Fradinger and Sledge often disagreed with one another, which created a dynamic dynamic (ha, ha) in class. I'd recommend it, if you can devote yourself to the course.",
    "The course was a broad spectrum of everything Freud. From the classics to the more modern works are covered in respect to both science and the humanities.",
    "This course is a close investigation of the various facets of Freud's thought, from his early case studies of hysterical patients and his theory of dreams and the unconscious, to his later works on culture and religion. These works are juxtaposed with contemporary work in philosophy, neuroscience, linguistics, and film theory to see Freud's enduring influence and continued relevance. As such, the course was very ambitious\u00e2\u0080\u0094sometimes too ambitious\u00e2\u0080\u0094for a single semester, but that will probably change in future incarnations. That said, the breadth also means tremendous freedom to focus on the aspects of Freud that most interest you. Overall, it's an excellent overview of Freud and a wonderful opportunity to debunk many of the pop cultural myths surrounding him. I would highly recommend it.",
    "A broad introduction to Freud and his intersection with science in the 21st century with an emphasis on Freud and less on science."
