   "comments": [
    "You learn what \"World Cinema\" means and you learn some of the basics of analyzing film.",
    "I watch movies in a new way!",
    "The professors chose really great films to watch.",
    "most insightful component was watching the films and hearing other students discuss it, lecture was usually just a bunch of buzz words",
    "Watching foreign movies was really interesting and fun; I liked most of the movies we watched in the class. Some of them veered into the melodramatic but most of them were actually really interesting, and the lectures gave a lot of good background information.",
    "I learned how to look at world films through a critical lens, while also taking into account my own positionality vis-a-vis these world films. The readings and lectures gave insight into postcolonial theory, queer theory, and other critical frameworks that are so applicable to any literature one might be studying. I learned how to write a film paper, and I learned how to come at films from both historical and theoretical angles. The section was wonderful!!",
    "This course is a good introduction to the foundational \"texts\" of world cinema -- we look at some fantastic directors\/cinematographers\/films from all over the world. It also takes as its main focus the very concept of \"world cinema\" -- what does the conception of \"world\" mean?, etc. Lectures are usually engaging; screenings are late at night but almost always enjoyable.",
    "I learned an immense amount about film, art, the world, and how to analyze it and put it in context.",
    "I was happy to find that all of the films we watched were more or less contemporary, and I learned much more about cinema of the now than I expected to. The class also gave me the opportunity to sharpen my eye for compositional, musical, and editing choices in films.",
    "reflection on the movie through a global aspect"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "We watch great films, and I liked having section right after watching them.",
    "I think that the greatest strength of the course was its format for discussion sections. We watch a film immediately before section, so there's no danger of anyone not having done the \"reading\" and needing to intellectually posture to convince the TA otherwise. We have all seen the film, and can then have a really interesting discussion about it. I think the lectures could be improved. Sometimes they weren't the most engaging.",
    "I would have liked to talk about the readings more in section.",
    "lecture sped through lots of content in short time, which wasn't very productive cine club and screenings are the best part",
    "I liked the movies we watched, they were really cool and I liked how in lecture the professors were able to link them back to historical contexts of the nations they were about. The section was really good and quite useful. The timeslot isn't convenient, and I did not like that section had to be an hour long regardless of the movie--some nights we finished around 10 PM. My biggest problem with this course is that we watched absolutely no Spanish language, Latin American, or Caribbean movies. There was 1 movie in Spanish, and it was an optional movie to watch for an end-of-semester paper. The professors totally abandoned the Southern portion of the Western Hemisphere. For context, we viewed for section: The Crying Game (Ireland), Battle of Algiers (Arabic\/French), Smoke Signals (USA), Hyenas (Senegal), Throne of Blood (Japan), Where is the Friend's Home (Iran), Time of the Gypsies (then-Yugoslavia), Farewell My Concubine (China), Happy Together (Hong Kong), Russian Ark (Russia), Edge of Heaven (Turkey\/Germany), and Life of Pi (USA\/Taiwan). None of the movies assigned for homework were South American\/Caribbean either. The professors did not find a single Spanish-language\/Caribbean\/South American film to view for section. I don't understand why that is, especially because Spain, South and Latin America, and the Caribbean have many movies that qualify as viewable for world cinema (Wide Sargasso Sea, Pan's Labyrinth, The Motorcycle Diaries). It is interesting and also disappointing that we watched no movies in section in the Spanish language or from South America in general. The movies we watched were surprisingly enjoyable and rich, and they increased my understanding of the world and of world film. But I feel like the course can be better.",
    "I think the team teaching fits this course very well, offering two perspectives on each film and film concept. I would say the additional films required on the syllabus in addition to the weekly screening felt like too much time demanded. I completely understand the intention was to enrich the understanding of each topic, but I'm not sure these extra films were widely viewed, and I would have rather gone deeper into discussions on the films we definitely did watch. Overall though, I really enjoyed the class and got a lot out of it.",
    "This course is wonderful! The lectures are fantastic. Professors Figlerowicz and Andrews both have fascinating takes on the films we watch, and I think both perspectives are necessary to provide a balanced critique. I particularly enjoyed Professor Figlerowicz's theoretical angle. It could be improved by perhaps incorporating more discussion of the readings. They were so well-chosen and I wanted more time to talk about them. Professor Andrew's slides were overwhelming but interesting and good to look at after class. I found discussion of industrial conditions and film festivals to be less interesting than other aspects of the course. Sections were probably my favorite part of this course. I also thought it was not super cool to have one of the TF's running to turn the lights on and off throughout the lecture. I'm not sure what the alternative would be, but it seemed like maybe not in the job description ?",
    "Section is held right after screening, which is a good decision in the sense that it allowed us to talk openly about a film that was fresh in our minds, but it also meant that sections went late! Be prepared to get out of class around 10pm!",
    "The movie choices were eclectic and wonderful material to discuss over the semester. The lectures, on the other hand, were not quite as engaging.",
    "The main strength of this course was that it set out to tear down the boundaries we erect when defining a film in terms of place and time -- to show that a film, by its content, its form, and its literal production\/distribution, can exist in many different global realities at once. However, I couldn't help feeling that the syllabus and the organization of the media library on the Canvas site didn't practice what the lectures preached: one film or a small group of films were used to 'speak for' all of (East) Asia or (West) Africa."

    "I loved this class! It exposed me to so many films I never would have seen otherwise.",
    "I definitely would! The films and readings and lectures and sections were all pretty interesting. The worst part of this course was Dudley Andrew, who is very boring and rambling. Marta Figlerowicz is amazing.",
    "Yes! It was a very interesting and engaging course, and the professors\/TAs are wonderful.",
    "Yes, a fairly low workload and an interesting topic make this class a great choice. Lectures aren't very engaging, but you don't have to go to them.",
    "Yes, great fifth class.",
    "just go to the screenings",
    "If you want to improve your understanding of world film, go for it!",
    "Very much so; lively & engaging.",
    "Absolutely! Do yourself a favor and take this course. Especially if Professor Figlerowicz is teaching. This was probably my favorite course I've taken at Yale. The section was my favorite section. I learned so much and read\/watched so much good literature and it became a really good source of de-stressing. It was a pleasure and I wish I could take it again.",
    "I would recommend this course. The reading material is light, and the workload is simple and allows for much discussion of the films, which themselves are conversation worthy.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested or thinks they might be interested in cinema on an international (transnational?) scale.",
    "I'm torn about what to say here - I enjoyed the course in that the films were all great and discussions in section were very helpful to understanding the film from a variety of perspectives. However, I found the lectures to be loosely structured and generally hard to follow or to connect to the material I was watching or reading about for the class. I would say that I could have probably gained as much information about these films just by watching each one at home and then looking them up and reading the corresponding pages on IMDB and Wikipedia. That said, this can be a great 5th class to anyone with a weighty course load who is looking to watch a few great films and think about them critically. These films tend to be much more down-to-earth than Hollywood Blockbusters, and may get you hooked on international film.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to students who enjoy thinking about the world through movies."
