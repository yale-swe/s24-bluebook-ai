    "French 110 is well-taught. It's not easy and is quite demanding, with weekly tests, short compositions, and lengthy workbook exercises, but it's worth your time. The weekly video lessons are fun and the course chair Prof. Ngame does a great job walking you through them. I took Spanish in high school so this was my first exposure to the language, and I came away from it feeling infinitely more proficient than when I started. I also like that it does a good job balancing speaking, listening, reading, and writing. For me (perhaps due to my romance language background), the fact that the course is taught entirely in French was not a big issue, but I guess I could see how it could be problematic for some. That said, my teacher was very accommodating if we needed a specific word translated to English. Professor Carr was fantastic. She has exquisite command over both French and English. She was accommodating in terms of deadlines and taught well. Her feedback was helpful on compositions as well. I definitely would recommend her as a section teacher.",
    "FREN 110 06 is an introductory course on the French Language conducted in French for students with little to no knowledge of French. I would definitely recommend it to another student because I feel that I have learned a lot of french in a single semester regardless of never having taken a French class before. I love the French department because I feel that many of them are invested in our success within the classroom.",
    "I would summarize French 110 as a moderately tough course. I would note that it is necessary to spend every day studying, or it is easy to fall behind, but if you study every day, the course isn't too difficult. I would recommend the course to another student, as I thought it was an extremely comprehensive introduction to the language.",
    "A challenging intro to french.",
    "FREN 110 is a fast and intensive course, but expect to have a solid foundation of speaking and comprehending French once you finish. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to learn French."
