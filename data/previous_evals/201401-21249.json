   "comments": [
    "Take it take it take it! Best class at Yale, amazing professor! Even if you don't feel compelled to take a course on Canadian history, take it anyways. I 100% guarantee you will not regret your decision.",
    "I really enjoyed this class! I hadn't really questioned American historical narratives until now and I had just assumed that Canadian history couldn't be that different from American history. So I was pretty surprised when we talked about the Canadian perspective on the War of 1812, the cultural genocide of the Acadiens, the KKK in Maine (no... not Maine!!), \"speak white\" (a phrase that anglophone Canadians would say to francophones), the naming of the Civil War vs the Revolution... It has gotten me thinking about other issues of perspective (e.g. why is it that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not considered crimes against humanity...).",
    "Although Jay Gitlin is a great guy and he, Dean B, and Logan were all very knowledgeable about Canadian history, I didn't really enjoy this seminar. Way too much reading meant a lot of people didn't do it, and not enough of a base timeline was given before delving into interpretations. Plus, seminar is almost all lecture (a lot of it tangential or not cohesive) and not much discussion.",
    "Good choice if you are looking to learn about an oft-neglected country in terms of world history. Seeing how close we live, it's worth it to know a bit more. Also, be aware that you are mostly looking at Quebec. You won't mention Vancouver or anything to the west (with few exceptions). Worthwhile!",
    "If you really want to learn about French Canada -- this course has wonderful readings, and the professors know their stuff. And there's just so so so much cool stuff in Canadian history to learn about. The surge in KKK popularity in 1920s Maine (more members than in any Southern state!). What a North American history can look like that's not an American one (at least if you're American, that's a useful alternate perspective.) The racialization of French identity, how land allocation methods affect the evolution of social institutions. So yeah, a lot of good stuff. But the intellectual expectations are pretty low -- you can do this class without doing any readings for it, as I did. I'd definitely recommend for someone who wants a no-work class to fill out their schedule. But if you have higher hopes, I mean, it just feels like there's so much unfilled potential in this class.",
    "This was a very interesting class but too often felt like a lecture as opposed to a seminar.",
    "Yes and no. The class is great: you'll learn a lot and come away with a totally different perspective on things you thought you knew a lot about. That being said, be prepared for it to basically be a lecture.",
    "This class is entertaining, though not particularly rigorous. Take it! You won't regret your decision.",
    "Interesting and fun! Makes people realize that Canadian history is important",
    "This is a great class! Professor Gitlin always makes sure class is lively and engaging. We get snacks during every class and go out for poutine after one of the classes at the end of the semester. There is also essentially no work, especially considering it's a junior seminar. A midterm and final paper and readings during the weeks, but Gitlin is a pretty unorganized, so it's very likely you won't cover the reading material at all during class. It ends up being a lot less of a discussion and more of Gitlin talking at you, but since he's such a character it's worth it! It does get frustrating how unorganized he is, but overall this is a fabulous class that I would highly recommend taking."
