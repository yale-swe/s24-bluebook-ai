   "comments": [
    "In the first half of the class, learned a lot about panel data methods, GMM, asymptotic statistics. In the second half of the class learned a lot about nonparametric methods including selection models, local polynomial regression, and the regression discontinuity design.",
    "This class is a continuation of ECON 136 and runs through several important methods in applied microeconomics. It's super useful if you're interested in econ research or are writing a thesis. Some topics include panel data, regression discontinuity, multinomial discrete choice, and much more.",
    "Built upon baseline knowledge of econometrics from ECON136. Developed a solid understanding of modern econometric techniques and various different ways to analyze data (i.e. panel data, nonlinear estimation, nonparametric methods). Learned how to replicate the results of published econometric papers.",
    "Many more econometric methods!",
    "I learnt about more econometric methods (building off ECON 136) including time series, regression discontinuity, IV analyses. I particularly enjoyed doing the two papers -- carrying out replication, robustness checks and expansions of existing papers really drove home the learnings from the class and have made me better at judging the validity of econometric methods and results.",
    "Whirlwind tour of various econometric methods. Natural extension of ECON 135\/136. You get to apply certain methods by replicating and extending landmark economic papers - this was super enlightening for me (I got practice writing a real empirical paper with code I wrote myself)",
    "Topics in an introductory graduate level econometrics course: review on OLS, GLS, IV and GMM, binary choice models, panel (and dynamic panel) data, (briefly) bootstrapping, M-estimation and MLE, NLS, limited dependent variables and (briefly) censored regression, regression discontinuity, causal inference, and quantile regression."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Content and quality of instruction are the two biggest strengths of the class. In both halves of the semester, problem sets were incredibly conducive to learning and taught us how to think about key theoretical and practical results.",
    "Overall, this course was excellent. It was a great way to learn about econometrics. One possible way this course could be improved is if the methods we were learning were grounded more in real world applications. At times, I would have appreciated knowing more about what type of real world situation a model could be applied to.",
    "Strengths: I was a big fan of the topics covered in this course, as it gave me a taste of what studying econometrics might look like in graduate school. We got a pretty broad survey of modern econometric techniques, and we didn't linger on any specific topic\/method for too long. I feel like I can now read most (if not all) of published econometrics papers and understand at least some of the technical details. The class was also tiny (7 students total), which was great. It was low workload only a weekly problem set and two presentations\/papers but taught me a lot. Kitamura and Armstrong are great. Weaknesses: It was sometimes a little tough to transition so roughly between all of the topics in the course. But that was only to be expected, as I think the professors deliberately wanted to cover as many econometric methods\/techniques as possible.",
    "A great walk through of different econometric methods very similar to ECON 136.",
    "Strengths: the material, papers and professors -- the class was almost perfect and I really liked the small size too Weaknesses: the teaching section of the class felt quite theoretical and there were times I didn't really know in which context to \"apply\" a given method till I started writing one of the two papers. I wish that instead of the psets in some weeks we could have readings utilizing given methods \/ find another way to involve the \"applied\" component more in the teaching (talking about contexts and research designs more actively in class), than relegating it to the homework itself.",
    "The course was overall very enjoyable! The material was structured, and I appreciated the rigorous treatment of the math behind a lot of important econometric tools. Sometimes though, the class felt very theoretical, and I wished there was time devoted to anchoring the material to real-life applications. Maybe a quick discussion after each topic to discuss when we should use the method (and go through examples or ask each student to generate their own), how it compares to other methods, what parameters (e.g. choice of kernel, degree of local polynomial) that people use in practice, what assumptions one should empirically test in your data to ensure that the method employed is valid, and whether there is econometric work that has extended the basic model.",
    "Strengths: Both Professors Kitamura and Armstrong gave good lecture notes, and I learned a lot through the two reports in the course (take an econometrics paper, replicate the main results, and do some robustness checks). This course teaches a lot of material with a very reasonable workload. Weaknesses: I think (at times) the homework in the second half of the course could have included more applications to offset the theoretical content of the lectures."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would! Though definitely do get started on the projects early. We got lucky the first time around when the Professor gave us an extension on the paper.",
    "Yes, absolutely, if you are seriously interested in Economics. That being said this course is theoretical and abstract, so if you really want to learn applied skills, this might not be the class for you. (They are still applied econometric models, but the problem sets, at least in part, are rooted in the theory behind them.)",
    "If you enjoyed ECON136, and want to learn more about the field of econometrics. I'd highly recommend this course. You'll learn all about why almost everything you learned in ECON136 is severely limited in practice (i.e., OLS) and how to use various other, more effective techniques. However, I do admit that the name of this course \"Applied Microeconometrics\" does feel a little bit like a misnomer, as much of what we cover in class is theoretical and statistical in nature.",
    "Yes",
    "Definitely! Especially if you are thinking of writing a thesis. I had taken ECON 438 before this class and was apprehensive that it might be redundant but 420 is structured much better than 438 (though 438 gives you more leeway to devise your own research question). If you like econometrics, I'd recommend taking both classes if you have the time (probably not in the same semester though).",
    "Yes, absolutely! The course is designed for students to learn rather than to worry about their grades. The workload is fairly low compared to other ECON courses, and the material is important and relevant for students planning to work in applied economics or statistics.",
    "Yes, if you took metrics (e.g. 136) and you want to go more in depth and learn some new topics, then this is a great course to take. Note that it is a bit more theoretical\/dry than some of the other 400 level econometrics courses offered."
