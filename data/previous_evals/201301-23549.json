    "This is one of the few oceanography courses available to F&ES graduate students, and is an excellent overview of the physical and biological processes of the ocean.",

I would also recommend Denny's Oceanography textbook (how the ocean works). It's well-written and covers most of the topics we reviewed in class. And cheaper than the eChapters."

I wish I had bought the Garrison chapters in the beginning, but I wasn't sure how necessary it would be. Some aspects of the course seemed a little disorganized, and a reference text book would have been useful.",
    "I think given that FES has so few marine\/coastal classes it would be great if they could coordinate so they compliment each other without repeating each other. Particuarly with coastal ecosystems, this class was a good extension of that - but it would have been even more valuable without the redundancies.Also I think student presentations are great, but it would be better to just have 1 a class period. Maybe one idea would be to have a presentation at the beginning or middle of the lecture? Then that would make everyone pay more attention to presentations and would break up the lectures. Also I think there's space in the syllabus to cover a few more topics (migratory species? Corals? Mangroves? High latitude ecosystems? Seasonal variations? More on fisheries?)"
