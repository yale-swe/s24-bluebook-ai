   "comments": [
    "You learn tons of useful (and in my nerdy opinion, fun) organic reactions and how they work.",
    "Organic chemistry basics, stereochemistry, reactions",
    "Drawing organic molecules, learning many reaction mechanisms, understanding of molecular orbitals, understanding of how bonding happens, etc.",
    "By taking this course, I learned how to conceptualize organic molecules and the mechanisms that dictate the reactions they undergo. With this knowledge, I can rationalize why molecules interact with each other in the way that they do.",
    "In this class, I learned the language of organic chemistry. I learned how to predict both the products of reactions and the mechanisms leading to these products. I also overcame many of the stereotypes behind organic chemistry (for example, the idea that it is only about memorizing naming systems). Furthermore, I learned a variety of terms and practices that should facilitate my future understanding of organic chemistry.",
    "I learnt how to see stereochemistry of molecules and reactions.",
    "The first semester of organic chemistry allowed for me to explore a very specific area of chemistry for the first time, and I absolutely loved it. Professor Slavoff introduced this sometimes daunting subject in a very organized, clear, and approachable way.",
    "I learned the basics of organic chemistry? I honestly don't know how to explain it, but *something* was taught. I'm sorry this isn't helpful.",
    "I learned how to predict reactions, what types of reactions can occur, and types of molecules that can be created.",
    "I learned a lot about the way in which organic molecules react with one another.",
    "Organic chemistry",
    "I learned about several organic chemistry reactions and how to analytically think about chemistry and reactions in general."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Good pace in terms of difficulty and time spent on each lesson",
    "No improvements that I can think of.",
    "It's a hard class, so doing practice problems often is crucial. The Sapling sets and written homework help with that, but doing other problems out of the book is also helpful.",
    "Strengths: Professor Slavoff is a very good teacher and her lectures are very thorough. Class material is interesting. Grading is fair and encouraging. Weaknesses: Sometimes the pacing of the class is a little bit off, with some portions of the semester seeming much more information-packed than others. Better pacing in the lectures could remedy this maybe.",
    "I believe this course did a good job of introducing us to many of the organic reactions we needed to know. Especially now, looking back at the order in which we learned concepts, I realized that they were very well organized and built off of previously learned concepts well. The exams were very fair, drawing completely on the concepts learned in class. A weakness of this course was that it started off incredibly slow, with a recap of some general chemistry concepts, but in the last week or two of classes, it seemed a bit rush. Luckily, much of the course in the middle seemed well-paced. I think if there was a way to more evenly spread out some of the material from the end of the course, it would be a bit less overwhelming. This class was challenging, but the expectations were clear, so it was manageable.",
    "The teaching was great although she began to go too fast over the material near the end. Section wasn't helpful so I ended up skipping them. The material was interesting and the textbook helped. Overall a solid intro class.",
    "Strengths: - Good emphasis on the concepts, and not just on memorization - Provides an amazing foundation for learning more organic chemistry - VERY useful practice problems on Sapling Weaknesses: - It would be nice to discuss nomenclature more, though it is true that it is not as commonly used as I once believed - Would have been fun to have more multi-step syntheses, though I suspect that we'll see more of these in the next semester of organic chemistry",
    "Answer keys to practice exams could have been provided. A great strength of the course is that it drops the lowest-scoring exam, so every exam did not feel as stressful as it would have been otherwise.",
    "This class was incredible. Lectures were at a good pace, engaging, and truly exciting. The workload was very manageable and all of the assignments truly felt like they were helping me understand concepts more fully as opposed to being busy work or confusing. Tests were also very fair and truly tested the material we were taught in class. I honestly can't offer any points of criticism. I loved this course.",
    "I liked the teaching style and how many resources we had, and I also liked how the homework and tests were structured. I wish the keys to the practice tests had solutions so we could study how the answers were gotten, and learn from it",
    "The course all of a sudden speeds up at the end. The pace of mechanisms and reactions we needed to learn was pretty manageable for the first part. I worked at it every day, but doing problems and understanding concepts was key. Then the last two weeks were a lot of memorization and a bit of an overload. If I had been prepared for that, I might have handled it better.",
    "Strengths: -multiple exams gave students more opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge -enough homework for us to practice the material but not so much that we were overwhelmed -Professor Slavoff Weaknesses: -discussion section often felt like a waste of time -the pacing seemed inconsistent. We moved more slowly at first but by the last couple of weeks it felt like we rushed through three chapters just to finish the syllabus",
    "This course is a friendly introduction to organic chemistry under Prof. Slavoff. However, the knowledge is cumulative and goes very quickly. Prof. Slavoff focuses on teaching you the fundamental principles of organic chemistry so that you can apply this knowledge to multiple scenarios, but you have to really absorb this material quickly. It is really easy to get lost.",
    "I thought the class was overall well organized but could potentially give more in class practice of reactions that resembled the reactions given on tests.",
    "This course moved very very quickly. If you did not read or do practice problems each night it was easy to fall behind.",
    "There was a lot of work to do which made it easier to learn the material."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, yes, yes. I loved this class, and I thought it was very well-taught and enjoyable. Not too much work by any means, either.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, Professor Slavoff is amazing.",
    "Only take Orgo if you have to, and if you have the option, take it in the spring with Sarah. Her notes are very clear, there's a lot less people, and your grade is not just based on exams. The homework is what I really appreciated about this course. I think it's something that should be implemented in the fall, when the course is taken by many more students.",
    "I would recommend taking this course with Slavoff if you can and take it off season. The class sizes are smaller and its easier to follow the material and ask questions during lecture. If you put in the time and effort studying it will pay off.",
    "Yes!!! Organic chemistry is necessary to a lot of major tracks, but taking it with Professor Slavoff is definitely the way to go.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I preferred the smaller class size that came with taking this class in the spring, as opposed to fall when most people take it. I also really enjoyed Sarah's lecture style and the fair exams that tested what we knew, without trying to trick us. If somebody has to take organic chemistry, I think this is the course to take!",
    "If a student wants to or needs to take orgo, I'd recommend this course. Professor slag off taught well and made fair assessments and I felt like I had learned a lot by the end of the semester.",
    "This is a great foundational course for organic chemistry, as well as an amazing application of the principles learned in general chemistry. I highly recommend it to any that are interested in continuing to explore the wonderful world of chemistry.",
    "Organic chemistry is so much fun. You come to comprehend so much, and it all makes logical sense! You're not memorizing, you're understanding. It's beautiful.",
    "I mean.... no, but not because of the instructor, just the class itself. I am not fond of organic chemistry in the least. But this was the better teacher I had to take it.",
    "Yes! I highly, highly recommend Professor Slavoff. She is incredibly dedicated and was wonderful to meet with me before class. The size of the class was also a major plus. But in general, the content was the most relevant to medicine that I've studied so far, so as a premed I was easily excited by it. It's kind of a game, predicting reactions, and I really enjoyed it.",
    "If you plan on taking Organic Chemistry you would do very well to take it with professor Slavoff",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who had to take organic chemistry. If you enjoy it, take it with Prof. Slavoff. If you're trying to fulfill a requirement, still take it with Prof. Slavoff. This is the best course I've taken in the chemistry department so far.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student unless he\/she needed to take organic chemistry to fulfill a requirement.",
    "I would only really recommend the course if you know that organic chemistry is something you are really passionate about.",
    "I stared taking orgo in the fall but dropped it, and taking it in the spring was one of eh best decisions I ever made. It's a smaller class and has more homework, but the homework actually helps with learning. If you can take orgo 1 in the spring, do it."
