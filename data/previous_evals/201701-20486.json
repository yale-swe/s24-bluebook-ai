    "I learned how to set up an experiment with the help of my post doc and PI and see it through as best I could.",
    "This course was instrumental in teaching me the fundamentals of experimental design and doing original research in a laboratory setting.",
    "I mean, it was independent research, so I learned all about how to write a scientific paper by virtue of having to write a scientific paper. There was also a lot of statistics happening. Generally, conventions of writing a paper for publication in biology.",
    "I worked on my senior thesis research project, learning about writing scientific papers and designing research.",
    "Conducting independent research, I learned how to be self-sufficient & make my own work schedule. I also learned more about the scientific process in general, and especially about the process post-field season. I also learned how to give a good scientific presentation.",
    "Data collection and analysis, scientific writing and reporting"

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The senior symposium at the very end was great to hear what everyone else had done for their projects. The course may have benefited by having an event before the end of the semester for us to speak informally with one another about our projects and get a sense of what we all are doing, perhaps in the fall for people doing two-semester projects or who had done it over the previous summer. I felt it would be nice to exchange ideas before the end.",
    "This course is good at allowing students to be independent and drive their research in their own time and be responsible for deadlines. It really helps build a relationship between the student and the advisor.",
    "Research varies so widely across everyone in the major that it is difficult to name strengths and weaknesses. It might have been nice to have everyone in the major meet as a group near the beginning of the semester to hear about others' projects and to exchange ideas and feedback.",
    "I would have hoped that there would be more interaction between Post Doc and PI, but I understand that it is hard to coordinate in just one semester. I think that research options should only be available to those that choose to devote one year to it.",
    "I think one weakness of the course is the inability to realy gage how many hours students are putting into the lab setting. I was working an average of 30 hours per week, but for one research credit. I think a definite strenth though is how much the DUS gudies you.",
    "I like the freedom of thesis topic choice given within the EEB major. The guidelines and expectations for the requirements were very fair.",
    "Structure of \"course\" is completely based on you\/your PI\/your mentor. So choosing a good project\/PI\/mentor is pretty important in how conducting senior research makes you feel. Other than that, personally a strength was that it was self-directed; a weakness would be that since it's self-directed, sometimes working on research can fall by the wayside when life\/other classes get too time-consuming."

   "comments": [
    "As a student in the major you are requried to take this course.",
    "Yes, but be prepared for the workload to be directly dependent on your adviser and project. It's pretty hard to predict and may devour your life for an indeterminate length of time. You learn a ton, but just be prepared.",
    "Yes!",
    "Take it if you don't see yourself spending 20 hours per week working on your senior research project, whether it's research or writing a review paper. I kind of wish I had taken the intensive course, like I did in the fall, because I did end up spending lots more time than expected working on my research. I had chosen to take this research credit because I wanted to take more Yale courses (#seniorspring) but I sometimes found myself wishing during the semester that I had chosen to take the intensive because I was spending the same amount of time anyway. So before you decide between this course and the intensive course, think about how much time is left in your project, and how much time you're willing to put into it.",
    "I'd definitely recommend doing senior research as an EEB student; good experience & can go on the resume. Pick a lab and advisor that you really like and it won't feel like you're doing work at all."
