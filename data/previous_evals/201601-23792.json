    "this is almost a cs gut. the four psets (originally six, but cut down to four due to scheduling problems) take about 6-10 hours each, and the testing is not like eisenstat's. you might learn something interesting in class, but the effort required to attend it given the lack of exams and quizzes may prove to be too much to overcome.",
    "Work: was supposed to be 6 PSets but ended up being only 4, plenty of time to do them all. Each builds on the previous assignment: you are building a decentralized service with more and more functionality each time (durability, replication & availability, transactions & scalability). Content: This class is literally Cloud Computing 101. EVERYONE should take it. The content is super useful and applicable to any job. Plus, Mahesh is great about covering ancillary topics to help you better understand their cloud counterparts (for example virtual machines). Professor: Mahesh is amazing. It is the first time he taught the class so it is a little disorganized, but he never penalizes the students for that (i.e. he cuts assignments to be accommodating or will re-explain things that were not explained well). Conclusion: Great content, chill workwise, and great programming practice. Take it.",
    "Pretty unorganized the first time around but I think it will be better the second time. The topics were interesting, and they are about industry standard practices -- not often addressed in Yale CS classes. Mahesh was great, but he didn't plan the course well. The assignments and lectures were a far cry from Stan's well organized psets, lacking details and test cases. The lectures seemed off the cusp at many points. Again though, I think these things will greatly improve next year after he has already taught the course once. I would be very excited to take it next year!"
