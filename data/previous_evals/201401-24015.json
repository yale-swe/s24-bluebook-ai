    "Q1 -- Readings could be updated to reflect some emerging issues (e.g.; capacity markets and other revenue streams for renewable energy and impact investing). Still, I enjoyed many of the original conceptual readings (e.g.; Rose and excerpts from the book about finance)Q2 -- Long essay assignments were a useful forcing mechanism for me to reflect and write... still didn't like them.",
    "I thought the midterm and final were useful assignments, but somewhat redundant. Perhaps set up severalconsulting projects so that students can write papers for actual clients. I thought the small group discussions were really valuable, but there were too many questions to reasonably get through in one hour.",
    "The PowerPoints were pretty abysmal with lots of ellipses and disorganized text. The structure and overall execution of the course material was at times hard to follow. The course needed to start off with the assumption that students had zero legal or private investment background and build from there. I felt that it was at times all over the place and that just looking over the syllabus one can see the complete chaos and overlapping themes that underscore the lack of a simple and structured approach. And although the course must be taught by a lawyer with knowledge in private investment and environmental law, it is more important-given the subject matter-that the material be organized, accessible, and structured. I found this to be the greatest weakness of the course.It was also offensive to have the TAs tick off a check mark every time the students spoke during small group to indicate participation. We are, after all, adults and I found this distracting and offensive.",
    "Re # 4: My frustration with this course was mainly that it oscillated between being too simplistic and then suddenly too complex. More specifically, the material covered in lectures often seemed pretty obvious but as soon as we started discussing specific examples the language would get very technical and become hard to follow.",
    "Great to learn from an actual, practicing professional in the field (rather than academic)."

    "Content -- focus on the role of private property in society, with specific legal tools that apply to the intersection of private property and the environment.",
    "The small group discussions and the midterm. Mark was also really responsive to questions and had some really interesting investing experience to bring to the table.",
    "The subject area was of great interest to me and very relevant to my career. It was helpful to have students speak up and engage in the material.",
    "I think this course and the material covered is incredibly important for individuals interested in environmental business and law.",
    "The discussion section was extremely helpful in reinforcing\/clarifying concepts from lecture and getting different viewpoints from students with a broad range of backgrounds.",
    "The best part of this course was that the professor gave us a great deal of flexibility in choosing what to write about in our term papers. I appreciated that we were encouraged to apply the course concepts to our specific areas of interest.",
    "Professor was very professional and knowledgeable. Discussion sessions were excellent, a great feature of the course. Alex (TA) did a great job running ours. Great complement to classroom lectures and readings - the opportunity to discuss informally.",
    "This course covers a wide range of concepts that are extremely helpful in advancing environmental aims through collaboration with the private sector. This applied and practical focus was great and was my favorite aspect of the course. Additionally, the readings were very helpful and often provided examples of real world applications of concepts. Also, I really appreciated that the midterm and final papers allowed each student to apply the course concepts to his\/ her area of interest."

   "comments": [
    "Could be strengthened by covering a broader range of environmental issues (tended to veer towards clean tech)",
    "The lectures were a bit dry at times, and I think there were too many readings, and too many questions to cover in the small group discussions. I also think the midterm and final were too similar and felt redundant. As I suggested above, perhaps setting up a consulting opportunity with outside clients would be great.",
    "Professor is really dry. The slides are full of text. It's really easy to zone out. The subject matter is interesting, but deAngelis was just really kind of monotone, and didn't come off as a super trustworthy source on all of the topics. A lot of people do email during class. Also, the reading list REALLY needs work. There are 20+ readings per week, and a lot of them are from the 90's. They aren't referenced in class, so there is no real reason to read them. The list really needs to be updated and shortened.",
    "The structure of the assignments and syllabus, PowerPoints, and the overall organization of the course needs a bit of a makeover.",
    "The lectures were often broad, and it was difficult to gain a deeper understanding of concepts.",
    "The lectures need to be improved. Admittedly it was the professor's first time teaching this course which was actually designed by Brad Gentry but I felt that Mark was not as familiar with the material as I would have expected. The examples from his relevant professional experience were helpful but as I said before, they were ultimately hard to follow because of the technical language, jargon, and acronyms used to discuss them.I realized about halfway through the semester that my chief complaint about this class stemmed from the fact that it should have a prerequisite. I was hoping to gain and understanding of how to recruit and direct private capital toward solutions to environmental problems but I was previously unfamiliar with investments and how financial deals are structured. As a result, I often felt dumped into the deep end on assignments because I was unprepared to undertake the analysis asked of us. While I understood the concepts we were taught, I was unfamiliar with the financial tools were supposed to apply them to. This did not feel like an introductory course that was accessible to someone without a financial background.",
    "I was satisfied with the course.",
    "The instructor's explanations of concepts were not always as clear as they could be, and sometimes assumed a prior knowledge of business concepts and terminology that students without this background, like myself, do not necessarily have. This made it hard for me to follow the lectures at certain points. Also, class lectures tended to skip over parts of the slides that discussed sectors other than clean energy, such as forestry or climate change policy under the UNFCCC, etc, while instead heavily emphasizing the clean energy sector. I would have liked to have discussed more diverse sectors in class."

Unfortunately while I learned about overriding legal regimes, I did not get the introduction into investments that I hoped to gain in this course. I now understand some relevant private investment terminology but did not gain insights into how to structure a deal from start to finish. It seemed to be assumed that we already knew this. Since this knowledge was fairly necessary for completing assignments effectively and creatively, there needs to be a prerequisite for this course or the course needs to be altered to make it more accessible.",
