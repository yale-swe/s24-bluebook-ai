   "comments": [
    "American Economic History was an enjoyable and laid back tour through economic developments in America's history. I would recommend it to anybody interested in economic topics. There were three 5-6 page papers, with a heavier weighting towards the latter two. We also had a midterm and a final, which were pretty straightforward.",
    "Wasn't wild about this one. Coursework isn't too bad and the material should be interesting (though I felt it really wasn't presented well). But all three papers are given without a prompt which was a bit challenging but not too bad in the end.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student only if you have an interest in both economics and U.S. History.",
    "Do the readings. They are good and carefully selected. If you do them this class is a lot of work. 3 papers, midterm, final and with mandatory discussion sections. You can avoid doing the readings if you want but you won't get nearly as much from the course.",
    "This is a great history course for quantitative thinkers. There are a lot of readings, but they usually contain empirical work which can be very interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course because I think it's important to know our economic history in order to understand the present day debates and issues we are facing. I will admit, however, that if you got the wrong professor, the material could all be rather dry. The coursework was manageable, but steady, with three 5-page papers, a midterm, and a final. In the past, I know the class didn't have a midterm, but they had a 15-20 page paper due at the end, and I think this schedule was preferable. If Jaya is still a TA when you take it, DEFINITELY try to get her.",
    "I would not recommend this class due to the quality of grading.",
    "yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. It's a class that teaches you a lot about how the United States came to be how it is today, which is an important thing to learn, I think. On top of that, it's a boon for economics majors since you get a writing credit too. It's even better for dual-econ\/history majors such as myself since I can kill two birds with one stone.",
    "This course is great for econ majors: you can get a writing credit and econ credit with one course! Honestly, there are better econ, history, or writing courses at Yale, so only take it if you love American Economic History (I do) or are an econ major. The workload is not soul crushing, but sizable.",
    "Easy writing credit, disappointing history class. Maybe if someone else was teaching.",
    "The topic is really interesting and it is a great way to get a writing credit. The readings are not too bad. However, the lectures can be dry at times although I would definitely recommend the class",
    "Pretty good course for a general overview of Am Economic history",
    "A lot of boring reads. I find it hard to imagine that somebody would want to read over 50 pages of mining laws, and there's definitely better writing\/econ\/history classes out there.",
    "Overall a good course if you are an Econ major also in need of a WR. Fairly straightforward, there's not much to add that's not in the syllabus.",
    "If you have the slightest interest in economics, politics, or the intersection of both, take this class. It will teach you how people in the past grappled with economic\/political problems that are still important until this day. \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\" -- follow George Santayana's advice and take this class.",
    "Great writing and econ credit",
    "A somewhat boring class on an interesting topic. Take it for the easy writing credit and\/or if you like economic history. Lectures are like mini classes of their own; there is almost no overall narrative structure to the course. Parts of the class will be fascinating, but the vast majority of it is very dry and unnecessarily detailed.",
    "It was a good course, but should be approached with thorough economic and historic knowledge beforehand.",
    "American Economic History was a good overview of the making of America's economic system up to the present day. However, the way the class was taught, I found it super boring. Also, under Prof. Lamoreaux, this class definitely is no longer a gut. The three papers were actually pretty difficult to write because, although short, they had to be written on the weirdest and most random primary source documents. Overall, not too bad though and if you are a joint history\/economics major, this class is essentially a must take.",
    "Absolute waste of time unless the only thing you care about is an easy writing credit\/class.",
    "There are better writing credits",
    "No overarching themes, papers were often ridiculously specific and largely irrelevant, barely talked about post-war period If you're into that, go for it. Try to get a law student as TA since they often grade easier",
    "Definitely recommend, a solid economics\/American history course that also provided a good opportunity to improve my writing ability",
    "Had high expectations and was underwhelmed. There are so many better courses to take for a writing credit or an econ credit, and usually with fewer assignments.",
    "A class based on good material but can get a bit boring at some points",
    "Great course to provide an overview of economics and how it can shape, or be shaped, by the political and social factors of history.",
    "Good class, easy writing credit. Take it. Shop TAs",
    "Fairly unexciting survey of American Economic history with a lot of focus on seemingly meaningless subjects in the 1800s compared to the exciting topics of 1900s. Professor Lamoreaux is pretty good though, but the lectures can be on very boring topics, and papers are based on one insanely obscure document like a scanned, hard to read copy of local California mining laws in the mid 1800s.",
    "Great class.",
    "Incredibly boring given how much interesting stuff there is within the topic. She chose the three least like readings of the course to make us write our essays on. The boring primary source, no prompt essays were not fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course!",
    "No, I would not if Professor Lamoreaux is teaching.",
    "Nice introduced to US history",
    "Great course for those interested in the material, plus a writing credit.",
    "It's a historical analysis class, but if you want a recent study of pure economic events since 1950, don't take it. Take it if you love history and want to learn about nuances of economic events in the past",
    "Would recommend it for any students interested in Economics and American history.",
    "ECON 182 was a great course that showed the strong intersection between history and economics. It is a great course for any student as it explains some theories of the complicated topic of economic development. We are exposed to the arguments of government policy, factor endowments, and other considerations.",
    "Best part of the class is that it is a writing credit in the econ major. However, primary sources for papers are very boring, the first one was about a paddler who wrote a diary where he either cried or wrote how he wants to become rich and the second one was about mining laws in California from the 1860s. Only the third paper, a diary kept during the Great Depression was interesting. Also, a big problem for writing the papers was that secondary sources were not allowed to be used. Midterm and final were ok though, pretty straightforward."
