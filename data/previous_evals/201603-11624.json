   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about Russian art history and art history in general. Seeing Russian art in the context of Russian history and culture and European art and culture helped me understand Russian culture and political climate much better.",
    "In this class I learned how to write a strong, argumentative art history paper and conduct visual analysis. I also learned a tremendous amount about the subject of the course, in greater depth than I would have expected from a survey course.",
    "While I had some background in the material, I was surprised by the thoroughness of the course considering it was a survey course. Professor Brunson provided us with an extremely well vetted list of materials and readings that thoroughly enhanced my understanding of the topic.",
    "Not only did this class give me a broad, yet detailed overview of Russian art since 1757, but it also introduced me to several interesting themes in art history from a new angle. For example, studying the rise of modernism in Russia as compared to western European countries helped me investigate the connection between life and art. I also developed my visual analysis skills.",
    "This was a great introduction to art history. I learned how to write a formal analysis, how to consider artwork as a product of history, and how movements are connected. I also appreciated the amount of primary literature included in the course, as well as a non-Western centric approach.",
    "I learned to formally analyze a piece of art as well as to connect it with larger ideological motives and moveements.",
    "Prof. Brunson's survey helped to fill out a gap in my training before coming to Yale University. My undergraduate work built up a wide cross-section of art-historical and visual-analytical skills, and I had a general education in Russian history and culture through my previous institution's Slavic Languages and Literatures department. However, I had never worked on Russian art in a classroom environment. Russian art was always the province of independent research (too narrow) or was a supplement--an illustration--to written texts (too broad, too scanty). I can't underestimate how important it is to be able to better situate my specific preoccupations within a long history of Russian art. The course has made me more receptive to the Russian 18th century than I was before. I've already been able to direct fellow students interested in the political stakes of tapestries to Komar and Melamid banners, or hold my own on issues of photography through the synthetic portrait-snapshot apparatus. I've been able to watch the scholarship of Rosalind Blakesley evolve from Y2K to the present day; I've arrived at a more nuanced reading of Christopher Ely's work; I've come to appreciate the looming historiography of Boris Groys; the TMSS is now on my radar. The course's readings have really helped to consolidate a large archive of Russian arts writings, which in turn have gone on to bear fruit in other writing projects outside the class's scope."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I believe that the course is incredibly strong as is and does not require any improvement.",
    "There is nothing I would change about this class. It is amazing. One of the best lecture courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Brunson's lectures are incredibly engaging and well organized. Each lecture logically builds on the last, to the point that when I was reviewing for the final I felt like I had always known the foundational information from the beginning of the course. The course also has a well-articulated thesis which makes it easy to follow the lectures.",
    "I really appreciate the format of the class, a survey course requires a more traditional lecture structure to stay on task, and I felt despite the short length of the course all of my time there was well spent. The overarching argument and narrative threads of the course were substantial and engaging.",
    "This course is wonderful!! Molly Brunson is amazing",
    "Perhaps include an introductory \"what is art history\" lecture for students who have never taken the course before.",
    "Interesting interesting material, poetic lectures but it's a lot of material that sometimes I found it difficult to keep up and know what exactly I needed to know",
    "I really liked the course and don't really have many critiques",
    "Prof. Brunson's meta-narratives were lucid and helpful. The creation of an artistic class in the 18th century, the formation of a national school in the 19th century, the move towards abstraction and Russia's stake in modernism without its own modernity, the complicity or innocence of the Russian avant-garde in building socialism--these motifs helped to quickly carve out the topography of the first two-thirds of the class. The last \"movement\" of the class was swift, and felt very much like a denouement, drawing to a close with the close of the Soviet Union. The story for unofficial art, the art of the kitchen table, exile, and diaspora was blurrier, or less easily told. I think this in part had to do with the fact that the withdrawal from or renunciation of \"big historical activity\" per se matched too uncannily onto the political moment in the United States. The distaste for official life that runs through much of that art mingled with the miasma that hung over (and still hangs over) the Academy after the 2016 Presidential Election. It's worth noting that the professor made her most direct allusion to American politics during the module on Stalinism--independent from the phenomena I describe here. The course was consistently taught at a high level. The professor asked her largely undergraduate audience to engage with a trove of scholarly literature. Most strikingly, the professor maintained a consistently critical, analytical tone throughout her lectures. Many of the lectures were written as arguments, admittedly with adequate room left open for students to form their own opinions--not so strongly presented as to foreclose multiple avenues towards addressing the questions posed. It was this thesis-driven preparation for each class that left the strongest impression on me. Lecture was not the recitation of facts, the elaboration of problems, but it tended to rehearse the kinds of thinking the Professor expected from her students."

    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone, regardless of the major or interest in Russian art specifically. Professor Brunson is an AMAZING lecturer and provides incredible insights into Russian art and culture and art in general. A lot of sections also take place in the YUAG, which is always fun. I can guarantee that you will not regret it if you decide to take this course.",
    "You must take this course. If I had to recommend one HSAR lecture to another student it would be this one. It was absolutely amazing.",
    "For majors and non-majors alike, this class is a great introduction to and in-depth overview of Russian and Soviet art, which is a truly fascinating area of the arts that can be overlooked. Lectures and sections were organized, engaging and well-done. Def take it!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student interested in the subject matter.",
    "An amazing course! Professor Brunson's lectures are engaging and thoughtful, and you'll definitely learn something new. Don't worry if you don't know much about Russian history, you'll get useful overviews in the lectures. The readings are interesting, but the focus is on the art itself. Do the readings though because they're interesting. If you're interested at all in the role of art in public discourse, early Soviet ideas of utopia, the Westernization of Russia in the 18th and 19th centuries, social issues and art, protest culture, etc....take this course! Where else are you going to learn about Catherine the Great and Pussy Riot? Section is great--I can only speak about Izabel but she's encouraging and genuinely wants to push her students to do better. A lot of what you learn is relevant to current events, for better or for worse. Overall, this is a fascinating and fun course with a fair workload. You get to pick a topic for the final essay, which can be really fun if you put enough thought into it.",
    "100% recommend",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. The material is fascinating and Professor Brunson curates an excellent syllabus chockfull of primary sources. She is also an engaging and poised lecturer, and every class is packed with important and interesting information.",
    "Yes because its phenomenally interesting",
    "yes, if they were interested in Russia or Art History",
    "Absolutely. As an introductory survey to three hundred years of Russian art, it served its purpose!"
