    "I wanted to have the best project that I personally had ever done and I feel that this was achieved.",
    "the only expectation not met was to have an exit interview with the critic.",
    "When I chose to take this studio I hoped I would be able to define the conceptual and formal parameters of the project myself. I am happy to have been able to do so and have a great time discussing the opportunities of my project with Prof. Scolari, who always showed an active interest in my work. The problem of designing and fabricating a chair, as well, is an incredible exercise and a great opportunity to engage in; it has been a very enjoyable and rewarding task.",
    "I was hoping to have a more diverse jury for the final review. I know that due to some scheduling complications some of the invited jurors could attend. Unfortunately, for better or worse, the final jury was very similar to the mid-review jury and was composed of nearly all in-house critics. One of the most rewarding aspects about final juries is that you get the chance to get the criticism of \"outsiders\", unfortunately this didn't really happen on either the mid-term or final.",
    "In the very beginning , I was intimidated by the scope of the project. However as the semester advanced I became more and more interested in the work and in turn felt immense satisfaction from the challenge put forth to us in the beginning of the semester."

    "yes",
    "Prof. Scolari has been the greatest intellectual resource throughout the semester: our discussionwere always supplemented by a rich visual and textual set of examples.Also, in addition to Tim, Joshua and Taylor in the shop have been incredible in helping all of us define and complete our chairs; they truly deserve our special gratitude!",
    "Yes, there resources at Yale are second to none and I have few complaints. It was unfortunate that the large mill was down nearly the entire semester. I know that several students could have benefited from it being functional for their chair fabrication; the robot was the only option for large format milling and it was entirely booked by various fabrication seminars.",
    "Yes, the school provided adequate equipment for the project."

   "question_text": "Comment on the most and least valuable aspects of the studio",
   "comments": [
    "The most valuable aspect of the studio were the one on one desk crits and I think the ratio of desk crit to pin-up was perfect. Too many pin ups lead to unnecessary time spent producing final drawings of work that is not ready for that sort of treatment yet.",
    "pin-ups with Massimo were the most valuable.the mid-review and final juries could have been more valuable if we had had more variety in the critics and especially critics from outside the school (there were no critics not affiliated with the school at either the mid- or final-review)",
    "I found that our less frequent, but more lengthy, meetings with Prof. Scolari led to a much more productive semester. It is often quite difficult to produce enough new material to present for discussion on a weekly basis. Therefore, I found quite postitive the more relaxed nature of the studio. Tim, of course, was essential in organizing and pressing us to maintain a functional schedule.",
    "The most valuable aspects were the pin-ups with Massimo. It was great to see how he responded from project to project and further informed my individual decisions regarding my project. As stated previously, one weakness of the studio was the lack of outside jurors or critics.",
    "I appreciated the freedom we were given in the studio. The trust developed by my peers and our critics allowed us develop our own thoughts and ideas with full support from our professors. I valued their approach in asserting confidence in ourselves and our work throughout the semester, not just towards the end. My only suggestion is to add more internal pin-ups during the semester as a way to advance the non-chair portion of the brief."
