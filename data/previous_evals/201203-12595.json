    "Do not take this class unless your instructor speaks some understandable English dialect.",
    "It's a class you take because you need to take it, and if you're going into any math-heavy field you should be very satisfied coming out of it with the amount you've learned, but it's definitely not the sort of class that makes you look forward to the next lecture. Actually, even attending the class is for the most part inessential, since I imagine you could do just fine only by reading the book and looking up the occasional thing online.",
    "Math 120 was a difficult class. Having a good teacher for math can make all the difference, and in my case, the professor wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to my liking, and so I struggled with the course all semester. The work isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t overly difficult, as the only assignments are problem sets, but understanding the concepts come exam time is much more challenging. I would recommend that only those interested in majoring in math consider taking the course; otherwise, it might be better to take something else.",
    "i would recommend it. it is a great continuation of single variable calculus and provides interesting new theorems",
    "Difficult class, particularly due to poor communication with instructor. If you like maths, though, you shouldn't have a problem.",
    "Mathematics 120 13 is a class that one must self-study for. The work in class regularly does not prepare one for the homework assignments or the tests, and the difficulty in understanding the professor does not help in this regard.",
    "Great course. You learn really cool stuff. But, make sure you attend the course with a Professor that can teach well. Perhaps follow online video material to accompany the class (like MIT's lectures). They might save your life."
