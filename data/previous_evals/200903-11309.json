    "i'd recommend the class for any student who wants a taste of what research \/ graduate algebra looks like and learn the basics of some very powerful mathematical tools",
    "This class is quite a step up from 350\/370. You learn a LOT and you won't completely understand half of it. But it's a really good introduction to the important concepts, and it'll challenge you in a good way.Don't take it if you're not a hardcore math person (but I'm sure that will be obvious to you after the first couple lectures).Corina is a decent teacher. Her exams and homeworks are very fair.",
    "You learn modern algebra. Yeah.",
    "It's a really intense course, only take it if you're looking for that.",
    "Probably a little too fast for the undergrads. Not a good idea to mix the undergrad and grad sections together. The undergrads are seeing this subject for the first time. The grad students are using this course for revision."
