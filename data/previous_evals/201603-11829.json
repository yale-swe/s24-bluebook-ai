   "comments": [
    "Greatly influenced the way I approached Latin and allowed me to better understand and be more engaged with the language",
    "Obviously I have a grasp on Latin vocabulary and grammar, but I think the more important skill I learned from this class is the ability to understand Latin's influence. A lot of Indo-European languages are connected and this class shows you how to identify how Latin language is adapted into other ones.",
    "I learned all the basic grammars of Latin.",
    "How to look deeper into texts and read slowly",
    "I managed to increase my foundation and knowledge of Latin derivatives and gain a better understanding of how Latin words and constructions are formed. This skill has also helped me for usage in languages in general, especially Romance languages.",
    "As someone who has never before taken Latin, I found this class incredibly fulfilling. I now feel comfortably on a track to soon translating Latin texts with ease. My instructor's dynamic and slightly alternative methods of teaching also allowed me to explore the best ways I learn. Moreover, the puzzle-like nature of translating texts has improved my patience and problem solving.",
    "I learned a great deal about Latin grammar and reading. I also learned many philological tools - Kyle stressed etymology and discovering the \"flow\" of the language. Beyond learning a lot of Latin, I learned a lot about language as well."

   "comments": [
    "Very fast paced and heavy workload, lots of memorization and self - learning",
    "The class is very fast paced and is designed for students to learn Latin quickly. Overall, it was a great experience and I feel like I have learned a lot in a semester.",
    "While homework was a lot, I believe we could have had less homework per night and hand them in based on completion per class and receive feedback on what we need to work on. Also, I think having more quizzes on less material wold be beneficial in making sure we have locked down what we need to know. The course taught us Latin in many different and unique ways which helped me grow in my understanding of the language and its background. Also, it would be nice to have more open translations with the class as a whole.",
    "The speed of the course could be slightly reduced. Though I was for the most part, able to keep on top of the work, certain chapters went by far too quickly given the level of complexity of the material. Also, though I doubt this could be changed considering the textbook is a publication of the Yale University Press, I personally see the textbook as more of a hinderance than a help. The chapters become very technical and I often found it difficult to navigate the skills taught in the text. Luckily, I had an instructor who could help me navigate the text. If I hadn't had Kyle, though, I don't know how well I would have been able to tackle the work given the inaccessibility of the textbook. The major strength of the course was my instructor. I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to Latin. Another strength of the class is the consistent nature of assessments. Being quizzed each week with a series of tests throughout forced me to always remain on top of the material while also making sure no one exam would make or break my grade.",
    "This course taught me how to read Latin. The instructor was great, as was the pace of the class. It was fast and challenging and made students keep up."

    "Good intro to Latin, but definitely a hard L1 course",
    "I would recommend this course! It's definitely a lot of work; expect to devote at least an hour a night learning the morphology and doing the exercises. But you cover a lot of material over the semester and it's rewarding to see how you improve.",
    "Yes! If you like languages and want to learn to think about languages systematically, this is a great course for you.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course because there is a rich amount of information and learning in this class. The amazing backbone of many modern languages given by Latin is highly beneficial.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I learned a great deal and am excited to be continuing on with Latin while at Yale.",
    "Yes. This course is great if you want to learn Latin or just learn about languages in general."
