    "Definitely recommend this class. If you have only heard about the basic information on the Civil Rights Movement, this will open you up to a world of justice and social movement.",
    "The Long Civil RIghts Movement provides a nice overview of the struggle for civil rights between the 1930s and 1970s. Students learn that the Civil Rights Movement was much more complicated and involved many more actors and events than generally included in the traditional narrative. The movement was not an isolated event, but rather one that changed with the time. I would recommend this to a student who has not yet taken a course on the Civil Rights Movement. While none of the topics are covered in depth, it provides a great overview. One word of caution: it was certainly more work than I expected it to be. You are required to write five reading response letters, one 6-page paper, a film review and a final portfolio (which should be started well in advance).",
    "The Long Civil Rights Movement covers a lot of important history that students should learn, but it is not taught as effectively as it could be. The lectures were not tied very closely to the other course material so that the course did not appear very cohesive.",
    "I'm not a writer. I'm not interested in the humanities at all. At least, I wasn't before I took this course. The Long Civil Rights movement opened my eyes to the value and the power that history can have. Feimster's lectures were inspiring. There is a lot of reading and writing for this class. But I found it all to be worth it. This class will change the way you think of history. It's an amazing course. Highly recommended. LCRM is AWESOME",
    "A great introduction to the Civil Rights Movement, especially as a long historical movement dissolving the traditional top-down narrative too often taught in elementary and high school classes. This course is new and definitely needs work, but I would highly recommend it if the Prof. has reconsidered her assignments and the structure of lectures.",
    "A needed reminder that what we learned in high school isn't even close to the entire movement. I would recommend taking this class only if you are deeply interested in race relations. It's a lot of work and filled with people with intense views on how blacks and whites should conduct themselves. If you don't like sociopolitical discussions, stay away.",
    "YES. Professor Feimster is an angel and one of the best teachers at Yale, and she teaches this class with so much care and rigor. Her style of having a final project, where you engage with primary sources, as opposed to a final, means that you will walk away with an understanding of the themes of the class which you won't ever forget. Especially given the relevance of racial justice in America today, taking this class is something that every Yalie should do to have any sense of how we have gotten to where we are and what remains to be done. The class is manageable work-wise and very fair grading-wise, and all-round an excellent experience. Take it!",
    "Through a use of readings, creative assignments and lectures, AFAM 125 helps to shed light on the complex and long history of the Civil Rights Movement complicating and expanding our understanding of the movement. Take it if you are interested in understanding the history of race and the Civil Rights Movement, it will give you incredible insight and teach you about the many individuals involved that have been forgotten by history. Be aware that it is a lot of work, so know that you will be committing more to it than your normal lecture.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. Hopefully by it's second year the lectures will be more structured and there will be fewer assignments or the assignments will be shorter in length.",
    "LCRM is a really fun, interesting, and important class. There is a lot of reading and work, especially towards the end. Do not procrastinate on the final project! Otherwise, work is definitely manageable and worth it.",
    "Take it! You'll learn so much ore than you ever expected, or at least I know I did and I cannot look back. Especially during these time in the US and the world this class was exactly what i needed to reignite my passion for activism and history.",
    "I'd highly recommend this class. It's well-taught, and the subject matter is important.",
    "I have very mixed feelings on this course. I think it has the potential to be awesome if the assignment structure is different next time it is taught. The readings were really interesting, and the concept of the long civil rights movement is SUPER important and cool to learn about, even if you've learned about civil rights before in various history classes. Feimster is really passionate about civil rights and it really comes across in lecture, which is also a great component of the course. HOWEVER -- the last assignment, a 15 page SINGLE-SPACED portfolio of primary source document analyses and a paper, was the single worst assignment I have had in my Yale career (I'm a senior). This was in addition to 5 one-page, single-spaced, graded reading responses; a 2-3 page single-spaced film review; and a 5-6 page double-spaced paper that required us to read an extra book that wasn't the weekly reading (and the reading is about a book a week). Entirely too much. Do check the syllabus, though, because if this is changed, the course is really worth taking--the material is so so important.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. Although it was interesting to learn about the civil rights movement from a different perspective, the class ultimately did not live up to my expectations. Lectures were boring, readings too long, and the final project is a killer.",
    "The class was very interesting and made me think about the civil rights movement in ways I had considered.",
    "Please take this class. You have no idea how much I loved it. Even though there weren't midterms or finals, I went to every class anyways because I was concerned about what I'd miss. Professor Feimster is amazing, the curriculum is important, and the assignments are fun. TAKE IT.",
    "Highly recommend for those who are interested in the Civil Rights Movement and want deeper insight into the movement, its activists and role in history. Overall a very interesting class.",
    "An excellent and thorough overview of the long civil rights movement until the present.",
    "A great course to take if you are interested in the civil rights movement especially if you want to know more about grassroots actors. Feimster's lectures are really interesting and you learn about people who are usually left out of the dominant narrative",
    "A lot of work, but worth it.",
    "Please take this class. Do it for yourself, your friends, your family, the cause, whatever. Just take the class. But in all honesty, if you haven't really been exposed to anything beyond Civil Rights 101, I would recommend this class to you. It's a history that isn't traditionally taught, but still impacts us today.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It's a great survey course on the civil rights movement. You learn a lot and Feistier is great! There is a lot of reading but other than the reading responses you are not assessed on them. The final portfolio is intense however, so start early.",
    "Yes yes yes. Take it. A new perspective to a very important piece of us\/global history. Professor definitely works hard to make sure you get something new from the course.",
    "Would definitely recommend it to any student who is even a little bit interested in looking back at the civil rights movement in a more micro-level. You'd be surprise how little our middle school and high school US history classes have taught us about the movement!",
    "5 single spaced page responses (in the form of letters to anyone you choose), one film review, one paper, and a behemoth of a final project\/portfolio. It's all work that challenges you to think outside the dominant narrative. Take the class. You won't regret it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. This class gives a much needed understanding of the Civil Rights Movement and is really a class everyone should take as its relevant to our lives and very interesting.",
    "Yes, I would. For credit? If you aren't taking 5 classes. For CR\/D? Definitely. Just do the work consistently and listen to your TFs. The work is a bit taxing at times but it's worth it. The class is akin to The Matrix. If you decide to take it, you nudge you to leave the world of ignorance and become a brighter global citizen.",
    "A good and important class. More work than you'd imagine, but Professor Feimster is wonderful.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is a lot of work. The portfolio at the end is a big endeavor and is about 30 pages of writing. Mine ended up being 46 pages with the sources. I would say take it if you want to learn a great deal about the unsung heroes of the civil rights movement, as well as a complete overview of the events (in the 30's and 40's) that lead up to the major breakthroughs in the 50's and 60's and then a complete look at the \"end\" of the movement in the 70's an 80's. You will be able to deconstruct the narrative of Selma to Montgomery (1954 to 1964) and find complication with the story that is normally told, including getting fuller view of the big players, both known and forgotten. I think that this course is a necessary course to continue to have at Yale, because it explores history that can be used to understand today's issues (although we didn't talk about the specific relevance until the last week).",
    "This class helps to challenge traditional narratives of the Civil Rights Movement. While I don't believe I learned much new information from the class, I do believe that I have a much better grasp of the movement: its strength's, it's weaknesses, and the context in which it operated. There is a good deal of reading in the class, and the final project does take a considerable amount of work.",
    "If you know a lot about the civil rights movement, like if these names are familiar (pauli murray, robert williams) then you probably will not get as much out of this course. This is not because it isn't a great course, but what makes it great for a lot of people is that it's teaching them a history they have never encountered. If you know more about the subject area, you'll be a bit disappointed that it doesn't go into as much depth, but that's not the purpose of the course. Take a different course with feimster in that case. Also, start your portfolio early.",
    "This is an amazing course! As we learn in this course, the civil rights movement was not just about black Americans, you'll learn that there are a plethora of individuals who do not get recognized (either for being queer, not fitting the narrative, etc). You'll learn that the civil rights history you were taught in high school was highly superficial and lacked depth. Especially in light of recent events in Ferguson, I encourage everyone at Yale to take the opportunity to learn about the history behind racism and discrimination - because having an incomplete history of people of color perpetuates oppression of people of color.",
    "I would recommend The Long Civil Rights Movement to all students because it was well-taught and presented very interesting material - a much more in-depth version of the Civil Rights Movement than what is normally taught. Professor Feimster brought life and emotion to the course, and it was a pleasure to sit in class each day.",
    "YES. Either you think about these issues a lot in which case you will love Feimster and everything she teaches and I guarantee you regardless of how learned you think you are on the subject you will learn more. Or you don't think about race, 'don't see color' and in which case you should definitely take this class so your world can be enlightened. please take it and do ask stupid questions so you walk out of this class never to say again I don't see color or some other variation of that statement. (and please note being \"liberal\" does not disqualify you from being racist)",
    "A good class to take, especially since of the important content and the relatively low level work",
    "This class does an amazing job of giving students a sense of the civil rights movement. Prof Feimster is an incredible lecturer, and her lectures are always moving and politically engaged. This class reminds me of US Lesbian and Gay History, and people should take it in similar numbers! It will change the way that you think about the movement and your own role in relationship to it. There is a LOT of work in the class, and a lot of it feels like busywork. Hopefully this will change before next year. Don't be fooled by this being an 100-level class: it takes a lot of time. Overall, though, this is a great class and I'd recommend it.",
    "Definitely take this class! It is a ton of work so maybe credit\/D it but it will make you think and feel.",
    "Absolutely take this class, no matter what major you are and what you have to drop for it. Professor Feimster is amazing and the assessments are, although many, incredibly good and I have learned incredibly much from them. This class has changed the way I think about the history of this country and how I perceive the civil rights movement and its leaders. With the recent events around the country I would encourage people to take this class and gain a deeper understanding of the historical precedent of what is happening.",
    "Absolutely amazing. This course is a must-take no matter what major you are and no matter what other class you have to give up for it. Professor Feimster is an amazing teacher and the assignments are very interesting and enriching. Most importantly, the class will change the way you view the history of the United States and the civil rights movement, and it will allow you to put contemporary events in context. Take it!",
    "If you enjoy life you should never take this class. It is an absurd amount of work and the readings are extremely boring. I did learn a lot, but the class could have been made bearable if there was less work and better readings were selected."
