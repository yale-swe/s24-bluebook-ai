    "good foundation course to take for any major (im a bio major)",
    "The first half is basically all micro, so if you remember that from Econ 115, you're in really good shape. However, even if you didn't take Econ 115, it's pretty easy to learn the micro that you need to know. The last half of the course is somewhat confusing, and you should be prepared to teach yourself some of it.",
    "If you're going to take Intro Macro, take it in the fall and take it with Smith.",
    "If you have to take it, take it with Antony Smith.",
    "At the beginning of the class, you will feel that you are back in high school with the easiest psets and concepts ever. The end of the class was really hard though because it was super rushed. Professor Smith is super nice but not very organized. We were several weeks bhind on the syllabus and then tried to squeeze everything in at the end. Midterms are at a fair level. Psets are also fair, but they very annoying use excel so that the class becomes more about learning excell than learning econ. In fact, the entire class is annoyingly reliant on technology, fromt the lectures in which Prof Smith spends the whole time trying to figure out how to draw a graph on the computer, lower the screen, straighten a line, etc. to the Aplia assignments, which is this annoying website that is supposd to help teach econ but actually is just annoying.I would say macro is super interesting, take it, but this is not the most well taught class ever. expect to learn it on your own, but not through the book, which is written at such a low level that you won't actually learn anything.",
    "If you have to take it for your major, sure. If not, just buy the book and read it on your own - not worth wasting a Yale credit on such a poorly taught class.",
    "great subject matter, weak course, easyish",
    "This course was an absolute joke. The problem sets were not written clearly and the lectures were almost unbearable. We would spend much of our time looking at data online and then run out of time to cover the material for the course. Professor Smith doesn't have a clue. I have nothing positive to say about him. Anyone interested in taking intro macro should take it with any other professor if it's possible.",
    "It's ok, not great. Lecture's werent the best, but I found the material interesting, the class generally easy (until the very last part), workload not too stressful. Important stuff to know",
    "Yes, I would as an interesting class.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS, WAIT FOR THE SPRING. Tony Smith is one of the worst Yale professors.",
    "Yes, if you have a genuine interest in macroeconomics.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who enjoyed ECON 115 and is seriously considering majoring in econ and or EPE, Econ and Math, or IS. Also probably a good class to have under your belt just in general.",
    "Intro econ. Macro is much more interesting than micro, but you almost could have taught yourself out of the book- going to class didn't really gain you all that much. Smith is a nice guy but a pretty dull lecturer. But you have to take it for a bunch of majors, and it isn't that bad- much better than intro micro and sounds like much better than Ray Fair's class too.",
    "Summary: Smith isn't great, but I hear Ray Fair is absolutely horrible.I rarely went to class, but when I did, I was disappointed by Smith's rambling explanations, frequent largely irrelevant asides, and general lack of clarity. Those who went to class regularly often came away confused. I found that I did far better than average by simply reading the book and doing the online practice assignments provided by the book's publisher.Smith attempts to apply the lessons to real-world situations in the questions he crafts for homework assignments and exams. Alas, the models we use are to simple to effectively use on a real-world level, and thus the assignments become unnecessarily complicated and convoluted.His explanations of this problems often suffer from the same faults. Further, he often defines terms ambiguously and mercurially. For example, despite defining \"long-run\" with regard to aggregate supply as at least 2-5 years in class, in a homework assignment he expected students to answer that temporary changes over a couple of months counted as long-run.The homework assignments (when he writes the questions, which is not always the case) are thus far less about understanding the material, and far more about understanding what Smith is looking for in an answer. Sometimes, you have to sacrifice the answer as the book would suggest it for the answer as Smith would suggest it. Personally, I trust the book's more.All this aside, I'd recommend this class over Ray Fair's Intro Macro. I've only talked to one person who ever enjoyed that class, and he showed up high every day.",
    "Take it if you want to get to a higher ECON course, otherwise it has a high opportunity cost- booyah macro!",
    "I think that the course under Anthony Smith was excellent. I would definitely recommend taking it - after micro, I though economics was really boring, but Professor Smith made me want to consider being an econ major. Definitely a great class to take if Smith teaches it again",
    "I would recommend it, if they are willing to do a lot of work practicing the problems and really getting to know the concepts.",
    "I'm really glad that I took this course. I don't intend to major in econ and I'm not a particularly math-oriented person. That being said, I didn't find this course to be difficult at all. There is very little math involved--it is more concept based. My TA was amazing and Professor Smith covers material at a manageable pace. I think that a basic understanding of macro economics can benefit everyone. It has already helped me better understand articles in the NYT, Economist, etc. Some classes were painful to sit through, others passed quickly. All in all, I definitely recommend it. Also, there is very little work. The weekly problem sets aren't difficult-- can usually be done in a few hours the night before they are due, and in addition to that there are two midterms and one final. By far the lightest work load I had this semester.",
    "I've heard the seminar version of the course in the spring is more engaging. In terms of the class, make sure to do the reading in the textbook - it makes everything SO MUCH easier to understand (and you dont really have to go to lecture if you get the textbook material). Do the Aplia practice problems -- they were really helpful for understanding the concepts\/problem sets\/finals.",
    "If you are going to take the seminar, I recommend you take it in the fall with Anthony. Although he goes off tangents sometimes, overall, his explanations are very detailed and clear. The homeworks are very similar to his midterms and exams so if you do the homeworks and understand them well, you will do well in class.",
    "If your an Econ major yes. If not, why put yourself through the misery of Macro. The lectures are really dry, but the book has everything you need to know in it.",
    "Do not take this class to 'learn about economics'. You can do that much more effectively by reading the Economist or Financial Times. Work hard and it isn't hard to do well though.",
    "Take it, but you need some work on your own.",
    "In ECON 116, you learn the basics of macroeconomics. I'd recommend it to all students, even those outside the econ major.",
    "Intro econ. Take it only if you have to.",
    "This class is a very broad overview that provides a lot of background for understanding our economy. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Basic course. Take it to fulfill requirements.",
    "Yes, for getting a general grasp of how modern macroeconomics works. As with most of neoclassical economics (modern mainstream economics) it doesn't really get at how the real world works, but there is some useful information about the financial system, and if you're going to be working with policy at all knowing the macro models will probably be helpful.",
    "If you don't quite understand a lot of the economics that economists talks about on TV, you will definately feel differently if you take this class. It give you a comprehensive understanding of how modern economy works.",
    "Take it if you must, don't take it if you don't have to. The material was boring, the professor was dry, and I thought the tests\/problem sets often were unclear in some way. The curve also is fairly harsh, which I found surprising.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class. This is material every college graduate should know, even at an introductory level. Take it with Smith he is great--entertaining and explains things very clearly. The best intro econ class you will find.",
    "Take it if you have to. It's very good to know in general though...very relevant to understanding the basic economic world.",
    "I think everyone should take at least 1 Macroeconomics and Microeconomics class in there time here. So, yes I do recommend the course. However, be prepared for a VERY long lecture.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone looking to gain a basic understanding of the macroeconomy. I think the value of this class will become more apparent once I am able to take intermediate macroeconomics...by itself, this course provides a rudimentary background on macroeconomic principles and concepts.",
    "Important subject, but not the most interesting class. Take it if you're interested in economics, but otherwise, there are better classes at Yale.",
    "Take this course if you want to learn about macroeconomics from a professor who won't bore you and will keep topics relevant. It is a good amount of work, so if you just want to learn these important topics, then just take it Cr\/D\/Fail. Also, if Mark Klee is a TA for this class, get into his section.",
    "A class that is worth taking, but if you are not a econ major or need it as one of your requirements, consider using a credit\/d\/fail, otherwise the course is the same as any other and be prepared to work.",
    "I would recommend it as a course to gain a general understanding of Macroeconomics. Not the most interesting at times, but by no means a terrible class.",
    "Econ 116 teaches you the basics of the macroeconomy, including aggregate supply and demand, money supply, unemployment, and other things that a think every eductaed person should understand to some degree. I would recommend this class, especially if you are a Poli Sci major or plan on doing I-Banking or anything related to money or government.",
    "TAKE IT IF YOU NEED IT FOR YOUR MAJOR.",
    "It's a great class to learn about how the economy works - you should take it if you have any interest in understanding economics at all.",
    "Quite difficult, ambiguous problem sets. Poorly-worded tests. TAs stink. Don't take it unless you need to.",
    "Intro Macro is a good overview of macroeconomic theory and current events. Smith is a good lecturer but sometimes off topic. That can't hurt, right?",
    "This is a good introductory macroeconomics class. The lectures are pretty interesting and Professor Smith tries to relate the class to current events. The workload is pretty minimal, with only one problem set a week, and a few interesting articles to read.",
    "If you want to take higher level economics classes, you have to take this class. If you're looking for a math credit, I'd probably look elsewhere.",
    "Economics 116 is a decent introductory macroeconomics course. I would not recommend it because although the material is interesting, the teaching was below average compared to other classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "No, do not take this class unless it's required for your major. Honestly, you can just learn about macroeconomics from a textbook or something -- you do not need to use up a whole coursecredit during a semester at Yale to do so. Also, the course is just not very well taught unless you have a good TF.It was really difficult to understand the lectures. I don't think that Prof. Smith organized the material very well. I think that most of what I learned in this class I had learned by reading on my own or by learning from my TF. In some cases I found that Prof. Smith's lectures even made the material more confusing.I also think that that Prof. Smith spent too much time at the beginning of the course on slightly easier topics, and spent very little time at the end on concepts that were much more difficult. It seemed like he was rushing at the end just to cram a lot of material in. I think that this was due to poor planning of the progression of the course. This made the course a lot harder than many people expected.",
    "No, not with Professor Smith. I was genuinely interested in economics going into this class but it totally turned me off.",
    "This was a great course. Applicable, interesting, well-taught, entertaining atmany points and much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. This material really is useful for understanding how important macroeconomic concepts like trade, production of goods, unemployment, GDP, stocks and interest rates, etc. work. This is NOT a painful course, particularly if taught by Prof. Smith, who has a great sense of humor and always makes the material accessible and relatable. TAKE IT if you want to understand some pretty major driving forces in our world today.",
    "Definitely a class you should take while at Yale-you get a basic understanding of the subject, and the class really helped me to understand economic developments in the news. Definitely take it with Professor Smith!",
    "I would recommend this course. You learn a lot of material that is very pertinent to current economic issues. I feel like a more well informed individual after taking this course.",
    "I would recommend this course, even if you do not need the course for your major. I enjoyed learning about the economy and am happy that I can now read articles from the Times and the Economist with greater understanding.",
    "You better have a good working relationship with your TA. That is the only way to get a good grade in this course (which is deceptively easy to understand from the lectures).",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in the field of economics. The course material is interesting and it helps one better understand the world.",
    "yeah,take it if you want to know something about macro econ. even if you're not planning to continue with econ, it helps you get a basic sense of the subject, which is helpful for daily conversation, politics, reading the paper, etc.",
    "I liked the course. It's not too difficult or a lot of work and Smith is actually a good lecturer. I was interested by the material though. It can be a bit dry, so be sure you actually like econ.",
    "This, despite the usual warnings to take Micro first, was my first economics class, so I might not know what I'm talking about. However, I found the class very manageable and informative, and I've gathered that Tony Smith is definitely the professor you want for intro Macro.",
    "I really enjoyed the times in ECON 116 when we were connecting the basic concepts we were learning in class (shocks to aggregate demand and aggregate supply, inflation, unemployment, etc.) to current and historical events (the Recession of 2008, the dot.com bust, the Volker Recession, Stagflation, the Great Depression). Unfortunately, this happened too rarely for me to recommend the class. Most of lecture was boring, disjointed, and too over-simplified.Problem sets take way to long and are harder than expected.Professor Anthony Smith has potential to be a great teacher\/lecturer, but he fell short.And be careful if you take this class in Davies Auditorium because that combination can be\/will be sleep-inducing.",
    "I did not like this course nearly as much as microeconomics (which I really liked), but that could be because I took the micro seminar my freshman year and wasn't prepared for an econ lecture course. It's just kind of boring a lot of the time. Much less focus on decision-making and why people do things, a lot more focus on numbers and trends and equations etc."
