    "i would say its a great class and you'll learn a lot i would recommend it to a friend.",
    "A wonderfully chill class where you learn to machine, eat cookies, talk about life, and come out with a cool steam engine.",
    "Yes, it's fun and as an engineering major it's nice to work with your hands and build something from scratch",
    "Very helpful for an experimental physicist. I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would recommend other students to take this course. Machining is very helpful and very useful skill to have. David does a very good job in teaching the course.",
