   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Huge expanse of knowledge of a period in musical history I knew little to nothing about.",
    "I acquired an acute ability to think critically about how history is told and why it is important for us to study it in detail.",
    "This class provides useful and fulfilling insight into exciting and for many of us foreign repertories of music. It challenges us to reconsider our preconceptions about music in before the common practice period, and engage with the aesthetic priorities of distant generations without judgment. I was super into it.",
    "A superb introduction to a repertoire of music I wasn't familiar with before. It develops both your brain and your ear.",
    "I learned how to read old notation and the history of where the music we know of today came from not just music, but political ideas and aristocracy.",
    "I was not particularly thrilled by the material of the course (took it because it was a requirement for the major), but I ended up learning a lot about a subject that I had absolutely no previous exposure to.",
    "I learned a lot of about early music, which was something I knew very little about before taking the course. Given the nature of the topic, I felt that we also had a lot of interesting dicussions on the nature of history and how we chose to tell it.",
    "This course teaches about early music, spanning from Gregorian chant up until the 16th century.",
    "I gained a good general understanding of how music developed through these eras. I aappreciated the fact that we discussed the difficulties of studying this time period -- it put everything into perspective. I would have benefitted from a few more \"application\" opportunities: more singing and more discussion of performance practice.",
    "I have gained a greater appreciation for the narrative of the development of music in the West through the Middle Ages to the early Renaissance, from Gregorian Chant to Reformation psalmody.",
    "In this class teaches the History of Western music predating the Renaissance",
    "I had developed a better understanding of early music history, as well a feel for studying music from a historical standpoint.",
    "I learned how to transcribe musical notation from the 13th century into modern notation.",
    "MUSI 350 provided a solid overview of Western music from the Carolingian Europe in the 800s to the late Renaissance. The main value of the course lay in the exposure it offered to periods of music that are often overlooked in our cultural education. The Medieval treasures have been displayed, but it is ultimately up to us to take a look at them with greater detail...",
    "A broad overview of the standard academic history of notated western music from 800-1600. Learned to read Ars Nova notation (14th century) and create a modern critical edition. Touched briefly on important questions of medieval and renaissance musical historiography and medieval sound.",
    "I have much improved my knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of the music of the Middle Ages and Renaissance."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A little disorganized but overall comprehensive and all-encompassing in a very engaging way.",
    "Some of the many strengths include the in-class participation part of singing, which makes everyone engaged, the excursion classes, and also the transcription assignment, which was fun and interesting and very educational. One weakness would be that there is really just too much information within the time period to get to it all or cover it all sufficiently.",
    "The course was well taught, although listening quizzes should have had more structure\/guidance. I just don't think this specific class should be required for the music major. There should be \"distributional\" requirements among music history, maybe, but deciding that this material, along with two more semesters of the western musical canon, is what we need to learn, limits the diverse interests of music students here.",
    "Professor Parkes and the TAs were incredible. They kept the course engaging and w're excited to show up to class every day.",
    "It's a hard class to teach and the topic is hard. That being said, I felt that the professor was less than accommodating for the students, barely stopping to explain confusing topics and anything difficult was to be learned \"on our own time\". This was particularly frustrating because we were being thrown into a topic that we barely knew anything about, yet there was a lack of support in learning all of the material. The strength of the course is the TAs-- without them, this class would have been almost impossible.",
    "I think the listening quizzes are a deeply stressful experience. One reason is that we are assumed to have a great degree of familiarity with genres we have only JUST encountered. I think that to the extent we are expected to differentiate between 15 genres from 1 min of listening on a quiz question, we should be helped out with the skills we need either in section or lecture. I.e. we could have something like \"what helps us differentiate between genres and centuries\" thing for me, listening to endless examples was not enough",
    "The strengths of this course is that it is well taught and well organized. Lectures where consistently interesting and informative. What I think could be improved would be finding more ways to engage with the material we are studying, perhaps with more assignments like the transcription exercise. Also in terms of content I felt like we started going through a lot of interesting topics at a really fast rate as the semester came to a close. I understand that this is a survey course, but it felt like we were going over a lot things that weren't connected (eventhough it probably was to some extent)",
    "The lectures are quite interesting, and I particularly enjoyed the queries presented for discussion during sections. I think the listening quizzes could be improved by giving us specific songs to know, like in music 352. That way the grading would be more clearly cut, and we would be forced to spend more time listening to the music and memorizing famous melodies.",
    "There is nothing I would change about this course, I really enjoyed it the way it was!",
    "This teaching staff of the class had a lot of enthusiasm, but the material was presented in a way that was very inaccessible. As only one textbook was used, the class material did not support assessing different historiographical approaches, since we primarily encountered one (albeit very interesting and convincing) viewpoint. Lectures were interesting and energetic, but the materials provided made it very difficult to keep track of class content, and thus I think students were very discouraged; a large portion of the class did not know that the lecture slides were online until the last week of the course. Having those available online before lecture, and having slightly more detailed or outlined lecture slides would make class less of a mad dash to both process and record what Professor Parkes was saying. Marco and Will's powerpoints were much more useful in that regard. They struck a good balance of having enough on the slide to both understand what was going on while in lecture, and as a reference for later studying. More guidance regarding what to listen for in different types of pieces would have been very helpful in processing the audio material and preparing for listening quizzes.",
    "There is not enough time in the semester to cover all of the material of the time span of this course. I would have liked to have gone more in depth with fewer topics. I also think the Taruskin textbook was a weakness and would have liked a more varied selection of readings.",
    "If you're really interested in learning about early music, then I'd imagine this would be a great course to take, although some classmates said that perhaps the course's attempt to cater to students uninterested who are required to take the course make it a worse experience for them. A clear weakness of this course is that it is required for the major; I believe the class would have been more engaging\/had a more excited environment if it had only students who had truly self-elected to take it. I also think that an attempt to teach *everything* that was happening in Europe during such a long stretch of time is perhaps a mistake, and instead really focusing on specific composers or eras while consciously leaving others out might be a better approach.",
    "I did not want to spend a whole semester of my time at Yale studying medieval music when I could be taking other classes that interest me far more. I was resentful that this was a required course for the music major and found it very hard to engage with the material. The course would have better discussions and a more positive, committed vibe if enrollment was purely voluntary.",
    "The course was certainly organized very professionally and covered substantial ground. I wish that the lectures departed from an overview approach more frequently, with closer investigations of musical excerpts, more aural identification exercises (not just occasional listening quizzes), and transcription assignments.",
    "I enjoyed the course in its current shape. I especially appreciated the different excursuses, such as the instrument demonstration and the Beinecke visit."

   "comments": [
    "Music major? Yes. Non-music major? Only if you're really passionate about Gregorian chant, I suppose.",
    "YES take this course!! In past years it has been given poor reviews, but I absolutely loved this course and Prof. Parkes does an incredible job of conveying the information in an engaging and cohesive way. He is awesome and knows so much. It is required for music majors, but anyone interested in the history of this time period at all should also take it!",
    "I absolutely recommend taking this course. This music is important and strange, and it is an entirely fulfilling process to open our ears to it and learn how it evolved into the music we play\/hear today.",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course. Going in I expected to suffer through it because of music major requirements but I was completely wrong. Professor Parkes is brings tremendous knowledge and enthusiasm to each lecture, and I left each lecture energized and excited. The workload is manageable, especially if you study hard for the listening quizzes. 10\/10 take it!",
    "Unless the student is another music major, I would not recommend this course. It's not structured well and unfortunately, the amount of stress this class gave me was not worth the amount of effort I put in.",
    "Yes!",
    "If you are a music major you are taking this course any way, but if you are curious about the origins of western classical music, the middle ages and renaissance, this is a really good introduction to that topic. I came into this class with little interest in the material but Parkes' enthusiasm and lecture style helped keep class interesting.",
    "This is a great course to take if you want to know more about where western classical music came from. There are also some fun lectures about early instruments and there was a trip to the beinecke to look at manuscripts.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone. It's a class that may seem unnecessary to a lot of people (including music majors), but it was very interesting and Prof. Parkes is a wonderful instructor.",
    "This class COULD be wonderful, and I think it will improve after this first semester of Professor Parkes teaching it. Don't be turned away by the content and your assumptions that (music from) this time period is boring.",
    "Yes, this is a wonderful way to dive into the music history sequence offered in Yale College. However, I would warn students that they will inevitably find themselves flying between various musical movements, only touching the surfaces of each one.",
    "Unless you are already a performer of early music, I do not think the current structure of the course is conducive to adequately engaging most music students at Yale.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. It is well-structured, interesting, and an excellent introduction to the music that it covers. It has improved my appreciation for music of this period significantly."
