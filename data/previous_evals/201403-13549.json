   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in Earth science or the world's energy system take this course. It is science oriented, so if you are looking for political arguments\/opinions you will NOT find it here. However, you will learn so much about the origins of fossil fuels and why the world has become so dependent on them. You leave the course knowing how all the fossil fuels work and can hold a conversation with anyone and even a geologist!",
    "Take it. Even not for science credit.",
    "Yes. Applicable knowledge, clear takeaways from class.",
    "Great introduction! TAKE IT!!!!",
    "I would recommend this class to a student more inclined toward social sciences and humanities. It was a very manageable science credit filled with interesting material.",
    "Absolutely. It is a great course that anyone with an opinion on fossil fuels should take.",
    "A thorough introduction to fossil fuels. Can be a little redundant for G&G majors (e.g. the intro to earth science lectures), but overall the class is very interesting and well taught. The workload is reasonable throughout the semester, with 5 problem sets and a midterm. The final exam, unfortunately, was absolutely ridiculous. It was exponentially harder than the rest of the class and hardly matched up with the materials covered in lecture. This was the first year that the class had a final exam (final papers in the past), so perhaps this will improve in the future.",
    "Absolutely take this class. It's one of the rare science courses that is at a level that is accessible to non-STEM majors, but still features genuinely interesting material and deals with important issues. The workload is very manageable; just five problem sets, a midterm, and a final. Professor Oristaglio is also really great. He consistently goes out of his way to give individualized attention to students even though the course is a taught as a lecture.",
    "definitely take it!!",
    "I definitely recommend this to anyone interested in understanding the place fossil fuels have in our society and how they have arrived there. It isn't much of a workload either.",
    "The course is very interesting and really helped me to broaden my view of energy and fossil fuels. Even being a mechanical engineering major, I really liked the course and believe it was one of the best courses I have taken in my life. Professor Oristaglio is a great lecturer, and prepared his classes really well; besides being very kind and understanding. The grading is fairly generous as well, and the workload is pretty smooth. Take this course, you won't regret it.",
    "Solid class for non-science majors hoping to learn more about the world's reliance on fossil fuels and the future implications of that reliance. Professor Oristaglio is a good lecturer as well, and I found his lectures both interesting and easy to understand. The workload is totally manageable, but this year the final was TOUGH. Overall, good course, important material, and a fair set of class requirements (midterm, five psets, final).",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The materials presented in class is interesting and relevant to the real world. Also you get to go on an enjoyable field trip to a coal mine and gas facility in Pennsylvania during fall break.",
    "If you want a science credit where you can do virtually no work and learn cool (and useful) things with little effort, take this class! It's fun and easy, especially if you take it with some friends.",
    "The class is really interesting, you can learn about geology, history, chemistry, geography and so many different topics that it is a really complete class. The topics are up to date and I really recommend taking the class if you are interested in fossil fuels, energy transitions and climate change or related topics. After taking this class I would like to take another class with this professor because I really enjoyed the class and I learned new things. He is a great professor, he explained everything really clear and I felt motivated to learn more about the topics.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the subject. That being said, Oristaglio sometimes experiments with the problem sets and the course's material, so bear with him.",
    "A great intro to energy. It is great to understand the scientific information and processes behind fossil fuels, and the factors that steer the world's energy usage. Prof Oristaglio has industry experience so he brings a rare perspective to these issues. I think I'll retain a lot from this course. Also not too much work, so a great 5th class.",
    "If you have any interest in energy and fossil fuels, take this course. You will learn so much. It is really good.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who was interested in fossil fuels and the oil and gas industry. In fact, I think that any student at FES who is focused on energy and the environment should take this class. I felt like there was a lot of overlap between the material covered in this class and the material covered in Energy Systems Analysis, but if I could only pick one class to take, I would probably take this one instead. I'm sure that some other students would disagree with this opinion, but I honestly feel like I absorbed the information in this class much more easily and will retain it better in the future even though this class required much less work.",
    "Good science credit that helps you understand the energy industry.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can. It provides a really interesting angle on the global energy problem and gives a great background into the geology involved in the subjects. It also isn't that much work and the homeworks and tests are pretty fair too. A really interesting class. Take it if you can.",
    "As a junior geology major, G&G 274 was disappointingly a mix of very basic information and a few higher concepts. The lectures are pretty good and Professor Oristaglio is great at explaining the material, but for many upper level geology majors, some of the material doesn't need to be explained that much (like for example what various tectonic margins are). The workload is pretty low, with a handful of relatively short psets, a midterm, and a final. For the geology majors: take this if you need to, or if you're okay with brushing up on the basics; don't take it if you're looking for an intensively science-based class.",
    "Good class, not too strenuous with the workload.",
    "This class teaches the geology of fossil fuels from the beginning of the time until now. For anyone who is interested in climate change and I would recommend them to take this class because the class shows how hard it will be to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the short term period. This class teaches the main science behind the fossil fuels why they are cheap to produce or to transport. And also for anyone interested in oil and gas industry, this is a great course to start with as in to gain all basics in oil and gas."
