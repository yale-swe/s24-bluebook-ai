    "I would recommend it to anyone genuinely seeking to learn more about the beginnings of the early church and all the doctrinal controversies that led to Christianity as we know it today.",
    "Very fun class; I would recommend the class to *all* Christians, regardless of your interest with history in general. It's very enlightening to see how everything developed in the early Church.Warning: The professor could have done more to describe the expectations\/rubric of the tests\/essays. I've never taken a history class before this one, so I don't know if it's just like this in history classes in general, but I was surprised by a few things. For example, on one of my test questions, I was able to name all the relevant positions and describe their theological content, but I couldn't quite remember all the names of the principle figures and the names of the councils that dealt with them. I figured \"Hey, I clearly demonstrated that I know the content, and I have a decent discussion of the theology, so if I don't get a few names right, I should still come out with a good grade.\" I got a C+. Apparently, names are *way* more important than content, which is not something I've gotten out of the literature\/philosophy classes I've taken so far. Also, it looks like my essays it looks like it was graded by a grammar Nazi (e.g. \"beared out\" was replaced by \"borne out\"... I'm a linguistics major, so prescriptivist grammar Nazis irk me).",
    "You learn the important people, philosophy, history, architecture, writings, conflicts, and politics that contributed to the development of Ancient Christianity. The class has a lot of reading, but its an enjoyable class to be in, and the last class is really cool because you get to learn using multimedia that simulates an ancient Christian church to all five senses.",
    "Overall a solid class. Expect a normal lecture class, but if you are interested in the material, a good choice.",
    "yes extremely interesting",
    "This class provides a history of Ancient Christianity from Paul to the Rise of Islam. I really enjoyed this class, the lectures are interesting, the sections are worthwhile and the curse material is great to learn. The class is a more difficult than meets the eye, students are often vulnerable in terms of expectations when it comes to essays and tests but regardless, I feel like I learned a lot.I would undoubtedly recommend this to any student because Christianity is an important World Religion and understanding it only helps us better understand the world.",
    "Amazing class and one of my favorites at Yale. Definitely take!",
    "Great class! Not too much work, interesting material, and great Professor and TAs. I am a Christian, and this class really helped me understand the origin of my religion, and some of the debates that shape what Christianity is today. Even if you aren't, Christian, though, it would be a really interesting history class! Definitely take this class if you can! It was my favorite of the semester! :)",
    "A very interesting course.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in religious history. As a history class it was pretty good, but I think the reason I enjoyed it as much as I did was because I am very interested in many of the theological controversies that were at the core of the class and in the overall relationship between humans and religion.",
    "if you are at all interesting in the Christian religion, this is a great class to take.",
    "Was a very organized class, manageable workload if followed through the semester. Going to class was a large part of this class - if you go to class and do the section preparation questions you will be very prepared for the tests and do well. Not an easy A but possible if you keep up with the workload.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the subject and are willing to keep up with the readings and take comprehensive notes in class.",
    "Extremely interesting course. Readings are reasonable. Grading on Essays is a bit questionable but midterms are graded fairly. Very good class. Professor Davis is a wonderful lecturer and very approachable.",
    "If you're interested in the early church, this is the class to take.",
    "This class is a very good coverage of Ancient Christianity. If you have any interest in the topic, you should take it. The mid-terms and papers are very fair as well, which is very rare."
