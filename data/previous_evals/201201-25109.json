    "This class is incredible. It will teach you a great deal about ritual, symbol, magic, shamanism, and many other aspects of religion. Professor Shneiderman is superb, and the in-class conversations are great.The readings are long and they are difficult, but they get unpacked pretty efficiently in class. Be ready to have a ton of reading.The ethnography project is a blast and was a lot of fun. It's not a difficult project and provides an excellent way to synthesize what you've learned from the class.",
    "This was one of the most disappointing courses I've ever taken at Yale. The reading list is frozen in the one of the worst periods of anthropology's history and the critical contemporary debates of the field are blatantly ignored. People said some of the most explicitly racist things I've ever heard in a classroom: e.g., \"If there's such a thing as a weak culture, Paraguay has it, everything there is just a copy of the United States\"--this, of course, came after that student spent less than a week in the country with his a cappella group; or, another gem, \"that [religious ritual]was horrifying, it just looked so primitive.\" The professor didn't intervene at all.The readings are dull, the discussion was disturbing (when it wasn't entirely insipid), and it was at 9 in the morning. The biggest mistake of my semester. Don't take it.",
    "I think with time, this might become a great course, but it is currently rather disjointed. addressing many different topics w ih no overarching sense of the big questions, and has a number of seemingly unnecessary readings. Still, it's a great opportunity to do an ethnography and many of the authors are so worth reading (Durkheim, Levi-Strauss) that the course was worth it for me in the end."
