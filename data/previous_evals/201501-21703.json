   "comments": [
    "You have to take it to be pre-med and for a lot of sciences, and Dr. G makes it as fun as a 4 hour gen chem lab can be. It is kind of a bear at times though, and the write ups can take forever (especially considering it is only 0.5 credits)",
    "General chemistry lab. You likely have to take it, but I wouldn't take it for fun.",
    "Your TA can make or break this course. While it's interesting, it is (like any lab) very time consuming, and fairly difficult.",
    "Kind of fun in a way but the work is a bit much if you don't plan accordingly.",
    "It is a course that involves a lot of grunt work, but it is easy to be successful if you put in the effort.",
    "I would recommend Chem 117L to any student who is passionate about Chemistry and enjoys laboratory. It can be very interesting and a great learning experience, and so that is why I would recommend it to them.",
    "Get a feel of your TF during the first lab session and do not be afraid to ask for a switch if you feel so inclined.",
    "Overly detail-oriented, much more work required than should be necessary for a half credit course",
    "CHEM 117L is a basic general chemistry laboratory class. The material is generally pretty easy to understand. Be prepared for many titrations.",
    "Great course but a lot of work",
    "If you liked Chem 116L, it's more or less the same. If you are not required to take chem 117, then I would consider looking for another course, especially since this is only 0.5 credit for a lot of work.",
    "It's manageable if you have basic chem lab skills. Had I not taken Chem 116L last semester, I would have struggled a lot. Some of the labs are very complicated and the lab reports are very time consuming and get complicated. The TAs and Dr. G are very willing to help however. Every one says gen chem lab is the worst and for being the worst it really isn't that bad.",
    "I would recommend Chem 117L to another student only if the student is willing to put in the time. This is not a class you should take if you do not plan on putting in the time. The lab reports take roughly 7-10 hours and they are graded pretty strictly. Even with this, the class is pretty cool. The experiments are engaging and really help you understand the topics you are going over in your lecture course.",
    "Similar to CHEM 116L",
    "It's fine, whatever. You're taking it because you have to, and it's tedious, especially the lab reports. At least sometimes things change color.",
    "I wouldn't recommend chemistry lab to my worst enemy.",
    "I would recommend this course as it perfectly complements CHEM 115. With a proper amount of work down before each lab, you will succeed in this class. You will learn an incredible amount!",
    "Never take this class unless you have to.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to. Expect to get really good at titrations but don't expect to think critically.",
    "Take it if you need to. Keep in mind that if you've previously taken 116L, the quizzes get a lot harder in 117L.",
    "This is one of those classes that you are only going to take if you are PreMed or a Chem major. It isn't fun and definitely not a class you are going to look forward to, but you have to get through it.",
    "This course teaches you important lab skills and furthers your understanding of the lab material. It is a lot of work, but it is worth it.",
    "A lot of work, some of it unimportant, but will help you overall.",
    "It is a solid lab that is quite long at times. Pretty similar to 116. A few of the reports are pretty extensive but it's doable.",
    "I wouldn't recommend taking the douse unless it is required. The course takes a lot of time and the lab reports are extensive. The individual experiments often took a long time, so prepare to use the entire 4 hours.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Overall, it's a good course. It's a lot of work, but all the work is doable. Dr. G and the TAs really do try to walk you through the labs and lab reports. The labs and the class don't really overlap at the same time, so a lot of what you'll be doing in lab you will have already covered and will be review. Still, this is a solid course. I'd recommend it.",
    "Chem 117L is a general chemistry lab that extrapolates on concepts like acids & bases as well as redox reactions in a way that advances students' understanding of the material. I would only recommend this course to someone who is taking it to fill a requirement. Though interesting, the lab is a lot of work for a half-credit course, and is only valuable concurrent with general chemistry lecture.",
    "If you need to take Chem 117L, good luck, otherwise don't take it.",
    "Just a lot of regimented boring labs that you have to do for a lot of stem stuff.",
    "CHEM 117L is a good follow-up to the CHEM 116L laboratory course. It teaches you the fundamentals of lab work and reinforces many of the concepts discussed in lecture. I wouldn't say that it's the most exciting or interesting course Yale has to offer, but it's definitely important if you're looking to major in the sciences or if you're pre-med. I would recommend it to any student who is taking the CHEM 115 course.",
    "CHEM 117L is the lab course that goes with CHEM 115 lecture and it actually does a pretty good job of explaining the concepts learned in class through experimental procedures. Most of the labs take close to the 4 hour session and are pretty long, and the weekly write-ups can take a few hours to finish (the 2-session lab write-ups take a lot longer). Overall, though Dr. G is a great professor who really wants to make sure that every student understands the material and can succeed in the class, and while my TA in particular was a very harsh grader, I felt that the course was fair.",
    "Harder than Chem 116L, but not an impossible amount of work. Just something that needs to be taken along with Chem 115.",
    "Only take if you have to.",
    "General chemistry lab introduction.",
    "If you're looking at this course, then you most likely have to take it as a pre-req for another class or you need it for your major. If that's not the case, you shouldn't bother with this class. Being in 116L helps a lot if you're going to take this lab. If you haven't taken it, initially you will be at a disadvantage to those who did take 116L. Check your sig figs on every single lab report, that will be the bulk of the points you lose in this class. Definitely more work than 116L in regards to some lab reports and the complexity of the chemistry but you should be fine.",
    "A terrible four hours, and a waste of precious Yale time. CHEM 117L is an outdated course that may have been a valuable pre-requisite for pre-meds in the 60s, but definitely not useful in the 21st century. Give anyone theoretical problems to solve over technical work. The amount of time required (FOUR HOURS) is more than any whole credit course, but you're only getting a measly half credit for your efforts. It was awful knowing that I had to go back to this every week. Perhaps if lab were every other week, the half credit would make more sense. Grading was tough, and it was difficult and time-consuming to scrape up an A in the class. This class won't change your life or give you any philosophical revelations (take a humanities class). Only take it if you have to.",
    "Kinda horrible. Takes a huge chunk of time to do the lab, and even more time to write the lab reports.",
    "Too much work for a half credit class.",
    "Actually a pretty fun supplement to CHEM 115. Most people who take it HAVE to take it, but even if you don't consider it as a hands-on way to learn chem",
    "Only if required for the major. Too heavy of a workload to take for fun.",
    "If you do not have to take it, do not. If you do have to take it, good luck.",
    "I would only take it if you absolutely have to. I can see that it taught me a lot, but it was really miserable at the time.",
    "Its good for lab experience.",
    "Chem 117L is a lab class that gives students hands-on experience with materials discussed in Chem 115. I would recommend this to any student who wants a firmer grasp on the topics covered in Chem 115.",
    "Harder than CHEM 115L. But the overall class enviroemt is pretty much the same. You're now better with lab techniques, so, in a way, the labs are easier to carry out (even if more complex). Lab reports are long. And the two-week reports are no one-nigt task, even though you might unwisely try (like I did) to do them in an evening.",
    "CHEM 117L 01 is the second half of a general chemistry laboratory course. It allows students to hone their skills of titration, qualitative analysis, and electrochemistry. I would recommend it to other students as it completes the background knowledge and skills expected from a general chemistry laboratory course."
