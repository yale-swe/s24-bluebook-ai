    "SPAN 110 is the first half of introductory Spanish. In it you learn present, present progressive, preterit, and imperfect tenses, along with a decent-sized vocabulary--clothing, colors, seasons, temperature, vacations, family, school\/city, and a number of verbs. I had some background in Spanish before Yale but didn't remember much of the language. This course was a great refresher\/class in which I actually learned. Definitely take it if you've never taken Spanish before or if you have a very limited background in it enough to place into L1 Spanish.",
    "I would recommend it, though I would caution that a lot of studying is necessary to learn the vast amount of material covered.",
    "Yes! Challenging but if you've had exposure to other languages you should be fine. Fast paced, but overall, a wonderful language and course!",
    "Great spanish class--if you can get up early take it with Maria Carmen Vicente Quesada. She's an amazing woman!",
    "This is a great intro. spanish course. You learn a ton in a really short period of time (so you do have to put your time in with homework and studying) but it is all really well taught and well practiced. Overall, this course will provide you with an excellent foundation for future spanish.",
    "Great Class!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Perfect introductory class, and Carmen is an amazing instructor. She will always find time to help you. With due diligence, and her instruction, Spanish 110 will be great."
