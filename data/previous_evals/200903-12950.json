   "comments": [
    "I would recommend DS to every student at Yale. I think that the foundation and modes of thought that it promotes have changed the way I look at the world. I think that understanding the tradition and history of some of the most important thoughts in human history is invaluable and changes the terms of all thoughts.",
    "Take it. You'll never think about politics the same way again.",
    "Take it. With Hill. Other sections are not as good as his.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend H&P to other students. Regardless of what we will end up doing in our future, I think it is important to understand the ideas underlying our society and government, especially as being the product of generations of thought.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student with a strong interest in the humanities in general. I would summarize it as accounts of wars and empire, as well as theories about the best state, written by dead white men.",
    "The curriculum of the fall semester of History and Politics isn't quite as thrilling as the other DS sections for the most part, but it had excellent moments, and Professor Hill made the works we read much more interesting. Hill has an amazing ability to draw his audience in when he speaks. Though he is often silent for the first thirty minutes or more of class, when he takes over, the class gets dramatically more interesting. I only wish he sometimes didn't let the class continue on its own quite so long. But Hill commands attention and admiration, and, when he talks about Thucydides, you have to love the book. He's always available to answer questions, and he has very interesting ideas. He's pretty funny, too, and a really nice guy.",
    "DS History and Politics is great. However, there is a lot of reading. You probably won't get through all of it. Make sure you go to lectures and section to get an idea of what parts you ought to go back and look at if you do not get through all the reading. This will be important for the exam later.",
    "Take DS and fight to get into Charles Hill's section. Charles Hill is god... (speaking as someone generally opposed to these cults around professors)... section with Charles Hill was one of the most rewarding academic experiences I've ever had. He has perhaps the most lucid mind at Yale.",
    "The class material is very comprehensive in the both of the realm of history and political thought.",
    "History and Politics is unique among the three DS courses in that you can really get at a \"big picture\" understanding of the West. Setting aside quality time to read the texts is the only way to do this. Also, there are a lot of little gems in the stuff you read, especially Herodotus, Thucydides, and Livy. Close reading will reward you.",
    "It's impossible to separate this course from the rest of DS, but I think History and Politics is a huge part of what makes DS worth it. The thinkers and historians we read teach a way of approaching the world and how to learn from the past. The readings are long but well worth it, and the professors beyond excellent."
