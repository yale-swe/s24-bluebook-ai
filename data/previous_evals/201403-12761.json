    "Math 380 is the intro graduate algebra class. The experience will depend substantially on the instructor, although for the past several years it has followed Atiyah Macdonald's book fairly closely. If Jiuzu teaches again, the lectures will follow Atiyah Macdonald closely, with some digressions into (seemingly) incomprehensible more advanced material. The course experience will be like an independent study in which you do most of the problems from the textbook.",
    "Math 380 is a quick introduction to commutative algebra. The course focused on Rings, Modules, Chain conditions, Dimension, and Completions. We used atiyah as our textbook which was solid book, but not suitable as a reference so outside material can be helpful. The psets are challenging and can be very long upwards of 20 hours, though professor hong was very fair with granting extensions. Professor Hong's lectures started off a little rough, but by the end of the semester his clarity and preparedness seem to increase. The material can be very challenging especially for an undergraduate but is definitely approachable.",
    "Abstract nonsense to the max, if you like it, great, if not, too bad. It's the perfect combination of boring and difficult! Honestly, I'm not sure this class has ever been well taught, so it seems like the general strategy is to read all of Atiyah and teach yourself everything, plus somehow have an intuitive sense of algebraic geometry. Jiuzu was a very friendly and understanding professor, but the material is daunting and often proofs would be missing key parts and he wouldn't understand them himself, so, that gives you an idea of what the course is like. Also, read about sheaves. In advance. On a more positive note, you need this to take noncommutative. So if you think you might like algebra, just be prepared to become best friends with Atiyah.",
    "This course was pretty average. Honestly, the material is not that interesting and is mostly only relevant to algebraic geometry, which you don't really learn in this class. Long problem sets that are usually all\/almost all the problems in Atiyah. We had a take home final that was not very relevant to what we had learned.",
    "Very challenging, partly because of very difficult problem sets (for which we were offered no support in the form of office hours or a TF) and partly because lectures were poorly delivered and hard to follow. I did learn a lot of algebra by working through the homework, but it was a frustrating experience."
