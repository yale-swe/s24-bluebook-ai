    "Would definitely recommend it - Julia Titus is an incredible professor and you get a lot out of the class.",
    "If you're the least bit interested in Russian, I'd recommend taking it. You get hooked really quickly!",
    "Russian L2 is a great class, but it does get a lot more difficult than L1.",
    "absolutely",
    "Good class and need to be determined to learn Russian in order to succeed. Gain a lot of knowledge and control of the language, so is definitely worth it.",
    "Of course! Only, however, if you are serious about the language. The course is only as valuable as you are willing to let it be. Doing the homework is necessary to solidifying grammatical concepts, and you really need to go every day to expose yourself to as much spoken Russian as possible. That being said, the environment is friendly and relaxed, and you come to know the other students very well by the end of the course.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Julia is incredible!",
    "Russian 120 is harder than L1 Russian. Be prepared to tackle some very complicated grammatical concepts very quickly. Instruction was good, but not as strong as first semester.",
    "a great second semester language course. i never thought that i would be this far along after only two semesters of russian."
