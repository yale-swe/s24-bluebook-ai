    "Every EVST senior has to take it, so there is not much to say about it. However, I would recommend spending as much time as possible doing your own research outside of class, because this won't really be asked of you until you have to turn in the first 20 pages of your thesis,and this is rather late to get started.",
    "This course provides a great opportunity to stay on track with the thesis throughout the semester. The fact that four professors are readily available once a week is extremely helpful.",
