    "Really effective language learning.",
    "I gained all the Japanese language skills that I currently have (which is significant considering i only took the course for 3 and a half months).",
    "Kanji, grammar structure, intonations, tenses, writing hiragana and katakana, memorizing vocab, and understanding cultural hierarchy. I learned a lot, and I enjoyed it. This class is hard work with high rewards.",
    "I learned a lot of Japanese and can now handle basic conversations in the language."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Sometimes grammars can be hard because they're not explained clearly.",
    "Strengths: Very efficient introduction to a language (daily class and homework is helpful) Weaknesses: A bit confusing in the beginning (learning how to read the schedules)",
    "Fast-paced is a double-edged sword. Teachers are all nice and engaging. Cutting off excess hw assignments (various media assignments) would be nice, and an overall fill-in-the-blank for all verb tenses done at the END of a unit, not the beginning of the unit, would be nice to study to.",
    "There was a lot of material every day and while I did learn a lot, it was hard to retain all of the grammar structures, vocabulary, and other skills because it seemed like every time we learned something, we would move on to another without having time to practice. Even though I signed up for a Japanese tutor as well, I felt that the material was a lot to keep up with.",
    "Strengths Very intensive class that forces you to stay engaged. Facilitates a lot of learning and new knowledge etc. Focuses on pronunciation, comprehension of different accents, grammar, overall vocabulary etc. It was great because by the end of the semester I felt a like I learned over a year's worth of Japanese. Weaknesses I felt like sometimes the class work load was too much but it's well known that it's one of the harder language courses. Also I feel like sometimes in class we'd start using new vocabulary from a class ahead and they expected us to know. Whenever that happened I felt very frustrated. Also the difference in skill level and experience with Japanese among the students. Some people already had some experience and one or two were already fluent or near it. So in the beginning it was very hard for me to get confident but that was fixed by the end of the semester.",
    "The course was taught well and I do not see much room for improvement."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Really fun and useful language class.",
    "Yes; even if you can only take Japanese for a year, you will be able to understand a lot of the general structure of the language",
    "Japanese is a hard language, and the class reflects this. You have to be on your toes and study every week if you want to stand a chance in this class, but after all that is said and done, it is rewarding. It depends how much effort one wants to put to a L1 course. Overall, would recommend.",
    "yes",
    "If you are interested in the language, this class is wonderful. It is challenging and a big time commitment, but the instructors are wonderful and you learn a lot."
