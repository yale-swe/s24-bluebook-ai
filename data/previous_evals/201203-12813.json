    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone with a strong interest in Spanish.",
    "Take it if you want to learn Spanish and learn it in an intensive way. Excellent instruction. At the end of the semester you are reading portions of Don Quixote and excerpts by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. NOT AN EASY CLASS. Be prepared for this to be the class you dedicate the most time to. It ten hours of class time a week. DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE. Must be ready to take the B+ (doublecredit) in order to learn the language quickly. You learn about 2 chapters of vocab and grammar a week.",
    "A very intensive but rewarding introduction to Spanish. Highly recommended if you want to learn a new language.",
    "Yes, definitely."
