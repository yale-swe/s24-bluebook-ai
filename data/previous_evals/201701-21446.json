    "This class is INTENSE but incredibly rewarding. My knowledge of the french language is far beyond what I thought it would be after a year.",
    "I learned conversational french, or at least a solid piece of it.",
    "learnt how to form french sentences rather than just knowing the words i had learned from L1",
    "Continue working on mastering French Grammar with focus on many tenses and modes of expression.",
    "I learned much more french grammar.",
    "This is a great class and your French will improve so much, especially your ability to hold conversations! If you took French 110l, you can expect this class to be pretty similar. The grammar this semester does get a little bit more complicated, but it's still very manageable. I actually thought this semester was easier than last because it isn't quite as much of a crash course.",
    "I learned more french!"

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Personally, I found the course too focused on french idioms and expressions instead of hard, grammatical concepts that were difficult to learn. For example, learning the Subjunctive without an in-English explanation is extremely difficult. I'd love to see more lessons emphasizing grammar.",
    "This course has a heavy emphasis on conversation over rote memorization or grammar, and this basic principle is still effective. I think some aspects of the class' organization could be better arranged to support this. The amount of rote grammatical work still dominated my time spent on this class at home. The idea was proposed in discussions to increase the amount of sketch-type work; I think that this would be a more effective way to work with new vocabulary for the first time than the traditional oral production. Proposal: What if every few weeks there was a larger oral production component, using not just the vocabulary of that week, but a larger number\/more general questions? This would better test the students' general vocabulary, not just their ability to guess which 3 of the 5-7 viable questions would appear. The rest of the weeks, I think the oral component could be fulfilled in class, with either a sketch, structured discussion, etc. These could focus on the vocabulary for the week specifically, but give students a little more flexibility than the 30 second responses.",
    "strength: the french in action method, professor ngames teaching style weakness: none",
    "Strength is the consistent method of French in Action which gives you a good balanced exposure to the language. Weakness: same method all the time can become somewhat tedious",
    "I think the strength is that I am comfortable with the grammatical structure of french and I can understand it pretty well. I think the weakness is that we don't talk enough conversationally, so I would not feel comfortable in a conversation with a french speaker. All of the vocabulary I know is very tied to French in Action, so I'm not sure how to talk to actual people.",
    "The French department really has this course perfected. I'd say overall French in Action is pretty effective. Sometimes it gets a little weird and feels sort of outdated, but for the most part it's very entertaining. The only thing is that I felt it was somewhat limited. I really enjoyed the days when we didn't focus on the textbook and instead had conversations about current events and stuff. I think adding more of that could be really helpful and help improve conversation skills.",
    "I loved how small the class was. I loved Ngame and thought the course was great."

   "comments": [
    "If they are looking for an easy language requirement, no. If they are looking to truly increase their french skills, absolutely.",
    "yes, you will definitely learn a lot after having taken L1 and L2",
    "Yes. Take L2 french and you will be ready to continue with French on your own -- that's how much exposure to the language you get.",
    "I think it is the best class if you are trying to learn French well at this age.",
    "Yes, take it because you'll learn so much! I personally have loved French at Yale. Especially if you take the time to put all the work in and not do the bare minimum, you'll really get a lot out of it in the end.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot."
