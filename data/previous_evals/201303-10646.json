    "This class is a great class especially if you are curious about the history of Japan but don't know anything about it! The work is about the same as any other history class, and you'll learn some really interesting things.",
    "Yes. As a STEM major, I have to say that I was incredibly impressed with the class. My favorite class taken at Yale. Must take class, even if you're a STEM major.",
    "This was an amazing class! My favorite semester and one of the best I've taken at Yale; TAKE IT! Professor Drixler is a great lecturer, and his powerpoints really help you visualize the time periods he discusses in class. Yes, the exams cover a lot of material, but as long as you study and have been taking good notes, you'll do fine. Definitely take this course--especially if you have no previous courses in East Asian history.",
    "EXCELLENT. This class is a gem. After taking this class, I am inspired to take the next one in the Japan series. Prof Drixler: Very great lecturer and awesome guy in general! For our final, he bought us all hot chocolate and coffee from Panera. He's also very humble, kinda like Marvin Chun. Lectures are very well-organized, theme-based, and he really draws in the most illustrative (and sometimes quite amusing) examples. Prof. Drixler also makes sure to show both sides of the story, allowing students to draw conclusions of their own.",
    "Take this class! Professor Drixler is an excellent lecturer, and also one of the nicest professors at Yale.",
    "Overview of early modern Japan, a really fascinating time period.",
    "I came into this course with no prior knowledge of the history of Japan and I found it pretty interesting! Professor Drixler is fascinated with the topic and that REALLY comes across in his lectures, which are usually engaging. The reading for the course is typical of a history class, and it can be a bit heavy at times but nothing too bad. The mid-term and final are not too bad, but they do require a lot given the time constraints (especially the mid-term - 2 essays and IDs in 50 min). There are two short essays that are required for the class, but Drixler made the second essay optional in exchange for a final that was weighted heavier. He's a pretty fair grader and we weren't graded on a curve at all. Overall, a pretty interesting course that thoroughly covers all aspects of Japan 1550 - 1850.",
    "A truly great history class. Whether you have a strong interest in Japan or not, professor Drixler (hands-down, the nicest man in the universe, no joke) will keep you intrigued throughout the semester. When you ask him a question, no matter what it is, he will make you feel like it was the best question he's ever been asked. The class is structured very nicely, the themes of the lectures go well together in sequence. He presents the material with such contagious, genuine enthusiasm and interest, it is nearly impossible not to be affected. There are also numerous outside of the lecture opportunities in this class like seeing special Tokugawa era artifacts in the Peabody museum, or watching related movies. Take this course for a wonderful history experience, made conveniently more wonderful if you have an interest in Japan.",
    "This class covers Japanese society as it evolves from the 600's, and the bulk of the course covers the Tokugawa Era. The first half is chronological while the second focuses on different parts of society. The slides are pretty solid, the material is interesting, and there's lots of great stories. I learned a ton in this class and would highly recommend it to others.",
    "I would recommend this class. It was interesting and not overly difficult. The professor and teaching assistant were there if you had any questions, or wanted to discuss things further.",
    "In basic terms, this is a history course that covers the Warring States period and the resulting \"Great Peace\" of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Take this course if you are looking for a ROTW credit, but not if you are looking for a totally easy class. There are easier ones, believe me. But, the midterm, paper, and final are all extremely understandable and not surprising in any way. Prof. Drixler held an extremely informative review session during reading week, and even sent us a summary of notes from the meeting that he himself took down. While I find the section totally unhelpful in the context of this course, the class is one worth taking if you want to get an off-the-beaten-path view - from a brilliant historian of Japan - of the formation of pre-modern japan.",
    "A really interesting class, would definitely recommend it! Drixler is a fantastic professor who really cares about the topic and his students.",
    "This was one of the best classes I took this semester. Although I knew next to nothing about Japanese history before I took the class, I now feel very comfortable not just with the history and culture of the Tokugawa period, but also with the major themes of Japanese history stretching back to the BCE's.Be warned, Professor Drixler is a tough grader, but he is a great lecturer and cares immensely for his students. I'll miss the class.",
    "Great class!",
    "Take this class. Just take it. I came in with no particular knowledge about or interest in Japanese history, and I loved every lecture. Professor Drixler does a great job balancing interesting anecdotes with fascinating information about historical trends of the period, and he really keeps things engaging and interesting. Most of the readings are pretty interesting, and they're not too long.",
    "History 307 is one of the must-take courses at Yale before one graduates. This course, which covers Japan's history from the beginning to the beginnings of Japan's modern era, fully covers how Japan transformed from a feudal state to the modernized state it is today. Professor Drixler is a phenomenal professor, and I always looked forwardto going to lecture every week. Yiwen is also an amazing TA, and the sections always complemented the lectures very well.",
    "This class is awesome. Good for every level of knowledge about Japanese history, lectures are compelling, Prof. Drixler is invested in his students. If you're a history major looking for a ROW credit, look no further. If you just want a fascinating class, also look no further. Seriously, go to one lecture, you'll be hooked.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student.",
    "A good, not very difficult basic history of Japanese history leading up to and including the Tokugawa period. I would certainly recommend this class if you have any interest in Japanese history or need a relatively easy history class to fulfill a requirement.",
    "This is a fantastic class. Even if you know barely anything about Japan, Professor Drixler will get you talking in depth about the sustainability policies of Tokugawa Japan in no time. There is a lot to get out of this course, but it definitely will also be fun.",
    "Take it! Really interesting stuff. Even if you don't know anything about Japan, I think you'll find a lot of what we study relevant today (How the Japanese became a sustainable society, for example) and also Professor Drixler is amazing.",
    "This is a fantastic course, one of the best courses I've taken at Yale without a doubt and Prof. Drixler is the best professor I've ever had. He cares so much about his students and knew the names of all 40+ of us by October, even though it was a lecture course and he had no obligation to do that. He even came to a couple of our sections, which was also way beyond what he needed to do. He is incredibly careful not to make wild assumptions or presuppositions about people or culture but is still able to make profound assertions aboutJapanese history and culture and the world, many of them having changed the I way I think about history. He is a great lecturer but I could see how some may not like his style. Maybe it's that for some it takes getting used to. But once you catch on you will hear gems of humor and insight that verges on what I would call endearing idiosyncrasies. He is very adaptive to the students and is willing to make exceptions if many students are having a rough time. For example, he made our second essay optional because many of the students were having a very stressful\/overcommitted time with other assignments\/courses\/extracurriculars. I only missed one lecture and it was because I had to and I still regret it because I had such a fun time each class. The TA, Yiwen, was also great. If you are interested in the subject and work hard, she and the professor are very forgiving with grades. Take it, take it, take it! It is so much more than a RoW credit for History majors.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student looking to understand more about the period of Japanese history often highly romanticized in modern culture. It helps give a more nuanced view of the samurai warrior culture, and explains the complexities of Japanese diplomatic relations beyond the oversimplifying idea of isolation.",
    "This is a fabulous course! It is a very interesting survey of the history of Tokugawa Japan. It explores topics of culture, society, government, and military. I would highly recommend this course!",
    "HIST 307 is a comprehensive survey of Japan in the Tokugawa period. The class covers social, political, and cultural history in a fun and engaging manner. While there is a fair amount of reading, the class is designed to help students do well, and I would certainly recommend it for a new way to learn about Japan!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Professor Drixler is excellent, and the course bears a great deal of relevance to issues facing society today."
