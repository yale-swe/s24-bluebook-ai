    "Yes.",
    "If there's any chance you will need to be able to read or understand Political Science research involving formal models, you should definitely take this class. It's much more straightforward and accessible than the previous one in the sequence.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Highly recommended for all doctoral students in the PhD program, including those who have not taken Fundamentals of Modeling I.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to somebody who wants a decent intro to game theory",
    "If 517 shook you so violently that you can't imagine ever doing another formal modeling class, do not lose hope. This is a very good course, the homework is difficult but interesting, and the concepts are important not only for those who want to model, but also for those interested in thinking more clearly about coordination, information, and strategic behavior in politics."
