    "a broad survey of Islamic intellectual thought, theology and philosophy from the 7th century to the 20th",
    "I was able to read an understand the ideas of Islamic theological history in their context, and to see the development of early Islam into the religion it is today. I was able to write and think about Islamic scholars, and to discuss major theological debates in Islam.",
    "This course provides a great overview into early Islamic history, and how that informs later theological movements. The structure of the course is very conducive to learning, and the readings have been carefully curated to provide insight into the key teachings of different theological schools. You will cover Shi'ism, Mutazilites, Ash'arism, as well as parts of Sufism and the Salafiyya movement, so it's really a great introduction into Islamic theology.",
    "I learned something about the early history of Islam and a great deal about classical Islamic philosophy.",
    "This course provided a wonderful background of Islamic history, theology, and philosophy. It balanced breadth with in-depth conversations quite well. I gained practice in critical philosophical thinking, as well as forming arguments. Most of all, I enjoyed learning about a culture and tradition very different from my own and broadening my perspective.",
    "I learned about the history of Islamic thought, and came away with a better understanding of the religion and where it comes from.",
    "I learned how to think about religion philosophically, which I had never done before.",
    "We learned early Islamic history, several important schools of thought and denominations within Islam, al-Ghazali's metaphysics, the impact of geopolitical forces in Islamic thought from the 9th century to the present, the intellectual history of Wwstern commentaries on Islamic thought, etc. FANTASTIC course.",
    "This course gave me a broad sense of the development of Islamic ideas and pointed out key individuals in Muslim history that are worth noting. It allowed me to consider some important philosophical debates within Islamic theology and helped me appreciate the vastness of Muslim thought. The TA of this class did a really great job helping us synthesize readings so that we could understand core points and process the information."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "first half of the course wasn't too engaging, since it was primarily historical and i felt like could have been condensed into one or two lectures",
    "This class was great. I have very few suggestions, except that having a final exam and a final paper was a lot. Perhaps having two in-class exams, one in the middle, and one at the end, would be a little more low-key and would still serve the purpose of the final.",
    "Strengths: clear, crisp lectures; a well-done section Weaknesses: relation of readings to class sometimes unclear; first half of the course spends way too much time talking about early historical developments in Islam and not enough on the, well, 'theology and philosophy'.",
    "The strength of this course was its fascinating material, as communicated by well-organized and understandable lectures. I found Professor Griffel's presentation of difficult philosophies and complex historical events very approachable. I think section could have been improved; we sometimes read material that was never (or very little) discussed in section. I wished we could have gotten more depth with some of those readings, either in lecture or in section.",
    "A strength of this course was that the testing style of 2 exams and one paper was highly conducive to retention of the material taught. One way the course could be better is if we were asked to write a bit more before tackling the final paper. Perhaps a short 5-pager worth 10% of the grade? I found it overwhelming to write a paper worth 35% without having written for the class before. Another grievance that I had is that there wasn't much of a theological or philosophical dialogue during sections. Especially during the weeks of the course that we dealt with the falasafa, al-Ghazali, Averroes, al-Arabi, and Ibn Taymiya. I got the impression that we were reading their works more in an intellectual history course than a theology and philosophy course.",
    "The course was good for giving a broad overview. One thing I think could help would be to make the term paper take up more time in the semester. It seemed like there weren't grades until right at the end, when everyone suddenly had to write a paper and study for an exam. If the paper was due earlier, or perhaps had an abstract or outline due earlier, so that it felt more like a big project, that might help with student stress at the end.",
    "This course was excellent. The strength of the course was in the material covered. I felt like the course covered a contentious and complex subject in an understandable way. Each school of thought was covered with the same focus and without too much judgement. The readings tied in with the course and section amplified the material, not rehashing what was talked about in lecture. The weakness of the course was twofold. First, the use of Arabic words was difficult because Griffel sometimes forgot to write them on the board. The words also differed from readings to class. Second, the material tested did not reflect the material taught in class. The tests focused on narrow subject material which didn't reflect the wide variety we learned.",
    "Lectures were sometimes hard to follow, ideas somewhat haphazardly introduced and tied together. I wish we had gone more in-depth with the more substantive thinkers and philosophical concepts (al-ghazali, ibn sina, ibn arabi, for example). This class gave me more of a historical overview than anything else.",
    "The material was really interesting and very manageable. We could have used more time in section to go over things, but that can't really be changed. Overall, loved the course.",
    "Professor Griffel's lectures were FANTASTIC. They made me excited for class every week. He has a true talent for making vast quantities of complex historical information and philosophical information crystal clear. The reading load was heavy, the grade distribution wasn't ideal, and guidance on the final paper was vague (thank you to our TF Ryan for getting us the basic information we needed, like page limits), but 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "This class is strong in that it provides exposure to many ideas, events, and people. The professor is accessible and the TA is very generous with his time and passion. Unlike other history courses though, because this class tried to fit in so much, there was very little room for questions, analysis, processing, and for a critical perspective on what we were learning. It was definitely more of a memorization-based class. Lectures often went over time by a few minutes or so and none provided room for discussion or clarification. Overall, although this course is a wonderful learning opportunity, it is aggressively demanding in ways that are not fitting for the topic and that emphasize particularities in a way that does not allow one to properly engage with the course."

   "comments": [
    "This is a class you take for a reason. It's not a gutty fifth class, it's not a legendary Yale classic, or a prereq for anything, which means that everybody cares and is engaged. If you have a reason to take this class, and you're going to be interested in Islamic theology and intellectual history, there is no better way to get that exposure than in this class. If this is something you're searching for, chances are, you'll enjoy it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about Islamic theological movements from a really knowledgeable professor.",
    "Maybe. The course covers a lot of ground but at the expense of depth - out of an entire course that's supposedly on philosophy, I could cite you maybe one or two arguments that were discussed in detail. Lots of surface-level discussion, with the exception of al-Ghazali (Prof Griffel's area of expertise). Also you have to be prepared to memorize dates for the exams.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I always looked forward to coming to lecture and was never once bored. It was refreshing to learn about ethics, morality, and religion within a context other than Greek philosophy or Christianity. An excellent course!",
    "Definitely take this course if you are interested in religion, intellectual history, and\/or exposing yourself to non-Western thought. This is a survey course of the major theological and philosophical debates in Islam since its founding to the present. Sitting in Professor Griffel's lecture, one gets an acute sense of the complexities in the belief systems of the major sects of Islam. Professor Griffel is a great lecturer and is highly knowledgable on the subject. It was an honour to be lectured by him!",
    "Yes, but not as a fifth course. With a final paper and a final exam, it makes the end of the semester rough. Throughout the semester it's mostly just reading so that's okay, but the end is hard with two things due for one class.",
    "A great course for students of any major. It was accessible and interesting every week.",
    "Definitely, I absolutely loved everything about this course from the way it was set up, to the lectures by Professor Griffel, to the material.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. TAKE IT!!!!",
    "I would recommend this course if you are looking for a really broad overview of Islamic philosophers\/thinkers, though you would have to be careful to be critical of what you are hearing on your own. There isn't much room for that in class. At the same time, I definitely caution that this class is demanding (long, dense readings, a paper, two exams, and active participation in section) and, unfortunately, the effort does not necessarily pay off. Be careful if you are trying to get an A and want to take this class... it might not be the wisest move."
