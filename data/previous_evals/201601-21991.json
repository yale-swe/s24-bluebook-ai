    "I would say it is an amazing way to expand your knowledge on 20th century music and I would absolutely recommend this course!!",
    "TAKE THIS if you have any interest in learning about a seriously under-studied era of music (and if they ever offer it again). Every week has radically different music- be prepared to hate some pieces and love other pieces, but such is the late 20th century (or any era, really). I'm sure it depends on who's in the seminar, but we had some of the most insightful, engaging, thorough discussions I've had in college- 110 minutes went too quickly every week.",
    "Overview of the complex network of influences and aesthetic strains from 1950 - 2016 in European Avant-Garde Music if you're willing to engage weird sounds with open ears and an analytical perspective, I would highly recommend this class these are some of the most amazing works I've ever heard and dissected.",
    "One of the only classes one can take as a music major that lies outside of the department's \"Standard\" canon of classical music, which apparently \"dies\" after 1945"
