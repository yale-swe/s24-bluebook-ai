    "Wasn't really worth the time, definitely glad I took it Cr\/D\/F. If you're interesting in using microcontrollers\/sensors, you'd be better off just buying stuff for yourself and spending a couple afternoons tinkering. The professor doesn't really understand the programming\/sensors\/etc. beyond what he uses for his own applications, so if your ideas don't happen to line up with his, you're basically on your own. Also he speaks really quietly in a soporific monotone whether the class is quiet or everyone is completely ignoring him and talking. Plus side: Once I was sitting on my laptop on Meebo, and he came by to see how my project was going and APOLOGIZED for interrupting my conversation. Whatever.",
    "It definitely is a good introduction to the kinds of things that can be done with simple programming techniques and easy to acquire electronics. I don't know that taking the class will really provide you with the skills you need to work on interactive projects on your own.",
    "Chill out, program, solder, rejoice.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it to myself, but I can see how a programming hobby nerd would just eat this class up. Not too much work, but you do sort of have to navigate your way around Processing and PD. THIS IS NOT AN ART OR DESIGN COURSE. It is about programming, and definitely more on the music end than the visual. It does give a broad introduction to interactive design, for which I am grateful. Not really a fun class to attend every week, though.",
    "If you're interested by the course material and willing to take charge of your own work, take this class. The subject matter is interesting, but the class feels more like a workshop than a course. If you're not willing to put in the time, you may not learn too much.",
    "Yes! Take it! If you have done any programming before it is a great way to apply this in a completely different way. Everything is user friendly, there is no nasty compilers and minimum frustration and de-bugging. It's like a breath of fresh air compared to classes in the Computer Science department. Anyone doing Computing and the Arts, or thinking of doing it, also HAS to take this class. It's the closest thing to the major. If you have never programmed before, still take this class. There is as much or as little programming as you want and it is really easy to learn. We use a wide variety of languages\/programs and people tended to pick their favorite and work in that for the rest of the semester. So some are more code intensive than others. Also, ignore what you see on the syllabus, we stopped sticking to that after about 2 weeks. There is nowhere near as much work as that suggests. Great class!",
    "Taking worldly input and adding a layer of abstraction with Processing, Pure Data, Max\/MSP, and\/or Arduino. In reality, you will only focus on learning the skills that are practical to your final project. The class has some programming, some electronics, and ominous technical difficulties. Jonathan is very knowledgeable."
