    "I learned a lot about the construction of white identity and how whiteness plays out into different facets of American society. Through this course, I developed a nuanced understanding of the role of whiteness in the modern day - how it came to be, and the various institutions\/incentives that have molded and reinforced whiteness.",

   "comments": [
    "Taught by a really dedicated and well-versed professor, solid readings in general and substantive seminar conversations, but the course lacked a narrative or a specific purpose. The readings, while really interesting individually, didn't always work together collectively.",
    "I struggled most with what felt like a disconnect between the content of the conversations we had and the far more academic readings that we did.",
    "I really enjoyed the salons, both coming up with my own group's presentation and reading what my peers had assigned. I know reading responses aren't always a popular opinion, but I find that I am much more attentive and complete much more of my work on the weeks when I need to write something before class. Adding one or two more reading responses or \"think pieces\" would be beneficial for chronic skimmers. I loved how fluid the class conversations could be, especially around the time of the election. The issues we talked about in class are so relevant to every aspect of our lives, so it was great to be able to decompress about the events of the semester.",
    "The course itself was fantastic. In-class discussions were incredibly insightful, and Aaron left most of the discussion to students while making sure to guide us in the correct direction. The readings were also varied and incredibly interesting-we read from prominent sociologists, race theorists, psychologists and activists to develop as nuanced and understanding as possible of 'White America.'"

   "comments": [
    "Aaron is great and this is important material; he does a really great job of establishing an intimate seminar experience that ultimately facilitates engagement from all students in the room. The class would be a good seminar to add as a fifth class, as there isn't an overwhelming amount of work (about 200 pages per week), but the intellectual reward is substantial.",
    "If you want to take a class that offers more concrete materials to ground the conversations that are going on on campus and around the country, as well as an environment to talk about them in a designated space, this really is a great class.",
    "Yes!",
    "Absolutely. This, or any other class with Aaron.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was without a doubt the most interesting and culturally relevant course I've taken at Yale. The depth of class discussion, the carefully selected but diverse readings, and Aaron himself made this class fantastic.",
    "Very good history\/reading list, and Aaron is a very kind prof. However it's important to push yourself and your peers in this class bc discussions can be easily sidetracked. It was wild to take it during the 2016 election.",
    "I would recommend this course to every Yale student who is ready to sincerely question what 'whiteness' means in the US. This includes an engagement in the history of 'whiteness' in the United States, in the different meanings that whiteness carries, and in the ways we can and should work to dismantle the 'possessive investment in whiteness' that can be traced throughout US history.",
    "Yes, I wish this class (or a variation) and its topics were baked into every student's introduction to Yale. Does more to help me be a good person than almost any other class."
