   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend it if a student enjoyed buildings and philosophical mindsets. Those who think quantitatively though, may find themselves unsure of how to pull magical orations out of no where about parts of a building normal people overlook (ie placement of nails, angles of archways, shapes of windows, and all of their meanings).",
    "I would definitely commend this because it was a really fun class. I really enjoyed the learning, discussions and drawing assignments. You also get an intimate setting.",
    "This class was a great way to see a new side of both architecture and utopia. The class was balanced between the two, and had traditional reading aspects as well as creative projects that were fun to do. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is looking to explore architecture (since it is one of the very first opportunities to take a class in the department). I'd also recommend it to anyone else because it is an interesting exploration of things that are usually taught in different contexts.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's a great introduction to certain ideas and concepts in architecture, and the seminar structure of the class was a really great experience.",
    "The workload is very light and if you have a small class, discussions can be very fun. You don't learn much though, and I felt like I came out of the class having gained very little."
