   "comments": [
    "This is an excellent course - it was really refreshing to take a course that focused on the critical analysis of primary literature rather than memorization of a textbook. Also, Professor Zhong is great.",
    "Overall, yes. Not too much work on a day-to-day basis and Professor Zhong's style of teaching--bombarding you with questions--keeps you awake. With the rest of the professors, the lectures vary in terms of quality and energy.Our final was a ~10-page review on neural stem cells.",
    "yes, i would recommend this class ifyou were looking to read a lot of classic neurodevelopment papers.",
    "This course convinced me of the romance of science. There were couple moments in the reading or during class where I'd want to stand and yell \"hoorah\" and jump up and down. Professor Zhong gives you impossible tasks -- like critiquing research in a field in which you have no expertise, or reviewing literature on a topic with no groundwork -- and you actually, albeit awkwardly, figure out how to navigate yourself. You don't get any of this in lecture courses. Don't let the title fool you -- it's not really a class on neuroscience -- it's a class on how to do science with neuroscience as a case study. You end up with very little knowledge but a lot of know-how. The only qualm I have is that there are a lot of guest lecturers which makes style a little unpredictable."
