    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was the best one I've taken at Yale.",
    "This class was a great way to learn key concepts in physiology. Also, I got a sense for how to go about differentiating between conditions that have very similar symptoms. I also have a much more solid understanding of how the organ systems in the body interrelate. I would definitely recommend the class to another student because I feel that it is a good way to really get a good grasp on body functions and malfunctions."

    "While this course was not directly relevant to my thesis research, it did serve to deepen my knowledge of the medical profession, which is an area I am very interested in. If I were a medical student, this would undoubtedly be one of the most important courses of my medical school career.",
    "This course helped me get a better sense for how a medical diagnosis is made. It also taught me ways that malfunctions in one area affect other areas and how symptoms relate to one another. This course did not directly contribute to my dissertation research, but furthered my understanding of clinical physiology."
