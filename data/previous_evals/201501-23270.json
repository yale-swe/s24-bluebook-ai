   "comments": [
    "The slides were great and very thorough -- tests were fair and based on lectures. Sometimes questions were vague but Dubrow did a good job giving points back if that was the case. Loved the review clicker questions. The homeworks were a little bit too long. Some of it felt like busywork and it took a while to get used to how questions were written. But in general still very helpful. Going over homework in class could be more efficient ... maybe if you went over the questions in small groups with an answer key per group or something.",
    "I thought the course was taught excellently. I personally do not like the discussion groups as much, because I feel that homework can be corrected on one's own time and any questions can be brought to the TA if needed.",
    "Interesting class covering important concepts. The pace slowed down towards the end, and was very repetitive (especially for the multiplicity lectures). Examples were helpful, but provided in too much detail. A short overview would have been better. Class could have been just 50 minutes - same content in less time would have been more interesting. Exams were relatively fair, but the use of multiple choice was not always appropriate. MC questions treated things like confounding in an article as black and white, when it's usually debatable. It became a game of guessing what the professor was trying to get at, rather than what I believe. If short answer was allowed, different perspectives could be proposed and defended.",
    "The course is well structured with a lot of outlines to see where the course is going and how it all fits together. I love clicker questions and they help Dr. Dubrow see what we are understanding and what we are not understanding which is great. I also really like the critiquing process for exams and homework, because we are not only reading literature but being critical of the methodologies. This is a great way to learn epidemiology in my opinion. The hardest part of the course is understanding sometimes convoluted questions on homework and exams. It can be difficult to understand what is being asked. Also, if there is a way to organized lecture slides into folders by date that would awesome; it can be hard to find the right lecture in ClassesV2.",
    "Lecture slides were great but dryness of the lectures meant attending was somewhat difficult.",
    "This class was extremely challenging, and frustrating.",
    "It is definitely an advanced epidemiology course. Dr. Dubrow is knowledgable. The weekly homework is too long though and the lecture slides are also a little condensed.",
    "I think it should be more interactive, and less reliant on the PowerPoints - everything is PowerPoint-based. There has to be a better way to learn epidemiology!",
    "I think the teacher really cares about what we feel. This is a difficult course and his consideration is truly important. However, he does not change much of his style. I think the only problem with him is that he goes the slides too fast.",
    "Strengths: Dr. Dubrow, comprehensive notes, applying knowledge of concepts throughout the semester on hws, clicker questions during class Weaknesses: time consuming hw every week, material is pretty dry",
    "The course seamlessly picked up where Epi 1 left off. The clicker questions were so helpful. The pre-exam clicker question review lectures were the best way for me to assess my understanding of the material before the exam. The only suggestion I have for improvement (and the same that I am suggesting for most courses at YSPH) is to reduce the amount of multiple choice questions on exams and have more open ended answers that give us room to show that we understand the material. It's grad school. I want to learn to think critically and instead of trying to learn how to do well on a professor's exam by trying to figure out the way he\/she thinks or figure out the concept they are testing when I read a question.",
    "No feedback given on homework assignments, but discussion sections were helpful for better understanding the material. Given that homework answers were mostly short answer, I felt that they did not prepare me well for the multiple choice questions on the exams. The new grading scheme (option to choose a 1st and 2nd choice) for the multiple choice questions was more fair than the previous grading method (choose only one answer), but I still did not feel like this type of exam really gauged my understanding of the material.",
    "I learned a lot in this course, but found it very difficult. I think it may have been helpful if we had talked more in class about how different concepts relate or differ, because it often felt complicated when there were similar concepts with very different applications. Clicker questions were very helpful. Problem sets were very time consuming, and I would recommend cutting down the length to give students more time to do readings\/review class content.",
    "I thought it was great. Strength, it has helped me to understand epidemiology as a whole adn to better understand research It could be improved by coordinating with the biostat and AAMIE class so topics are covered at the same time",
    "strengths: well organized weakness: There are some gaps in the logic of lecture, hard for students to follow. To improve, the professor could think a little bit more, and assume not everyone understand the new terminology he introduce at the beginning of each lecture and spend some time to explain.",
    "Strengths was that the material was very fundamental to public health in general, and especially for students going on to pursue research. Weaknesses include that the homework assignments were extremely long, and could have been more relevant to questions included on exams. There seemed to be a discrepancy between material on homework and material on exams.",
    "The instructor is fantastic, he really cares about his students and wants every single one of them to succeed. The clicker questions scattered throughout the lectures are a great way to see if you are following the material, and he provides excellent explanations for how to think through the problems if you aren't getting them right. Also, his review sessions before each test are so nice! You really get all of the material you need to succeed in this course; it requires a lot of work, but he makes it possible for everyone to succeed.",
    "Strength: Encourages critical thinking. Weakness: The topics covered can be better organized.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I thought the material was presented clearly and expetations for students were articulated well.",
    "I learned a lot in this class even though it started off somewhat rocky. I found it challenging that many of the topics covered were presented conceptually in lectures but then more applied in the homework...I sometimes had trouble making the jump. I think that overall the material presented was well organized it was just a lot in volume and if you don't go back through all of the lectures, you can miss important details\/connections. It would have been nice to have a summary lecture that tied concepts from various lectures\/topics together.",
    "Overall this course was valuable and well taught. My only criticism is the phrasing of homework and exam questions. In some cases, it is difficult to understand what a question is asking for or whether or not the answer should be more general or specific.",
    "Learned a lot",
    "instructor really cares, and highly responsive to feedback! but homework was often too long\/highly repetititive in nature. would have also liked to see more exciting (?) article selection-- not everyone is a CDE! put some more EMD in there :)",
    "This course is very well designed, but the content and workload are a little bit overwhelming.",
    "This course is very dense, but very necessary. The content was meaningful and presented with a great theoretical framework as well as real-life examples. However, many assignments had ambiguous wordings for questions, causing confusion for many when completing homework. The jump in difficulty from Epi I to Epi II is very noticeable, and I would almost hope that we were held to a more stringent standard in Epi I to make the transition less shocking.",
    "The subject material is interesting and the instructor really tries his best to provide real world examples and applications for much of the concepts that we cover. Sometimes, due to the nature of the subject, some of the questions posed may have been confusing, but the instructor tries his best to provide explanations and take student input during grading, which I appreciated greatly.",
    "The course was very useful and the homework very helpful.",
    "I feel that this course has advanced my knowledge in epidemiology and my ability to critically read research articles. Although some of the homework assignments were a bit lengthy, Dr. Dubrow adjusted them after receiving student feedback. So I would suggest keeping them at a reasonable length throughout the semester since they are weekly assignments. I think the homework assignments were at a good level because they were challenging, but it was nice that they were pass\/fail so that you could make your best attempt and then review the answers in section. For section, maybe it would be useful to spend less time on homework and save time at the end to have a more open discussion for 10-15 minutes about the article topic to have students discuss a public health issue and how it could be addressed to get them thinking in a broader sense. This course material coincides nicely with biostats II and applied analytic methods of epi.",
    "Good",
    "I enjoyed this course. I felt the homeworks really helped facilitate my understanding of the material and that the tests were fair.",
    "Strength: very informative, straightforward, ta's were available, professor tailored lecture style and pace of the class to students Weakness: long homeworks, no review session for tests",
    "Strengths: - Covers important concepts - Complements material learnt in other epidemiology courses",
    "I learned a lot but I find the homework is more useful than the lecture.",
    "This course was incredibly well-structured. The lectures were well organized and a good balance of material and examples. The homework always helped reinforce material taught in class. The course really taught me to be critical about studies and how to dissect research papers. I am very confident in my abilities now.",
    "I felt as though this course was a bit redundant. A lot of the material was covered in other classes - specifically BIS505B and CDE534. Some of it was new material, but all of these classes shouldn't be required when there is so much overlapping material.",
    "This class was a great application of epi principles to real world examples. That being said, sometimes it felt like answers were subjective, (e.g. I still don't know what to include in a primary hypothesis). One improvement I would have for future classes is to revamp the cheat sheet. Instead of having multiple sheets with notes for Part 1 of the exam, I would have loved to have a single sheet that we could write hard to remember formulas and keep it with us the entire test. I'm not sure if that is possible, but it would have freed up my study time so I could more fully understand concepts instead of memorizing formulas.",
    "I hate that it's such a large class. It's a difficult course. I know that Professor Dubrow and all the TFs do their best to make themselves available to answer questions, but it's sometimes not easy to make to office hours between other courses, jobs, etc. There's sometimes barely enough time in discussion to get through homework so it's hard to ask questions at that time.",
    "This course was very informative, detailed, and went at the right speed. It was very practical and I think has given me a much better understanding of applied Epidemiology than if I had just taken CDE 516 A.",
    "I thought the course was good but challenging, and seemed like a big step up from Principles of Epidemiology I. However, I feel that I learned a lot from this course.",
    "I thought this class overall was tough but very good for me. There was just so much material but Dubrow tried to present it in a clear way. He has many slides, which makes reviewing and studying for exams a little overwhelming. Overall, I thought the class was good but tough.",
    "This course had quite a few high points and low points. On one hand, it was an excellent survey through a variety of topics pertinent to epidemiologic research. On the other hand, the focus on some seemingly pedantic material felt odd as material within a required course. As an individual who does not see oneself going into broad epidemiologic research throughout my career, many of the topics covered were hard to engage with fully due to the pedantic nature of some of the material. One significant issue with this course is the amount of overlap with other required courses. As funny and reinforcing it may be to learn the same thing three times in a single day, it gets fairly frustrating to learn a single method multiple times. I would've thought that this class would have put more of an emphasis on the interpretation and practical uses of things such as multiple regression models, but there seemed to be just as much focus on the equation writing and comprehension as there was in our biostats class. However, the presentation was far more muddled in this course, and I frequently found myself trying to understand information for this course through the information I was taught in biostats, which seems counter-productive. The discussion sections felt fairly useless in this course. There was little incentive to stay attentive and actively correct the homework, since the assignment was already turned in, and we could just look at the answers later on the key. Being able to turn in corrected homework would have made the discussion sections far more engaging, since everyone would be actively discussing the correct answer. As it was, people seemed to content to simply give any answer and move on.",
    "Overall this is a great introductory epidemiology course following Epi I. The strength of the course was the practical application of epidemiological theory to research. I would recommend varying the homework reading as they were heavy in chronic disease but the course is taken by SBS and EMD as well. More global or infectious disease readings would be more interesting and apply to more varied interests.",
    "Epi II is probably the most challenging course I've had in my first year. While it is difficult, I also feel like I learned the most from this class in terms of tangible skills and understanding to take with me in my academic and professional career. There is a lot of material and some of it is more technical and scientific than other courses, but it ultimately serves to help us become more critical readers of the literature, a skill which we will use for many years to come. The use of the clickers was actually very helpful to assess how well I was grasping material along the way.",
    "Strengths: It is a challenging course. You have to learn a lot of content and it demands a lot of effort Weakness: The multiple choice format of the exams doesn't necessarily test what you know, but how well you can interpret what the question is asking",
    "The course was quite helpful as it allowed us to get a more in-depth look at how to read an epi article but one thing that was quite frustrating is how we were tested. Our professor is quite an intelligent person but it was frustrating because some questions required outside knowledge outside of the scope of the course in order to answer them effectively. In addition, I also felt to be honest the TFs were not quite helpful in truly explaining these concepts to us. There is no denying that they in fact knew the material but when it came time to teach it to us in their own way, it never completely made any sense. In addition, when preparing for tests, it was quite unfair that TFs would share certain helpful terms or ways to think about a question with certain students but withhold this from other students."

    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Very nice and knowledgeable. Has incredible experience. Cares about student progress.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I think Dr. Dubrow is one of the most knowledgeable and passionate professors I have ever had. He is not dynamic but he makes up for it in the time he takes to make sure we are paying attention and understanding throughout lecture. He could add some pictures or designs to his slides to facilitate the dynamic issue. I cannot emphasize enough how much I admire him speaking about climate change in the context of public health and how much I wish other professor emphasized this like Dr. Dubrow has.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I think that Dr. Dubrow was fantastic in this course. He was extremely receptive to student feedback along the way and he altered the course as needed in order to best fit the needs\/requests of the students in order to better the experience overall. I think that this shows that he really cares about his students and about the quality of the course overall. He was one of the very few professors who actually took feedback and made changes and I greatly appreciated that.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow really cares about his students and is a great teacher.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is knowledgable. It will be better if Dr. Dubrow could explain some concepts more clearly.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is a very helpful instructor in this course. As a mandatory requirement for the epidemiology departments, it is important to really digest and understand these concepts, and his use of examples are great in achieving this goal.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Very supportive, and genuinely cares about each and every student.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Lectures move too quickly and are often hard to follow. However, the instructor is great, makes very informative slides, and is very receptive to student feedback. He is a great professor.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow has demonstrated by far the most sensitivity to students' needs that I have seen from any professor at Yale. Literally any time even a single student made a suggestion or provided him with feedback he brought the issue to the entire class and made adjustments accordingly. He REALLY cares how students are feeling about the course. I was one of the students who made a suggestion that he took and it really made a difference for my learning style. He is the first to admit that he isn't the most animated\/exciting lecturer --partially his personality, partially the material --but he speaks clearly and his notes are excellent so I can't really ask for anything more.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I'll start with the bad parts and end on a good note. I want to bring to your attention the rampant cheating that is blatantly occurring within the Asian community of students. This occurs not only in your class but in many others. During the exams, especially the final, it was obvious when a few of them went to the bathroom at the same time. We are in graduate school and should be able to police ourselves but I don't know the solution to the problem but thought I would bring it to your attention. Also, there are a few of us that are upset by the fact that one of the TFs has been meeting with a student one on one and helping that student with certain work. We think it is great that if a student is struggling, that student can have access to private tutoring but from what we understand that TF went over the final exam article with the student (the source of this being the student). If we ask questions about exam articles in office hours, TFs are not allowed to answer the question. This student received preferential treatment and had certain aspects of the article explained to him\/her. We are a community of learners and all want to help each other succeed. Finding out that one student has an upper hand on an exam, even if it doesn't affect our grades, creates a little distrust within this community. YSPH has a great atmosphere of cooperation and collaboration. In the future, please try to ensure that we are all on the same playing field so this can continue. Okay, now onto the good parts! I have never had a professor that cares as much about the students as you do. You really took our midterm course evaluations seriously and the second half of the course was even better than the first. I enjoy your humor and the small quips you make in class. It is clear that you know the material well and you are good at explaining things in different ways when we don't understand the concepts. You are open and encourage questions in class (but I hate that the students don't ask many!). You are a great professor and we are lucky to have been taught by you. Thank you for such a good semester!",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Excellent professor",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I appreciated the effort Dr. Dubrow put into giving students opportunities to learn and review content. One suggestion I have would be to simplify\/clarify questions on exams and problem sets. I thought it was often confusing to try to discern what was being asked or which concepts were being tested by certain questions. But again, I really appreciated clicker questions and being able to discuss answers to those questions during class.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Absolutely great. He did a wonderful job teaching the material and also listened to student feedback and tried to adjust accordingly",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0While Dubrow was a wonderful man, his teaching style could have been much more enhanced in that primarily during lecture, he would just be reading off the slides. There were also too many slides to be rushed through, so that it would be hard to absorb the material during class. I think if he spent more time answering students' questions and providing less examples in his slides, teaching would be much more effective.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0The best teacher I've had yet at YSPH. You can tell he really cares and his self-deprecating humor is a bonus. His motivational speech at the end of the semester about the future of Public Health shows just how much he believes in his role as a teacher, and by that extension, in his students. This was the best course :)",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0It is very obvious Dr. Dubrow cares about his students and cares about their learning. He is a very knowledgeable individual and is very well versed in the core principles of epidemiology. The teaching style is not a style that works for all students. However, it is helpful in the sense that a student is able to revisit the slides to attain any information that was said but not captured. More clicker questions to check for understanding would be the best way to maintain all the information in the slides and to encourage engagement. Some lectures only had 2 clicker questions, while some were more populated with questions.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Professor Dubrow obviously cares a lot about his students and I really enjoyed him as a professor",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Professor Dubrow was very receptive to suggestions and worked quite hard to understand student issues. His humor was also entertaining. I think that my brain might just work a bit differently because I had trouble following things the way he presented them sometimes. He has the tendency to rush through slides or things he thinks he has already covered or explained, which I found occasionally frustrating, particularly with clicker questions, because I would look down to type notes, and he would have moved through one-several more slides slides. Otherwise, he was very good!",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow cared greatly about whether or not students in his class understood the material and could learn easily in the class environment. In fact, I don't think I've ever had a professor who has been so visibly concerned with what students in the course think is best for their learning. This is a strength of YSPH, I have noticed, but particularly of Dr. Dubrow. Thank you!! During our mid-semester evaluations I might have called him dull (I can't remember, if I didn't say it I was thinking it and I'm sorry!), but I realize that wasn't what I actually meant. Dr. Dubrow's teaching style is not dynamic, and I maintain that being a little more dynamic could go a long way in keeping students attentive and engaged (clicker questions probably helped with this). When the class was laughing (either from funny examples like the Chi-Chi's example), or just getting to see a little bit of Dr. Dubrow's sense of humor, I could see everyone become more enthusiastic about the course. I hope Dr. Dubrow continues and builds on this so that everyone can see what a fantastic and caring professor he is!",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow truly cares about his students! He wants everyone to learn the material, and he is very open to feedback from students. I really appreciated how much effort he put into teaching us the material.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Nice guy. Means well",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0instructor really cares, and highly responsive to feedback! really great 1:1 and extensive detail to slides. However, in front of large class, tends to get a little long-winded with answers... could perhaps improve by having smaller overall class sizes so that we are able to interact more directly with him.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0The instructor is very serious and responsible for the class, but his illustration sometimes was not clear enough.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is an extremely intelligent man. His course slides and materials are wonderful, and he's a thoughtful lecturer. My only concern is that his particular teaching style, in which he uses response questions, can be inconsistent. There was a consistent use of gathering a student's initial thoughts on a subject, then revealing the answer later, however, when the correct answer was revealed, it was often glossed over. This is very problematic for the students that got these questions incorrect, as they still answered the question wrong and did not receive feedback as to why the correct answer was correct. This didn't occur with every concept and improved over time, but it was to be expected to happen about once a lecture regardless. This is a very particular assessment, as overall Dr. Dubrow did a fantastic job.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Excellent!",

    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is an excellent professor and very clearly explained the course material.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow made his expectations very clear at the beginning of the semester, as well as throughout the course. His exams are fair, and the couple of times there were ambiguous questions he was open to reviewing them. He also cares a lot about his teaching performance and how he can improve, which was quite evident when we did a course evaluation after the first exam and he took the time to review the evaluation results\/comments during lecture. I think this is a great quality in an instructor.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Very smart and thoughtful",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I felt Professor Dubrow did a really great job. His lectures were really easy to follow and it was nice that he gave us several versions to best suit individual learning styles. I also really liked the clicker questions. They helped keep me engaged in the lessons and allowed me to see what I was understanding and what I needed to spend more time going over.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Strength: very supportive, encouraging, fair in terms of tests, explains things very thoroughly Weakness: a little bit dull, sometimes not very cohesive during lectures Could improve by having less words on slides",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Strengths: - Has a great grasp of the concepts - Works hard to make sure students understand the material",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Sometimes hard to follow in the class, goes to fast.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0The professor was incredibly in touch with student needs and great at responding to adjustments that needed to be made to meet student needs. He taught the course at an appropriate level and pace for a diverse group of students. His preparation in making the course successful really showed. Really great and caring professor!",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I really appreciate Professor Dubrow's dedication to teaching. He is one of those amazing professors that leave a lasting impression because of their passion for teaching. I really enjoyed taking his class, primarily because he was the one teaching it. Initially, his classes come across a little dry - white slides, plain text, minimal images and color. But he is really clear, provides good examples, and tries his best to engage the class through clicker quizzes. My one major critique for Dr. Dubrow is his question writing style. He has a tendency to write ambiguous questions and loves when multiple choice questions answers are \"need more information,\" neither of which is appreciated by students. He should be more specific on tests by completely stating all of the information he wants in our answers. For example, this is from the answer key for Exam II: 17. What does the dashed vertical line represent? The overall summary relative risk estimate from the random effects model. Many students answered simply summary relative risk estimate. But which one? Random effects model or fixed effects model? Overall summary RR estimate or summary RR estimate from one of the income strata? Be specific. The question could have been worded more clearly, perhaps adding \"keeping model in mind\" to make it understood what degree of specificity he was looking for.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I have never met a professor who was so compassionate and accommodating to his students. It meant a great deal that he cared so much about our opinions. The clicker questions were great and made the lecture much more interactive! I love the way Dr. Dubrow has office hours (where you get a private 15 minutes instead of everyone dropping into the office at their leisure), it was nice to have a space to get my questions answered directly. As an SBS student, I would love to have some more examples that weren't exclusively exposure + outcome based. For example, my favorite study in class was the one that looked at mortality rates in formerly incarcerated individuals. Adding examples like these, or one that look at health care delivery, health communication, intervention effectiveness, etc. would help promote interest in the non-CDE students.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is a great instructor. He was incredibly responsive to our needs\/difficulties as students. I think he went to a lot of effort to make the course manageable without watering it down. He definitely expects a lot and is a stickler for details, but it is obvious he cares a lot about his students and the material, which definitely isn't the case with some of the professors I've had.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Professor Dubrow is detailed, helpful, kind, and approachable. He is very quick to respond to student feedback and is an exceptional professor.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow delivered very informative lectures, and held good review classes before exams. However, some of the multiple choice questions on exams seemed unnecessarily difficult.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I love Dubrow! He is so receptive to student feedback and understanding of issues that might arise. While Epi II is a hard class, he tries to make it understandable. I actually really enjoyed his teaching style although I could do with less homework. Every week, there is an assignment due and there are at least 15+ questions, sometimes with multiple parts to them. I realize they are helpful to studying but are too long and take longer than expected to complete. I would suggest shorter homework assignments.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow appeared to care about the material and about the student comprehension of the material quite a bit. However, I think a number of his teaching habits could be improved to make the information in the class more comprehensible. There were quite a few subjects for which Dr. Dubrow presented the information in a far, far more complex way than seemed necessary. The plethora of caveats made the information difficult to digest, since it seemed like every concept and piece of information carried along with it a train of 'maybe's and 'possibly's. Further, his way of asking questions did little to clarify his points. The answer of 'need more information' may be very pertinent when in the field and trying to determine what you can figure out with your limited data, but, in the classroom, using 'need more information' as a frequent answer just results in confused students who aren't sure what was missing. Dr. Dubrow had a habit of saying 'go back and look through the slides' if a clicker question was answered substantially wrong. He would offer a clear explanation that clarified his thinking, but frequently mentioned that going back and looking through the slides would make everything clearer. While this may be true, he seemed to be missing the point that often, the reason the questions were answered incorrectly in the first place were due to the confusing nature of the slides, so trying to use the confusing slides as explanation for the question proved to be frustrating and ineffective.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is passionate about epidemiology. He is sensitive to student needs and does his best to incorporate recommendations.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is one of the most caring professors I've had during my time at YSPH. It is evident that he really cares about us as students and wants us to succeed academically. He is very patient and understanding, and often solicits student input to improve the course. He is very thoughtful in his responses to student questions and checks in to see how well we are grasping the material, which can be complicated at times. His care and obvious investment in our success often motivated me to work harder. It is also really clear that Dr. Dubrow is extremely intelligent and understands Epi very very well. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to learn from Dr. Dubrow, especially material that was challenging as his generous and kind spirit helped me get through the course.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Great ! Taught at a good pace, and wanted us to understand.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was quite a good professor and since coming to Yale was so keen in ensuring that all our needs were always met."

   "comments": [
    "know the slides, understand the concepts. tests are very manageable if you study.",
    "A great overview of many important topics in epidemiology and that will help any researcher or public health professional in every facet of their work. I would recommend students to take this course regardless of whether or not it is a requirement for their concentration.",
    "I would recommend the class. I think the content is helpful and necessary for understanding epidemiology studies. It is also helpful to review papers in-depth for the discussions.",
    "I feel as if much of my class is split on this class. I believe it is an imperative course to the MPH program and that all students should be required to take it. Dr. Dubrow has a very different approach to introduction epidemiology than Dr. Niccolai or Desai and I think it is an important view on how epidemiology should be done.",
    "I would recommend this course. I feel like I am prepared to continue on with Epi III.",
    "The course is worth to choose if you want get a advanced understanding in epidemiology. It will provide you with a great basic knowledge for the future career as public health professionals.",
    "You will work very hard, and will learn epidemiology at an intermediate level, but this information will be tough to retain, as it is all via PowerPoint and is only possible to memorize in unmemorable ways.",
    "A ton of work! But I learned a lot.",
    "Important course for a public health student.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It might be more work-heavy than other courses, but I think it's beneficial to learning to have to apply the concepts every week, so come exam time you're not teaching yourself the night before like in some other courses. I don't know why it currently isn't requited for some students, but I think anyone who wants a solid knowledge base in Epi should take this course. Dr. Dubrow is a uniquely impressive professor --very humble, very smart, very sensitive to students' needs, and very passionate about public health. Students should all have the chance to take a course from him. I want to be mad about the difficult work and exams, but I can't be because you really get what you paid for with this course. It is true to the idea that grad school should be applying\/synthesizing material rather than regurgitating it --he definitely writes his questions that make you think through the concepts in different settings.",
    "This course seamlessly picks up where Epi 1 left off.",
    "Very useful",
    "Not necessarily a fun course, but one that gives you a lot of the fundamental tools for public health work and theory.",
    "I would recommend the class, however, I would provide warning about Dubrow's teaching style and that the material is more difficult and comprehensive than that covered in Epi I.",
    "definitely recommend. Most of us HAVE to take this course, but if you aren't required and are interested in Epi, you should take it.",
    "Lots of work but worth it.",
    "Required course but no terrible. Challenging",
    "good! you learn alot, just be prepared for a lot of busy work.",
    "I would recommend it to students loves epidemiological studies.",
    "This course is hard. Many of you will have to take it, so buckle up and get ready. For those that don't require this course, it is still very worth your time. The content is extremely helpful in evaluating and assessing epidemiological research.",
    "You learn a lot but it's a lot of work",
    "It's an essential course for any serious epidemiologist and accordingly, you're going to use all the concepts learned in this course. So, pay attention, review, and take the homeworks seriously and you'll be fine.",
    "I would recommend it. It provides many valuable skills and provides a lot of knowledge about how to conduct epidemiology research.",
    "This course advances your knowledge in epidemiology, and gets into a lot more detail on bias and confounding than epi I. It also builds skills in critical reading of research articles. I would recommend it to other students in the same or similar fields of study.",
    "Satisfied",
    "Very straightforward class with homeworks and tests that are fairly reasonable. The concepts are pretty interesting and can learn a lot about public health in this class. Should tak ethe course if pursuing health or medicine for career",
    "Yes, overall it is a good course",
    "Yes- really interesting material. I really feel like I can read an epidemiological paper and engage in high level conversations after this course.",
    "This course expands upon various issues in epidemiological studies that are not elaborated upon in Epi I. However, it has a lot of overlapping material with AAMIE and Biostats II. I would avoid taking all 3 courses if possible.",
    "Great practice in applying epi concepts. Get a study group together to help practice concepts. When studying, practice problems are more helpful than memorizing notes. Yes, I would recommend for individuals interested in research design and developing stringent studies.",
    "Absolutely. It's a hard class, but you learn A LOT. Fuck the haters who said Dr. Dubrow needs to be more dynamic or whatever b.s. they complained about on the mid-semester evaluations. That's so superficial. He's actually an incredibly inspiring guy, and it was a total pleasure to be in his class. Even if I really struggled with it at times and didn't necessarily do as well on the exams as I would've liked, I learned so much and am really grateful that I decided to take the course.",
    "This course goes into all of the concepts of the first semester of Epi, but with more detail and more practical applications. It focuses on real studies, which at times can be tedious, but overall are helpful. The course is very fair.",
    "This course covered more in-depth principles of epidemiology than first semester, and was helpful in improving my understanding of epidemiological studies.",
    "This class is a tough one but a necessary one. Dubrow is sweet and the material is relevant no matter what department you're in.",
    "This course is a broad survey that addresses a varied set of topics within epidemiologic methods and practice. It provides ample opportunity to read and comprehend scientific articles, and provides a slightly different take on some topics addressed in other courses. However, I would probably not recommend this course to another student. It was more redundant than complementary to other courses, and more time was spent in the course learning the material as was spent attempting to interpret and understand Dr. Dubrow's way of presenting and testing on the information. I would say it is necessary and informative if an individual is planning on pursuing epidemiology research throughout their career, and a bit less necessary for interpreting and understanding different research articles. However, for someone who has no plans to pursue these topics throughout their career, this class would not come very highly recommended from me.",
    "It's a great course in combination with Epi I. Provides a solid foundation in epidemiology. I would recommend for students in SBS, EMD, and CDE.",
    "Epi II is arguably one of the most challenging courses you will take as a first year student, but also one of the most rewarding. Dr. Dubrow is an excellent professor and is more than willing to help you. Epi II provides an in-depth look at various research methods within epidemiology and teaches you how to critically examine the literature and evaluate its quality. You will be exposed to a lot of different material and gain a lot of different skills over the semester. While it will require a lot of investment, it will be worth it in the end.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I think it is essential for future epidemiologists."
