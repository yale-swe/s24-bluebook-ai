    "I would not. Fascinating subject, poor seminar.",
    "A slightly strange course. This seminar is a crash-course in essay-writing, which I wasn't expecting. It is pretty challenging to understand exactly what the professor is looking for in your writing. Also, as someone with absolutely no history background, I felt like I was playing catch-up a lot with the material. That said, Professor Winroth is so, so nice and it might be worth it to take the course just for that. And to watch everyone's face every time you pull a textbook with \"TORTURE\" written across the top.",
    "Great, laid-back class! Professor Winroth is a witty, engaging, and sometimes goofy seminar leader. He'll freak you out by giving C's on the first paper, but don't fear--he's really big on writing skills and as he puts it, \"the grade on the first paper does not necessarily have any bearing on the final grade.\" Four short papers and an 8-10 page term paper.",
    "I would recommend to anyone looking for an interesting history course, who is passionate about making arguments and writing good prose.",
    "Just don't do it. We never talked about torture or even history. It's a grammar and writing class, that's all.",
    "A great course if you are interested in legal history and something \"off the beaten track\" for a history course. You will not learn much about torture implements. FYI."
