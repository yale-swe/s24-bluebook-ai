   "comments": [
    "Very good learning experience for novices on how to write research protocols. However for people who were writing 'fake' protocols (that were not going to be submitted in reality), maybe it would help to pair them up with faculty who are actually working on protocols at the beginning of the semester. THat way everyone gets a real life experience about how to submit a protocol.",
    "Very important class for everyone who would go for an academic career.",
    "Strengths- teaches valuable skills about grant writing and offers good feedback along the way.Weaknesses- some aspects of the grant were a little beyond my capacity- felt over my head with some of the issues and did not know how to resolve them. Meeting with the professor helped, but it was hard to write those sections.",
    "This course does exactly what it says, teaching us how to write an actual NIH R01 grant proposal. I greatly appreciated the many sub-assignments which helped break up the huge grant proposal into many manageable sub-steps.",
    "Wonderful course, but workload is heavy. Useful knowledge",
    "This course is definitely useful. I am happy I took this course with Dr. Dubrow. Developing a research protocol is a necessary skill in research and the focus on the class was to develop your own research question and turn this into a protocol. It was very challenging but this skills I gained were well worth it.",
    "This is a very practical and useful course. Felt like it dragged on by the end of the semester since we had each been working on the same assignment all along. Felt like some classes could have covered the same material a little quicker. Don't have any recommendations, but more interactive components would help to keep the class engaged.",
    "Great for acquiring grant writing skills.",
    "Strengths: Wow. THis was a great course. So incredibly practical and skill-building. By far one of the better classes that I took at EPH.Weaknesses: None- I thought Dr. Dubrow made changes during the semester to fit the needs of our class and everything was scheduled well and graded fairly.",
    "Excellent course with real world applicability. Excellent teaching and methodology. Co instruction with a biostats prof might have been an interesting concept.",
    "Great grant writing class. All skills required to write a successful grant proposal are taught in the class. It may be improved if students that are interested in taking the class start thinking about their topics if they are not presently working on anything a few months before the start of the class as it takes a while to decide on a topic and then build up from there."

    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0strengths - great instructor, very good feedback.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0excellent instructor.Dr Dubrow put a lot of energy in this class and provides excellent feedback on all assignments.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0He gave lots of feedback and made himself very available for questions.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was very helpful and kept an open door for students during office hours. These office hours were great to get individual feedback. The class sessions were good, but sometimes especially toward the middle did not help as much toward the grant. The presentations in class were very interesting, but it could have been helpful to get a one-page print out with the basics of each study so that we did not have to refer back and ask the basic questions.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was very helpful and guided us through the entire process of writing a grant, providing feedback at each step along the way.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dubrow is a great instructor and knows the material, great feedback",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is an excellent professor. He was very approachable and always had his door open for questions and office hours. He is very knowledgeable about this topic as he himself has submitted many grants! His comments and feedback were invaluable to this process.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Durbow was very thoughtful in his delivery of the material and VERY accessible outside of class. With long term self guided projects his availability was very helpful as he was willing to serve as a sounding board, or to brainstorm as needed (on the big and little details).",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Very helpful. Very knowledgeable. Makes time for students.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is an incredible instructor. I regret not having turned in a professor of the year recommendation for him (Deadlines- I'm no good at them!) He was the most attentive and responsive professor I have had at EPH. He listed extensive availability for office hours and was always able to meet when asked, he responds quickly by email, he emailed helpful information specific to the students research topic throughout the semester, he gave critical, detailed feedback at every step of the way, and he provided very clear instructions about his expectations and what was to be done for the R01. He also brought in numerous guest speakers for EPH and other departments to inform us not only about this R01 writing process, but about career directions and life as a grant-writer.Dr. Dubrow should be teacher of the year. He is an incredible professor, thank you for everything Dr. Dubrow.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was unbelievable. Considering the size of the class, it is remarkable that he was able to give individual attention to each student. He clearly knew each student's project and provided great feedback to each of us.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0He is always ready to help. his feedback on the assignments is great and he is a great teacher.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Prof Dubrow was a great help and had ample office hours for the students. He responded quickly to e-mails and was willing to spend time with each student individually and go over their proposals and help when the students encounter difficulties. Fantastic instructor!"

   "comments": [
    "Very good learning experience for all those who have never had to write a grant before and plan to work in this area in their careers.",
    "It's an excellent grant writing class.The workload is important and it van be frustrating to write a fictional grant proposal (if you don't have to write a real one at the time of the class).You'll learn tons of things about grant writing, budget planning and the reviewing process.",
    "A huge amount of work but worthwhile if you are going to be writing grants. I would definitely recommend looking for a grant that you can actually write in tandem with a professor here since you will get more support and be able to better answer the questions that come up during the grant writing process.",
    "For those taking this as a capstone class, this is an excellent course, teaching you how to write a grant proposal. It's still a great course otherwise - if you plan to work in academia in the future, you'll definitely want to learn how to write grants.",
    "Great, but heavy work load. Learn a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. It helps you develop much needed skillsto write a protocol. Also, the information about federal grants and writing a protocol in that format is something that will be used, especially if you are going into a research career.",
    "Take it if you think that you will be writing grants and do not have much experience. This is a very practical class if you are looking to leave this program with some skills.",
    "Yes. Good for learning how to write grants.",
    "ESSENTIAL if you are going to remain in academia or write grants. It is THE most practical course I took at EPH. It does have a higher workload than average, but it is worth it. If you want to learn how to write an R01 grant, this course is a must.Additionally, Dr. Dubrow is great.",
    "Great course with excellent utility. Maximize by finding a project\/mentor before the course begins if you can.",
    "Yes",
    "Great grant writing class. Highly recommended."
