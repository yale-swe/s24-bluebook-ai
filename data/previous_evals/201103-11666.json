   "comments": [
    "Yes- but make sure you enjoy Econ or are prepared to do the work if you haven't had exposure to Econ before.",
    "I would recommend Econ 115 over econ 110 because it is the same material but it is easier math.",
    "Economics 110 is a good course and I found it both more interesting and useful to be in a seminar as opposed to the big lecture.",
    "After ECON 110, I would recommend this seminar over the lecture, but I feel as though both forms of Intro Microecon are just not interesting, engaging, or fun. I shopped both, I chose the seminar because of the closer interaction with the professor (Katerina Simons, who was far from spectacular). I definitely learned the information, but I never enjoyed a moment of it.",
    "It's a good class if you can stay awake and read ahead. Otherwise you will most likely be lost during class and on the exams. The problem sets should be easy with the reading and notes during class but if you are lost in class you will be lost on the problem sets. Not too much work but also not the easiest QR.",
    "ECON 110 is a great intro micro course. Compared with the things I've heard from the micro lecture, the ECON 110 seminar was harder and had more intensive materials. With that said, I think it was worth doing the extra work; you really do get a nice foundation in microeconomics at the end of the course.",
    "I would recommend taking economics because it changes the way you view the world. However, if you aren't comfortable with calculus, I might recommend taking a different course or a different professor.",
    "Economics 110 is an introductory microeconomics course taught in a seminar setting, allowing for a more intimate, learning environment. Many people have said that they \"get more\" out of the small class setting than the lecture course. This is true--I would probably not have understood economics as well had I taken the lecture course.",
    "It's a good intro course, but it can get slow at times.",
    "The class is a great introductory class to be exposed to a new discipline. I definitely took away a new perspective on thinking about decision making and understand concepts such as monopolies better. I would recommend the seminar to other students because it is an opportunity to be in a smaller class and interact with students and the teacher more.",
    "Make sure you have a good basis of knowledge before taking this class. Those with no prior knowledge should be wary unless they have a lot of time on their hands.",
    "Yeah I would recommend it to everyone. I personally think it's better than the lecture even though the curve makes it hard to get a good grade, but it's definitely a good class.",
    "Definitely take it it's so useful and pretty fun.",
    "This would be a great course to take even if you are not planning on majoring in anything to do with economics. I learned a lot of very interesting and useful information that pertains to every day life.",
    "HIGHLY recommended. This course is a wonderful introduction to the basic principles of economics. Professor Simons keeps class lively and interesting. The work is not too hard, and Professor Simons makes sure you know it very well."
