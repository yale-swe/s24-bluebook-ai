    "Teaches you present and past tenses of spanish, weak in vocab. I would recommend spanish for people that think it would be useful in their work force, if they are learning a language to get credits then they should pick something much easier",
    "Take the course because the class is necessary and the topics are interesting, but take it under a different teacher.",
    "It is a god class for a student familiar with spanish already but not for a true beginner.",
    "Yes, if you have experience with the language or patient enough to give it the time it needs.",
    "This class is decent, but could be better if the instructor follows the syllabus and better prepares students for tests. I would only recommend this specific section for students who would individually keep up with reading and follow the material on the syllabus.",
    "I would recommend this course because Spanish is a really important language and Yale's curriculum is intense enough to build a solid language proficiency for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course! Being able to speak Spanish is a very useful skill to have, and the course work was generally fun and interesting. However, some professors's teaching styles may not work for you, so be careful.",
    "Its just a very basic intro to the language. I mean if you want to learn Spanish you have to take it. The teacher makes a HUGE difference though. Try to get one that is actually helpful.",
    "It would have been fine if I had another teacher, now I'm worried about my grade and feel like it is largely out of my control",
    "A good beginning Spanish course. I would recommend it.",
    "I would not."
