   "comments": [
    "A course with great (but light) reading and in-depth class discussion. Suffered from ambiguity and lack of purpose at times, but made up for what it lacked in general camaraderie and a passionate professor. Professor North was very passionate about the subject matter and extremely knowledgable about the poets we read. The main critique I have of the class is that we would go more than a month between turning in our papers and receiving them back, which made it difficult to know how we were doing in the course, or how we could improve before tackling the next one. Discussion was interesting, but at times we spent too long on a single line or stanza in a way that was unproductive.",
    "It's a course for people who love poetry but are interested in going a step beyond close reading. It's very refreshing to think about poetry not only as an aesthetic achievement, but also as a vehicle of feeling, and to evaluate how successful it is at conveying its feeling. It's great if you love modern poetry and want to find out things about your core sensibility that would never come up in our current political climate! TAKE IT!",
    "A great class on contemporary poets (something the English department doesn't have nearly enough of). The workload is quite light, the readings are a pleasure, and Professor North rocks. Paper prompts are pretty vague, which can be frustrating, but that's hardly a major complaint; I highly recommend this class if you're interested in contemporary poets (\"Politics\" as you might find in history or PoliSci classes were a decidedly secondary concern).",
    "This was my first poetry class outside of the 125\/126 sequence, and I really enjoyed the syllabus -- I don't usually consider myself a poetry person, but the poets were so diverse and expressed such an array of feeling that I think there was something for everyone. Joe is really passionate about all the poets and is very kind. He pushed us to find the \"political sensibility\" behind each poem -- which not only meant close reading, but also meant scrutinizing our own emotional reactions to poems. This is something I think most English majors (or students at Yale in general) haven't been asked to do before, so it can be a little unnerving\/unfamiliar\/uncomfortable, but I think it's a worthwhile task, even if just for the duration of one class.",
    "I would highly recommend it (and I have). It is an interesting course that pushes the student beyond what is commonly asked of him or her.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! Most of the time the discussions were engaging. You get to read a lot of cool poets, some or most of whom you probably haven't read much or any of before! I didn't realized how much I had missed reading and analyzing poetry until I took this class. While it sometimes erred on the side of talking about too much death and suffering, I thoroughly enjoyed the course. Joe is a fun, deep, and fair teacher. The writing assignments (3, each 5 pages long) were completely manageable, and Joe was a fair grader. If you like reading poetry that is cool, moving, beautiful, and disturbing, and you wanna talk about all that with a group of pretty cool kids, take the course!",
    "The reading list is great and class discussions with Joe were always interesting. However, the class felt a little disorganized at times, and I wasn't ever quite sure what \"political sensibility\" means. Overall an interesting course though (even though it met at 9am)."
