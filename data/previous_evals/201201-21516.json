    "Amazing immersion in French language! Highly recommended to students that want to learn French and are ready to devote time to it.",
    "I recommend it strongly - so much real progress in such little time! It's a very rewarding experience.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student. It is a lot of work, but your progress at the end will speak for itself. I also think the French in Action material is quite enjoyable and pretty hilarious, so studying is not that boring. If you take the course with the right professor (*hint hint* Prof. de Saussure), going to class five days a week won't feel like such a drag.",
    "French 120 was a great class that really helps each student to achieve a good base of speaking and understanding spoken French."
