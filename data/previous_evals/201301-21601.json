    "3 tests, no final. Take the risk as you see fit.",
    "Its a pleasant mid to upper level bio class with a wide range of topics covered.",
    "Definitely take this class! It requires a minimal workload for a science course. The material is fascinating, and there are no homeworks or mandatory readings. If you attend lecture and pay attention, you should do fine!",
    "MCDB 240 is a good class to take if you really want to know about gynecology!",
    "Repro bio is by far my favorite biology class at Yale. It's a really interesting topic, and the guest lecturers are fantastic. Normally I'm not a fan of a class taught by several different instructors, but the exams were fair considering we didn't have total continuity between teachers. Definitely worth taking!",
    "Repro bio is overall a pretty great class. The biggest problem is that the lecturers are hit-or-miss. Some of them are amazing, and others are pretty bad (very smart people, obviously, but have trouble effectively communicating their message.) The class has 3 midterms, each worth 1\/3 of the grade. Even though the topic seems very specific (reproductive biology,) I felt as though it actually gave a good overview of the way that biological systems work. It felt like an incredibly worthwhile course. My other complaint is that some of the lectures are filled with sexist undertones. It seemed very 1940s. It was bothersome. It needs to be changed!",
    "not too difficult MCDB course, class is taught by a lot of different guest lecturers- which is cool, but also means there isn't a set rhythm to the class. the grade is based on 3 exams- which are not too difficult, but some questions are worded super confusingly and are annoyingly random\/specific.",
    "You really learn a lot about the reproductive system.A lot of information is given.The tests are too specific sometimes.",
    "I recommend this class overall. Not too much work, interesting material, though the exams are pretty annoying.",
    "I'd recommend MCDB240 for a relatively stress-free bio course. It was a lot of information to study for each test since each test is very specific to details, but not having a cumulative final was really helpful during the finals period. I enjoyed learning about many different aspects of repro bio.",
    "yes, if you like the subject",
    "Wonderful bio class: interesting material, wide array of speakers (most of whom are great), only 3 exams, and by finals period you will be so thankful not to be taking another final",
    "I would absolutely recommend Repro to another student. This class is so interesting, the exams are pretty laid back, and there's no final. Just be warned that sometimes it's hard to adjust to the number of lecturers that the class has, but there's really only one or two bad ones.",
    "A great overview of repro bio. I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "This is by far the best science class I took at Yale - it is so interesting, especially if you're premed because it's the only class I've taken so far that is actually medically-relevant.Lectures are all interesting, and there are only 3 non-cumulative exams (very straightforward and fair, as long as you study). Even if you're non-science but looking for a science credit, this is a very doable class and just really interesting stuff!",
    "I took it Credit\/D\/Fail as a non-science major with an interest in science looking for a 5th class to round out my schedule. The subject matter is actually fascinating, and especially towards the second half, you learn a lot of relevant and practical information that is important as you move on with your life, especially if you want to have babies later on. It was a nice break from my usual courseload to just learn about how the male and female reproductive systems work rather than interpreting literature. The course is also a constant stream of guest lecturers most of whom are from the med school, which definitely keeps it interesting. You can definitely get by without a textbook, especially if you take it Cr\/D\/Fail. Just take good notes since the exams will test on every little detail that is covered (especially if you take it for a grade). Being Cr\/D\/Fail, I spent about 2 hours the night before looking over the lecture notes for the exams, and did decently (lower than the average thanks to the premeds but way more than enough to get a credit). There are 3 non-cumulative exams and no final. Super low workload (just take notes at lecture and study for exams, no psets!). Overall, a fun and enjoyable class.",
    "Definitely",
    "Very interesting! Tests are tricky though.",
    "MCDB 240 is a great fifth credit bio course. Definitely recommended!",
    "Definitely take it. The material is simple and interesting and you don't need to go to lecture. Just be careful! It's easy to get caught up in how easy it is and not study enough for a test that could otherwise be the easiest thing ever. Also, don't buy the textbook! Everything you need to know is posted in the slides online. Study that and you'll be fine!",
    "This course is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone that has any sort of interest in biology. While there are a few lectures that are mind-numbingly boring, most are enjoyable and you learn a lot about a subject that you probably wouldn't otherwise. While some may dislike that there were so many lecturers, I liked that we had lecturers that presented the information that they were experts in. The tests are fairly straight forward: Multiple-choice, true\/false, fill in the blank, and maybe one short answer. The test draws only from the lectures, so the textbooks aren't necessary, however I did use one of the textbooks (not the Jones' one) to supplement some of the beefy topics (like the ovary). There are three non-cumulative tests and no final. If you do the work, you will most likely get the grade you want. That being said, I am pretty sure there is no curve in this class, however the tests are easy enough that it wasn't necessary.",
    "Since there are so many guest lectures, there is a lot of repetition but this is usually regarding the fundamentals (e.g. the hormones regulating the menstrual cycle) so the information becomes engrained. Personally, I found the material very interesting although it does tend to be very female-centric. The class is open to majors and non-majors alike so the science is explained on an understandable level; that being said, memorization is the key to the tests. The exams are generally fair but they sometimes test seemingly minor details. The best way to study is to go over the slides and ask the TA if something is important. The averages on the first two tests were both a B.",
    "It's an interesting class but it's not as easy as older reviews may seem to suggest - there is a tough curve and you have to really be sure to go to all the review sessions and study each lecture very thoroughly. That being said, it's definitely interesting material and I'd recommend the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to someone who has done quite a bit of biology in high school and needs a fourth or fifth class. There are only 3 exams so that's a bit stressful but most of the exams were fair. They did however progressively get more difficult. Some of the questions did seem to address merely memorization of trivial facts rather than testing understanding of concepts. If memorization is your thing, this class is for you. There are a lot of lecturers but I liked that since there were only a few that were truly inept and they left quickly. The lectures themselves were really interesting and the TAs (Eddie and Allison) were extremely helpful. Definitely go to section even though it's not required. They will help you know specifically what you need to know for the test.",
    "Don't take it. It's full of pre-med students who you will have to compete against in memorizing facts (many of which are the smallest of details).",
    "Take it! Really interesting and not stressful at all.",
    "A great bio class -- and a great science class for those who aren't science majors. This is a class that everyone should take because it covers a subject that is so important to human health.",
    "Yes- definitely take it! Very well organized and straight-forward, and an overall very pleasant experience while learning a ton of extremely relevant information!",
    "This was honestly my favorite class I have ever experienced at Yale (and I'm a second semester senior MCDB major). The lectures are extremely interesting and the fact that clinicians (MDs) present a number of them adds a degree of clinical relevancy that is often times absent in other biology classes.I would wholeheartedly recommend taking this class. It was a class that I actually enjoyed waking up for, and I am typically apathetic about many of my classes.The one caveat is that I was under the mistaken impression that the class was going to be a relatively easy bio class, and in many ways it was. But it does require a deal of studying before the tests.",
    "Good course - has interesting material. Quite a bit of studying required for the three midterms.",
    "You learn a lot about reproduction in an interesting and applicable way. Take it!",
    "This is a course for many MCDB majors and pre-meds. It's really, really interesting and a very manageable course load. For people who are interested in understanding Reproductive Biology, even if they're not science-oriented, this course would be a great fit.I took the course because another student recommended it as a great Biology course for a non-science major who is pre-med. I'm very glad I took it. I highly recommend it to other students who are interested in the material and able to learn without a textbook (only lecture material)",
    "A strong course. I found it interesting day and day out. I appreciated the fact that it focused on the human as the primary subject of study, rather than other organisms. It was very much a physiology course, which was cool. I recommend.",
    "Workload is light. 3 major non-cumalitive tests. There are readings but not really worth doing except if you need clarification on a topic since tests are based on lectures. Kankel's lectures were the hardest to follow\/study for since he uses a website instead of powerpoint slides. Test 2 was noticeably harder than test 1. Test 3 was probably close to test 1.",
    "take it! one of the best bio courses I've taken at Yale. with different lecturers, you don't get to know the professors well, but you do get to hear from researchers and doctors in the field. go to section - the TA's make the tests and are helpful in consolidating sometimes scattered information.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's not too hard, I learned a lot, and it's usually nice to have lectures from different professors.",
    "As an ex-premed student, I would say it's the best bio class I've taken at Yale. Very relevant regardless of your major. Covers topics from cellular\/endocrinological aspects of reproduction, to everyday issues like contraception methods. Great elective for bio majors, great science credit for non-science majors, great course for anyone just interested in reproduction and all its related topics! Also, there are only 3 non-cumulative exams...no final exam, no other assignments. However, don't be fooled...you still do need to study to do well!",
    "I love, love, love this class. Take it if you're a woman. Take it if you're a man. Take it if you're premed. Take it if you're looking for a Sc credit and want to do something legitimate. You learn about the whole journey of reproduction, from meiosis to menopause, from some of the most groundbreaking researchers in the med school. The lecturers are fantastic (for the most part), and 3 exams is a reasonable thing. LOVE IT!",
    "I recommend it if you're looking or a bio class with no work. 3 midterms (non-cumulative) that you have to study for, but other than that it's a breeze. Going to class is important as tests are lecture-based. Don't buy the book!",
    "There are three tests some that are fairly straightforward, others that are not.",
    "Yes! Definitely! Everyone should take this course, because not only is it fun, but it is also important, necessary information that everyone should know about the basics of human reproduction.",
    "Yes, take it even if you are not science major!",
    "Easy course material but very high average. I took it as an easy class but ended up not doing so well.",
    "A great course for pre-meds and bio majors, especially since you can take the lab course with this. It's pretty much pure memorization, but it's understandable and interesting, and slides are all posted online.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course it was extremely interesting.",
    "a hodgepodge of interesting lectures on reproductive biology - you will learn things, but there is no clear progression.",
    "If you have even the slightest interest in reproductive biology, you should definitely take this class! It's fun and interesting and the lecturers are changed every 2 lectures or so. And surprisingly, almost all of them are fantastic lecturers! This class is also low stress: no homework, 3 exams that are fairly general and comprehensive. Your grade is directly correlated to the amount of work you put into the class and the amount of time spent reading the powerpoints and memorizing every single thing on them. The textbooks are unnecessary but very useful for gaining a deeper understanding of the material, but the material is fairly straightforward. So, overall, a great class!",
    "Yes, it's a nice biology course. Don't expect individual attention, but among bio courses, it was pretty decent",
    "I took Repro Bio because I heard it was a class that even non-bio majors enjoyed. And it is true that it is a class with enthusiastic lecturers you probably would never find in another MCDB course. However, this class asks you to strictly memorize and regurgitate. And expect to memorize and regurgitate a lot of information for each exam. This is one of a few classes which do not focus on actually solidifying your deep understanding of the topics, but sees how well it could trick you on the tiny, least relevant aspects when it comes to the multiple choice exams. Also, the TA's seem to genuinely not care to be informed about the topics (except for one knowledgeable TA only). When asked questions, many of them were of no help.Interesting material + good lectures + poor assessment of your actual knowledge = take this credit D.",
    "MCDB 240 gives you a comprehensive overview into the human reproductive systems from the formation of genital regions through conception and puberty. The material is presented in depth, accounting for the neuronal hormones that guide these processes, and there are also lectures on bioethics and biotechnology in relation to reproduction.",
    "Not the hardest class, and very interesting. Of course this means the curve can be tougher. You are learning from the best in each professor's field, but you might feel that the class is a bit disjointed for it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course",
    "Take this class! Very interesting material for sure. Tests can bite though, so be very prepared for them."
