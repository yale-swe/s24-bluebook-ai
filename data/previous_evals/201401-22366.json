    "I would say that this course examines art in America, the Carribean and the African Diaspora to think about the ways in which race, gender and sexuality are at work in the variety of works. The readings are dense and there are many of them but they are so worthwhile and do a phenomenal job with positioning these varied various cultural workers.",
    "The class is about representations of race, gender and sexuality in modern and contemporary art+practice. We study works by artists from the United States and the Caribbean.I would recommend this class to another student without hesitation.",
    "I'd say the art is more contemporary than modern, though it pushes back to some modernist concerns. I'd say it is deeply engaged with the question of black art today\u00e2\u0080\u0094does it exist, and if so as what? What defines it? Who defines it?",
    "If a student were interested in questions of race or gender in contemporary art I would unquestionably recommend this course."

    "I plan to think about the ways that visuality also requires an ability to witness and therefore \"see\" another (or their work) in a variety of ways. The possibilities of witness in narrations of ourselves is something that I hope to think about more deeply in my research.",
    "It was very helpful! It was wonderful to have so many, varied critical voices. Our class in the Beinecke was fantastic. Seeing colleagues from other fields engage the work was also very helpful (even as it could also be disorienting!) in that it really helped clarify what kinds of questions I'm interested in asking of works\u00e2\u0080\u0094and what's at stake in those questions.",
    "This course was incredibly useful in helping to guide questions surrounding contemporary art and provide both a foundation in art historical discourse and contemporary debates."
