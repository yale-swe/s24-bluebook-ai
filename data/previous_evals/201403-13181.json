   "comments": [
    "I would tentatively recommend this course to others if they want a better introduction to late 19th century\/early 20th century literature, particularly British modernism. In retrospect, I'm glad I took the course, but it was a lot of work and I'm not sure I learned as thoroughly as I would have liked.",
    "Don't take this if you want a rigorous junior seminar. Do take this if you value interesting reading over a good grade.",
    "I highly recommend Modern British Novel. Professor Richards leads great discussions and is also very generous with her time outside of class. Just make sure that the books on the syllabus will keep your interest for the whole semester!",
    "A good course on modernist works from the late 19th century to early 20th century. The highlights were works by Wilde, Joyce, and Woolf. Our class size was seven, and I think we would've benefitted from a slightly larger group to have more input during discussion because sometimes the texts were difficult to grasp. Professor Richards is brilliant at providing an understanding of how works can be situated within their historical context. She guides discussions but allows students to speak and form their own insights instead of influencing them with hers."
