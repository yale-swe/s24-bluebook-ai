   "comments": [
    "Yes. It is about analyzing theoretical texts as one would literary texts. And why not? Very unique approach to theoretical texts, would definitely recommend.",
    "You read through some of Carol Jacob's favorite texts, and watch a practicioner of deconstruction do her magic in real time. It's great.",
    "This class is a great opportunity to read canonical, challenging texts and to practice a kind of close reading not often performed on texts considered to be non-literary. A student who would want an explanation or historical\/biographical contextualization of these texts should not take this class.",
    "I felt it was an enriching course, covering some of the most important theory of the 20th century. Because the course only focused on four authors, we were really able to go into depth with each writer covered. I would definitely recommend this course to another student looking to study these theorists in greater detail.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interesting in literary theory. Even a student who has already studied the authors covered in the course would benefit from Prof. Jacobs' unique and very close reading of the texts."
