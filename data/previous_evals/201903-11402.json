    "Over the past semester, I have improved so much my tone quality and sound production.",
    "Breathing and sound production techniques for classical singing, but that can also be applied to all musical styles and genres. Studied challenging and fun-to-perform repertoire in various languages."

    "One of the strengths of this course is the constant feedback you get from your professor. I was able to improve a lot as a result. Studio classes also gave me the opportunity to practice performing. I cannot think of any weaknesses for this course.",
    "INCREDIBLE",
    "No improvement, this is why I came to Yale",
    "One-on-one vocal instruction is extremely valuable and, in my opinion, the best way to improve your overall vocal health and technique. I was challenged by the repertoire I studied, and 10 lessons was just the right amount to prepare for jury. I would have liked to explore other songs outside of the three I prepared for jury, but the continual close study of each of those three songs each week helped me improve in more nuanced ways."
