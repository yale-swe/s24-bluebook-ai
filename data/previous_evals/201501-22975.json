    "Shop it. If you have a good teacher then stick with it.",
    "If you want to get a grasp for music theory, or have played some kind of instrument and want the humanities credit\/knowledge, I would highly recommend this course.",
    "MUSI 110 is a great intro music theory course. The workload is light, and there are lots of assignments, so it's super easy to figure out how you're doing grade-wise. Overall, I would recommend it, especially as an easy fifth course",
    "MUSI 110 is a good class for learning the foundations of writing and analyzing music. It moves quickly and covers a lot of ground in one semester, but hey, so does every other Yale class. I would recommend taking MUSI 110 if you want to learn a little bit more about the innards of the music you listen to. Heads up, if you haven't noticed yet, you DO NOT get a humanities credit for this class. So that sucks, but oh well.",
    "Yes, anyone who is interested in music and has any kind of background in music should take this class. It's pretty easy and layed back. The homework can be a little tedious sometimes, but they are never mentally straining. This class is never mentally straining, so its a good break from that stress in every other class. You get to just listen to music sometimes."
