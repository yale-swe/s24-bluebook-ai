   "comments": [
    "You will learn about the theories of why violence occurs, some historical applications and then how the media affects violence. Really interesting class, very applicable to life, and you will love it. I highly recommend it, it's the best class I took.",
    "This was an amazing course--the best I've taken at Yale. It's demanding (the papers are only 5-7 pages, but that will feel like too little), but the subject is fascinating. TAKE IT. My only regret is not investing more in the material.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! You will look at violence in America through three disciplines: social science, history, and hermeneutics. You will read a total of 9 books, write 3 response papers, and 3 papers of 5-7 pages. It's a lot of work, but totally worth it!",
    "Three words: TAKE THIS CLASS! It was by far my favorite course during my first semester at Yale. It is a comprehensive look at the origins of violence, the reasons behind why it happens, and how violence fits in with our identity as a nation. Granted, it is a *lot* of work--one book to read per week, and three 7-ish page essays. But the essays are structured so that you are never reading and writing at the same time, so during the writing week you can complete devote yourself to the assignment. Faragher is simply amazing, both in lecture and discussion. It is an intense subject, and he is intense about it. It is clear that he knows what he's talking about, and loves the topic. By the end of the semester, you will love it, too. Simply an amazing class.",
    "The course was an excellent survey of the themes of violence and justice in America. Although at times it was a tad heavy on the violence I learned a ton from Jmack's unique style of seminar teaching. The class is supposedly very representative of what goes on in the AMST department, we took a ton of material from different disciplines of historical study and social sciences and attempted to develop from them an understanding of violence and justice in America. We wrote three essays, with very little time pressure and a solid emphasis on the understanding of the texts we explored. It was a great class and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to take an incredibly interesting freshman seminar.",
    "Violence and Justice in America is an interdisciplinary exploration of the subjects of violence and justice as well as their roots in America and civilization (the name of the class really says it all). There's one essay per unit (out of three units), and assignments include reading a book a week and writing a response to one of the three to four books per unit. I would recommend this class to anyone who is genuinely interested in the subject and enjoys a smaller, more intimate discussion-oriented class. I loved this class and definitely looked forward to going to class every Tuesday and Thursday.",
    "The course is incredible - Professor Faragher is an outstanding speaker and teacher, and I enjoyed the class thoroughly. he is incredibly understanding and will play to the students' needs - this is the best class I have taken in my life.",
    "I loved this class, it was my favorite class of the semester. The workload seems daunting at first, but if you have a genuine interest in the course material, which I found very interesting, you shouldn't have a problem. Professor Faragher's lectures were really good, and the class discussions were always stimulating. If you don't get in to this class through the lottery, and you really want to take it, don't let that discourage you. There are usually a few spots left open, so go to the first class meeting.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it if the student was interested in the subject matter. Again, it delves very deeply into the subject of violence.",
    "Interesting class, everything is structured around the question \"why does America have a higher rate of lethal violence than all other developed countries?\" You will learn some causes but not a definitive answer. JMF is very good at what he does, but your enjoyment will depend primarily on who is in your class because it's mostly discussion-format. Most of the readings are fascinating: what turns someone into a violent criminal, the inner city street culture, the history of lynching, violent entertainment, the Tulsa Race Riot, the LA Riots. Commit yourself to a rough night when the papers are due. Challenging class, but you won't get bored: it's about violence.",
    "I would definitely recommend Violence and Justice in America to another student. The class is challenging and the workload is serious, but it is so worth all of the effort. You learn so much about the subject and the class serves as a great transition into college-level classes. The class is focused more on violence than justice, but it Professor Faragher shapes the semester so as to give his students a well-rounded understanding of violence in America. Professor Faragher's lectures were fascinating and informative and our class discussions were profound. If sociological theories, history, and creative interpretations of violence interest you, then this is an amazing class.",
    "I would summarize American Studies 006 01 as a course in which you study violence from many different perspectives in an attempt to discover why this instinct towards violence seems to exist in everyone. I would certainly recommend this courseto another student. It is not an easy Freshman Seminar but it is by far the most interesting and engaging course I took this term.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in violence and justice. The class mostly focusses on violence. It is not an uplifting class but I found what we were reading about to be intriguing. It made it so I looked at violence in a different way.",
    "If you are really interested in the study of violence, take this class. If not, I would suggest finding a class that pertains more to your interests.",
    "definitely recommend. interesting subject matter, artfully taught. papers leave a lot up to the student, and you come away with a great understanding of the topic of Violence and Justice"
