   "comments": [
    "A great class to really learn about your writing and hone your skills while studying some great stories",
    "If you love writing fiction and want to grow as a writer, you've come to the right place. Professor Choi is an amazing professor and chances are, most of the other students in the class will be fantastic writers as well. Be warned that almost all of your grade will depend on participation, so if you do take the class, you should commit to putting in the effort. It will definitely be worth your time though.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for any student no matter how experienced he\/she is in creative writing. I wasn't very confident in my fiction writing skills coming into this course and I have seen myself improve immensely throughout the semester. This course allows you to think in a different way, without constraints. It's challenging in the best way possible.",
    "Simply put, this class is a luxury. Students and professor alike are invested in each other's writings, and Professor Choi's comments during class discussions are lessons in themselves. Her comments on writing assignments are meticulous, and endlessly helpful. Take this class!",
    "Yes, especially if the fellow student already has some work they'd like to get feedback on and\/or wants to get more exposure to fiction.",
    "Would recommend",
    "I would summarize this class as a introductory writing workshop in fiction, perfect for those who have not taken a writing workshop before. I would recommend this class to another student who was 1. a English\/creative writing major or 2. someone who is a passionate writer and was looking for a forum in which to get feedback for their writing. If you do not really like writing, don't take this class thinking that it would be an easy 5th class, because it will just be painful. There is not as much work as in some other reading-heavy English classes, but a decent amount,",
    "Every day was a workshop of 3 people. Structurally, there was nothing much else to the class. This class is good for people who have never taken creative writing before (which is unlikely because you had to apply to this but anyway) or barely did any. Otherwise, it may get boring or uninspiring. There is also a decent amount of work--the workshop letters and the weekly writing pieces do take up more time than you'd expect.",
    "A great class, and Professor Choi is amazing. You're likely to make significant progress on at least one longer piece, and over the course of the semester will churn out a small armada of short pieces as well. If you don't already have such an armada (I didn't) you'll find taking this course a blessing for your portfolio, as well as any future applications, as it will leave you flush with new material that you're (hopefully) proud of. The class is also a lot of fun, as basically each class is simply discussion of the work presented by your peers, and occasionally yourself! My only word of caution is that the section I took devours paper. I thought the $20 I put into PaperCut at the start of my Yale career would last forever but I have never been so wrong. Expect to spend at least that much on printing if you don't have a printer of your own."
