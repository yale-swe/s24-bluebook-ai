   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I guess the splitting into sections thing worked, but I didn't think like how the different sections has differences in class structure, not just material, such as lectures only vs. recorded lectures or finals vs. final projects (even though that's probably inevitable).",
    "Strengths: I loved my individual polisci section. I felt that it was easy to pay attention and that the material was applicable to the p-sets Weaknesses: The lectures during the first 8 weeks were very fast-paced and I found it difficult to manage when doing homework\/quizzes",
    "Strengths: Good professors. Statistical analysis of political science data was very interesting to learn. Weaknesses: the out-of-class midterms is nothing like the sample posted on Canvas nor the p-sets we did. So, I did not really know how to prepare for them.",
    "It is a good overview but due to the size of the class, it is hard to get engaged.",
    "JDRS is great, really fun, and the lectures are all online so you can take the course when and how it makes sense for you, rather than hiking up science hill to space out for an hour and fifteen minutes. Professor Rader is not as engaging, and her lectures aren't online, but she moves very slowly and essentially repeats the same lecture every time so it wasn't too dramatic a shift from JDRS to her.",
    "Overall, I feel like I learned a ton in both parts of the class, and the course is designed such that if you put in the work, you can get the grade you want.",
    "First part of the class is a little all over the place and hard to follow, second half (poli sci) is great! I think a more clear laying out of what is testable knowledge and what is the more in depth statistically explanation to theorems and rules we know would make studying for exams less overwhelming.",
    "Strengths: JDRS is a great teacher and the class moved fast while he taught it. Weaknesses: Once the class split into individual sections, it became incredibly boring. We really didn't learn anything in the last 5 weeks of the class, which was a real shame.",
    "First Half - Loved the live recordings; it offered flexibility! Jonathon is engaging and energetic, so it is easy to stay involved in class. He can be a little annoying with his speech though! Second Half - Liked the smaller setting better, lots of interpretation.",
    "A weakness was definitely the beginning half where everyone was together learning basic statistics. I wish it had been specialized then because I learned a lot of stuff that was confusing to me and then it was gone. I also feel as though that portion moved way too quickly and there was not a lot of time or opportunity given to understand things. A strength was definitely JDRS even though I was confused the majority of the time I sensed that he cared a lot about his students and statistics.",
    "good class especially for non-mathematically-inclined people",
    "I think a weakness of this course is the lack of engagement with the professors once we all divide into our sections. A strength is that we learn a wide array of statistics during the first half.",
    "The first half of the course was really helpful and thorough, while the second half was quite slow and overcomplicated simple concepts that could have been taught in a much shorter time.",
    "The strengths of this course were its online aspects (such as the livestreaming of the classes and the Piazza forum). The weakness of this class would be its fast pace.",
    "This course was split into two halves, and there were great differences in teaching style between the two segments. Our two midterm exams were very different from our final, and more support\/instruction was given surrounding the final than earlier exams (possibly due to the smaller class size). It might be helpful to have the instructors from each section hold review sessions or otherwise engage with students prior to the mid-semester split, so that students will be better acquainted with their new instructors' teaching style.",
    "Strengths - lectures posted online, class slides available online Weaknesses - psets were often very difficult (much more difficult than what we had covered in class)",
    "Strengths were that I learned basic stats and learned to use mini tab. Weaknesses were that the course was not engaging at all and moved pretty fast.",
    "The lectures were thorough. I cant really say there were any weaknesses.",
    "Good overview, office hours are very helpful, could be more engaging although thats hard with such a big class",
    "I enjoyed the course but the material was often repeated in each lecture.",
    "The lectures were often more confusing than needed. However, if you can make it through the difficult first 2\/3rds, it's a good way to cinch an easy QR credit at the end",
    "It is a very large course but it is well run."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes for poli sci majors, it's important material and it's a relatively good QR.",
    "Yes! If you want a fast-paced stat review with the added advantage of applying that learning to a field of interest, this class is for you.",
    "Only if you enjoy Statistics and care about the subject matter. Very easy to lose interest if you aren't actually interested in the field.",
    "If you are a non-STEM student and need a QR, this is a good option. I had a bit of experience with statistics in high school, but even without prior knowledge, it should be more than doable.",
    "Yes! Don't expect to be super interested in it, but it's a good foundation for non-stats majors who are going to need stats in their career. In other words, it's not gonna be your most interesting class of the semester, but the knowledge is useful and it isn't a very hard class.",
    "Yes, a good QR and PLSC credit if you dont mind doing psets.",
    "Yes! It is NOT a gut QR, but it is an extremely valuable and doable one.",
    "Yep! Especially the Poli Sci track, its a great way to get a QR out of the way and get a good skill out of it",
    "Yeah, if you want a pretty easy class that teaches the bare-bones of statistics. If you're looking for more nuance and more engagement, look elsewhere.",
    "Yes, it is a good introduction to Stats, albeit it does move a little fast and cover a lot of ground. You will definitely learn how to use Minitab, which is good! P-Sets are moderately difficult, they kind of vary. Both midterms are take home though so that is good!",
    "I would if they desperately need a QR credit and theyre in the major. However, I think there are less stressful ways to get a QR credit. This course is really challenging and requires a lot of maintenance. It also moves very quickly, but if youre someone who can handle that, take it.",
    "It's amazing introductory course. The workload is really small, there's only one real exam and you can do the mid-terms in your rom. This was my best class",
    "Eh",
    "It is a good introduction to statistics, but I took AP Statistics in high school and I can't imagine taking this course without that knowledge. It would have been too challenging.",
    "Certainly. The first half of the course was really well-taught and fairly graded but the second half was too slow and did not match the difficulty of the first part of the course.",
    "If you need it as a prerequisite, yes. Otherwise probably not. Though I suppose it provides an introduction to statistics.",
    "I'd recommend the first half of the semester with JDRS.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because there are a lot of different available options to receive help, if needed. This class also gives a student a foundation in statistics and data analysis.",
    "I would recommend this course, as it provides students with an impressive skill-set and analytical 'toolbox' after only one semester. It is an introductory course, but even so students will still walk away with concrete, usable skills and knowledge. This is a great gateway to future data science classes, especially for PLSC majors.",
    "If you need a QR credit and understand basic statistics already, then sure. The class itself is not too difficult, but the psets can be deceptively difficult, so be ready to go to lots of office hours.",
    "Yes if you want a solid foundation in stats.",
    "I would recommend this course with a few caveats. As someone who is not good at math and did not take high levels in high school, this course was good for me but I would not really recommend it to super advanced math students. Also, this course at times seemed to border a social science course, so for people really into math, that might be a problem.",
    "Yes because its a good introduction to stats for people to decide if they like it",
    "Its a good introduction to statistics and I think its beneficial to those who are interested in political science.",
    "Not unless they're looking for a QR that's attainable if you REGULARLY go to office hours",
    "No, but only because I find QR very difficult."
