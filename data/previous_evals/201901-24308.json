    "This was a fantastic course. I learned how to build a solution to a social challenge from the bottom up. We co-created with our communities, and in the end developed a viable solution for improving student mental health. Were actually going forward with our venture (my team) and trying to develop and implement our mobile app product. I cannot do this course justice in a written review. All I can say is that Ive made wonderful friends, found a sense of excitement and purpose, and developed my business savvy, communication skills, and more."
