    "My Spanish grammar and reading comprehension improved.",
    "I developed my reading comprehension and writing skills, specifically my grammar in writing.",
    "This course really helped in giving me a strong review of grammatical structures I had learned in the past but had not quite perfected yet.",
    "It is fair to say that the language program at my high school was less than stellar, but having class every day for 50 minutes did wonders for my skill in the Spanish language. I really feel as though, should I decide to go to a Spanish speaking country, that I would be able to have coherent conversations with locals.",
    "I definitely improved in Spanish in terms of both speaking and writing.",
    "Better fluency and writing skills.",
    "Few. I got a little more practice with spanish, learned a few more verbal tenses, but ultimately felt like my speaking and writing skills actually regressed from lack of practice."

   "comments": [
    "This course is very strong with keeping students engaged and interested in the material.",
    "The course should focus more on grammar concepts and how the relate to English grammar concepts.",
    "The strengths include that there is lots of repitition in the practice activities which helps you master the topics. The weaknesses include that there could be more activities which encourage speaking in class",
    "More (grammatically correct) conversational Spanish.",
    "This course excels in giving students a wide range of course materials to study from. The subject matter is taught through an engaging variety of mediums, from short stories to textbooks to movies.",
    "I really enjoyed the class and see no room for improvement. It was very well organized and there was a reasonable amount of work and the tests were very fair.",
    "Strengths were the videos, movies, and stories.",
    "Spanish 130 focussed on reading comprehension and writing. I believe these are very important skills but it took time away from practicing speaking and listening. Additionally, a lot of new material felt rushed in the second half of the semester making it difficult to absorb and utilize the new material.",
    "Not enough speaking practice in class. We were talked at for most of each day, with little to no opportunity for improvisation in speaking."

    "If you are going to take Spanish L3, take it with Professor Diaz. He is exceptionally funny and really encourage you to do well. I always enjoyed walking into his class in the morning and he made learning Spanish, interesting and fun.",
    "It's a lot of work, but you really get what you put into it back out of it.",
    "Your basic run of the mill language class. Homeworks are a pain, otherwise it's manageable.",
    "Yes, the daily work can be tasking but the content and course were enjoyable",
    "Yes, this is a great course for students who like Spanish and have a hunger for learning.",
    "Yes. This class with Sebastian and great and I learned so much!",
    "Don't take the class with Sebastian if you want to improve your spanish skills. He wastes class time playing Pitbull music videos, makes constant insinuations about romance between students, or going over answers to homework that are already posted online. He can be funny and is certainly a character, but ultimately is a poor teacher."
