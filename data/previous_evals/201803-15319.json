    "so good! Hugh Flick is super kind",
    "I learned about the Ramayana story, how different tellings portray the characters and narrative, how the story interacts with religion and politics, and the different ways of telling the story.",
    "I learned about the religious, political, and cultural contexts behind a fundamental Indian text. I was also able to analyze the text as a piece of literature independently and critically, while practicing the principle of cultural relativism.",
    "Learned a lot about the Ramayana and how it has shaped the culture and politics of India",
    "An understanding of the Ramayana as a story and how it has shaped and been shaped by Indian culture",
    "I learned a lot about the historical implications about the Ramayana!",
    "Learned a lot more about the Ramayana and it's implications in modern day politics",
    "Detailed study of the Ramayana story and it's many tellings.",
    "Learnt about the story and various versions of the Ramayana, and the how the various lessons learnt from the story can be applied to our real lives."

   "comments": [
    "not too heavy, interesting",
    "This course was mostly all strengths. The one thing I wish was different is spending less time talking about the articles at the beginning of class and delving deep into the actual text instead. I'm sad that we were unable to get through the entire book in terms of discussion, and I find that some of the articles can be dry, especially talking about them after just hearing the presentation. I also wish there was a way to make the course more collaborative and discussion based.",
    "The strength of the course is that it is very accessible to all students regardless of background. Prof. Flick does a great job in teasing out interesting discussions and engaging the students. One way to improve the class is to read and discuss the actual text in class in an organized manner, as sometimes it seemed like students were reading critiques of the text but not the text itself.",
    "The strength of the course is that Professor Flick seems to have an opinion on all aspects of the Ramayana. Getting into discussions with him is easy! The course could be improved by making the requirements of the final paper more concrete. I had no idea what the papers would be graded on or what topic was appropriate!",
    "i thought it was a fasccinating course bar one exception: sometimes other students wouldnt pay attention during other presentations.",
    "Super chill seminar, Prof flick is incredibly knowledgeable and his journey towards Hinduism is quite inspiring, definitely would recommend talking to him outside of class about it sometime",
    "Strengths: chill, interesting, good professor, interesting discussions weaknesses: some students were slacking and discussions we're thus dominated or held up by a small few",
    "Professor Flick is very knowledgeable, and the course is well structured with weekly lectures, student presentations, midterm and final essays. The material is very interesting and very well presented."

   "comments": [
    "yes, for Flick!",
    "Definitely! Probably more so if you are already familiar with some South Asian epics, but I loved this course. It can essentially be what you make of it -- I appreciated the material so I did all the readings, but you definitely don't have to in order to still do the discussion posts (which are very low key anyways). The two essays (3-5 page midterm and 10-12 page final) did take some work and time, but they were not too bad overall, especially because the final was on a topic of your choice. Professor Flick is great; you might be confused by the structure of the class on the first day, but it's essentially the first half spent talking about the articles and the second half about the text itself. Prof Flick does most of the talking and discussion, but that's mostly because not everyone in the class was willing to participate.",
    "Yes! This is the perfect class for a student who wants to explore a topic out of his\/her comfort zone. Its laid back atmosphere is very conducive to learning.",
    "I would recommend this to any student who does not know much about Hinduism but would like to learn more (I took it so I could talk about Hinduism with my parents more easily). It was also a nice way to earn the humanities credit I need!",
    "Yes - you learn about a niche area in Indian history.",
    "Take it!! Whether you know the Ramayana already or you've never even heard of it, this class has something for everyone",
    "Yes, it's a chill way to get an introduction to a very interesting story that is engrained in the hearts of over a billion people across south and south East Asia. Very culturally relavent and revealing story. Prof Flick is a great professor and tries hard to make the class interesting. He even invites a few cool guest lecturers. You really get what you put into this course.",
    "Yes, great course. Professor Flick is an amazing teacher, and the material is very interesting."
