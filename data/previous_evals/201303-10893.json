   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend it for anyone who wants to read the Divine Comedy but is daunted by the idea of plowing through the whole thing (or has only ever read Inferno), or who has read it on their own without the benefit of Christiana's lectures.",
    "If you want to read Dante then absolutely take it!! The lecture is amazing and if you're into allusions to mythology\/theological theory\/ medieval medicine,\/historical references, then Dante's your man. Christiana's lecture is fantastic! She's funny and can tell you what happens in every canto of the comedy basically off the top of her head. Keep in mind that you'll have to memorize what happens in each cantos (chapter) for the midterm, final, and each of the section quizzes. I have a terrible memory and \"cramming\" for each one was a pain. Keep in mind too that if you take the section in Italian your final paper is in italian.The ideas you learn about are great though. I mean, it's a whole class on Dante, so make sure you really like reading his work. While the Divine Comedy is one of the most beautiful poems ever written, it really does read (especially paradiso) like a religious text, and if you're not as interested in all the historical\/mythological\/medieval references in the poem, then this may not be for you.",
    "DEFINITELY take this course! There is a reason this poem has been read and written about for centuries and this class will honestly show you exactly why. Even if you don't speak Italian but just love English or literature, you should absolutely take it. I sound dramatic when I say it, but it's a life-changing course.",
    "YES! The Divine Comedy has changed my life and myperspective on things like community and diversity. I was raised an atheist, but Dante's philosophies are very applicable to daily life as a human and a citizen of the community. Furthermore, Christiana and the TAs really enhance this course through outside ways, like film screenings, food, review sessions, etc. It's a wonderful course! Essay and final exam is a bit rough doe.",
    "You have to be very interested in the Divine Comedy, obviously. While I'm not a classics major, I'd wanted to read the Comedy in its entirety for quite some time and figured that this was the perfect chance to knock out one of my personal goals and a humanities credit, simultaneously. It does kind of drag on though in the second half of the course. Fair warning.",
    "Take it! Dante gives me new life. I've never been a huge Classics person, but Dante and all of his beauty and connections are truly remarkable.",
    "It's a great course if you're incredibly interested in learning more than you'd ever planned on about the Divine Comedy, one man's obsession with a woman he barely knew, mounds of medieval theology and pseudoscience, and every little family feud and scramble for power circling 13th to 14th century war-ravaged Italy. The course definitely delves right into all these disputes, covering enough obscure Dante contemporaries to fill a mountain, maybe even Mount Purgatory itself. The instructors are without doubt some of the loveliest people you will ever meet, and their enthusiasm for the subject matter is inexplicably contagious. Take this if you're prepared to be poring over the work of a historically revered man with a gold-rimmed, rose-tinted magnifying glass for a whole semester. You'll be rewarded if you are, but if your interest is only fleeting to vague, an \"I'll consider it,\" just be warned: Dante is only human, after all, and the painstaking analysis\/admiration shot into his verses may annoy you at some point. This is a course that understands that, but persists in its depth of Comedy coverage for the sake of actually learning more, learning insightfully, and learning for enjoyment.",
    "This is a really great course. You should take it if you want to read the Divine Comedy, or if you did DS and now want to read the rest of it. The tests are difficult but manageable, the sections are very helpful, and the lectures are enjoyable.",
    "YES!!! This class is amazing! Christiana is a wonderful lecturer and a great conversationalist, who was always expertly prepared and always incorporated our own queries regarding this -- really dense and hard -- poem in her discussions. The Comedy is one of the most intellectually rigorous and fascinating works I have ever read and it is something that you can read over and over again. It's so widely encompassing and accommodating. It's great! Both TAs were great and very much committed to the material. It was a great experience. Will undoubtedly recommend it!"
