   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class - the problem sets really help with understanding the material and the small class environment helped me stay engaged and because of this I think I learned more.",
    "I would recommend it, while its not perfect, in the spectrum of economics classes at the intro level, its probably one of the better ones.",
    "Rather challenging course material, but manageable with sufficient effort",
    "ECON 110 05 was difficult for me because I'm not very math oriented. The seminar format put a lot of pressure on me to do well in comparison to the math and economics majors surrounding me. Personally, I would have preferred a lecture format for someone like me. That being said, I made it through the course with a good grade, and my other work didn't suffer because of it.",
    "Workload is not too bad, but you have too keep up with the material since the course is very fast-paced. If you have not taken econ before, the lecture class might be easier.",
    "Certainly. Especially for anybody even remotely interested in economics. The seminar was a great experience.",
    "Basic intro to microeconomics. Lots of focus on concepts and graphs.",
    "Definitely recommended whether or not you plan to major in economics. It is a good intro course and a good benchmark for whether or not to consider studying economics.",
    "I would not recommend this course to any other student. It is dry, and the instruction is poor",
    "The curve is harsh, take the lecture if you can.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is prepared to put a lot more work than is required for this course. By this I mean that the student must be willing to do all the reading outside of class and sit in office hours because sitting through the lectures and doing the homework is only the bare bones of what is enough to make it through the midterm and the final. I now know that this is probably to be expected in a college course, but as a first semester freshman it took me a while to figure it out.",
    "Challenge but manageable. Interesting material, can be dry at times, equation heavy. Conceptually very interesting. A good intro, covers important basic knowledge of economics. Would recommend."
