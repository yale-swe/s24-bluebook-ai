    "If you're looking for an intensive language course and you actually want to learn Portuguese, this is the right course. Fabi is wonderful, warm, and you will get so much out of a class with her if you are willing to put in the effort. The workload in the second half of the course does get heavy, and the grammar gets difficult, so don't write the class off. Be warned though -- if you took Spanish, Portuguese will replace it for a while and you won't be able to speak Spanish (though I've heard this gets better as you approach fluency.)",
    "Take it if you're willing to put up with a frustratingly gutty atmosphere. If you really want to learn Portuguese, you're going to have to do more outside of class to make it challenging and valuable.",
    "Port 120 is a course that definitely picks up from Port 110 but it's very interesting and there isn't much homework."
