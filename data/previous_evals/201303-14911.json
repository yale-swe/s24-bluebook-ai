    "Its an interactive meeting where one student presents his\/her work and everyone else is free to ask questions and understand the work being discussed. I think it was a good learning experience. It gave me a broad overview of the scope in geophysics, the various sub-fields and also made me familiar with the different methodologies of working of different professors in our department. It was also a good way to interact with my seniors and other professors.",
    "It is extra work without learning basics so I woudn't recommend it unless they know the basics already.",
