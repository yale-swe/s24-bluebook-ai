   "comments": [
    "If anything, I think this class expanded my view of what constitutes acceptable critical discourse at a university. We talked a lot about the grotesque and disgusting and touched on everything from Syrian refugees to whether Greek statuary is sexy.",
    "Through taking Dionysus in Modernity, I have gained great insight into the Dionysian-Apollonian dichotomy described by Nietzsche which permeates much of modern society. I thought deeply about what it means to experience the sort of ecstacy and \"primordial oneness\" Bacchic revels bring about, and how this idea of letting go, unrestrained pleasure, and joy from pain plays out in literature and in history\/culture. In this class, I read great works of literature from Euripides to Thomas Mann to Lorca.",
    "Got a widened philosophy knowledge through the readings and especially the discussion in class. Definitely worked on writing skills thanks to the long papers and the professor's feedback. Interesting and different readings from different sources and styles",
    "This course taught me to read texts from a Dionysian lens. I also learned many skills in classroom discussion as well as establishing connections between different disciplines."

   "comments": [
    "This is a very laid-back class, which was both a strength and a weakness. I think most people actually did all the reading since it was only around 50p a week, and that made for a better discussion. I do wish the some of the student presentations were structured more as students simply leading the discussion \"20 minute\" presentations often went on for an hour and often didn't get to the most interesting aspects of the text. The class was very hot\/cold sometimes the discussions were really compelling and fresh, but at other points it felt like rehashing conflicts in 20th century psychoanalytic or literary theory weren't nearly as interesting if you were familiar with some of the subsequent queer and feminist theory that had really worked over those questions.",
    "The readings for this course are absolutely perfect and the lectures are informative and clarifying. However, this class can feel a bit inaccessible at times to non-humanities majors.",
    "More shorter papers instead of 2 long ones A couple of short readings for what major philosophers' ideas connected to class readings are stand for. Professor gave really good feedback",
    "The classroom discussion format made the course very interactive and enjoyable. Having one or two students present each week made sure that we were directing the discussion. Also the interdisciplinary aspect of the course meant very little was off-topic, which meant that we could talk about anything. One thing I regret about this class is that I didn't get to know my classmates that well, at least as well as I would expect from such a small and interactive class."

   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend it as a laid-back 5th class for someone who wants to read some fun books every week. Wasn't life-changing, but the discussions were good, workload was pretty minimal, and George is a sweetheart.",
    "I would definitely recommend this fascinating course to anyone at Yale.",
    "Absolutely. The way this class hit me was like a sucker punch. You'll never see what is lurking beneath the glass shimmer before it comes around to not only knock on your image but then on you from behind as well.",
    "This class will present some very unusual texts and material (Dionysian rituals, sexual and other \"liberating\" activities ) that are not usually approached in other classes. Some of the material is quite shocking and could disturbing while the last movie provokes pure disgust. A philosophy background is recommended since it gives an additional depth to everything. I would recommend this class, but be aware that there will be plenty of moments throughout the semester where the readings might REALLY shock and appall you.",
    "Yes, if you feel like you are interested in the topic definitely shop the first class and look over the syllabus. If you feel like this is the class for you, you will really enjoy it."
