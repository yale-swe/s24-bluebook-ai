    "I would definitely recommend this class. Even if you think you wouldn't like a WSGS class, just shop it. I loved it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, not just if he\/she is interested in WGSS issues. I have to say, i didn't think i was, but i do know that i like american history, and this was sucha different and intersting way to view american history and to learn about people, movements, and event you would not otherwise focus one, unless your'e a wgss major, that is. meyerowits is great about presenting both sides of an argumetn, bso i never felt like i was drowning in radical, liberal ideology, about which i was surprised. Great class, i'd recommend it.",
    "This course gives an overview of women's political history through the twentieth century. I would absolutely recommend it, as I think it is important knowledge to have, and Professor Meyerowitz does a great job explaining the material. The reading was not overwhelming, either.",
    "Absolutely. If it were up to me it would be a prerequisite for every Yale student (and two semesters for every guy in Zeta).",
    "An awesome course with manageable work and a great professor. You will want to go to lecture!",
    "Great course if you are interested in women's roles in the 20th century. I would recommend that all Yale students take this course (not just women!) The class explores the ways in which gender, race, and class all intersect and is formative to understanding the history of the United States in general.",
    "I would recommend the class, it was very good.",
    "yes, a very interesting course if you want to get a basic history of women in america in the past century. really eye-opening and informative, plus professor meyerowitz is incredible in lecture and very inspiring in general.",
    "TAKE IT!! One of Yale must-take courses for the socially-conscious mind.... really makes you think about issues almost all of us take for granted - even women",
    "A great course that I heartily recommend about a side of history we often ignore.",
    "A great overview of 20th century women's history. Prof Meyerowitz is funny, nice, and very engaging, and the material is super important. However, the readings are really jumbled (all journal articles and primary source documents that don't necessarily align with the lecture material), and the questions on the tests were frustratingly vague (\"describe the women's movement of the late 20th century\"). A great Cr\/D or auditing (if you'll actually go to lecture) option.",
    "This course is an overview of women's movements in the twentieth century, as well as a brief foray into lesbian& gay rights movements and transgender rights movements. The lectures are interesting, section was as enjoyable as a section can be, and the tests are very straightforward (essay questions are given in advance, etc).It's a great class to take, even if you aren't interested in most WGSS courses, because women's history is something that is often bypassed in other courses. Also, Prof. Meyerowitz did a good job not just going through the large women's movements, but also talking about the differences within the women's movements according to race and class.",
    "Fascinating introduction to a history of women and gender in the US. The women's movement is fascinating in so many different ways, and you'll find yourself inspired by many of the lectures and readings as you think about how they apply to your own experience\/life. Professor Meyerowitz is brilliant and wonderful--my only lecture class where the professor genuinely has cared about how students respond to the readings\/material in order to help shape the rest of the class. You have a lot of freedom in your final paper to write about something that is very important to you, and I think everyone in my section was truly excited at least by the topic of their paper if not the prospect of writing it. (It's only ten pages, too--you can do it).If you're at all interested by the title of the course, you will not regret taking the class. For those who read over this course in the Blue Book--definitely take another look. You definitely will not be disappointed.",
    "Very fun class - interesting content, engaging lectures, great readings. It's not just about feminism - it covers the suffrage movement, women's movement into the workplace, and more.",
    "Yes. If you like survey classes, you'll love this one.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if you are (1) looking for an interesting, niche intro history course and (2) don't already know too much about women's history in the United States. It's clear, meticulous, and very interesting, though it's a survey and, as such, not that nuanced or complicated an experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking Women in America. While it's a fair amount of work, the largest project - a 10-page paper - is written on the topic of the student's choosing. This allows students to learn about what interests them while still teaching them the value of primary source work and effective writing. The course itself is also very interesting - most history courses do not focus on the female side of history, which is just as important as what is commonly discussed.",
    "I would GREATLY recommend this class.",
    "A pretty interesting class and a good intro to the more historical aspect of the WGSS department. The reading is pretty interesting (Prof. Meyerowitz brings in a lot of primary source documents) but kind of heavy. Not all of the reading is super necessary. There wasn't too much work (midterm, 10-page paper, final) outside of the reading. A pretty standard women's history course--definitely worth taking if you're interested in the subject matter. Nothing mindblowingly exceptional, but a solid course nonetheless.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's not just another review of 20th century America--it takes a different perspective in a way that is very interesting and worthwhile. It's made me want to take more gender studies classes. It is not some stereotypical \"men are oppressive\" feminist attack on America; it is introspective and cuts through all such stereotypes. The reading is also both very interesting and not heavy at all; section is fun and interesting; the exams are straightforward.",
    "Shes a very good lecturer and the class was both engaging and informative.",
    "Yeah its a very interesting take on history",
    "This class isn't too much work, but you will learn a lot. This class really teaches you to reevaluate what it means to be a woman and feminist in America. And it's not a wishy-washy class, it's very much fact driven.",
    "Exactly what it says- will give you a pretty in-depth understanding of the woman's movement. Would definitely recommend it. Everything we learned was interesting.",
    "If you are even remotely interested in this class (which could also be titled Gender, Sexuality& Women in America: the 20th Century), TAKE IT. Easily one of the best courses I have taken at Yale thus far; I cannot sing its praises enough. Joanne is absolutely fantastic and I found myself excited to go to lecture twice a week.",
    "This is a great class, but does not mistake it for a gut. The lectures are interesting and you will look forward to going to them. You will not, however, look forward to the sixty and upwards pages of reading per week. Or the midterm\/final\/paper, which take a lot of time and effort. But I am happy to have taken it.",
    "This is an excellent course, a wonderful overview of women's history in America and Professor Meyerowitz is a joy to behold. The readings regarding minority women felt a little perfunctory, but otherwise readings were just as fantastic as lectures. Really, a stunning course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is actually one of the best courses I have taken at yale.",
    "It was a great class overall. Lectures are interesting, Meyerowitz is fantastic, the readings are worth it, and the workload is fair. Take it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. As a senior History major, it's one of the best history classes--and one of the best classes, period--I've taken at Yale. Great readings, great lectures, great professor.",
    "A classic history lecture but with a subject that everyone should know more about. It lays out the history of women in America over the last century clearly. You do need to do the reading, but it is all pretty interesting, especially the novels. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone! The course is very interesting and a great survey of women's issues and movements in the twentieth century.",
    "Do NOT take this class! I was initially excited to learn more about women's movements and feminism in the United States. The topic sounded interesting and the first few lectures were engaging. Still, it did not take long before I became awfully bored of the class. Unless you absolutely love American history and do not mind re-learning things that you learned in APUSH, don't take this class. It won't go as much in depth as you might think and the lectures \/discussions will be boring. Keep shopping. You'll find a better class.",
    "Awesome! One of the best classes at Yale. Not too much work but you learn so much and it is all very useful and insightful.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course. It covers material you have probably heard before (unless you're international) and doesn't even ask you to think critically about it.",
    "Definitely take it if your interested in learning more about women's history. The lectures are very interesting but be prepared for a lot of writing, from the paper to the 3 essays you need to write on the final.",
    "Women in America is the narrative of changes to women's lives and society in general that women fought for and achieved over the course of the 20th century. In taking this course you will realize that traditional American history courses ignore the huge impact that social movements (and especially those led by women) had on the United States. Take this course. It is amazing.",
    "Women's history in the 20th century -- pretty much that. I would recommend it. It's great to learn more in depth about things that most American history classes touch on very briefly, if at all.",
    "Yes",
    "MUST TAKE!!! Especially for all the women out there. This course changes the way you approach modern day feminism and being a woman in society. So many of my friends took this class with me and we all walked away unbelievably inspired by Prof. Meyerowitz. This is one of the few courses that I have taken at Yale that I think truly forced me to reexamine my beliefs in a very positive way. What a fantastic experience. I love Prof. Meyerowitz. TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. Oh, and the open-ended term paper allowed so many of us to explore issues of interest to us in a way that I found more enjoyable that most of the papers I've written at Yale. When you find students openly discussing their papers in the dining hall with pride and engagement, you know that the course has been a success.",
    "This course is an overview of the experience of women in America over the course of the 20th century - focusing on the ways in which women organized for different political causes and also the ways in which they came to have the place they have now in society, with its successes and limits.",
    "It's a great overview of women's history. As a quasi-feminist, I am very glad I took the course - it goes over the women's movement from six different lenses, labor, sexuality, etc, describing history that I did not know existed. (Although I have heard from more hard-core feminist friends that this course is very basic.) The grading isn't too easy on tests, but not excruciatingly difficult either. Lots of reading. You have to put in a good amount of effort to do well, but I would encourage you to take it! Very interesting.",
    "absolutely. All yale women must take this class!",
    "Great, but frustratingly broad.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Women's issues weren't particularly deep in my heart when i took this course, so I was completely surprised by how much I ended up loving this class. I learned a lot, Meyerowitz is a great lecturer, and it really blew away a lot of misconceptions I had about women in the 20th century.",
    "A great course that offers a more nuanced view of American history. Not too much work, and sets up a lot of lively debates.",
    "The class was definitely a 100-level course--it gave a brief overview of a span of history, but didn't really delve deeply into any of the material. For that reason it felt a little simplistic at times, but was a solid and comprehensive (if basic) account of women's history. It was very little work and reading, but I would only recommend it to someone who has never taken any WGSS classes and so is seeking a comprehensive introduction.",
    "Take it. Interesting, not too much work. Might be review for some individuals because I feel like many classes cover some of these topics, but Meyerowitz really tries to challenge the class.",
    "It's a great class!! I would definitely recommend it. I learned a lot from it- lectures were very interesting, informative, and easy to understand. Also, most of the readings were very interesting. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. It was really interesting to approach women's history from so many different perspectives, and Professor Meyerowitz is a great lecturer. Class and readings went well together, but definitely were not redundant. Grading was pretty simple; just section participation, midterm, 10 page term paper, and final exam, each 25%. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Absolutely take this course. The lectures are extremely well-organized, and easy to follow if this is really your first introduction to women's history. There is also a lot to learn, if, like me, you feel like you already have a fairly firm grasp on the topic. Meyerowitz is a really great lecturer and cares about the topic. It kind of sucks to have a research paper due at the end and then a final, but it's definitely doable and the tests aren't incredibly difficult. The research for the paper is actually really fun. I'm a history major and I thought this was a great course, but I also think it would be enjoyable for anyone looking for a first history course, a first WGSS course, or even a humanities credit.",
    "Interesting lectures, good professor, manageable work -- a must-take.",
    "If you're at all interested in the subject matter: TAKE IT! Really great course, the work is very manageable and enjoyable, and you learn a lot about the very important 50% of the American population in the 20th century that may have been glossed over in other history classes. The TFs are all wicked, highly recommended.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, as Professor Meyerowitz is an amazing lecturer. Initially, I didn't know if I would be that interested in a Women's History class, but I was very impressed by this course.",
    "I would recommend the class, even to those who already know a fair amount of women's history\/feminist history. There are certain lectures that feel very remedial to those who already do know a good amount of history, and it can be frustrating how quickly the professor moves through really significant material, but even if you already know a lot of the history, a lot of the primary source materials are pretty great. Professor Meyerowitz is especially strong in labor history and in the history of transsexuality and gender issues, so if you're interested in those takes on American history or women's history, I would recommend the course. The readings and workload are all very manageable.",
    "Yes, this was a great class. It teaches you a lot about the history of women in America without overwhelming you with details about dates and historical figures. The professor was great and gives organized lectures that are easy to sit through.",
    "take it take it take it!!! my favorite class at Yale so far! the lectures are fascinating, professor meyerowitz is great. you will learn a ton - there is so much to the history of women in America that i never knew about before. there is a lot of reading but it's so interesting it will go by quickly, especially the novels. the midterm and the final are relatively low-stress because they give you the essay questions in advance. overall, the course material is great and the class is well structured.",
    "I would recommend American Studies 271 01 to a fellow student. This course is a history course that covers women's history in America from 1890 to 2010. The course work includes weekly readings and brief responses in the form of a discussion question, one small project in the first half of the semester, one midterm exam, one term paper, and one final exam at the end of the semester. The workload is manageable and the reading materialis interesting.",
    "Def. recommend this class to everyone, WGSS major or not. It should be a must for all students.",
    "This is a history class about the women's movements. It's highly structured and the lectures are easy to understand and follow. There is a good bit of reading, but it's broken up nicely. Grading is broken down into quarters for participation, paper, midterm, and final. Good class, take it if you get a chance no matter what your major."
