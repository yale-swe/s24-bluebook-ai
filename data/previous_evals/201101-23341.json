    "This is a 2 credit course for F&ES students. There is little homework, other than reading for class, and the final paper and team presentation. Regarding speed of class, Prof. Elliot often goes over the same subjects one too many times.Prof. Elliot teaches in such a way as to present multiple sides of an issue, without advocating (favoring) any particular one. This is helpful in realizing there are no easy answers to green energy policy.",
    "Good overall",
    "I enjoyed the class' pace and the Socratic structure the instructor led it with. There were some great discussions, fed not only by the professor's expertise but also by student's comments. Highly recommend it to other students.",

    "I think this is the only clean energy US policy course at Yale, which is much needed for F&ES energy students (although there is also a 1 credit energy reading group at the Law school).",
    "Good overall",
    "The professor's method of evoking critical analysis and original thought. Professor presented the most important material and built the concepts for the class to attack from original perspectives.",
    "See above.",
    "Course materials are not difficult to understand even if you don't have a strong background in the environmental policy.",
    "instructor was great",
    "Learning about some of the legal details associated with things like federal energy efficiency mandates, renewable energy portfolios, etc. It was also a great opportunity for me to think more thoroughly about various energy issues around which I already had a technical background, but hadn't put into a policy\/legal context.",
    "Open ended final paper, allowed us to pursue our own interest areas.",
    "The class discussions and all of the different students' experiences and perspectives.",

   "comments": [
    "Prof. Elliot's teaching style is in most need of improvement. He has a tendency to ask questions, and then within two seconds go right into answering his own question. Why ask a question if he is not going to allow students to answer? Or, when he does allow a student to answer, he often interrupts the student and then finishes the response himself. It's annoying and I am not sure Prof. Elliot realizes he has this habit.",
    "Good overall",
    "Just a bit more clarity on grading structure (i.e. what % of grade on what) and transparency on how we did on the group projects.",
    "I think it's attempt to embrace both law and forestry students leaves both groups wanting (or at least it did from the forestry side). I came into the class with a very solid understanding of things like energy efficiency, renewable energy, and transportation, so didn't benefit very much from the sometimes long discussions about the basic concepts related to these issues. I think that background information was more presented for the benefit of law students. However, I did really benefit from discussions that integrated legal concepts into those issues; how the commerce clause could be used to mandate a federal building efficiency standard, or what groups have jurisdiction over what issues. Those I think were some of the basic legal concepts that probably bored the law students, but fascinated me. Perhaps there's a better way to combine the two... if anything, cutting back on the time spent reviewing concepts talked about in previous classes might allow more time to delve into new issues in more detail.",
    "The content -- there was not enough policy covered.",
    "It's pretty broad in scope. I would have appreciated more technical legal instruction.",
    "The course is not taught in a very engaging way. The professor should look for ways to build interest from students."

    "Email feedback from Prof. Elliot was short. In addition to this, he always runs off after class to catch a train, leaving no time to discuss issues with him after class. He should schedule himself or the class differently to allow for time after class.",
    "Good overall",
    "The professor was very responsive to requests.",
    "instructor very responsive to email",

    "Definitely, advantage from discussing and exchanging ideas.",
    "Students did not seem terribly interested in working on our group presentation.",
    "I thought it was really interesting to get to work more closely with law students -- they helped explain more details about legal concepts like the commerce clause that factored into our policy discussions. The only disadvantage was that the assignment itself felt so broad that it didn't really give a good opportunity to through the details of policy implementation, which I think would have been a good exercise. (So maybe instead of thinking of our top three policy suggestions, each group could be assigned a specific policy or policy objective and then have to think in detail what such a policy would look like, how it would be implemented, and what the costs\/benefits would be).",

    "great course",
    "If you're a FES student with a strong background in energy issues, a lot of the lecture content might seem like a review. If you really want to gain better grasp of legal issues surrounding green energy policy, you will need to go to class ready to ask questions and draw out the details that you want. If you don't come to class prepared and don't participate, you may not get the interesting insights and knowledge that makes any class worth your time.",
    "Don't expect a comprehensive, historical look and green energy policy, but an issue-focused approach. Professor Elliott is a good lecturer."
