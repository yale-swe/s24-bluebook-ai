   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the evolution of thought. From pagans to Christians, advocates of democracy and monarchy, war and peace. I learned about some of the greatest rulers of the West. I learned about a lot of famous authors and famous quotes. I learned there can be logic to religion.",
    "I have learned how to write papers quickly within a week. I have learned how to critically think about different historical authors together.",
    "This course improved my ability to write clear and concise analysis reliably",
    "As advertised, I think the incredibly broad scope of the curriculum helped me see the broad strokes of Historical and Political thought throughout the ages. I also thought that the essay writing regime was rather rigorous and forced me to be clearer about my thoughts.",
    "I have developed a better sense of the progression of ideas in Western historical and political thought, especially regarding the ways in which the authors of assigned readings comment on and respond to one another over the centuries. My skills as an analytical writer, particularly when it comes to synthesizing large bodies of text and\/or comparing multiple texts, have improved greatly. I feel better able to communicate my interpretations of texts verbally in discussion with classmates.",
    "This course taught me to critically evaluate history through political and philosophical lenses.",
    "I learned about different political philosophies and their development across time. However, I did not see too much of a practical connection with modern politics, although I saw the origins of our standard democratic states. I definitely became a better writer and analyzer of works and grew to be able to discover the gist of any given writer's theory.",
    "I improved my skills in extracting the key ideas from historical texts and developed different ways of understanding them.",
    "While taking the class was certainly tough and it often felt that right when I started to grasp a concept we would move on to the next one, I do think I learned a lot about historical and political theorists and writers who have defined and altered the ideological landscape of the western wired from antiquity to the Renaissance period. Going into the final and reviewing everything I learned, I realized that I could map out the different intellectual movements that have defined the West's history. And that is knowledge that I know I will never forget."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Maimonides and Alfarabi seemed like concessions to those who argue we read only white authors. But their work is confusing and didn't add a lot to my understanding. Also both works were more philosophical than historical. I'm not convinced they were the best authors we could be reading.",
    "I think the amount of reading was a lot, and it often felt as if I did not completely understand one author before we moved on to the next. Also, students were not given a lot of background and context about the authors. It was hard to think about one author in the context of another. However, it was very interesting to read so many different historians.",
    "In terms of strengths, I think that the lecture and seminar style is very useful for gaining different perspectives on the material. However, I think the level of one-on-one engagement can be increased, with more detail given to feedback and personal understanding of the material.",
    "This course is very well organized in the context of the DS curriculum. Readings and writing assignments are well spaced and discussions deal with important topics in the subject matter over the course of Western history, from ancient Greece to the early Renaissance. I often felt that discussions were somewhat unfocused, possibly due to the fact that students tended to draw in evidence to the discussion from very disparate parts of the text in question. Discussions could have been more centered and in-depth by focusing on particular passages rather than trying to attack entire texts at once.",
    "The writig component could be made stronger through specific feedback. The class generally lacked stucture which meant that dicusssions and learning suffered. The professor could have also given more specific answers when asked by students. The courses (fall) curriculum cold also be better organized to provide a more coherent experience.",
    "To be honest, I felt like this course was a less-interesting version of my DS philosophy course; we studied many of the same authors, but focused on one subject of their works, political theory. The class was strong, however, in student engagement and the lectures were very interesting. The seminars, though, could go on a bit long and I wish we had done more history and less political thought.",
    "I greatly enjoyed this course. At times I felt like more historical context could be given in class, but that is very situational may be an inherent issue in balancing between history and political thought. I love Directed Studies! I have glimpsed how these texts' ideas have sprung from the books into the world we inhabit today, shaping politics and our worldview for centuries. I became more flexible and critical of my society and political system, viewpoints that I hope to use for constructive and analytical engagement with the former and the latter. Perhaps handouts could be standardized :)",
    "The readings are often long and arduous. I found that on several occasions I unfortunately could not finish them. In that respect the classes were harder to appreciate when I did not finish the readings. But, for the classes that I was fully caught up, I typically got a lot out of them. I also found the lectures to be very engaging and informative. It was insane to have lectures by some of the Yale legends."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Sure. This class all around was average. I would give it a B.",
    "Yes, depending on the student. This is good for anybody who likes reading and writing and wants to get better at these and analysis",
    "This course, like all the Directed Studies courses, is beautifully planned and fits perfectly with the other two courses. The small class size and level of communication with a fabulous professor (as a first-year!) also make it well worth taking. I would recommend this class to any student at Yale! The coursework is fascinating and vital if you're planning on studying the humanities. But even if you're not planning on studying the humanities, the material you will engage with in this class will inform you well in life and in the conversations you'll have with friends and in classes.",
    "It really depends what the other student was looking to get out of it. If his goals were the same as mine, sure.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student, along with the rest of the DS curriculum, of course. My understanding of political theory and the importance of studying history has expanded greatly over the course of this semester, and I believe as many people as possible should become well-versed in the concepts that were covered in this course.",
    "I would recommend that a student take DS if they understand what it entails. I also advice students to choose their professors with care.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because it gave me a wider viewpoint as to how modern statecraft evolved from the polis. I also feel like it will be much more relevant and interesting next semester when we get into renaissance authors and are not just trying to pick out what the philosophers had to say about this particular topic, for example, Machiavelli was very interesting.",
    "Absolutely. A great exposure to the seminal texts of the Western canon!",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course. The readings are very interesting, the essays are challenging but in fun way. The lectures are amazing, and the seminar discussions (so long as you do most, if not all, of the readings) are often very engaging. It may seem like it can be impossible to finish the readings, but I think the best mindset to have going into it is that this course is a survey of these works. You are taking it to get a brief understanding of these author's and their writings, not to have completely memorized or analyzed every single component. That said, read it to the best of your abilities, but don't completely freak out if you can't finish a reading one week. That much is expected. It is more important to learn the major themes, arguments, and characteristics of each author than to memorize every single character name or historical story."
