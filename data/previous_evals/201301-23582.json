    "Jim is strict by fair. He created a good learning environment.",
    "Question 7. I feel like the course could be strengthened by having field trips included, and perhaps having more project assignments with data collected in the field rather than theoretical applications and multiple midterms.Question 1 and 2. I would like to see more of the primary literature play a role in how the class is taught rather than the text book, which is designed for upper-division undergraduates. Perhaps offering a more advanced course in hydrology, and having more applications to systems students are interested in: wetland hydrology, tidal ecosystem, stream restoration, etc. I understand that the basics needs to get covered and the modeling in MatLab helped go beyond that, but I feel the applications could be more advanced and varied.",
    "The instructor was excellent and clearly presented the material, as well as was always available to answer questions.",
    "The course did a good job of introducing us to the fundamentals of hydrology. Overall, I am most satisfied with the teaching quality of the professor and TA, and least with the structure of the assignments and exams. The course may however be most useful to undergraduates and there really ought to be a course for graduate students with knowledge of calculus.",
    "This class was quite challenging but really good. I think it would be helpful for the TA for this class to give a few sessions on differential equations, because they were part of the class but never thoroughly explained, and some of us have different math backgrounds.",

    "Professor was responsive to making sure students learned the material. Having exams peppered throughout the semester made me study more and really learn the material (though I'm concerned about ability to retain the information in the long term given that it is fairly technical\/theoretical). This course was clear and progressed in a cumulative way that made it easier to learn the material.",
    "The video before the final exam. . .",

    "Sometimes the material was breezed through really quickly without context.",
    "More balance between the topics: we seemed to cram a great deal of complex material into the final weeks after having spent a long time covering simpler topics in the beginning of the semester.",
    "I wish we had more homework assignments or more practice problems in general. I think the Matlab questions on the homework were somewhat of a waste of time. I think it would have been better if we did more calculations similar to those on the test.",
    "More field trips and more advanced applications.",
    "Provide more practice problems that are similar to those on the test - even if they're just for practice. Homework 1 was good, in that related clearly to all of the other materials. The homework assignments felt more disjointed as the course went on (though not entire disjointed, but they weren't always great practice for the exam).Furthermore, assess students' abilities at the start of the course and be more supportive of the varying levels of ability. The group in-class project near the beginning of the course was not only good practice, but it provided greater interaction among students that, if further pursued, could have led to valuable partnerships to better understand the material.",
    "I thought the course was great, and cannot think of any improvements. It was well-organized and run very smoothly.",
    "The homework assignments felt disconnected from the lecture, in that some of the methods required for the homework required a series of assumptions that did not come naturally from the lectures.",
