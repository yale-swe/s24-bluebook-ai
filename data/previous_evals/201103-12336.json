    "If the class was at a different time, it would be absolutely great. It gives you a good amount of freedom, but keeps you on track so that you're actually going in some sort of direction. Sometimes it's a bit hard to figure out what you're trying to accomplish in the class, but that is more of a personal situation, generally. The largest considerations regarding taking the class would be would the schedule work for you, and can you handle the expense of what is needed for a painting studio course?"
