    "They could have picked people in the field that only had their MPH. It seems like every speaker had a PHD or was at a high up position.",
    "I found most of the speakers very boring. Some were good. This seminar really should not be every week... Make it once or twice per month and bring in a handful of very dynamic or preeminent speakers.",
    "Dr. Zhu and the entire EHS faculty did a great job in bringing more diverse speakers to this year's seminar series. Last year, the seminars were just focused on people's research within an academic institution. This year, there were actually people working in industry, which I found more practical and helpful. Not every MPH student is doing a doctoral program after this, so it was great to hear about people's careers outside of academia.",
    "informative",
    "It was very necessary for the EHS students to take this seminar to get to know what's going on in the field.",
    "One strength is that the lectures included a variety of different kinds of EHS-related work. I would like to have seen more academic-research work, versus 'what you can do' with an MPH in EHS, but overall I thought the seminar was significantly better than the previous year.",
    "I enjoyed all of the guest lecturers for this seminar although I do think there needs to be a little more variety in terms of the kind work that they do. For example, less individuals who work in genetics and more who work in private industries or for government organizations.",
    "I really appreciated the variety of speakers this semester compared to last year!",
    "A varied and interesting set of perspectives and experiences from seasons public health professionals.GOOD FOOD FOR THOUGHT.ACTUAL FOOD COULD BE MUCH MUCH HEALTHIER."

I really would like to thank him for making this year's seminar a great opportunity for the students to learn more about the wide spectrum of work that we can do with an EHS degree.",

    "I enjoyed this seminar because you got a chance to hear what current research was happening, and you got a taste of what jobs you could possibly do once you graduate.",
