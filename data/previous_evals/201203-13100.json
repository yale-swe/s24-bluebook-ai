   "comments": [
    "The course is essentially a description of Himalayan culture and recent history, seen through weekly films and easy (but interesting) course readings. I would certainly recommend this course, thanks mainly to Professor Turin's great discussion style and the course content.",
    "If you want to know about the Himalayas, particularly Nepal, India and Tibet, this is your class. You get to watch a film, the readings are very interesting and accessible and the discussions are very relaxed and fun.",
    "Take this class. It's a lot fun and covers a range of interesting topics. This is a great class for learning something completely new just for the fun of it.",
    "The class is basically a broad overview of selected subjects concerning the Himalayan region, explored each week through a couple of readings and a film. Class discussions are led by students, and are very open to a wide range of perspectives and reactions. I'm a film major and often focused on the filmic elements of the class, which I felt were always well received by the class and professor.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. The material, however obscure it may sound, is interesting, and you do not need any prior knowledge of the Himalayas. Workload-wise, it's just a reading response per week and a final 10 page paper. You also get 2 free passes with the reading responses, which are really helpful!",
    "This course was phenomenal. I went in knowing very little about the Himalayan region, and honestly was not very excited about the class as I needed it to fill a requirement. However, the region is ridiculously interesting and you come out of the class truly learning a lot, which isn't always the case. The work load isn't bad- weekly reading responses, leading a discussion, participating in section, and a final paper. Professor Turin (who has an incredible breadth of knowledge on the subject matter) is arguably one of the best professors I've ever had at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's a little heavy on the reading, but the professor does his best to make the workload manageable. Best part are the discussions! It tends to be a small seminar class, and if you don't participate, you won't get a lot out of the material.",
    "This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. It may sound strange and unusual, but take it. Mark Turin is an amazing professor and you'll love every minute of the course.",
    "YES! This was a great course! It was interesting and had a manageable workload. You can pick the topics that interest you when you present and write the final paper, so you will always enjoy what you are working on.",
    "Take this class! Professor Turin provides a reasonable workload, many interesting topics, and a great environment for class discussion. I was scared of taking this class at first because I am a Political Science major, and it is a class in Film Studies. I am so happy I took it anyway. I learned so much about the region that was completely different from what I originally thought about the Himalayas, and it turned out to be my favorite class so far at Yale."
