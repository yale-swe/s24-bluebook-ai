   "comments": [
    "Great introductory course to history on Latin@ migrations to the United States. Would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the political, economic, and cultural implications of this social phenomenon.",
    "I would say it is a good introduction to some of the current literature concerning Latino History. I would say it focuses mostly on Mexico, and not South America at all. I would recommend the course to anyone interested in getting a general knowledge of the literature being produced about Central American, Mexican, and Caribbean history.",
    "I would recommend this course because it provides a great introduction to Latin@ history. While the emphasis was on books and assumed a certain pre-existing knowledge, I would encourage a student to take a survey Latin@ history class first, but it would not be necessary.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course, not only for Latino\/a specialists but those interested in transnational, immigration and race history in the 20th century American context. It provides not only a more in depth knowledge of the specific topics tackled but develops skills required by the PhD."

   "comments": [
    "Not only will the long reading list help me in my Latino orals, but reading so many varied books helps me understand the different ways in which Latino scholars approach particular issues. It also helps me think about the different dissertation models.",
    "The course was great to take in my first semester, because it gave me a jumping off point for some of my research. It also provided me examples of really successful research projects. The paper I wrote at the end will definitely stay with me as a theoretical guide through my later research.",
    "Learned more about historical archival work thanks to this class. Interested to continue to have discussions about the relationship between Ethnic Studies and American Studies and its more recent historical convergence. Learned how to lead class more effectively. ENabled me to write about border security, which is helpful for my dissertation."
