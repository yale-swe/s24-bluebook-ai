    "If you are interested in the topic, take the course.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. It gave me a good understanding of human rights law and policy and central debates in the field. I really liked the paper assignments--they are practical, real-world, and interesting to write. The class also gave me a good grounding in polisci methodology. The readings were really manageable and focused, allowing us to discuss them in-depth.",
    "Maybe.It's very easy. Teacher is SO SMART, so just teachers down to us.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone.",
    "Great class--take it even if you know nothign about human rights or are intimidated by the subject! Prof. Zinn makes it so enjoyable!",
    "I don't even know how to summarize the course, since it didn't really have a cohesive structure. Classes are meaningless and the only thing you will learn from are your amicus brief and policy report.",
    "YES. it was a very comprehensive look at the international human rights regime from conception to application to problems and potential solutions. the course's implications and applications are far-reaching. not only is prof. zinn very knowledgeable, a good teacher and nice, but she's also really dedicated to teaching us a set of analytical skills by which to assess human rights. i feel like i've learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend the course on a basic level but it wasn't as fulfilling as I first thought it was going to be, probably because of the combination of people in the course.",
    "If you are at all interested in human rights- even if you are a human rights buff- go ahead and take the course. Professor Zinn has a different teaching style and different ideas about classes- the course is worth it just to be taught by her alone.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. Professor Zinn is wonderful, and if you're interested in critically exploring what \"human rights\" means and how they are implemented, take it. It incorporates political science, philosophy, history, and real world application in a very low pressure and interesting environment. Fairly easy grading, but you actually have a vested interest in what you're doing. The final papers - one was a legal brief and the other was a policy report - are worth the time and energy you put into them.",
    "Yes. The course material is ripe for discussion. The assignments are practical and rewarding. At times the discussions can wander, but if Professor Zinn asserts herself a bit more and reigns in some of the long-winded or preachy students, then the class should be worthwhile.",
    "This is a great class. It comes highly recommended for the student interested in gaining real world skills. If you\u0092re bored with theory classes, this is the class for you; very hands on and practical. The professor is also great. Take it."
