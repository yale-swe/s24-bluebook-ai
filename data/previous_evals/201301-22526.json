    "I would definitely recommend taking CS185. It's definitely not your typical Yale class. Classes are structured in that you have a set of readings you have to do, and Brad has general points that he makes sure are covered in discussions, but classes are pretty fluid. If you think you would enjoy learning outside of a highly structured curriculum, this is a great class to take.",
    "The. Best. Class. Ever.",
    "This is a very different kind of class. It's pretty loosely structured and a lot of fun. However, it is also a fair amount of work. There are a lot of readings, and participation is important (so you have to do them).",
    "You'll read lots of important and interesting cases, the class dynamic is great if you know Brad, and you'll be looking forward to the class every week. Don't take if you like structure, set curriculums, set grading schemes, and hard deadlines.",
    "You must take this class.",
    "Brad Rosen is not your usual professor, and he has some interesting points on privacy. It's a pretty easy credit but still gives you lots of perspective and ideas to chew on.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. THIS IS THE BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE, AND I AM A SENIOR. I could not recommend this class more highly.",
    "If you took 183 and like Brad. take 185. It's more of the same (with Brad's spiel, in his own words, turned to 11), only everyone in the class is interested and participates in the discussion. Probably the two funnest hours of my week this last semester.",
    "It's like 183, but with much more of a sense of community. Most enjoyable class I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "Survey of legal issues related yo technological development and its relation to privacy.",
    "The class atmosphere is a little zany. If you're ok with that, it's fun and interesting.",
    "Summary: Such a fun class - you will actually want to do the readings and make fun\/creative\/witty\/thoughtful reading responses. Brad is so chill and class is kind of like controlled chaos? This is one of the few courses at Yale that has actually changed my perspective of life.I would recommend it to someone who has lots of \"real\" classes and needs something to kind of balance out the semester. Also you learn lots of fun\/interesting\/applicable things about law and technology.",
    "185 is a very interesting and applicable class, and Brad is a very exciting instructor. Just take 183 in the fall to make sure you're compatible with his teaching style.",
    "Best class ever. Take it.",
    "Class be crazy. Professor be crazy. Everybody be crazy.",
    "Amazing class. Our professor, Brad, did an excellent job of guiding us through ideas and leaving room to allow is to form our own opinions. This course definitely changed the way I approach doing anything online."
