   "comments": [
    "If you need a science credit and have some interest in astronomy, definitely take this class! It won't take up too much of your time, and you'll learn a lot of cool stuff.",
    "The material covered in this course is an overview of the basics of astronomy, how stars form and develop, how star systems and planets form, and how the planets in our solar system are similar and different from each other. The material and Dr. Faison's commentary can be quite fascinating. The workload isn't bad (only one problem set a week) and the math involved is pretty basic. Some of the concepts can be a little tough to get your head around. Going to section is optional, but it can be nice to go when they're reviewing for midterms. I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a relatively easy science credit that provides you with a lot of interesting information about the universe that you wouldn't otherwise know.",
    "Astronomy 110 is a fascinating class with interesting subject matter. However, it is a QR so there is a big math proponent. The problem sets are a bit tricky, as are the tests. Just be aware that while people may consider this simply as a way to get rid of a QR, it is actually going to be some work.",
    "Nice way to get a SC credit. I'm an English major who wanted a relaxed science course where I'd actually learn something, and that's exactly what I got. Very fair workload, very fair exams, and outer space is really cool! The professor and TAs are also very friendly and helpful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class--it's a great thing to take for a non-science major if you've already taken Physics, Chem and Bio in high school and you're not going to continue them in the foreseeable future. Might as well learn some other kinds of science, and Astronomy is really fun.",
    "Great course for non-science types. Try to get Faison, because he's really accessible and nice, and a nice lecturer.",
    "This course made me miserable. The P sets take up a lot of time and you won't really get too much help from the professor. It's a good idea to go to the lectures but you never know because sometimes you'll hear tangents about astronomy that nothing to do with the course. You will be expected to use an online forum to ask questions about upcoming exams but all you will ever get in response is more obscure questions instead of the answers you need. This is not a gut so unless you like science and are already good at it take a different course for SC credit.",
    "Planets and Stars is not as \"Gutsy\" as I thought it would be. It felt kind of like taking a freshman seminar all over again. The class was straight forward. Dr. Faison was clear and always fair.",
    "Are there more exciting Sc credits out there? Probably. But this is not a bad one. The term \u0093gut\u0094 gets thrown around too much, so let me just tell you what this is. It\u0092s a basic foundation course in the science behind planets and stars. The math involved is minimal\u0097anyone who\u0092s taken trig can do it. And the tests and problem sets are straightforward, with a very generous curve and lots of extra credit opportunity. Faison is a good lecturer, generally keeps things interesting. And truthfully, you don\u0092t have to do all the assigned reading\u0097about half of it will never appear in lecture or on a test. It was a decent course, good Sc credit.",
    "A good overview of the solar system. I would recommend it.",
    "Do not take this class until you LOVE astronomy.",
    "No real surprises -- it's pretty much as described.",
    "I would recommend it! So many people don't like it, but if you treat it like a real class (important!) it's really not the hard and pretty interesting. Just go to lecture (or read the book- do at least one), take notes, go to section sometimes, and study for the finals. It's really pretty fun. Then you can go impress people about your knowledge of the moon and the sun and everything! If you want a science credit, and you don't mind doing a little work for it, planets and stars is really good.",
    "Weekly problem set, 2 tests, 1 final.",
    "Michael Faison is a funny guy and is good at putting complex astronomical concepts into terms that aren't too hard to understand. Weekly problem set, two in-class exams and a final exam. While the problem sets were fairly easy (though sometimes they took a long time), the exams were not. It's definitely not a gut -- for humanities-inclined students, there probably are better courses with which to fulfill the QR or Sc requirement.",
    "I took Planets& Stars because I wanted a QR, but I didn't want a silly class. (Perhaps you might think that astronomy isn't particularly useful, but now I can navigate by the stars and hold lively conversations about the nature of the universe!) Planets& Stars was definitely very interesting, but sometimes I did find it a bit conceptually difficult. This was not the Professor's fault\u0097Professor Faison is a good, clear, and enthusiastic lecturer. But the universe is a complicated place, and planetary motion is difficult to wrap your mind around. So if you want an easy QR, perhaps look somewhere else. However, Planets& Stars is not too difficult, either. Section is very helpful for problem sets, the exams aren't very hard, and you will definitely learn something which you can use to liven your dinner time discussion\/ use when you're lost in the forest without a compass.",
    "Take it, especially if you're looking to fulfill a QR requirement.",
    "I would recommend it if they were looking for an interesting and doable science course.",
    "I would not recommend it ,but the class was just not for me.",
    "Take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who have an interest in astronomy but who are not majoring in science and need to fulfill the distributional requirement.",
    "The lectures are basically a summary of the text book chapters. At the beginning of the semester, the class seemed very easy, but once I took it for granted, the psets and second mid term became harder for me. I also had a hard time staying focused in lecture.",
    "This class is just not that great. The stated goal of the course on the first day was \"How do we measure distances in space?\" which is just a boring goal. If you think space is cool you'll probably take this class anyways, but you really shouldn't waste a Yale course on it. Also, it's not that easy - it's curved to a B.",
    "Michael Faison is a great professor; however, the class material is somewhat dull. The lectures just review what's covered in the book [in addition to a bit of supplementary material]. Take it for a Sc\/Qr credit.",
    "yes. i'd recommend it. if you are looking for an easy science credit, know that this class isn't EASY, but it is very manageable, and it is not math heavy. you just read an online textbook, do weekly psets, and then have 2 midterms and a final exam (comprehensive). it isn't an amazing class, but hey, it's intro astronomy.",
    "It is a fun and moderately challenging introduction to the interesting subject of astronomy. Very much for non-science majors, but certainly not a \"gag\" course. Equal parts conceptual and QR-skills based.",
    "A good introduction to astronomy. The professor is excellent and makes class exciting. I recommend this class if you are looking for an interesting, but not too difficult science credit."
