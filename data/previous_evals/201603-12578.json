    "I learned a decent amount about the general principles of pathology, such as inflammation and the body's response to disease. I also feel like I got to meet several faculty that I would not have otherwise encountered.",

    "I learned a foundational level of knowledge in an array of disease conditions, with varying levels of specificity depending on the instructor.",
    "The skill to analyze the mechanism of a disease.",
    "Can't say I took away much relevant knowledge due to the diversity of the class. Did develop some ability at working with the literature to write scientific responses.",

   "comments": [
    "I strongly disliked this course. There was no organization to the lectures whatsoever, and there were lectures where the information was flat out wrong. Many of the lecturers were underwhelming. Many times it didn't feel like it was rooted in the molecular mechanisms of the disease, but was just a lecture about the professor's research or about the gross pathology of the disease, which was not what I anticipated from the title of the course The only time I felt like I was learning anything was when I took the exams or did the discussion questions, and even then, it was just enough to get the answers. I would have liked the course to have organized sections - we started with inflammation, we should talk about inflammatory disease such as IBD. Then we could do neuropathology with Alzheimer's and addiction, etc. Then metabolic with atherosclerosis and diabetes, etc. The way it was set up felt like a bunch of lectures with no cohesiveness and no flow. There was no feedback on exams without requesting it, which is not conducive to learning.",
    "The course highlighted the details of certain diseases, but often failed to provide big picture ideas. The exams were a really great method to better understand certain diseases and did a lot to strengthen my understanding.",
    "The strengths of this course are that the material covered was generally interesting. The weaknesses of this course are that there is no continuity whatsoever, the radically different teaching styles of lecturers are difficult to follow, there is no obligation for students to pay attention during lectures because the assessments require outside reading into the primary literature, and as a corollary these assessments are essentially useless in regard to the class. In addition there was no feedback provided for these assessments, further making them feel like busy work. This course could be improved by grouping related topics together, for instance having inflammatory bowel disease, atherosclerosis and septic shock lectures at the same time, or all of the different cancer lectures together. This would allow for more comprehensive learning of the topic and a sense of continuity in the class. Then the assessments would also more closely parallel the lectures. For the final paper, I think the students should be permitted to choose their own topics, subject to instructor approval. Writing a dense paper on a topic you have little interest in is nothing more than busy work, while this alternative would lead to more thoughtful responses as the topic is inherently of interest to the student.",
    "The arrangement is good however the topics are not that structured.",
    "Organization and communication was lacking and lead to a lot of confusion on all parties, including the guest lecturers who were not sure how to approach their presentations. Also, it is hard to really remember much of the material since it is only revisted once, so I would suggest making the take home exams more like weekly homework of one topic that require references and then the 2 midterm discussions with the TAs so that we need to look at the material more than once.",
    "A good variety of topics were discussed; however, a more thorough discussion of particularly important topics was lacking."

    "I would not recommend this course for the reasons outlined above.",

    "No, I would not recommend this course to another student because it was generally not worth the time commitment. It is in the middle of the day, thus disrupting a normal work schedule, the lectures have no bearing on the grade you receive in the course, the organization is extremely haphazard, and no feedback is given on assignments.",
    "The workload is OK and there are lots of interesting topics.",
    "No. I feel like this class generated more confusion than it was helpful."
