    "Question 9- This course had a many exercises that took place outside of normal class hours. I learned a great deal from these exercises, and nearly all of them ran very smoothly.",
    "The course was good for what it was - an introductory course in environmental design. That said, I think it was (far) below the graduate level and should be made much more challenging if it is to be kept a part of the FES curriculum. I took an enviro design course in undergrad and we actually read many of the texts referenced (cradle to cradle, biomimicry, etc.). I guess this was more of a \"survey\" course but I feel like I didn't get much out of it, unfortunately. I took it to fill an MEM distribution requirement. That said, the professor was very good at explaining the material, and was clearly invested in the class and his students. I know that he knows much more detailed info about the subject matter - I wish we'd gotten to tap into that!"

    "The group work was an essential component of the course. Designers usually work in groups, so the class reflected industry practices in this manner. I enjoyed working with my group, and it's difficult to imagine the course without that dynamic.",
    "Fun! Great group led to creative brainstorming and creative teamwork that enhanced the experience.",
    "For the in-class group work, I did find some assigned group members to be rather abrasive and difficult to work with (it was particularly frustrating to have most of the hands-on part of the disassembly exercise be done by one male). However, the voluntarily selected group for the semester design project provided a wonderful experience. We complemented each other very well and by scheduling weekly meetings and check-ins were able to complete the coursework efficiently and on-time."
