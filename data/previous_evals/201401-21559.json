    "Highly recommend for EP&E majors. This is what you signed up for!",
    "Good luck trying to figure out what he wants you to argue in the essays.",
    "This is a great class if you are interested in these topics and was a survey of them but be prepared to not learn about any in too much depth. The readings are really good, and the papers are the best - basically you get to write about whatever part of the reading strikes you as most interesting, and then you can literally write whatever you want. Also having a class with five short papers (2-3 pages) that you can write whenever you want can really help make your semester less stressful!",
    "Sure. You get to talk about a number of issues in a counterintuitive but really interesting way. Swenson's chill but not that great at leading seminar.",
    "A great course.",
    "I would if you are interested on the economic incentives that interest groups have to influence certain policies in the US and to understand where does it come from.",
    "If you're interested in the politics of money and industry, then take this class. The readings are all pretty solid, though the seminar discussion is lacking. You won't learn much if you're not going to do the reading (it's about 80-200 pgs\/wk). The workload is super light--just 5 response papers that are 3 pages each. No final paper!"
