   "comments": [
    "I absolutely do recommend this class, with the caveat that having some experience with London or European cities generally is a good idea. Almost everyone did my year. That said, the few who didn't were't at a loss, and the course was so relaxed that it barely mattered anyway. This class ended up feeling more like a conversation with friends than a seminar, probably due to the professor's very hands-off style. A great history seminar, much more lighthearted than any other I've had.",
    "Very chill history seminar. I would recommend it to people interested in British culture or urban history",
    "The perfect balance between learning and teaching. I think I learned so much from hearing my peer's presentations and from conducting my own. In addition, the paper is a topic of our choice making the research so interesting and the access to the British Library is incredible. This course is a yale gem.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially to sophomores looking to experience a Junior History Seminar for the first time. It is a nice introduction to the format!",
    "Very discussion based. The readings are great, but heavy. But it'll bring up new aspects of London (and any city) for you to think about and connect to each other. Fantastic history course."
