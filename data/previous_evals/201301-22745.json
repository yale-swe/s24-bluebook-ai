    "Very good class, but I'm not raving about it. Lots of reading, most but not all of which is fun. Lots of secondary reading as well (it's not all Harry Potter and Dr. Seuss...). Sometimes I didn't feel like I was getting much out of the class, but looking back, I'm glad I took it. Definitely a fun experience, even if some nights I was staying up late doing reading. Papers are tough... Criterion for creative assignments were unclear. Very nice professor, very knowledgeable. Had some rigid interpretations of works and \"what kids would like\" that I didn't quite agree with or understand. I took it for the junior Engl seminar requirement -- definitely less work than other seminars. Class is mostly non-Engl majors.",
    "Awesome course- take it! But beware, there's a lot of reading and Prof. Stepto leads discussions with a certain conclusion in mind. Once you figure out what it is you're golden.",
    "The class did have quite a bit of reading, and the discussion was strong, but it seemed to falter a bit in drawing conclusions based on the trends we discussed. I also felt, given the amount of creative work we did, perhaps the class should have workshopped these creative pieces--I would have gotten something more out of it.",
    "I would recommend this class to any upperclassmen who likes children, literature or both! His class was wonderful for future writers, teachers, actorsand even parents. There was not a week that I did not enjoy! The creative projects were the most fun because everyone engaged with the material differently. We saw creative writing, art, dramatic work, etc.",
    "Yes! It is kind of difficult but it is a lot of fun!"
