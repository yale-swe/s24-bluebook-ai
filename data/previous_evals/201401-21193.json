   "comments": [
    "Interesting course that makes you think. The class is very much a textual exploration of topics related to urbanism. You read a wide variety of pieces (but the reading load per week is very manageable). Prof Reisz is a dynamic seminar leader and discussions were always enjoyable.",
    "You read about cities and ppl in all sorts of ways!",
    "Definitely! Learn about how the city feeds human life (or doesn't)",
    "This is a unique class that focuses on writing about cities. Though we read some background on architectural approaches, it is not primarily \"about\" architecture. You read journalism, travelogues, project proposals, architectural criticism, pop economics, and art manifestos. The syllabus says, \"Assigned reading will perform less as references to particular cities and more as evidence for critically analyzing how cities are understood.\" That is, the class is not ABOUT cities, it's about HOW things are about cities. So if you want to, for instance, debate the economics of urban development, this may not be the ideal class for you. If you want to pick apart written narratives on the economics of urban development, this may be the ideal class for you. I found the class fascinating if occasionally disjointed. It's designed, I think, to open architecture students' minds up to non-architectural or quasi-architectural approaches to the reality with which architects work, but it's also effective in introducing writers and social science students to various ways in which people package technocratic issues together with personal experience. It's a survey or the border between humanities and social science. The course requires weekly reading responses of one page each. You put together a compiled reader of sources for your final paper as a midterm project. The final paper is a piece of writing about a chosen city that draws on the approaches the class has studied. Todd (not William) Reisz is a lot of fun to have as a professor. Discussion was lively in our seminar.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to others. You get exposed to a great reading list and really get to think critically about how we view cities. You also get exposed to different ways of writing about cities and what that means for what we expect from cities. I was especially fond of the fact that we studied different cities around the world, and not just North America, which tends to be a focus in other architecture classes. The class definitely raises more questions than providing answers but that is a great way of questioning some of the things we take for granted when we think about cities.",
    "No--even though it seems interesting and is a good overview of cities and the reading is interesting, class with Todd can be a letdown--perhaps this also depends on the classmates. I'd find a different writing course.",
    "Prof. Reisz has a tendency to talk a lot and ask leading questions with a specific response in mind, so discussion can be difficult. Readings are generally interested, but discussion can be a bit painful because there sometimes isn't much to say. While there's a lot of flexibility on the final paper, Prof. Reisz expects that you'll ultimately be critical of cities in some way, which can be frustrating.",
    "The benevolent city is an interesting course mostly focused on writing about cities. The reading list is fantastic and professor reisz leads a seminar well. Be warned the city reader project is a significant amount of work but can be very rewarding.",
    "Take it. Todd is by far one of the best professors I've had. He thinks carefully about every class and truly cares about each student. The issues discussed are relevant to any major and will give you a new perspective on the world.",
    "A class that focuses on writing\/reading about cities. Great introduction to thinking about urban planning and seeing cities\/society in a whole new way. Would recommend for those who have little exposure to these topics."
