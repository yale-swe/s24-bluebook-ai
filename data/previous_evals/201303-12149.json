    "A great reading list and a great professor. Worth it for the material! I like the pace of the work. I think the three papers are a good amount of work and a good basis for discussion. The books chosen showed a good range of approaches to the study of agrarian history, which I really appreciated.",

    "It showed me many different ways of approaching the materials, which I thought was the greatest strength.",
    "Given the centrality of agro-environmental issues for life, historians obviously ignore these issues at their own peril. In this regard the course drew out and highlighted important areas of overlap and connection between agrarian history and other fields."
