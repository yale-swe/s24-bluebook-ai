   "comments": [
    "Overall, it's an okay class. There's nothing especially good or bad about it. There iss a lot of reading though.",
    "I would recommend it given that you would like some free time in a busy schedule and would like a class where you are learning things but you don't actually have to attend the lectures. Good for self-motivated and disciplined people.",
    "I'd recommend it. Boring at times, but overall interesting anf",
    "This course teaches behavioral and institutional principles that are not just theoretical but those principles are easily transferred to improve your business and professional life. I would recommend other students to take this course to add to their personal development among other things.",
    "ECON 527 is a good course for those interested in general behavioral economics topics and how those theories can be applied to current economic situations. Students discover behaviorally-base answers to questions on economic inequality, savings rates, etc. I would recommend this class to students interested in discovering behavioral economic theories.",
    "It is very little work and somewhat interesting. But, I still would not recommend it because Shiller is just too hard to follow, so you will learn very little useful material.",
    "If you want to learn a lot about macroeconomics with a behavioral twist, then go for it.",
    "Great introductory course to Behavioral Economics with intriguing reading material. Definitely recommended",
    "He collates the important information for a course in this field and examines you on them which is interesting. You will only really learn on this course from your own independent research and reading, and how you prepare for the examinations. You will not learn much from the instructor and certainly nothing from the TFs.",
    "Really interesting",
    "The course is interesting for students who would like to develop a good understanding of what the field of behavioral and institutional economics is about. It covers a wide range of topics and has an excellent selection of reading assignments.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any student interested in a general overview of behavioral economics.",
    "I would not recommend it. One is better off reading the books than by attend the class.",
    "I would recommend the course because the material and reading list were absolutely fascinating. Taking a class with Prof. Schiller is also a treat.",
    "The most helpful element of the course was the readings. If a student is disciplined enough to read the books on his\/her own, the course does not offer much more.",
    "I really enjoyed the class and how you learn a little bit about a lot of topics.",
    "More economics that I expected. The course is largely about how the study of economics does completely explain economic trends."

   "comments": [
    "It was more geared towards institutional economics rather than behavioral, which I would've wanted more of.",
    "Definitely covered some different and new concepts in economics, which expanded the field of economics for me and could definitely contribute to thinking about what to research for a possible disstertation.",
    "This course allowed me to see how economics intersect with other disciplines and certainly provides a platform for interdisciplinary research.",
    "The course brought all the relevant material to my attention and tested me on this, however, all of the understanding i gained was through my own work and not through the lectures attended.",
    "The course provided a comprehensive overview of the field of behavioral and institutional economics and triggered ideas for further research.",
    "This course was not required for my discipline but I felt the topic would provide me valuable information that would help me better understand the world around me, which it did.",
    "Behavioral economics is going to be an important part of my dissertation work, so it was very important that I take this course. Especially prospect theory and information cascades.",
    "I found the readings really helpful for deepening my knowledge. The lectures, however, didn't."
