    "I would recommend it to someone working in OCT or interferometry. It was a bit too specific to be very relevant to even those working in fluorescent microscopy, but expanding some of the topic materials to microscopy in general would broaden the appeal of the course.",
    "An interesting course that goes into the specifics of optical coherence tomography.",
    "Great class. It has a heavy emphasis on optical coherence tomography and a little on confocal microscopy. Selected topics in optics were covered as they relate to these imaging techniques (e.g., geometric optics, coherence, speckle statistics, spectrometers,...)",
    "A comprehesive overview to optical imaging."
