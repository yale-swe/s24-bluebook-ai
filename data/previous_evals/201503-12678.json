   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend it to another student on account of how boring it is. However, the structure of one reading response per week plus a final paper is very manageable.",
    "Overall, the class is really good. The discussions are interesting, the readings are great and the professor is one of the best at Yale. The readings can be long (just skim most of them) and the work is extremely manageable (weekly 1-page readings responses and a final paper). This class is perfect for those with little background on European politics as well as those with a lot of background.",
    "I dreaded attending this seminar every week. Do not take this course if you're looking for an overview of European politics, political history, or institutions while developing a theoretical framework to approaching these areas of study - you will end up painfully bored. Pedagogically, this was a disappointing course because there is very little teaching happening. In a nutshell, here's what happens every week: you read a book, you scribble out a reading response with no theoretical backbone, you attend seminar and listen to students debate their opinions about the book for two hours (many of them have only given the book a cursory glance, yet have award-winning opinions to share). This would probably be a great course for a student with a robust background studying European history, politics, and institutions who merely wants to sit around and showcase their argumentative skills on topics they are an \"expert\" on. If you want a course in European politics at Yale look into Cameron's lecture course on the European Union - that may be better. He's wonderful and it's unfortunate that in this course not enough time was dedicated to listening to what he has to say.",
    "Great seminar that covers topics from various types of democracies in Europe, Eurosceptisism, to transition from communism and Islam in Europe. Would definitely recommend it. Meets only once a week but it also is a lot of reading and weekly comments."
