    "I gained understanding and awareness of a country and culture I knew almost nothing about, which was incredibly valuable. I also learned how to skim a large amount of reading.",
    "Very in-depth knowledge about the geopolitics behind the creation of modern Iran, and the functions of the regime today.",
    "I learned about the history of Iran and about European imperialism in the region.",
    "Knowledge about the Topic: -enlightening discourse on an objective history of Iran (as objective as one can get) -engaging selection of readings that provided, what felt like, a very comprehensive presentation of Iranian history from the Safavid period up until the present. Academic Skills gained: -exposure to excellent resources in the library's at Yale for future research -skills in reading more efficiently"

   "comments": [
    "The subject matter covered in this course is fascinating, but the lectures are pretty dry and there is way too much reading per week (some weeks more than 300 pages). Since there is so much reading, section is often a drag because people have done different parts of the readings. I would recommend trimming down the amount of reading.",
    "The material covered was really interesting, but the amount of reading was remarkable. Most weeks, there was a couple hundred pages of dense reading and primary sources.",
    "This subject matter for this course was fascinating and I felt that I learned a great deal from it, yet I also struggled with the excessive workload and the inaccessibility of the lectures. The amount of reading for this course was much higher than any other class I have taken, but little of it applied to the exams or papers, even though we were expected to have read all of it come section. In addition, professor Amanat's lectures felt hard to access without any powerpoints and little student participation, which would have been understandable had it been a large lecture, but there were less than twenty students in the class. Some level of student-teacher engagement would have been appreciated and would have definitely made the class much more enjoyable. Overall, however, it definitely sparked an interest in Iranian affairs and I would be interested in taking more classes on the country in the future.",
    "The course is a very traditional history lecture, which was nice. I sometimes had a hard time staying awake, but thats a personal problem. Professor Amanat is a great scholar and his lectures were interesting. He sometimes went on really long tangents and didnt finish his outline, which meant I had to teach myself a bit from Wikipedia and the readings. The main weakness was that there was just an absurd amount of reading. No one did close to all of it, which sometimes made section a little awkward.",
    "Strengths: Professor Amanat knows has a wealth of knowledge and basically tells a story during classes. We should also do more events like the Maziar Bahari talk. Weakness: It would be nice to have access to slides and perhaps more organized lecture notes.",
    "Strengths: This course has so much interesting content and is well-organized to go over its themes. Professor Amanat is clearly very knowledgeable and his ability to answer questions was unparalleled. Weaknesses: Simply put, there is too much to this course for it to be a lecture course worth a single credit. There is no reason that this course needs two 75-minutes lectures a week and a 50-minute section. The workload was bad but not awful. I think this class would be much better converted to a seminar.",
    "The course was thorough while also covering a large array of information over a vast time period. No recommendations for improvement."

   "comments": [
    "The history covered in this course is fascinating, but there is entirely too much reading assigned per week (sometimes more than 300 pages). As a result, section is a drag and people have done different segments of the reading. The lectures are also often pretty dry. The class would be better as a 50 min lecture!",
    "I would recommend this course if youre good at staying awake during long and kind of slow lectures and if youre good at skimming large amounts of reading. You probably dont know a whole lot about Iran, and its an interesting country. There is not a whole lot of work, besides the readings (a 4-page film review, a traditional midterm exam, and a 7 8 page final paper), so its not going to take a huge amount of time.",
    "Professor Amanat is very warm, approachable, and knowledgeable. He is a superstar in his field and his class is a must for anyone interested in Middle Eastern history.",
    "Good class to really get to know Iran. A big commitment (two long lectures and a section a week) along with a lot of smaller assignments. Don't take unless you're really interested in the content.",
    "Yes. I have been recommending this course to everyone since I first started attending the class."
