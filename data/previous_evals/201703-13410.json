    "This course provided a great methodological introduction to book history.",

    "I truly appreciated the thoughtful way in which the course wove together practical skills with theoretical learning. I feel that my ability to engage with objects meaningfully has been substantially increased; simultaneously, I have a much greater grasp of book history\/historiography."

   "comments": [
    "It was concisely focused on its topic, readings were appropriate, and there was a field trip!",
    "The course allowed us to address different book history questions by creating environments where we made the most of the Beineckes rich collection. In my view one of the courses major strengths was that careful planning on the part of the instructor resulted in a clear, logical narrative that allowed us to accrue skills and knowledge over the semester. Engagement with other instructors and experts was also valuable, as was the opportunity to use the travelling scriptorium and visit with a modern-day craftsman. The course could perhaps think of blocking two hours, rather than an hour and fifty minutes, to help incorporate the very valuable palaeography practice."

    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student, as a means to expand their capacities to deal with objects, to delve into book history as a practice more generally, and to work on a final project that is truly focused and could provide avenues for future study and work."
