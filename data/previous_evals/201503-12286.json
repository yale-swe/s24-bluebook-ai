    "A wonderful class! Theresa is a total sweetheart and obviously really cares about the material and cares about teaching students what they really want\/need to know. It's pretty low pressure (just 2 papers and a presentation) and you get to handle a lot of cool artworks\/materials. Take it, don't stress, enjoy.",
    "What a gem of a class. If you love art, take it! You will learn so much about conservation, which is a whole nother side of the art world that I knew nothing about prior. I learned so much new terminology and different techniques for how to treat a painting, and it was a very informative class. Professor Fairbanks is extremely generous and kind, not to mention very knowledgeable in her field. She always had fun hands-on projects for us to do, such as making paper or practicing painting with egg tempura. We also went on several field trips which were really fun, such as to the West Campus conservation lab, and to a Rembrandt exhibit in New York. The workload was very manageable, with two short papers and a presentation. Overall a wonderful class!",
    "This course is unlike anything else you will likely take at Yale, and it is an incredible experience. It is not necessarily for art history majors, although those within art-related fields certainly benefit immensely. It is a manageable workload and in fact the two papers force students to consider fascinating topics. It's a highly hands-on, very varied approach to understanding the creation and care of many kinds of art, and every class offered an exciting new experience with an absolutely wonderful professor whose generosity and intelligence are so special. If you are lucky enough to secure a spot in this course, do not for one second hesitate to take it.",
    "Loved the class! Certainly one of the best learning-for-learning's-sake experiences I've had at Yale. It was incredibly interesting, and I absolutely look at works of art in a completely different way now - I had never taken a technical analysis class before, and this was a great one to experience.",
    "Great class! Very hands-on, all about technique and materials. It helped me to see art not just as an idea represented or an image, but also as objects with history and condition. Wonderful!!",
    "You learn about close looking and things you never previously thought of about a piece of art. From the details of how a paper was made to how a work should be handled, every class you get to deal hands on with real problems in art\/art history.",
    "This class was interesting in that it showed us a little bit of the otherwise hidden world of conservation, but it was not an especially fulfilling academic experience. Class was often disorganized, with each session covering something totally different.",
    "If you're willing to endure two straight hours of unplanned, stream-of-consciousness lectures every week, but only write a 3-page final paper and give a 5-minute presentation over the whole semester, then this is the class for you. TFH is very understanding and generous, although sometimes seems clueless, and the papers are actually pretty interesting to write.",
    "Observation and Analysis was great. I've never seen a teacher dedicate as much time and love to a class as Professor Fairbanks-Harris. I am an economics major and never really thought I'd take a history of art class, but Observation and Analysis opened my eyes to a whole new world."
