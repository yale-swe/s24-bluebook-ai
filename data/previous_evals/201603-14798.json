    "In section, we participated in conversations unlike any I have had--open, generous, and passionate conversation about literature. I was lucky enough to be in a section with elder and very creative readers--and an outstandingly sensitive and articulate professor, and I learned most from them. I felt my reading skills and my ability to talk about challenging literary topics improve greatly.",
    "I developed a great understanding of how to frame a piece of writing - be it a critical analysis essay for an educated audience or a piece of creative writing. Learning by discussing popular books and novels helped me gain the perspective of how character voices, their use of language, and the setting of the book relate to the literary devices used by authors. The devices being repetition, juxtaposition of low and high registers, 'camera placement and movement', free indirect speech etc. The art of building a narrative, forcing an interplay between the fabula and sjuzhet, became clearer to me by listening to the various perspectives that the professors and fellow students shared."

   "comments": [
    "Strength: fantastic personnel and engaging and diverse curriculum. Weakness: The electricity of section was often grounded in lecture.",
    "The syllabus of the course is very good with a few exceptions, but the format (part lecture part seminar) was confusing. I would have liked to see more diversity of lectures -- it was a team-taught course, but David Quint delivered most of the lectures. The course seems to have been designed with freshman in mind -- many short writing assignments, 4-5 page close reading papers, very little theory -- but almost everyone taking it was an upperclassmen in the literature major who could have handled more advanced course work.",
    "Strengths - allows for free exchange of ideas and perspectives. Prof. Figlerowicz incorporated the feedback given to her at mid-term really well in the second half of the course. Knowing the intent behind making us discuss the works we discussed was crucial in furthering my understanding of the art Weaknesses - although Prof. had worked on this piece of feedback as well, but I would appreciate more push-back from the Prof. so that students can clearly delineate right from wrong. One last piece of feedback would be to include some time during class to discuss expectations from each upcoming assignment so that the professors and the students are on the same page in that regard."

   "comments": [
    "Of course--narrative is a crucial notion in all academic discourses, and this course, while wide in breadth, is very focused on narrative as not only a literary tool, but as an epistemological conundrum that affects every person. This should be a more standardized course at Yale.",
    "This is a great course that will give you the building blocks and a framework to help hone your authorship skills."
