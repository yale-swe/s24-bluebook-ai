   "comments": [
    "By far, this is one of the best classes that I have taken at Yale, and I highly recommend taking this class. Professor Kavanagh is super helpful and knowledgeable, our discussions are always engaging, and the wide range of topics(from art to political science to literature) provide a very well-rounded view of the French Enlightenment.",
    "If you really have a passion for French enlightenment thought, or if you are politically\/philosophically minded, then go for it. I don't fall into those categories, but I thought I would try something new. I did learn a lot and it was different from what I have ever taken.",
    "Take it. It's a really interesting look into what social transitions preceded the French Revolution and the readings are very engaging. Professor Kavanagh does a great job at leading discussions and honing in on important issues in the texts. He's also a fast grader.",
    "I would suggest it if students are passionate about the material, don't come in knowing nothing about the subject.",
    "This seminar takes a look at the enlightenment and eventually the start of the French revolution through literary and philosophical works of the time. I had no background in this subject, but ended up realizing I had read a lot of the most famous works of this time just for this class. I loved the class, there was great discussion, great literature, and great topic. This is a discussion heavy class, not an objective, textbook approach to history. The work load isn't ridiculous, there is a lot of reading but not all of it is always necessary. Take it!",
    "Yes I would recommend it if they have an interest in this area.",
    "I have mixed feelings about this class. The reading list was fantastic, and I loved essentially everything that we read for the class. However, while Kavanagh seemed nice, I also found him a bit stubborn in his ideas. And though the class was interesting in that it drew upon a wide variety of disciplines (literature, philosophy, film, art), I thought that none of them were given particular justice in that Kavanagh was not a specialist in any of them.",
    "I wish that the professor would teach us more by talking to us instead of trying to prompt an answer out of us. It made conversation a little bit dull. The syllabus was very balanced, however. I liked the depth with which we learned about the era, even though the syllabus was a survey and we didn't go too deeply into each text."
