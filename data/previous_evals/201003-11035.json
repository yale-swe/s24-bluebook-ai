    "yes, if they were looking for a course that taught you a lot about a lot of different viruses i would say go for it",
    "I would describe it as a well organized walk through the world of viruses at the molecular level, and would recommend it to other students.",
    "a lecture-based overview of major virus families",
    "A survey of relevant DNA and RNA viruses, with particular emphasis on medicinal relevance.Yes, would recommend. No reason not to. It feels like a seminar, which is nice. There is a decent amount of material covered.",
    "Microbiology 734 gives a general overview of virus several virus families, highlighting replication strategies and special characteristics of certain viruses. I would recommend the class to another student who is interested in virology since it gives a good introduction to many viruses."

    "it was a great course for me, i haven't taken virology before and i work on HIV proteins so this class gave me great background information",
