   "comments": [
    "Public Health, both as a whole and in the specific context of India, is a really interesting topic; I didn't know much at all going into this course, and I definitely feel like I got some very valuable lessons out of it, so for that I am grateful. Vani is a really wonderful woman who is always willing to meet with her students outside of class for extra help or advice; if you take this class, I HIGHLY recommend that you meet with her at least once or twice...This is because her instructions for papers (your only two real assignments in this class are twolong papers) aren't always clear enough, but if you meet with her to throw around ideas or to go over your drafts, she is always really really helpful and your work will improve tremendously. The class utilizes lots of documentaries and guest speakers, all of which\/whom are really interesting and enlightening as to India's dire public health situation. The class also assigns A LOT of reading, but by no means do you have to do it all. Overall, I definitely think that public health and the health crises in developing countries is something everyone should learn about, so if you're even remotely interested in public health, international development, southeast asian studies, or anything else that may relate to this course, definitely consider taking it.",
    "It is an overview of health in India from a sociological perspective, but you also learn a lot about public health in general and comparative health issues around the world. You learn a lot about the structure of the public health system in India, its strengths and failings, and about inequalities in health indicators. The format is a mixture of lecture, discussion and documentaries. Workload is two big papers (one spread out over the semester and one at the end), weekly readings and almost weekly reading responses. I enjoyed the class, learned a lot from it, found it very applicable and would recommend it to anyone interested in public health (even if not in the Indian context).",
    "This is a sociology course and Professor Kulkarni makes it a point to address this issue at the beginning of the class. This course is interesting from a sociological perspective. Don't expect it to be about public health issues and the solutions to these issues. The lectures can get a little mundane. However, the second half of the class mainly focuses on discussions which can be engaging and interesting.There are only 2 papers for the course where you can really experiment and put your interests to work.",
    "Take this class if you are at all interested in Public Health. It is not extremely stressful, but you do get a lot out of the class. I even found the final paper interesting to write. But, be warned: the public health situation in India is really bad, so prepare to often leave the class depressed.",
    "This was a pretty good class. It was a little boring at time but Professor Kularni really cares about the subject matter and her students. Take it, its not too tough.",
    "Great course. Learn a lot, with a overbearing amount of work. Class is set up in a good way with a incredibly nice professor."
