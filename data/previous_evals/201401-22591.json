    "Yes, of course--I definitely feel like I know about 100 times more about 19th century French lit than before. Also, the class is set up to help you write a decent seminar paper (which is all about generating ideas for a seminar paper), and I appreciated that very much",
    "We covered French literary works spanning the 19th century and discussed them in relation to the broader theme of modernity. I would recommend the course. It helped me view the literature I want to study in the larger context of changes occurring in France though the 19th century (other than political revolutions, which has tended to be most of the context I've been given in the past)."

   "comments": [
    "Good intro to an entire body of literature that I should know way more about. Definitely an essential skill also to be able to generously reproduce the arguments of critical texts--which we practiced every week. Also, working on 20th century novels, essential to know Balzac, Flaubert, and Zola. In that way, I will definitely be able to use this course in the future",
    "See answer to Question 1 above.",
    "I hope to focus on 19th-century French literature, so there was really no element of this course which was not relevant for me. I do not know how it will help me specifically, but it certainly deepened my knowledge of the period and literature I want to study in a very helpful way."
