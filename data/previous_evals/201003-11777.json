   "comments": [
    "I would recommend taking it with prof. Cividanes. Great class.",
    "I would definitely recommend that if you take L4, you take it with Cividanes. She's really nice and I really feel like she helped my Spanish proficiency a lot. I tested into L4 as a freshman, but if you are coming from L3, be prepared for this class to be extremely similar - I've heard that L3 and L4 are essentially the same thing, with L4 just maybe having a bit of a higher standard. However, I generally enjoyed this class and if you want to become fluent at Spanish, it's definitely going to help a lot.",
    "Spanish 140 was my favorite class of the semester, despite the fact that it meets everyday and I am not a Spanish major. I credit Prof. Cividanes with a lot of why I enjoyed the class so much, but I felt the variety of material in the class, from the textbook to the novel, was an improvement over SPAN 130.",
    "I would recommend it. It fulfills the requirement, is really not very difficult, and is a good opportunity to improve. I feel as though I write and speak better. A lot of ideas that I was not so clear on have been cleared up thanks to this class.",
    "Spanish 140 is a good class. If you like Spanish but aren't ready for L5, this a great preparation. The class is fair and pretty easy.This class is uncharacteristically easy during shopping period, so realize that it will get harder as the year goes on, but it is still not that difficult. The spanish department at Yale is the best, literally, in the world, so all of the professors are amazing.Nothing bad to say about the course.",
    "Allow me to preface this evaluation by stating that I cannot evaluate this course from the perspective of a student who genuinely wants to learn Spanish. I sort-of want to learn Spanish, but I had to take this course to meet the distributional requirements. If this describes you too, then take this course with professor Cividanes! She seemed to be an easy grader (I received higher grades than in my last two Spanish classes without particularly trying to work harder). She can also speak English well (to such an extent that I am not certain whether it is her first language); this allows a student to easily and clearly discuss important administrative matters in English. Additionally, instead of trying and failing to describe Spanish words using other Spanish words, Professor Cividanes could just say the corresponding English word!",
    "An overview of advanced Spanish grammar, more vocabulary, and lots of stories and movies to improve comprehension. We read a short novel at the end, which I found very satisfying. There is work every day but it never feels excessive and is always useful. Definitely take this course if you want to improve all aspects of your Spanish and take a fairly easy and fun credit.",
    "I took it to fulfill the language requirement. If you walk to actually pick up a language, take Spanish; we have the best department in the country. I might have chosen an easier option in retrospect.",
    "Yes, it is an excellent follow up to L3, and a good pre-cursor to any course you're going to take in the L5 pool.",
    "If you're going to take Spanish 140 with anyone, take it with Ame Cividanes. Her teaching is as fantastic as her sense of style - and that is very much a compliment. She isn't too stringent a grader, which is nice. The course provides a good mix of means by which learning Spanish is made possible - short stories, videos (the actors are comical, and not in a good way), a longer short story at the end of the course, etc. I recommend it.",
    "This is an excellent intermediate-level Spanish course. My grammar and writing improved greatly and I gained a lot of confidence. The readings are not always interesting but very good for learning grammar and picking up useful idioms and expressions. However, if you're not into Latin American politics and history, you may not enjoy it that much. The workload is light and class sessions are very relaxed. Overall, a great course.",
    "Yes. A great refresher course for intermediate spanish speakers.",
    "I would recommend it. While it seems the Chinese program does a better job, for example, of promoting good speaking habits, Spanish 140 was definitely a worthwhile class.",
    "L4 is really quite similar to L3; the main difference is that you get to read a few more stories and a novel in L4. As in L3, you use the textbook Enfoques, have homework several times a week, and get to occasionally watch a clip or movie. The last 3 weeks of class involve reading and discussing a novel, which is a great way to end the semester. You learn a bit more grammar, but the main reason I'd recommend the class would be to practice. If you need L4 for your language requirement, there's no big reason not to take it. If you've already finished your requirements, ask yourself whether you'd like to practice Spanish each day."
