   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend it. There was definitely not a lot of work, but it wasn't very enjoyable or interesting.",
    "If you have an interest in Naples and in pursuing studies in Italian at a higher level, I would recommend this course. Anna is amazing.",
    "Yes, but with the understanding that your Italian will not improve a great deal; if you're looking for a really immersive, challenging L5, this might not be it. But if you're looking for a really chill, fun class in which you learn a bunch about Neapolitan theatre, art, food, social issues, popular traditions, etc., then definitely take it! Anna is lovely, and hopefully the next group of students will be more willing to participate.",
    "A non-intense class that keeps your italian skills growing while also teaching a history that is not taught anywhere else.",
    "This course was very enjoyable. I particularly enjoyed the detailed discussions about Neaopolitan culture and history that we engaged in. We studied a variety of passages, ranging from the Middle Ages to contemporary culture. Professor Iacovella is a great professor and what I appreciate most about this course is that I got to improve my language skills, not through grammar exercises, but rather through exciting readings and heated discussions. Definitely recommend it!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It is an excellent way to improve Italian speaking skills as well as writing skills. The way in which the history of Naples is taught and the opportunities to do individual research on points of interest make it very worthwhile."
