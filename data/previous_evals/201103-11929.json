    "I highly recommend this class if you want to push your understanding of fiction and the story to a new level.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a workshop style class and you write two short stories over the semester. Caz will make you into a much better writer than you are.",
    "This is a good course for someone with an independent work ethic. Only two stories are submitted for peer-review, but Caz is willing to look at extra stories and help you by talking in his office. The assumption is that the students already know how to write fiction, and the class is really more of an independent study. If I could modify it slightly, I'd have more stories due in class at risk of lowering the amount of time spent on each story.Caz is as brilliant as he is intimidating. Although he will tear apart sub-par work, his blunt criticisms are really a form of tough love. The man clearly cares about his students and is willing to put in extra work and read extra stories. He's also inspiring.",
    "Advanced Fiction Writing with Caz is a pretty laid-back course where you get out of it what you put in. There is not a lot of required work, but if you make the time to really work, Caz will help your stories get so much better.",
    "Advanced Fiction Writing entails writing two short stories, doing two revisions, and reading 1-3 student stories a week. Caz is blunt but encouraging: he tells you what doesn't work in your story, and he helps you go about figuring out how to fix it. Caz is great. Take the course!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Seriously, Caz is amazing and will really help you improve your writing and your understanding of what a story entails. You write stories, hear critiques, and revise them; but Caz will also have you do exercises on character, etc. as is needed. And of course you couldn't get someone with more expertise in the field.",
    "Yes - the format of the class (2 stories to be critiqued, one revision) is standard for fiction classes but Caz was great - he can be a bit harsh but he holds everyone to a high standard. Fiction classes can be prone to \"its whatever amount of work you make it\" and a ton of bullshitting in critique but his willingness to call people out kept that to a minimum. He's also more accessible than any professor I've had at Yale (he basically wants the class to be more like a group of students he individually advises)"
