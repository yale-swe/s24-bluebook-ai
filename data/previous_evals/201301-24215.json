    "It was good.",
    "This is a very informative course for anyone who is interested in hospital epidemiology, specifically infectious disease control and prevention in hospitals.Guest speakers were great.It seems that having a clinical background would be a plus. You will get more out of it. For people without clinical background, it is a nice exposure to the hospital environment and learn how infectious diseases are been controlled and managed in hospital settings.",
    "I enjoyed that the course incorporated lectures and speakers from diverse fields in hospital epidemiology. In general, I found the in-class lectures and activities to be interesting. I did not feel that the assignments and projects for the course overlapped well with material covered in the class. I rarely used class notes or readings for the assignments, and think that more consistency would have been helpful.",
    "Very good introduction to the hospital setting in terms of epidemiological investigations and some of the major factors regarding infection prevention and control.",
    "The course material can be dry, but there are important\/useful information to be learned from this class. There are three homework assignments, which were fair and reasonable. There are also a group project and a final exam for the course. To address the fairness of individual's contribution to the group project, a peer-assessment should have been made available to allow group members to give feedback about their group member's contribution to the project.",
    "I enjoyed this course. I especially enjoyed the opportunity to understand how design choices and program that are implemented for improving quality within a hospital are often largely based on epidemiology.",
    "The course provides a great overview of hospital epidemiology. A weakness is that some of the assignments\/final do not help to reinforce the material learned in class.",
    "Guest lectures from subject matter experts were excellent. Case based classes were provided good integration of lecture material and application.",
    "this course covers a broad range of topics in hospital ePI , provides insight into current challenges and different solving strategies.It will be great if a short pre-quizz e.g. 5 multiple choices questions for each session could be provided to highlight the key component of the class."

For instance, couple students received other classmates' homework in their mailbox.It would be helpful to have a TA with clinical background who actually knows the material well, and who is familiar with the hospital environment and has a genuine interest in this topic.",
    "Instructor: Harry Jin \u00a0Students in the course did not have substantial interactions with the Teaching Assistant. That being said, Harry was helpful and responsive whenever we had questions of him!",
    "Instructor: Harry Jin \u00a0I had no interaction with the TA and he was never in class. I question whether a TA was necessary for this class. Although I don't think that the TA graded any of our given assignments and I trust that if he does, he is objective. However, one of the negative aspect of having a TA that is also a fellow MPH classmate, is that there is a conflict of interest because the students that the TA advises are also fellow friends.",

    "It's good.",
    "This course overviews a number of topics related to hospitals and public health, such as site-specific infections, public health emergencies, and surveillance. Guest speakers are featured in many of the lectures, and it was interesting to hear from experts in the field. Many of the class assignments did not overlap substantially with material from lecture and the readings, and therefore did not necessarily enhance learning.",
    "This was a good introductory course regarding the background and basics of hospitals from an epidemiologist's standpoint. Any public health professional who hopes to work in a hospital should take this class.",
    "Overall, the materials in this course can be dry, but there are also some useful information taught and can be learned from the class. If students are interested in hospital epidemiology and infectious disease management in healthcare settings, or is looking to fulfill one of their EMD course requirement, then I would recommend this class. The grading and assignment load is fair; however, the group project assignment can be improved with the implementation of a peer-evaluation assessment.",
    "This is a great overview course in infection transmission and hospital epidemiology.",
    "The course provided a good survey of basic hospital epidemiology and infection control.",
    "great for students who want to work in hospital or similar health care settings in future.I would recommend this class to my fellow students"
