    "MATH 228 is a great course. I would absolutely recommend it, even for non-majors who are interested in having a different kind of math course! Your mind will be blown with the concepts of geometry it covers. While you spend the first half of the class on Euclidean geometry (ie, things you learn in high school -- but in a completely different light), you then venture into affine and non-euclidean geometry. The class picks up a pace during these finaltwo sections, and it also becomes more difficult, as you have to starting thinking more abstractly as you enter unusual geometries. That said, Professor Howe is incredible and helps to make all the material (especially the truly mind-blowing stuff) accessible. More that than, he makes himself available outside of class to a degree that I've never met at Yale. Every week he holds his own \"section\" to offer help on the problem sets, and holds multiple office hours each week. Make sure you go and just talk, even if you don't have problems with the P-Sets, as Professor Howe is an incredible mathematician!",
    "I would definitely recommend the course as a great math class that really tells you lot about a topic that you probably haven't studied since freshman year of high school in Euclidean geometry. The course moderately proof-based but very accessible to students who may not have had as much experience to proofs. At the same time, the course is not easy, and I feel that being familiar with linear algebra will make many of the topics (in the second half of the course) more understandable. This course almost fills in the dots and tells you the very interesting geometrical results that are always glossed over in other course. Even the study of Euclidean geometry is far from trivial, as Roger Howe (who wrote the textbook and really is one of the leading people on this subject) has created a very rigorous collegiate level exploration of the material, which is both rewarding and at times challenging.Overall, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is mathematically-inclined.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend Math 228. It's an unconventional and interesting approach to different geometries. It's very accessible (you start from basic reflections), but you learn a lot.I would particularly recommend this class if you're interested in physics- it's a thorough introduction to special relativity, and will probably count towards a physics major.As a note, it's not offered every year so take it while you can.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to students looking for an unconventional course in the Mathematics department."
