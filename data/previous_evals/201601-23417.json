    "This course, frankly, was a disaster. The class itself was pushed back a semester due to work on the curriculum, but now that we have taken the class, there is no real sign of curriculum that was developed in that extra time. This schedule change took away course options for second years so tightly bound by requirements. The first half of the semester taught by Yawei Zhang was informative, but elementary and at a lower level than epidemiology 2 which most members of the class had already taken. It was also mostly taught by guest lecturers. The second part of the semester taught by Josephine Hoh was worthless. I sat in class for five weeks and learned nothing about genetics that I hadn't already learned in high school. I was forced to listen to role plays of simple genetic issues and write about genetic conundrums that did not push my ability to think critically about genetic factors in health and environmental exposures. This second part of the class started with a lecture about how Dr. Hoh is not convinced that climate change is a man spurred issue, which I think is unacceptable and reflects poorly on the EHS department as a whole.",
    "This is not a well-organized course due to many reasons. The lack of real input from environmental epidemiology makes it no value to take this course.",
    "Environmental Epidemiology was originally scheduled for Fall 2015, but was pushed back to Spring 2016 because the two new instructors, Dr. Yawei Zhang and Dr. Josephine Hoh, needed more time to perfect the class. It had previously received negative reviews, and they really wanted to exceed expectations. Fine we as students were frustrated with scheduling issues, but appreciated the effort that appeared to be going into the class. Dr. Zhang taught an effective first half of the class, despite only giving 2 lectures. She assembled a strong set of guest lectures (some of which we have heard in other classes), but ultimately taught us something. Our midterm project was a good opportunity for real-world grant writing experience, though it did feel as though we were being slightly used for ideas on her cohort. Nevertheless, we learned a decent amount during the first half of the course. I think it would be beneficial to look at the Epi II syllabus to try to a) minimize overlap if Epi II remains an EHS requirement or b) cover all of that material if Env Epi is intended to replace the EHS Epi II requirement. At the beginning of the semester, a syllabus had been provided with lecture topics extending through May. Dr. Zhang had assembled a wide range of environmental topics (chemicals, pesticides, air pollution), while Dr. Hoh focused on genetics. Those of us who arent interested in genetics were a little disappointed but were open to learning more about the topic. However, the day before Dr. Hohs first lecture, we discovered a new syllabus had been uploaded with all of her lectures listed as TBD. This was particularly concerning to us, because she had allegedly been spending the last year developing this course. What happened to those extra months of preparation? Well, we spent the next several weeks waiting to find out. Each week felt like it was still day 1 and she was giving an introductory lecture and explaining her \"plan\" for the course. But we never actually got to her plan. Instead we read dialogues out loud, watched movies, and learned about Earth Day. I was half waiting for arts and crafts and naptime. I genuinely believe that Dr. Hoh is a good person and strong researcher who means well. However, Im not paying $41,800 in tuition to hang out in a classroom with a good person and strong researcher for 2 hours a week. I understand YSPHs desire to keep her as faculty given her reputation, and I understand that her complete ineffectiveness as an educator probably wont be enough to keep her out of the classroom. She is paid for both research and teaching, and shes apparently doing so well on the research end that she is indispensable despite her inability to teach. But YSPH needs to recognize that we as students are paying a great deal of money to be here TO BE EDUCATED. We are paying for a service, just as Dr. Hoh is being paid to provide that service, and we did not receive it. In the real world, if someone hired a plumber to fix a leak and he showed up, said heres some Wikipedia articles on how to fix leaks, and left without doing his job, the client wouldnt be expected to pay. So why am I paying to be taught LITERALLY NOTHING by Josephine Hoh? Is this what a Yale education should be? I dont know why Dr. Hoh constantly doubted her students abilities and failed to teach us anything. The only reason I can give is apathy, because she had plenty of time to coordinate with Dr. Zhang and develop a strong, useful class. Instead, she chose to patronize us by forcing us to read pointless dialogues in class. She refused to answer students' questions because there isnt enough time. She couldnt give us a final because there was no material to test us on, and her (plagiarized) homework assignments werent even relevant to environmental health. Honestly, Yale should give us a refund. This is not the education we deserve.",
    "Honestly, I did not really learn a lot from this course. It is just an introduction about environmental epidemiology, so it is relatively simple for us.",
    "not so that goood",
    "More prepared for the class.",
    "The first part was okay. Although a large proportion of the contents have been covered by previous courses, it was still well-structured. The second part of the course was a complete disaster.",
    "This course is a new cours by Prof Zhang and Prof Hoe. It's good to learn how Envi Epi works with an introductive level.",
    "This class began quite well, with a good overview of environmental epidemiology concepts and practices. After two initial lectures that provided us with good background information, we had a number of guest lectures that gave us some specific case-studies in different applications of environmental epidemiology. The mid-term project was a great opportunity to learn how to plan an environmental epi study. I wouldve liked to know a bit more and get some practice on how to actually execute an environmental epi study, but I think it provided us with a good foundation. Then, in the second half of the course, we switched teachers, and the class became a complete and utter waste of time. The bulk of my feelings can be found in my Instructor Evaluation for Dr. Josephine Hoh. Essentially, the class switched from an interesting environmental epidemiology class to a poorly taught genetics\/genomics class. From the first class meeting, in which the credibility of the climate change hypothesis was questioned, to the final class meeting, which she skipped out on entirely and had her research group give a 20-minute presentation about their work, absolutely nothing was taught or learned about either genetics or environmental epi. The second portion of the class had no syllabus when it started. After we asked for one, Dr. Hoh provided one for usand promptly deviated from it. Nothing from the actual syllabus was taught. The concepts she wanted to talk about were introduced, then left behind, without ever actually explaining what they were, because she was too short on time. In short, the entire second half of the course was worthless. There was no semblance of grading. We got 80% on homework assignments (which were basic opinion pieces) just for turning them in; if they were adequate we would get the other 20%. Also, she said after two assignments that she would probably stop reading them all the way through. The only way I see the second half of this course improving is through a different teacherone that actually knows something about environmental epidemiology, and does not try to teach a bad genetics course."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Josephine Hoh \u00a0Dr. Hoh underestimates grad students' ability to learn genetic research material. She has questionable stances on many issues, including climate change. She rarely finishes her sentences in lecture and scares easily at questions from students. She refused to share her own research as she felt it was above us. Her patronizing tone throughout the course left us wondering why we were even attending. Her lectures were disjointed, and often cited wikipedia and youtube videos.",
    "Instructor: Josephine Hoh \u00a0Enjoyed the writing exercises that posed ethical issues to the class. Helped me strengthen my argumentation using academic literature. Her lectures could use improvement as they didn't seem too well planned out and didn't quite feel like Master's Level material.",
    "Instructor: Josephine Hoh \u00a0Dr. Hoh seems not well prepared to teach this course. The lecture content lacks continuity and depth. All the information provided in this course can be learned from other courses (eg: epi II).",
    "Instructor: Josephine Hoh \u00a0Incompetent doesnt begin to describe Josephine Hoh as an educator. Apathetic, ineffective, disrespectful, waste of tuition money? Now were getting somewhere. Dr. Hoh is an extremely well-respected researcher and is often referred to as the mother of GWAS. Well, like the mother of dragons, she promised her people many things but failed to deliver, completely lost track of the big picture goals, and eventually left us in the hands of her more effective associates. Dr. Hoh started our first lecture (and every subsequent lecture) 10 minutes late. We spent the first half of class taking attendance, watching her send us blank emails (yes, on the projector), and learning about the history of Earth Day. Not even kidding. She then explained that our homework was to write an opinion piece on whether or not global warming is caused by humans, because she isnt convinced by the current research on the topic. The fact that an ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH professor at Yale doubts that global warming is human-caused is insane. Her slides were disorganized and had nothing to do with environmental epidemiology (Earth Day?!). There were slides with (INSERT NAME HERE) and Wikipedia was her most frequently cited source. Several students met during the 15-minute break (again, great use of class time there Josephine) and discussed how we want a refund for this class. Point being, Im not alone in this opinion. When students say that she improved after the first class, what they must be referring to is the fact she actually crossed into the realm of public health. Her rationale for completely eliminating her plan for the class was that she didnt think we had the science background to handle genetics material, so she wanted to give us a taste of what is out there without actually going into detail. She had us read dialogues from her powerpoints to learn that genetics play a role in disease. Groundbreaking. She talked about lactose intolerance a lot and gave us pointless quizzes about the prevalence of lactose intolerance globally (same quiz 2 weeks in a row). Once in a while shed tell us about something random dbGaP is a database with data and results from genetic studies but then add on, If you want to know more, take Andrew DeWans class or follow this Wiki link. Wed have slide after slide of heres something that exists, take Dr. DeWans class or click here to learn more. Earth to mother of GWAS, THAT IS NOT TEACHING. Our homework assignments were all relatively short opinion pieces. If they were actually relevant to environmental health and graded fairly, I wouldnt have had any issue with them. I think her goal in inflating our grades was to bribe us into liking her so we wouldnt complain about her half of the class, and it probably worked on a few students. In doing research for her homework, several of us discovered that she literally copy\/pasted case-study articles written by Dr. Laura Rivard onto Powerpoint slides, and didnt give any credit to Dr. Rivard. Now, its one thing to paraphrase scenarios from these case studies, but its another thing entirely to copy the article word-for-word, including photos, charts, polling questions, and references. And Dr. Hoh didnt give credit once. For a school that has been plagued by citation errors and plagiarism in recent years, youd think youd hold your professors to a higher standard. She didnt show up to the last class and instead had us babysat by her special guests the members of her lab. They each took a turn explaining their backgrounds, academic interests, and current research. I learned more those 50 minutes than I had in the 10 hours I spent with Josephine Hoh. They explained their research in a way that anyone with a basic science background could understand (which we all have Josephine! Get with the program!). While this wasnt really relevant to what most of us plan to work in, at least we learned SOMETHING.",
    "Instructor: Josephine Hoh \u00a0I believe she is a great researcher in her field, however, she was probably not well prepared for this course because she had no idea about our background. She only talked about some basics about genetics and really did not reach out the issues of environmental epidemiology too much.",
    "Instructor: Josephine Hoh \u00a0A nice researcher but not a good lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Josephine Hoh \u00a0She is simply not even qualified to teach. I'm sorry but her performance was just so poor. I have not learned anything, anything at all from her, either from lectures or homework. It's quite embarrassing since a lot of students from other departments came to this class specifically for her part and she really let us down. We really need to replace her...",
    "Instructor: Josephine Hoh \u00a0Prof Hoh is overall good, but need to redesign her course structure to prioritize rather an introduction to all the topics.",
    "Instructor: Josephine Hoh \u00a0The worst lecturer I have ever seen",
    "Instructor: Josephine Hoh \u00a0I have no idea how to begin expressing my frustration with Dr. Hoh's inability to teach. In the second half of this course, across six class meetings and twelve wasted hours, I did not learn a single piece of information about environmental epidemiology, or, for that matter, about anything. Each class was started at least 10-15 minutes late, with another 10 minutes often spent watching Dr. Hoh send us e-mails and give meaningless introduction. From there, she would go on to either attempt to teach us things that felt appropriate in a high school science classroom (because understanding the complexities of epigenetics, gene-environment interactions, and genomics is just too hard for you), show us popular science videos, or have us read skits out loud from slides. The slides she created were fairly incomprehensible. The first class meeting, there were a number of things on the slides she couldn't explain when a few of us, confused, pushed for some semblance of understanding. Wikipedia was frequently cited. Other times, she left out the citation entirely, with a simple [insert citation here] or [student, find citation]. On top of the utterly inadequate teaching, Dr. Hoh repeatedly directly plagiarized content from the internet. Our homework assignments (which were case studies in morality and genetics: not in any stretch of the imagination related to environmental epi) were copied directly from a Nature series, without any proper attribution to the designers of the case studies. If YSPH is serious about reducing the amount of academic dishonesty cases it sees, it might be prudent to start with the teachers, so students don't see this as appropriate. I do not know why Dr. Hoh was chosen to teach this course. At some point, she said that she's not really an environmental person. That came through loud and clear, since she basically tried to teach us her genetics course. Yet, she could not even manage to do that, since she constantly complained about how she did not have enough time to teach us any meaningful content. Funny how we managed to fit a great introduction to environmental epidemiology, a few in-depth topical lectures, and a complex midterm project into the first six class meetings. When you waste as much time as Dr. Hoh does in the classroom, it's no surprise no learning comes out of the class. A basic course on pedagogy might do Dr. Hoh some good. Or, since we're in graduate school, where apparently pedagogy doesn't matter, even providing students with any content would be better than what we were given. Being continually underestimated (and not even being given a chance to prove our worth, due to the homeworks that basically boiled down to opinion pieces) is an intensely frustrating feeling, especially when it is coming from someone so utterly incompetent in the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Dr. Zhang did a great job teaching the sub-graduate level material that we reviewed in class. As an advanced epidemiology course, it was unacceptable to have such a paltry amount of critical epidemiological material that focused on environmental exposures in particular.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Really clear and solid professor overall. She should teach a full semester course. The group projects were challenging and helpful because they were based on real world prompts for submitting a study design for funding.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Dr. Zhang's part of this course is better organized. The mid-term project is helpful in some aspects. However, still, I didn't learn anything new from the lecture contents.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Dr. Yawei Zhang delivered a decent first half of this course. However, she didn't lecture much and relied heavily on guest lecturers. Her half of the class was good and she is a good lecturer, though it's pretty evident that she is more passionate about her research (which is great!) than teaching.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Dr. Zhang is really a good professor for this course because she has been involving in this field of study for a long time. She has much experience on researching about environmental public health problems. I learned some practical methods of research from her part.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0A great lecturer and researcher.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0She was great. She organized quite good project at the end of the class.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Prof Zhang is great, she teached us how to design a Evi Epi study with her useful database. It's good to know how to read and write a scientific paper.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0I would've liked to see more of Dr. Zhang's teaching this semester. She provided a great introduction to environmental epidemiology and one focused lecture on study design, but we did not get to see much more of her than that."
