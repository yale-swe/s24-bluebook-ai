   "comments": [
    "We get to learn a lot that I wouldn't have been exposed to otherwise, and that was fun, but the readings at the beginning were pretty difficult.",
    "An excellent course that is very esoteric. Be prepared to be confused at times, but have no fear because Professor Williams is amazing. The readings are kind of odd, but they're really interesting and fun to discuss. Also, it's a very fair workload for a WR\/junior seminar: just a paper proposal, annotated bibliography (although this is easily 10+ pages); and a 12-15 page pager. Overall, this course is awesome!",
    "Yes. If you like the materials listed on the syllabus take it!",
    "TAKE IT! The syllabus is really unique; don't think you'll find another class that studies representations of the Orient in the West and ties together seemingly separate works so well. You also learn about some seminal movements and moments in American history, so that's good for all the HIST\/AMST majors. Professor Williams is a rockstar. Well, indie star to be fair. He is very patient and willing to take time to answer any questions about the materials and makes class enjoyable. Now to see how we did on our final papers...",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The subject matter is much more interesting than I thought\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was worried it would a lot of \"whoa look how racist\/misinformed authors from this or that time period were!\" but that's not the perspective at all. The course ended up being a really interesting look at Eastern religion and thought through a Western lens, and a great way to reread some of the most important American writers from a new perspective. Professor Williams is great\u00e2\u0080\u0094really fun, quick, and an exciting scholar to engage with. He lectures quite a bit during section, which is great to place the texts in historical context but don't take this class if you only get your kicks from close reading. Basically the only assignment is a 20 page paper at the end of the semester, so super doable.",
    "Williams is a hell of a professor--he's engaging, entertaining, and full of life. However, the class was not the most stimulating. Conversations were dull, the other students not completely engaged. I found myself wanting more depth, more insight, not just a broader syllabus.",
    "East Asia in American Lit& Film explores various texts that illustrate the influence of oriental faiths and cultures in American literature. The reading list is eclectic and includes everything from Emerson to the Book of Mormon to Kerouac. Professor Williams is brilliant and really passionate about this topic; he knows it inside and out, so I found that the class was really propelled by his knowledge and insights rather than class discussion (although he does encourage class discussion). It's a relatively obscure course theme, particularly if you're not an English major (I took it as a writing credit), but if the reading list and seminar style appeal to you, then go for it.",
    "If you want a really easy English class with a chill professor where you don't have to do too much work and can write anything you want, take it! The class is really haphazard but you can learn a lot of random information about religions and the East if you do the reading. Roberts is way too relaxed for the English department and should be a bit tougher but it's nice to have a class that you don't need to worry about. You only have one paper the entire class which you work on all semester and you can do whatever you want so that's pretty awesome-but start on it early. This class is a hidden gem, take it!"
