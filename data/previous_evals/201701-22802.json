    "This course, like the first semester course, is especially useful for getting used to the primary literature of the field and improving skills for evaluating papers critically.",
    "Critical thinking.",
    "I had very little to no knowledge about MBIO\/molecular research techniques prior to taking this course-- given how it was structured, I learned extensively about such topics within the structure of different disease models. I also really enjoyed the paper discussions: going through so many papers so quickly enabled me to hone my reading and critical thinking skills."

   "comments": [
    "Great class - no complaints! Interesting variety of topics, organized, assigned papers were distributed in a timely manner, plenty of time was given to complete the final exam.",
    "Better if it is more organized and cohesive between different presenters.",
    "Strengths: discussion section, rotation of instructors, diversity of material. Weaknesses: perhaps remind students at the beginning of the semester (or take 10 minutes to go over during first lecture) \"smart\" reading techniques for articles and where to focus effort for discussion. Several instructors assigned too much reading to be discussed during 1.5 hours-- we frequently only discussed 1\/2 or 1\/3 papers assigned. Finally, it might be more useful to assign the instructor problems as we went, rather than at the very end as a final exam, but I was also a bit torn about this-- it did require me to go back to certain information\/topics that I might have otherwise let myself forget."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Very good way to get to know the faculty in the department and read about a broad range of topics within the subject of microbial pathogenesis.",
    "Absolutely! I would also strongly recommend to non-majors. The instructor provided excellent resources at the beginning for those of us who needed additional background prior to diving into the papers\/course content. It was clear that all the instructors valued true \"learning\" of the content presented."
