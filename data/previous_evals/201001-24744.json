   "comments": [
    "Yes - although unfortunately it will not be offered in the future! I hope that Yale will find a way to offer courses similar to this, and not just Joselit's lecture.",
    "a must take.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student if he or she has any desire to dissect European modern art into a series of manageable and comprehensible chunks. Movements such as Fluxus, Arte Povera, the Independent Group, and the Situationists were all confusing and silly to me before the course, and I now know far more about them and appreciate them more.",
    "Art and Politics in Postwar Europe, as taught by Jennifer Farrell, is an incredibly interesting course that manages to touch on many issues at once. Chronologically it can get a bit confusing, but if you keep up with the reading you will really enjoy the class discussion.",
    "Very manageable homework- one take-home midterm (total 7-8 pages), a final paper proposal and a final paper. Class can sometimes run long, but the material is so engaging that it ends up not really mattering. Take a class with Professor Farrell if you can at some point.",
    "In terms of modern art, this class provides an up close look at a lot of the works and artists. The participation of the YUAG and BAC curators provides a different experience from a regular art history course and the atmosphere is one that I think was productive and helpful for the students. Small seminar style also allowed for serious debate and conversation; students getting to know and work with one another and a sense of community and peer group that does not always happen.",
    "The class flies through post world war II European art... almost too quickly. There is a ton of reading, but you will learn a lot. I would definitely recommend it, but too students in the art history major only."
