    "If you are interested in Anthro or Linguistics, take this!",
    "This is a good course that is focused mainly on the learning and not on assignments. It is a small class and it was nice because it fostered really interesting discussions but at times the conversation would die down and there would be strange lulls. The professor is good at filling in the lulls. It is ok to take this course if you have not taken a linguistic anthro or linguistics class before. There isn't much work and there are no grades throughout the semester which can be a bit nervewracking. The only things taken into account for your grade are your participation, your final presentation, and your final paper. Nonetheless, I learned a lot about Bilingualism and left with a new perspective on language.",
    "There was actually a whole lot of reading each week, but I suppose that's not surprising given that it's a seminar. I feel like how good the discussions during class are would really depend on the people in your class. Definitely come in with an idea for the research paper though or it'll be a lot of work towards the end of the semester. Also be ready to have no idea what your grade is at any point - make sure you're okay with that and just enjoy the discussions.",
    "This has been my favorite class this semester by far. Professor Errington is an extremely thoughtful and smart teacher who planned the course very well. If you do all the readings and participate in class, the seminar provides you with so much amazing information and insights into bilingualism in a social context. This class also allows students the platform to frame their personal experiences in an academic setting, which was very rewarding for me. It was so much fun getting to see other students' projects as well as working on and presenting my own. The only aspect that made me a little nervous was the lack of graded material. As the final project was worth around 70%, I still do not know where I stand with this class. Regardless of this factor, I would definitely recommend this class to students.",
    "Bilingualism is a course where you'll get out what you put in. Professor Errington is a stellar professor who is nice and thoughtful. The readings are also interesting and discussion can be really great.",
    "I would recommend Bilingualism in a Social Context to any student (bilingual or not) simply because of Professor Errington. He's one of the best professors I've had at Yale."
