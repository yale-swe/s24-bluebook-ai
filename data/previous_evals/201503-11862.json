   "comments": [
    "This class definitely improves your writing! It is more than a simple intro writing class though. Analyzing literature is quite complex and hard and Prof Wepler holds you to a high standard.",
    "ENGL 115 04 is a solid introduction to Yale's writing expectations. Its a chance to not only read some \"good literature,\" but to grapple with the questions of what makes something \"good,\" and why some books make it in the canon. You will not go that in-depth with the analysis in class, but you will be expected to do so in your essays. Nevertheless, you will learn how to craft a college essay, and if everyone does the reading the discussions can be really enjoyable.",
    "A great course for freshmen who want to improve their writing right off the bat, but also really enjoy reading. The selection of literature is great, but if you aren't a big reader initially, this probably isn't the course for you. The essays can be challenging, but you learn a lot from them, and if you put in the effort, you will definitely improve.",
    "It's an interesting class, that will improve your writing significantly. I would recommend it, but only for someone who really likes to read, and who really wants to improve in their writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend Good Literature to a fellow student especially if they enjoy reading good books. In this class, we read a lot of great books and analyzed different elements of the book in our essays. We also read a lot of really good short stories that enhanced our understanding of the bigger elements of larger novels.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. Good introductory course and helped me to understand the writing style expected at yale."
