    "YES! Take this class. Great law and ed class.",
    "Some comments will probably say this was an unusual, disorganized, and unstructured course. While these adjectives all may be appropriate in some way or another, I still thought this course was highly interesting and worthwhile. Definitely take it if you are interested in educational policy and\/or law. If you are more an education person, the course will give you insight into the legal limits of education reform. If you are more a law person, it's a good class to apply what you learned in Con Law, for example, to a unique legal discipline. Also, the workload is sublime; the only requirement is that you write 25 pages total by the end of the semester, and you can space it out pretty much however you want. Get one or two papers done over Spring Break and you're golden. Ideal course for second semester seniors.",
    "If you can get into this class you should definitely take it. Workload is manageable, though there is tons of dense reading. Garfinkel is wonderful and makes the class so worth it!",
    "Interesting topics, and the professor is really, really kind, but the discussion is not so riveting.The only work is that you have to write 25 pages by the end of the semester. Take it as you will.",
    "Yes! Definitely take this course if you are interested in law, education, or both. Judge Garfinkel makes every topic fun, interesting, and easy to understand. I can't recommend this course enough!",
    "Take it. The course dove into many interesting topics in ed law, and I wish the course could have met more or longer to allow for many more interesting discussions. Professor Garfinkel loves the subject that he teaches, and he cares for his students. Both show immensely in the two hours that we met each week.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in education law. We cover multiple areas of education law in this class--first amendment issues, fourth amendment cases, religion cases, school finance law, etc.--so you get a very broad overview of how education intersects with the law. The cases are all very interesting and there is a ton of flexibility with the writing responses (and when the responses are due) so the class would work well in a busy schedule. Judge Garfinkel also brings in several guest speakers so you get a different perspective on some of the topics we are discussing. Judge Garfinkel is also very willing to help his students, be that academically or professionally, and is an overall good guy. If you are looking for an intense law class, this isn't it, but it does provide an opportunity to learn about tons of different education law cases.",
    "Take this class! It is an amazing seminar! you will learn a lot and you will have the opportunity to be taught by prof. Garfinkel, who is simply an amazing person!",
    "If the people are good, the class will be good. if the people are shit, garfinkel can't hold it up on his own. also, the first amendment cases are interesting but some of the sections are boring as shit."
