    "Audit it. This class reminds me of the Anthropology 100 class I took years ago. I still remember that moment when I asked why points were deducted from my essay that I spent hours on and the prof said, \"It was good, but not great. That's all I can tell you.\" This class reminded my of that moment multiple times. We are supposed to be scientists which means recognizing and eliminating bias. This class seemed to embrace bias as natural. The numbers will most likely prove my point. The TAs mentioned the average grade on the midterm from last year, and this year had a much lower average. This class provides valuable information that I did not receive during my undergrad studies. So I hope Crews continues to provide this class. But there is a dire need to address the issues I've mentioned thus far.",
    "Currently, I'm not sure if I would recommend it for another graduate student. I found a lot of the information interesting, but the course style was clearly undergrady",
    "A survey type course that provides some insights into non-academic careers",
    "I learnt a lot in this class and would definitely recommend it to another student. Different lecture topics are presented by the experts. Industrial perspective is also included."
