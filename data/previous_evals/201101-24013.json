    "great course. very interesting material. definitely worth taking.",
    "19th Century Britain was a great small lecture. Professor Semmel was an engaging lecturer and the material was always well selected and interesting, with plenty of anecdotes to enliven the facts. I would definitely recommend this class to those with an interest in the time period, but I would not say that extensive experience in History is necessary. A fun and rewarding class.",
    "I would recommend the class--it's really interesting stuff, empire, riots, politics, good stuff. Prof. Semmel is really nice and made the content very fun. There is a significant amount of work in terms of assessments, but not in terms of reading. Reading is only from primary sources and is usually light, though it sometimes spikes when we occasionally have to read whole book. On assignment side, there is 6 page paper, a 10 page paper, a midterm and a final (not really cumulative), which is a lot, but not overwhelming at all. Overall, great class for British\/empire\/democracy\/almost anything enthusiasts.",
    "Nice survey course. Interesting time in British history.",
    "Really interesting course that I highly recommend. Covers the long 19th century, so there is a lot of material, but it is always really interesting. There isn't too much reading, and you should definitely do it--most of it is pretty interesting, and there are passage IDs on the exams, so having read them and really being able to understand what is said about them in lecture is invaluable.",
    "Yes! The class is a great mixture of political and social history that will give you a great overview of the time period. The readings are actually pretty light for a history course, but all primary sources, so they are interesting and essential. The course doesn't have a general text for the period, so lectures are realllly important. Professor is a fun lecturer and the two papers and exams are totally reasonable. I really recommend it.",
    "An overview of social and political history of Britain during the 1800s. It focuses a lot on the expansion of the franchise and voting issues, so if you're looking for a more international focus (as I was), it may not be the best course for you. That being said, Professor Semmel is a great lecturer and makes the material really coherent.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about Britain in the \"long\" Nineteenth Century. The course covers British history from 1780-1914, and you get a pretty decent overview of the politics and culture of this time span. I always found the lectures to be very interesting and informative. I thought the reading load was very reasonable and didn't take too much time to complete each week. The readings were only primary sources, but they were not hard to read and helped me understand contemporary feelings more than secondary reading material would have. The two papers (one 5 page paper and one 8-10 page paper), midterm, and final were all very fair and reasonable, and I felt they really allowed you to show your knowledge without tripping you up. Overall, I greatly enjoyed this class, and I feel I learned a lot about British history from this time period."
