    "I would not recommend the course if it was not compulsory. I understood most of the topics before hand but I could still not follow the lectures. The course added very little to my understanding.",
    "A very useful course. Teaching wasn't great this term but we studied important topics.",
    "A good course on topics in empirical econometrics, but requires sufficient capacity to learn topics on your own.",
    "great for people wanting to do econometric analysis - less abstract than i expected.",
    "Yes if wants to understand many metrics methods, but I had a hard time understanding the lectures and had to study the material on my own",
    "Yes. Important material.",
    "Great content. Final exam was too easy",
    "I`d recommend because it teaches us most of the basic econometric tools. The content is very important",
    "Yes. I will.",
    "Helpful overview of empirical econometrics. Difficult material, but pace and workload is reasonable.",
    "Pretty standard 2nd quarter graduate econometrics.",
    "He was helpful before the exams. I have the impression that he did not have office hours during the semester."

    "It taught me a little bit about binary response models. I do not think it will add much to my research.",
    "Very helpful for my intended area of research in applied microeconomics.",
    "Econometric theory is not useful for my future research. The applied aspects were good, and the professor focused a lot more on applied ideas than others. But this really highlights that the econometrics sequence\/requirements should be changed. Not everyone needs applied\/theoretical and introductory\/advanced material.",
    "Introduced me to many important topics",
    "Learn important tools.",
    "Excellent material, chosen well to complement metrics 1",
    "I helped me solidify knowledge in econometrics.",
    "It will help for future studies",
    "Yes",
    "We covered some topics I had not seen before and ones that I had seen before but only casually. I learned in many cases why something was the way it was, and when that happens I feel like I really start to understand the material a lot better.",
    "It was very useful for future research. I regret we could not have more classes like this during the first year because of the comps."
