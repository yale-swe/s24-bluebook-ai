    "I found the class to be very interesting, as professor Parker is very knowledgeable on the topic and is always open for any questions regarding it. The course covers everything from the history of X-rays to astrophysics. I would recommend the class for anyone interested in radiation and its application in the world today.",
    "An interesting class, that is what you make of it. You can easily sit through and not listen at all, be bored to death, and still get a good grade. However, if you want to learn about interesting physics without too much pressure, this is where to go. It covers interesting topics like nuclear weapons, and x-ray machines, and black holes, and professor parker will answer any question to the best of his ability.",
    "The course may get dry if you do not participate, but if you are truly interested in physics or science in general, this is a great course to explore your interests.",
    "Interesting class, though a little dry at times. The workload is very manageable - boils down to two papers, though the final assignment is a bit daunting for a Freshman (twenty pages). Definitely worth taking if you have any interest in radiation.",
    "Take this to knock out an easy science credit and to have no work in a class, or if youre interested in science, but don't expect a class you will feel very engaged in.",
    "This course is interesting because it is up to the student to choose what to make of it. Either you can do nothing but write the two major papers and show up for class, or you can take the time to read the material and learn some very interesting history and cutting edge concepts.",
    "If you are interested in Radiation, take the course. However, I would not recommend this course simply if you are a science-lover : it is not what you would expect."
