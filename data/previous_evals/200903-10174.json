    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in urban politics\/ policy and ethnography.",
    "I think that Sociology 630 01 is a one-of-a-kind class. As a workshop, it provides students and ethnographers with a unique opportunity to develop their craft. It encourages ethnographers to think flexibly and openly about their projects \u0096 opening up the limits of what ethnography can be \u0096 while also helping students to think rigorously about what their projects should ultimately look like and accomplish. In the workshop, we hoped to discover what significance urban ethnographies can have for the broader contexts in which they are created, and also ways in which these ethnographies can be refined and developed in order that they become as truthful, penetrating, and far-reaching as possible. The setting of the class was informal and the required reading was not overwhelming, which gave students a lot of time to spend in the field, thinking about and developing their ethnographies. The uniqueness of the class, I think is largely due to Prof. Anderson, who is a one of a kind instructor. He helps students see the world as their laboratory and he articulates points in ways that stick with his students. I think though that his greatest strengthis in encouraging students to look at the world and use whatever knowledge they have \u0096whether it comes from theory, pop-culture, or personal experience \u0096 to try to understand what is really going on. In the end, I am surprised by how much my understanding of my site changed \u0096 and I hope improved \u0096 over the course of the semester.",
    "It's a valuable way to think through ethnographic methods, theory, practice and it's a great way to think through ethnographic work. It comes highly recommended.",
    "Take the class to learn more about urban ethnography.",
    "The course is an opportunity to see how ethnography could help to inform professional practices related with social management: from education, to nursing, to social integration, etc. Furthermore the course, although the interdisciplinary applications of ethnography, engages with a very precise disciplinary definition of ethnography, described and explained by prof. Anderson. I would recommend this course to students in the social sciences who would like to understand non-quantitative approaches to the study of society and who care to understand better cases of urban marginality.To get introduced to the body of material of the course, is better to have already a background on the social sciences."

    "You need to take this course.",
    "As mentioned above, the course provided me with a unique opportunity to develop my abilities as an ethnographer. It encouraged me to think flexibly and openly about my project \u0096 opening up the limits of what an ethnography can be \u0096 while also helping me to think rigorously about what my project should ultimately look like and accomplish. It helped me think about my site in different ways, and draw from theory as well as personal experience in order to apprehend, comprehend, and ultimately represent what I saw going on in the field.",
    "This course has been crucial for the development of my methodological approaches to my dissertation work. It's been immensely valuable.",
    "This course opened my understanding of a discipline which is based on urban analysis and which is not conventionally part of the architectural practice, my present background. I would like to continue to follow this course in the following semesters since I believe that it will be very helpful to build my research on the implications of multiculturalism on the urban environment."
