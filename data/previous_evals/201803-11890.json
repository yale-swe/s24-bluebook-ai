   "comments": [
    "A great introduction to contemporary theater. I'm not sure how much I learned concretely, but it's great experience analyzing theater that you probably aren't used to reading.",
    "I learned to read a contemporary play closely and to take every new twist in dramatic writing as it came to me. I also had the chance to expand my knowledge on the art form generally and to broaden the scope and style of plays I enjoy.",
    "Got to read a bunch of cutting-edge plays and got better at frameworks by which to discuss them",
    "I learned so much from this course! I got a hugely comprehensive understanding of what the contemporary theatre scene looks like today, I learned a lot about how to analyse plays and works of theatre and I felt hugely inspired by this class I took so much of what I read\/ saw\/ discussed into my own theatre projects.",
    "I had no idea what was going on with theater before taking this class. So this class has really given me... a lot!! Most of all, a way (or many ways) to think about theater, which sounds sort of basic but is a lot -- I didn't really know how to approach theater in my own mind before. This class has left me feeling especially aware of the audience, what the audience's role is, what it means to be in the audience or to have an audience, etc. These are questions that have helped me in my other studies in a pretty direct way. Most of all, this class has given me something new to feel engaged by and excited about -- something I want to keep in my life (even if that just means going to the theater from now on!?). This was one of those rare courses where I realized, after each class ended, that I had spent the full two hours entirely absorbed, entirely focused on what my peers and Professor Robinson were saying.",
    "This class taught me SO much. By reading several plays every week and having incredible discussions about them, I learned so much about both a play's internal and external mechanics. The people in my class were absolutely brilliant and Professor Robinson was an amazing facilitator, which made the conversations even more fun. I learned so much from hearing other people talk!",
    "I learned about how to analyze theater both as live performance and as literature.",
    "I got to read 30-40 contemporary plays over the course of the semester, and I got to learn about difference modern tendencies and themes that seep through contemporary theater. I also got to witness and think critically about upcoming theater in the Yale community and in New York"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The readings are engaging, lectures are less so. Honestly you can tune out on your laptop for entire class periods and still do fine in the class. Restructuring the class to be less lecture and more discussion-based will help with student engagement.",
    "Strengths: readings move quickly\/are generally enjoyable to read; seminar is essentially an open conversation Weaknesses: having a hard time finding any",
    "This course is so great!!!! I loved the syllabus -- the plays are amazing, interesting, disturbing and thought provoking. I think the stuff\/ amount we read and the discussions were my favourite part. I loved getting to really talk through some of the complicated\/ confusing\/ 'experimental' texts we read. I love that the syllabus is always being updated to reflect theatre 'NOW,' which is great. I loved writing the papers too. I wish we got to see another\/ more NYC shows but that was mainly an accident. Also, the class is a lot better when people do all the readings.",
    "I loved the discussions, syllabus, blog posts, assignments. Can't think of any real weaknesses! Only \"weakness\" is that I wish more of the plays were filmed\/ available as videos online -- I was always so curious to see how the plays were staged.",
    "STRENGTHS: Professor Robinson is literally incredible; the discussions in my class were so genuine and fulfilling; the plays we read were (for the most part) really interesting and exciting to read and interrogate; the conversations that started about theater often extended past theater into debates about philosophy, textual analysis, politics, history, and other branches of the humanities; the people in my class all brought their own eclectic theatrical experiences into our conversations. WEAKNESSES: There are only two papers, and the prompts for those papers are very very open-ended. For those who haven't written theater papers before, this was very stressful. Additionally, sometimes 110 minutes can feel very very long. I'm not sure if there's really an argument for having \"Theater Now,\" be a two-hour class as opposed to two 75 minute classes on two different days.",
    "I liked how open the structure of discussions was. The assigned plays were often very challenging and abstract, but I rarely felt intimidated by them because discussion was so relaxed. I think that Professor Robinson could have done a better job of engaging all of the students in the course. At times, it seemed like there were three people in the class who took up a lot of space. Also, I wished that the class had given each play for the week its fair share of time. Sometimes we discussed like one play for most of the class, and didn't spend much time at all on the week's other 100 pages of reading. I think that this class would benefit from being held twice a week!!",
    "Strengths: all the plays are super enjoyable, the course structure is loose enough so that you have a lot of freedom, you get to see a lot of great theater! Weaknesses: only 2 graded assignments, discussions aren't always focused",
    "The syllabus was wonderful and Professor Robinson is a great teacher\/presence in the seminar room. Sometimes discussion felt repetitive or was dominated by some voices."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you want to go into or are generally interested in theater I'd recommend it. It's definitely valuable to know what's happening in the theater scene currently.",
    "YES! TAKE IT! I loved this class and wish I could take it again! Professor Robinson is excellent, and the material is so good. You'd think a 2-hour seminar would be daunting, but at times I wished we'd meet longer. This class is really open-ended and is truly what you make of it.",
    "I'd recommend it to anyone interested in exploring contemporary English-language plays. I found the course structure enjoyable and conducive to whatever level of engagement you're willing to put into it. Loved almost all of the readings (which is really rare) and was happy to have the chance to familiarize myself with plays as they are today.",
    "Marc is great and the new plays he puts on the syllabus are intriguing and worth hours of discussion.",
    "Yes!!!!!!! Take this class. I recommended it to everyone I spoke to. You get to read amazing plays and talk about them. As an English major, I hadn't had as much opportunity to do this and I truly loved it and it sort of massively transformed my academic path at this school. Marc Robinson is an amazing teacher and it is so fun to talk to him\/ listen to him talk about plays. I would recommend probably any class with him. You also get to see loads of shows and we saw one in NYC. This class was one of the best parts of my week.",
    "Yes!!",
    "If you are interested in theater, this course will permanently change the way you watch, analyze, and process theater. Even if you aren't interested in theater, this class will teach you so much about your own spectatorship and art in general that it will be equally informative and useful. Professor Robinson is an incredible professor and will really challenge the way you think. 10\/10 recommend",
    "Absolutely! I'd recommend anything with Professor Robinson. The workload is manageable (though sometimes there's a lot of reading for one week), and Professor Robinson provides very helpful feedback on the course's assignments.",
    "If you are interested in theater, absolutely! The course assumes little knowledge outside of the plays that are discussed in class.",
    "I would definitely recommend if you haven't taken too many theater courses before or if you are looking specifically to learn about some abstract\/genre-bending works. Don't take it if sitting around a table analyzing two or three plays per week for two hours at a time doesn't interest you.",
    "Take it take it take it probably the best class Ive ever taken at Yale"
