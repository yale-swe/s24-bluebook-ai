    "Japanese Popular Culture focuses on popular culture in Japan after World War II. It covers a variety of popular culture media. I would recommend the class if one has an interest in learning more about Japan. Additionally, the class introduces various ways of thinking about popular culture.",
    "Decent Course, but pretty boring teacher.",
    "Yes. It's a really interesting class with a good balance of theoretical and practical matters, and Japanese pop culture is actually pretty fun to learn about.",
    "A great humanities course that covers a range of topics relevant to modern Japanese popular culture. NOT a gut class -- lots of work but rewarding."
