   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Developed the skills needed to critically examine artifacts and make educated guesses about their function and development.",
    "I felt like this course helped me to become more familiar with how an archeologist thinks and how to approach ancient history from a curious perspective.",
    "The lectures were very interesting. Fun to learn about different civilizations, how we discover things about them, and how impressive their achievements were. Absolutely loved the class.",
    "This class allowed me access to the Peabody which was nice, and I got some insight on ancient civilizations.",
    "This is a really unique course and I would be surprised if there was anything else like it at Yale. Every other Wednesday, we got to go to the Peabody and do a lab exercise. During these lab exercises we would examine artifacts and write down notes for a short paper later. The artifacts we looked at over the course included stone tools, bone tools, and ancient pottery pieces. It was super cool just to handle the artifacts. Don't break anything!",
    "I learned how to think outside of the box. During our labs we had to think of different uses for artifacts. It was both really fun and informative!",
    "Learned about analyzing and interpreting data from artifacts.",
    "I gained a wide-ranging knowledge of archaeology-regarding both the civilizations we studied (ranging from the Mesopotamia to Andean societies) and the discipline itself. Prof. Gardner was really effective in describing his own work in Mongolia, which I found really fascinating.",
    "I learned an immense amount about the archaeological excavation process as well as about surveying ancient land and ancient material culture."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths : the labs, the professor Weaknesses : the brevity of the material, but we covered a lot of different things, just not in depth",
    "A strength of the course was the flexibility in the topics that we studied, as a class, we had input into the ancient civilizations that were covered. Each lecture focused on one civilization and the course in total provided a good basic introduction to ancient life all around the world. Professor Gardner is a very enthusiastic and engaging lecturer and it was always enjoyable to be in class. He always provided constructive and positive feedback for our lab reports and I think the quality of my work defiantly improved over the semester because of this. The lab classes every 2nd week were a great inclusion to the class, it was very cool to be able to see artifacts ourselves and to analyze and form our own ideas on the cultures.",
    "Very engaging, good general overview of a lot of different civilizations throughout history. Professor allowed for us to choose some topics to go into as well, making the class even more interesting.",
    "Strengths: Access to the Peabody Weaknesses: The readings were not required and there was no way of checking who had read them or not which made them obsolete. The class was very disorganized and had very little synthesis, and it also did not help me to determine whether or not I am interested in the Archaeology major.",
    "Strength: it was something different from what I'm usually exposed to Weakness: was not very engaging because of the way it was structured. lenient grading and requirements was nice in theory but in practice it meant that I never did the readings and didn't pay attention in class. Would be good to have a test or paper on class material that would require students to do the reading and be engaged during lecture.",
    "It is an amazing course! It is so interesting and fun. The weaknesses about this course are that it is a little disorganized.",
    "Weaknesses are inherent to any survey: we didn't get to spend as much time on some civilizations as I would've liked. Strengths are that Gardner still managed to make each culture significant and to go into some depth on each culture",
    "The strengths are as follows: a super energetic professor, wide-scope of learning, hands-on labs, and a relaxed atmosphere. The only real weakness would be in the organizations of the class. Sometimes I felt we were jumping a little awkwardly through time, but this wasn't a major issue.",
    "The strength of this course is in Professor Gardner and his lectures. He's so enthusiastic about what he's teaching and you can tell he loves spending time with the class. He really makes it. Also, the hands-on labs and visits to the Peabody were fantastic."

   "comments": [
    "Would definitely recommend as Professor Gardner is great at getting involved with the material and the labs are amazing.",
    "This is an amazing class, take it! You will not regret it! The topics that we studied, we broad with each lecture focusing on one civilization, the course in total providing a good basic introduction to ancient life all around the world. Professor Gardner is a very enthusiastic and engaging lecturer and it was always enjoyable to be in class. He always provided constructive and positive feedback for our lab reports which defiantly helped to improve my quality of work over the semester. The lab classes every 2nd week were a great inclusion to the class, it was very cool to be able to see artifacts ourselves and to analyze and form our own ideas on the cultures.",
    "Very fun course with a fantastic professor. Light workload and fun assignments that you can get very interested about.",
    "Probably not, unless you are looking for a gut where you will only be required to do some brief labs and short papers. You won't get much out of the class because there is no synthesis of the information.",
    "Take this if you don't want to pay attention in class or do any readings. Super easy class but you won't really learn much.",
    "YES! Take this course! It is so fun and you learn so much! Professor Gardner is so passionate and he makes this course amazing!",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Very intersting course with an enthusiastic professor that works to bring a greater understanding of cultures and civilizations around the world. I loved the labs we dod and explored more about the culture of ancient civilizations.",
    "ABSOLUTELY",
    "This is a fun introduction to anthropology and ancient civilizations. The first few units are on basic archaeological tools, early humans, how complex societies developed. Then the students select civilizations they want to study in depth, and the professor chooses the most popular ones. Not a crazy amount of work, two papers and a presentation. Take it! Gardner is a great professor and a great guy.",
    "Absolutely a great class. Professor Gardner really cares about the students, and it's apparent that he's excited about the course material as well. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in Ancient Civilizations or anyone who needs an archaeology credit for the Anthro major. You get to go to the Peabody archives to see ancient artifacts, so that's pretty cool as well. Take it!",
    "Yes! I had a wonderful time in this course, and although I won't be majoring in archaeological studies, I found it worthwhile and a lot of fun.",
    "I am a STEM major and I would absolutely recommend this course. It's a great introduction to archaeology (never did I think I'd take an archaeology class!) and Professor Gardner is the chillest guy who knows so much about the ancient world. His lectures are great and he's really enthusiastic about what he's teaching. He even got us obsidian shards one day from out west. The class has labs once a week which are during class time and essentially involve visiting the Peabody museum and examining ancient artifacts. Then there's a midterm paper on an ancient civilization of your choosing, and then a fun little PowerPoint you present to the class about what your civilization, and then a final paper which is a continuation of your midterm paper. The field-trips and labs with the class and the professor will be what I remember most. Definitely take this course- Professor Gardner is great!"
