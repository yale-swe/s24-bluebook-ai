    "I would certainly recommend French 150 to another student.",
    "FREN 150 is your average French class -- biweekly redactions, a few tests, readings and grammar exercises. However, I think it's the instructor who makes all the difference. Madame Charney is honestly the kindest, most caring, funniest professor I've had at Yale. You will feel instantly welcome by her on the first day and for every day that follows. She is incredibly invested in her students and there's no chance you'll ever leave her class with a frown on your face. If you have a lot going on during the semester, I'd highly recommend taking French with Mme Charney. She's very lenient on deadlines and understands that all of us have a lot to do outside of French class, and she's very willing to work with your schedule as long as you do the work at some point. Her attitude fosters a great learning environment within the class, but if you're not someone who is good at self-motivation, I would probably not recommend taking French with her.",
    "yes if they really want to pursue the language--not just to get a requirement.",
    "A literature and discussion based course with grammar being entirely self taught."
