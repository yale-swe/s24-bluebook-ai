    "A great course that serves as an introduction to materials science through the lens of biomedical applications. If you're interested in materials, biology, or medicine, this is an important course to take.",
    "It is a good class for introduction to biomaterials. I would have preferred a more in-depth class focusing on application rather than basic information, but it was still useful. I would recommend this class to other students.",
    "Highly recommended",
    "Yes, take it!",
    "I would recommend it as a good overview to the types of common materials used in biomedical research and how they are being used."

   "comments": [
    "I came in with strong knowledge about polymers but only moderate amounts about natural materials and very little about ceramics or metals. This course served as an excellent way to fill in those gaps and make me more effective in considering all factors for choosing a material for biomedical applications in my research."
