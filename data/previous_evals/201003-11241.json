   "comments": [
    "This class is the hardest class of your first semester. I would recommend it to students who are interested in biophysics, but if you aren't, then do not take this class unless you have to.",
    "I would certainly recommend MB&B720. It is a challenging class and requires some previous knowledge of not only biology, but also chemistry, math and physics. A few of the lectures are conceptually challenging if you do not have a firm grasp on advanced math\/physics, but the rest of the course is more accessible to students from biology backgrounds.",
    "A challenging but extremely beneficial course that will push you to really learn important tools, methods, and concepts in biochemistry. A tough class with lots of material to cover, but very practically useful and very interesting.",
    "The class is a useful way to get the background to understand MB&B talks by professors and seminar speakers. It requires a lot of work outside the classroom, and tends to monopolize one\u0092s time. Some topics are broadly helpful (amino acids, protein secondary and tertiary structure, mass spec, overview of structure determination methods, maybe molecular mechanics, membranes, and nucleic acid secondary and tertiary structure,) but the rest (NMR, X-Ray) are dispensable in that our future research likely won\u0092t be affected based on whether we learn these techniques in that depth. If the class weren\u0092t required, I wouldn\u0092t have taken it.",
    "It is a difficult class but it is a very useful class as it provides a lot of important concepts in biophysics. If biophysics is what one is interested in, s\/he should definitely take this class.",
    "For MB&B grad students, it's required. For anyone interested in structure\/biophysics, I thought this course was a great intro to all topics (except cryo EM, which should be included next year if possible).",
    "Yes.",
    "It is good survey course for an introduction to x-ray crystallography and nmr. If you need to to do either of these things in research, extra coursework will be required. It is also a good survey of macromolecular structure. I would recommend it to first year graduate students in the biophysical\/biochemical sciences. I'm not sure it would be that useful for many other students.",
    "It is really beneficial and provides you with more access to the biological research."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "It greatly deepened my knowledge of macromolecular structure and biophysical analysis. The name of the class fits it very well.",
    "I learned a lot about my department and the research they do. It contextualizes their work. At this point it looks like the class will have no bearing on my dissertation project, but instead enriched and broadened my understanding of the discipline as a whole.",
    "It broadens my knowledge in protein, membrane and nucleic acid structures, practical experimental techniques in biophysics such as mass spectrometry, molecular mechanics, nmr, x-ray crystallography. The knowledge from this class will help me significantly in my research.",
    "I have been using macromolecular structures in all of my previous research without a full understand of their origins. This course helped me understand and appreciate the vast amount of work that goes into solving structures that can be used by many others. The lectures of molecular mechanics were also helpful from a protein modeling standpoint to understand what is going on in an energy minimization, etc. Although I will probably end up doing protein research, the lectures on nucleic acids were great as a background in something completely new. Great overview course for all things structural and biophysical.",
    "I learned a lot about techniques and gained conceptual understandings of biochemistry that will be useful in my future research.",
    "This course is a good introduction to MBB. It provided a lot of the background I lacked as a first year graduate student. Due to the pace, however, it will be less helpful and applicable to research because topics are covered in a broader sense. It will be very helpful, however, in understanding research in the department and in biophysics.",
    "It is fundamental course of the first semester. The core information is clearly the most important gain of knowledge for my first semester."
