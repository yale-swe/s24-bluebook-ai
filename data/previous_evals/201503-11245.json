   "comments": [
    "HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COURSE - one of my favorites at Yale. Provided a good introduction to the field of Anthropology, through an incredibly interesting topic",
    "Excellent class - always very interesting (you will actively want to go to lecture) and very accessible to people with a non-WGSS background. Would highly recommend for all Yalies. The workload is actually pretty moderate\/high - three short papers, two exams, weekly reading responses (just like a paragraph per day), leading section once, and pop quizzes. That being said, although the quantity of work is more than what I've done for most Yale classes, none of it is hard and it's very easily graded.",
    "This was a very interesting course. I found myself thinking about and discussing the material long after lecture or section had ended. I would recommend this course to anyone at Yale because the material is thought-provoking and it applies to any individual, not only anthropology majors.",
    "TAKE IT!! Even if you don't need the social science credit, this is a really easy class but, more importantly, really interesting and fun! Maybe will be different when Karen isn't teaching it, but you learn a broad overview on a lot of topics and I think everybody should learn about them so that people are less ignorant and become nicer. Also it's called ANTHRO 169 which I know can't be a coincidence. In terms of workload you have a lot of reading but you can really just skim them, and the papers are all less than a thousand words, so it's very nice.",
    "A class where you learn everything that can happen from your vagina to why our bones are changing to adjust to modern society",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, as it was not too much work, but I still felt as if I was learning.",
    "A survey of different topics in gender, sex, and sexuality studies through the four lenses of anthropology (archeologic, linguistic, biological, and sociocultural). Lots of guest lectures. Short (two questions) reading quiz for every guest lecture, reading response each week, three short papers, one midterm, one cumulative final. Several opportunities for extra credit. Easy to get a good grade if you do the work.",
    "Definitely recommend. I thoroughly enjoyed this entire class experience. It was not only interesting, but challenged my view of sexuality and gender in ways I have not considered. Workload was intermediate and readings were ok. Karen is real and one of the best lectures I've heard. Doesn't hold punches and keeps things fresh and exciting. Definitely recommend this class - although Karen will not be teaching at Yale again.",
    "It's an incredibly interesting and fun class that will change how you think about gender, sex, and sexuality! Love Karen, and wish she were here to teach this class again! :(",
    "YES! Easy yet really enjoyable 5th class.",
    "This is a survey course for anthropology. It requires quite a bit of work, but the readings are interesting and cause you to think about things from a new perspective. Guest lectures keep the class both broad and specific.",
    "The most amazing class in the world. Take it.",
    "The best course ever! 10\/10 would always recommend.",
    "Fun course with a substantial but easy workload. Karen is incredible (even though she is leaving yale",
    "Yes, its a wonderful course! Not too difficult and very entertaining",
    "Fantastic class. You get as much out of it as you put in. Karen is hilarious and her lectures are usually very interesting. Tests and mini-assignments are easy and enjoyable, and there's extra credit!",
    "Interesting class, not too hard but lots of small assignments that add up.",
    "If you are looking for a gut, this is it. Sometimes class wasn't all that engaging, but the material is easy to understand, and it's a great 5th class.",
    "AMAZING COURSE. Probably won't be offered again as Yale don't care about faculty of color and so Karen Nakamura is leaving.",
    "Great class that opens your mind about how we view identity in the world. Challenges popular social systems and disinteresting, with a great professor!",
    "I definitely would. I have learned so much in this course, and it has been so interesting to connect it to the other courses I have taken this fall, for example minds and brains.",
    "Definitely take this course. It is a great introduction to the field of anthropology and it teaches you how to think about approaching challenging or not well-defined problems and questions in nuanced ways.",
    "It's an out-of-the-box class. Not traditional at all. If you're looking for something different, this is your class. Fair grading. Can have a cheat sheet for midterm and final.",
    "It was a good, interesting, easy course. One midterm, three short writing assignments, one final. Final's easy.",
    "Definitely take this class! Its fun and interesting, and not too hard.",
    "Wonderful class if you're interested in getting a holistic view of a few really interesting and controversial topics.",
    "TAKE IT",
    "This class is great. I would definitely tell you to take it, but Karen is leaving so unfortunately you can't. You learn a lot of gender and sexuality. It's very important material to think about in order to better understand LGBTQ lives. That said, this class actually has a decent amount of work. It's easy work and easy grading but there's a lot of reading and little assignments.",
    "I would say that ANTh 169 is an introductory anthropology course that discusses and investigates sex within different biological, cultural, and social lens. I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the lectures were interesting and engaging and it was not an overwhelming amount of work.",
    "ANTH 169 is a very interesting class with material that is valuable to know and that many wouldn't touch on otherwise. It's the kind of class that teaches you things you can only learn in college. The material includes things that everyone should know in 2015.",
    "I would recommend it strongly! It challenges the traditional ideas about sex, gender, and sexuality that you may have come to Yale with.",
    "great fun class",
    "Amazing course. It's a shame that Prof. Nakamura is leaving for California and won't be able to teach this course again. I hope it will still be offered. Really fun material. Quite a bit of reading, but it never felt tedious and it wasn't difficult or complicated.",
    "This class is a great intro to the 4 types of anthropology and has a manageable workload. Karen is fearless and approached many topics that I think other professors might have been hesitant to discuss. The writing requirements were not necessarily very academic, but forced students to think in a very different way that I believe will help us become more empathetic and questioning people outside the classroom. I would highly recommend the course, but if Karen no longer teaches at Yale I doubt the class will be the same again.",
    "A broad overview of how anthropological studies and sex tie together. There were times when the topics were fascinating and other times when they were very boring. It's a very broad subject so there wasn't any linear progression within the course, just a random topic every week.",
    "I thought this was a fantastic class. It prompted a lot of conversations amongst my classmates, as well as my friends who were not taking the class. It was structured such that it was not difficult to do well and complete the assignments, yet we still learned a lot. I appreciated that it provided a kid of entry point into learning about \"mainstream\" feminist issues, while also delving into denser critical theory which not only supplemented the larger ideas but at times even challenged them. I was definitely challenged in the way I thought about the world around me, despite coming into the class having taken another WGSS class and informally educating myself about the issues touched on in class. That said, someone without a lot of background information would also do well in the class.",
    "I would recommend this as a fun fifth class.",
    "Weird class, not much narrative direction. If you've never taken a class like this before, this isn't a bad one to start with. You don't have to do the readings, but you have to do mini-assignments before each section, so be prepared to spend 30-40 minutes a week skimming and writing."
