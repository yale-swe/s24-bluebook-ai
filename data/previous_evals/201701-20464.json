   "comments": [
    "I became a more precise writer and thinker. I gained a broad sense of the development of political theory, particularly social contract theory. I learned what to look for in my reading of works of historical and political thought.",
    "Connecting texts and developing a complex thesis in my papers",
    "I developed a large range of critical thinking skills of reading very difficult texts and a foundation of knowledge in more modern historians and politicians.",
    "This class felt like the most relevant DS class. The small nuances that created radical differences between political philosophies helped explain so many of the ways we think about government today and to develop my ability to analyze texts.",
    "A lot of really interesting perspectives on government, a much smaller emphasis on history than in the previous semester.",
    "A sharp analysis into all the texts. A clear set of links between the texts. Contextual knowledge and ability to put the knowledge into the current climate.",
    "Learned to balance a heavy reading load and answer complex questions about complex political philosophies."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this is the least coherent of the three tracks of Directed Studies. This course would benefit from a definition at the outset of what it means to think \"historically and politically\" and how that is distinct from literary or philosophical analysis. It nonetheless provides a solid overview of the major political texts. It is also a great chance to discuss these texts with an expert professor.",
    "the texts really worked off each other and there was a clear connection, but completing the readings was difficult because it was so much",
    "Historical and political thought for DS has a very unique and inclusive structure. Somehow, all of the texts seem to fit well with each other. No weaknesses.",
    "This class put together a narrative for DS HP that wasn't as present in first semester (mainly due to the fact that there wasn't such a narrative). Pretty great authors and books.",
    "The author and work was put into context before every seminar was very useful. History is not a straight timeline in progression of thoughts, so setting aside some time to connect authors from different periods of time really helped to organize ideas.",
    "Strengths: Bromwich is incredibly intelligent and sharp-witted, but also fleshes out points students make to great extent. A lot of laughs whenever Trump mentioned. He shows the relevance of the past texts to today. Weaknesses: Hard to get office hours. Still waiting on my final grade and it's the 21st May.",
    "The books were well chosen and spoke well to one another.",
    "I believe the single greatest flaw of this course lies within the rapid rate at which we study novels throughout the semester, because we are unable to fully appreciate the complexity of the texts we study. However, this is also one of the defining strengths of the course, forcing students to direct their attention toward the most important details of each text we study. I believe that this could be improved by an evaluation of the number of texts the course covers, but at the same time, it is this challenge that forges greater critical thinking skills."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course if the student is interested in reading the books on the syllabus. It is a great experience to attend lectures on these books given by distinguished faculty from many different departments at Yale and to attend seminars lead by equally distinguished professors. I got great feedback on my writing and I was able to meet one on one with my professor to discuss my essays. But the course is centrally about the texts, so if the student is not interested in the content, they should not take this course. If the student is, there is a lot to recommend Directed Studies as the best way to read them.",
    "yes, it was relevant to current politics",
    "Of course, DS is an amazing foundation for any first-year student.",
    "I would definitely recommend to anyone in DS to continue with it. I personally found that first semester, H&P dragged more than the others, but that wasn't at all the case this semester. Professor Bromwich was great at directing conversation in section towards interesting questions as well as in giving particular and detailed feedback to papers.",
    "This was one of my favorite DS courses I took because the writings felt so prophetic and relevant.",
    "Absolutely. These foundational works include thoughts that continue to re-appear throughout all my other classes. I did not have much of a grasp on politics before this class, but I do now feel more comfortable reading books of historical and political thought on my own.",
    "Continue with DS if you survived the first semester, definitely worth it to complete the sequence and have a sense of internal reward for making it through it! And the changes in perspectives as you approach the modern day is readily apparent.",
    "The opportunity to be taught taught by David Bromwich? How could you not?",
    "Yes, DS is tough but worth the work."
