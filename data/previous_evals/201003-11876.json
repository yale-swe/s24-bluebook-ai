   "comments": [
    "It's Multivariable Calc. Nothing much else to be said.",
    "Some problem sets involve using Mathematica, which you can obtain for free as a Yale student.",
    "Yes, it's a good class to take if you want a challenge.",
    "Math 120 is a multivariable calculus course with heavy emphasis on integration. There are only a few theorems that one has to memorize. Some students may find it easier to think of most of the problems in physics terms. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, although I would warn them that they will be competing against a steep curve.",
    "I would recommend this course to those who enjoy math and not to those who are looking to use it toward a distributional requirement.",
    "Not the easiest material, but the course is taught really well and tons of extra help is available if you want it. Yu-Wen did a fantastic job, and I would strongly recommend taking any math course with her.",
    "I took this course after doing Calc BC in high school, and I felt that I was prepared. Yu-Wen is a great instructor who really cares about her students. She always made it easy to ask her questions\/meet her during office hours, which was really helpful. She is also a really sweet person and is good at doing examples in class. I would definitely recommend taking this class with her!",
    "Not a very stimulating course, mostly mechanical and formulaic, little room for exploration\/creativity.",
    "Math 120 is a tough, but rewarding class. Unless you a required to take the class, think twice about taking it; there are easily way to fulfill a QR. It was a good expeience and I definitely learned a lot, but the workload was pretty heavy",
    "I would definitely recommend math 120 to another student.",
    "Very, very challenging course that is fast-paced and covers some difficult concepts. Make sure you wake up early and get a good teacher on pre-registration day because having a bad teacher makes the course even more difficult than it already is. Go for Frame or Havlickova",
    "Math 120 is a good course. It starts off easy and gets much harder around and esp.after the second midterm. So, be careful to keep up with all the work at the end you will be fine!",
    "Mathematics 120 was an introduction to vector\/multivariable calculus. I would recommend it to someone interesting in going on to study calculus\/math\/physics at a higher level.",
    "I just took the course as a pre-req, and I think that's why most people take it. It's fine, I was never too excited about it, but it was fine.",
    "Mathematics 120 covers the topic of multivariable calculus pretty thoroughly. Its main topics are double and triple integrals, Greens theorem, Stokes theorem, and Divergence theorem. I would recommend this to a student who is interested in mathematics because it is important to advancing in mathematics.",
    "This is a good class, required for allot of science majors. The final is difficult, but the class itself isn't too difficult and is very interesting."
