   "comments": [
    "don't take it unless you have to its really boring and way more work for half the credit",
    "only if you have to.",
    "Take it if you need to.",
    "This class was actually kind of fun to take, other than all of the work that we had to do for it. It is a lot of work, but it really helps to solidify all of the concepts that you learn in Chem 115 in your mind. If you are taking Chem 115, then you should definitely take this class.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. It is time consuming, but sometimes necessary",
    "This semester was much more tedious than last semester. I never looked forward to lab, and the lab reports were really long. But if you gotta do it, you gotta do it. It's more bearable if you get to know the people in your lab.",
    "I would recommend it as a beginning lab course since it forms a good basis.",
    "Its a lot of work, but well worth it and goes along nicely with chem 115.",
    "Chem 117L is the second half of general chemistry lab. It meets once a week for about 4 hours (depending on how long a particular experiment takes to complete). In terms of grades, there's a pre-lab quiz before each lab session and a lab report due almost every week. I didn't find the experiments particularly interesting, but they were generally not very difficult. The lab reports, however, made me want to beatmy head against the wall. They are exceedingly time consuming and, in my opinion, not helpful in terms of teaching me anything new about the material that the lab is about.",
    "It is not bad, just make sure you read through the lab beforehand so you do not spend so much time in the lab trying to figure out what to do.",
    "yes, but take it along with chemistry 115 or else the quizzes could be confusing. and be prepared to spend 5 hours on a lab.",
    "If you have to take it, do it. Most of the time, it seemed like a waste of time.",
    "Yes, good required course.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. It was sometimes tedious but overall learned a lot.",
    "Fun class but lab reports can be difficult\/take a lot of time.",
    "It was ok. I liked the first semester much better, and the labs took longer and were more stressful. Still, it was interesting at times, and I actually liked practicing identifying unknowns.",
    "If you need this class for something take it, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. The lab report is a whole lot of work for only 1\/2 a credit and if you are in Chem 112\/113 you are not aligned with what you are learning and the lab so it can become very difficult.",
    "If you have to take this, take it. It's not too bad.",
    "It takes up a lot of time, but it's not a hard class and sometimes even helps you understand material from lecture better. The quizzes are more difficult than first semester, but the actual labs are still straightforward. The last few weeks are all about qualitative analysis (no calculations!), and you will be very prepared for the final lab practical. Dr. G is hilarious.",
    "Only if you need it for a requirement.",
    "necessary for science majors, builds basic skills. i would recommend it if you're a science major but definitely not if you're not a science major. it's a time consuming course that is just a requirement.",
    "It is a large chunk of time and if you are not planning on majoring in a science or applying to medical school don't take it. If you are, it is a good course to take.",
    "A good course, you learn a lot, but it is MUCH more work than 116L.",
    "the quizzes can be extremely tricky - they will make or break your grade",
    "Standard lab class. Take it if you have to, but otherwise take a more interesting lab.",
    "Great introduction to lab skills and seeing reactions first hand. However, it didn't always correlate with what I had learned in lecture, as lab material moved much faster.",
    "Chem 117L is the lab course that accompanies Chem 115 during second semester. Dr. G makes this class - his wit, knowledge, and approachability make him an excellent lecturer and in-lab professor. Take this lab if you must (e.g. pre-med, bio major, etc) or if you have a general interest in chemistry and want to see some applications of the course material.",
    "Standard chem lab, not too much work, other than the lab itself, which usually takes close to the full four hours (or more), and the once a week, night before, morning of lab report, which is usually pretty easy though can be time consuming. You probably are taking this because you need to, and you probably also already took the first semester, so there I probably don't need to be to detailed. Second semester is harder, quizzes are more difficult and labs take longer and are graded a little harder, but the final is super easy.",
    "It is a good class that complements the lecture course very well and helps to put difficult topics into perspective. I would recommend this class to a student because of its usefulness in chemistry topics.",
    "Take it if you have to, otherwise there are more efficient ways to earn course credits.",
    "Only take it because it's necessary prereq for bio or medical school. This class is a huge pain with long, tedious, contrived, mindless lab reports that literally take up the 6 hours.If you have to take this class, it is doable, just less than ideal.",
    "A lot of work for not a lot of learning. I feel it is unnecessary as I learned virtually nothing.",
    "Likely the only reason you are taking this course is to fulfill a requirement, so honestly, just do it. It's tedious and can get boring but hey, it must be done.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it unless it was a requirement for your major.",
    "It's enjoyable, to an extent. Sitting in the lab for 3 hours is not my ideal afternoon, but if you need to take it, you'll be able to survive.",
    "If you need to take it, take it.",
    "Take this class if you have to. Otherwise don't bother-- you won't enjoy it.",
    "I would say that it is a great way to get a hands-on understanding of chemistry and that it nicely augments the general chemistry lecture. However, I would advise that students do not take it unless they have to (or unless they genuinely enjoy chemistry).",
    "You need it if you're premed, so I would recommend taking it. I wish it were worth more than 1\/2 a credit, I do more work in it than my gen chem class. Sometimes it gets really tedious and annoying, but push through and it's worth it.",
    "This lab course was similar to 116 but involved a greater time commitment because the lab reports were much more tedious and long. I wouldn't take this course for fun, but I would highly doubt anyone would.",
    "You'll take it whether you want to or not because you need to. Don't worry, it's a good, fun, (sometimes deceivingly hard) course.",
    "No, it seemed like a waste of time and hit to my GPA. Not interesting chemistry at all.",
    "A lab that can be fun if one works on the lab write ups in a timely fashion. I would recommend it to those that need it for pre med reqs.",
    "A class that goes well with the lecture class, that is interesting and introduces you to a broad variety of topics. It's also a lot of work though; lab reports always take much longer than you expect.",
    "it is a necessary evil, it id definitely a more stressful class than last semester and takes a lot of work to write the lab reports...and it is only worth 0.5 a credit",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I would strongly recommend it. While it is a requirement for most science majors, it is also very enjoyable.",
    "It is a lot of work but you have to take it for a pre-med requirement. So its not too bad and some labs are pretty interesting.",
    "Well, I mean, you don't take a lab for fun. Nearly everyone taking it is either pre-med or taking it to fulfill requirements of a major, such as engineering.",
    "Take it if you need to. I don't recommend it otherwise.",
    "I definitely recommend taking Chem 117 along with Chem 115. It really helps solidify the concepts and the practical application of the concepts is a great supplemental tool. It's a lab course so it's a fair amount of work but it's appropriately challenging.",
    "This is a good class to take alongside Chemistry 115.",
    "This course is okay, more than likely the only people who take it are those who have to, but that is okay. The spring portion of this course is definitely harder than the chem lab in the fall, so any student who is going to take this course should study the online pre-quizzes before the actual in class quizzes.",
    "Chem 117 is your basic second semester Gen Chem Lab. You do a lot of experiments and write a lot of (sometimes very long and tedious) lab reports, but it is better than last semester's part one so it has my recommendation.",
    "I'd recommend it. It's an interesting course.",
    "It didn't always correspond to the lecture.",
    "Definitely not as easy as first semester - the lab reports take twice as much time to complete, and the grading is much harder. Beware of the quizzes: they WILL drop your grade if you don't do well.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course-- it teaches necessary good lab skills, although the lab writeups do take a very long time.",
    "I thought it was a fun lab. It was a little more challenging than Chem 116L, but there was a lot more to do other than titrations. There was more qualitative work this semester, like identifying compounds, which was a little less stressful.",
    "If you need to complete it, take the class. Otherwise, do not, under any circumstances, take it.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU HAVE TO.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone trying to fulfill the pre-med requirements. It correlates with the material taught in lecture course, at a slightly faster pace. It is a good way to cement your understanding of the theory taught in lecture.",
    "CHEM 117 is an interesting lab with some ridiculously long labs and you don't actually learn much from the lab. Mostly, the class provides examples and hands-on experience with new lab techniques. I would recommend the lab if it was needed -- otherwise it is just a frustrating half credit.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend it for someone taking CHEM 115. It's stressful and tedious, but if you're pursuing science\/chemistry, it's unavoidable. Take advantage of Dr. G.'s office hours, and start your lab reports early so you can ask him about issues you run into. It's much harder than the fall portion of the lab (Chem 116), as Dr. G. tries to make the students think more independently (instead of feeding them everything they need to know).",
    "Chem 117 is a very tedious step in the path you are taking, likely in order to be a doctor. If you made it through 116, you are capable enough in lab technique to handle these labs. What you need to be cautious of is that the grading (on reports) can be much stricter than it was in the fall and the quizzes can be harder. It's hard to do this sometimes, but starting lab reports early (even if it's just 2 nights before instead of 1) is REALLY helpful this semester (as opposed to 116), especially because some of them will randomly take MUCH longer than expected.",
    "It is a great course to get yourself acquainted to working in a lab and lab procedures.",
    "Only if you have to",
    "Only take this lab if you have to. Definitely should be worth a full credit. IT IS A LOT OF WORK!",
    "Don't take it ... but everyone will take it because of pre-med stuff so my opinion doesn't really matter",
    "If you are taking a general chemistry course, I would recommend taking it with lab. Although lab work was sometimes tedious and was more work than a half credit, it was a good experience. You learned to use some general equipment in the lab and really had to understand what you were doing in the lab to write up a lab report.",
    "Chem 117 was harder than first semester lab only because you don't have Dr. G. telling you exactly what to do. But that's what lab should be. And if you need help, Dr. G. is more than glad to help you so it's all about how you choose to approach it. The course is extremely well organized and everybody's familiar with the rules so it was nice to have a consistent amount of work every week.",
    "No, I would not particularly recommend the lab. But it is necessary if you are in the chemistry class and also need the lab for something like premed requirements.",
    "Chem 117 is an excellent course. Not only is it very helpful in supplementing inorganic chemistry and teaching important laboratory techniques but it is also a lot of fun. I did not find the work to be too burdensome and I looked forward to this course every week, in all seriousness.",
    "It's a good lab for learning lab techniques and applying chemistry concepts. The lab reports can get pretty tedious and take up a lot of time, but overall, it's manageable.",
    "There's a great deal of titration. Prepare yourself for some tedious experiments and lab reports. I learned a lot, though. I would recommend it if it's necessary for your major.",
    "Chem 117L is a very tough course. Above all, it is very time-consuming and lab-report intensive. The lab session itself is a single 4-hours session each week. My recommendation: **Only take Chem 117L if it is required for your major or premed requirements.** It is survivable, but the course may cause you a substantial amount of grief throughoutthe semester.",
    "Chemistry 117L is a beneficial laboratory class with interesting experiments. Be preapred for lengthy laboratory reports and challenging pre-lab quizzes. Overall, I enjoyed the course and would strongly recommend it.",
    "Straightforward chem lab. Just follow the directions, and you'll be fine.",
    "Chem 117L is a pretty difficult class when it comes to the prelab quizzes and reports. Make sure that you make a lot of time to write up your reports because they can be long.",
    "If you like chem, of course. most likely though you would take this simply for a pre-med req. good luck, it's tedious, but not hard.",
    "Last semester's chem lab was much more enjoyable. This lab course seemed a lot more intense and I would only take it if one really enjoyed lab.",
    "only take if you need to for premed or major. otherwise, there are plenty of other labs which i think would be more interesting. still though, if you're thinking at all to take this, then take it",
    "IF you are taking General Chem then it's highly likely you'll take Chem117L whether you'd like to or not. That being said, it is a course that reinforces the materials learned from lecture, and is taught by an effective instructor. The second semester is generally more difficult than the first (depending on the TA) in terms of how much work you have to put into the class. Also, be prepared for some arbitrary grading.",
    "Chem 117 is way too time consuming for the amount of credit you get, but it's a required class so you really have no choice. A few of the labs are fun, but a few are really really time consumingand boring.",
    "I would definitely recommend 117L to another student. Despite the tough workload, if you put in the necessary time you will do well and learn a lot.",
    "Chem 117L is a good companion to the Chem 115 lecture course; I would recommend taking it at the same time as the lecture. The labs are generally interesting and engaging.",
    "Chem117 is a hard course, but worth it. The lab's aren't hard and you can finish early most of the time if you work efficiently. Definitely take if taking Chem 115",
    "take it if you have too",
    "I would say only take this course only if you have to.",
    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend this course to another student unless chem lab is mandatory for his or her major."
