    "It was a great, interesting class for both people who believe in prison abolition and people who do believe that prisons should exist to gain a new perspective through which to view the whole issue of prisons.",
    "Absolutely! For any major or academic background, this class is amazing.",
    "This class is super important. Everyone should learn about these issues. Dara is awesome - take this class.",
    "CSTC 320 was a very informative course about conditions inside of prisons. (It is not a course simply about the mass incarceration phenomenon in general.) It ranged from violence to sexual abuse to friendship to guard relations to healthcare to media portrayals of prison life. We had a few guest speakers, two of whom were previously incarcerated, and they gave us great insights on the prison system. The course was very fluid, but very informative. Dara (professor) did a great job facilitating discussions. Though she sometimes had to cold-call in the beginning, this was no longer necessary later on. The highlight of the class for me was the visit to a prison because with all of the research that I have already done regarding prisons, it was my first time actually getting to go inside of one. This course does a great job at humanizing prisoners, who are often dehumanized. The assignments could have been better spaced out. For example, we did not get our first grade in the course until after spring break, making it hard to know how we were doing. But overall, I would definitely recommend the course. If you know nothing about prisons, take this course - you need to be informed! And if you already know a significant amount about prisons, still take this course because it will expand your knowledge, and Dara is a super knowledgeable person in this field.",
    "learn about prison conditions, something no other class will teach you about. you will become a prison activist after this. no chance you won't.",
    "This is a good class for those interested in the criminal justice system and prisons. Conversations skew theoretical but strike a good balance between theory and practical information. The field trips and guest lecturers were great, and the class is overall great for learning about a topic that otherwise isn't necessarily covered by other classes. Also, Dara is great and super approachable!",
    "If one is genuinely interested in learning about our modern prison system its shortcomings, then I would absolutely recommend this course. Be prepared for a fair amount of reading each week. However, it is incredible how much you can walk away with after just 1 semester.",
    "Definitely! If Dara teaches this course again, I'd totally recommend taking it. It's an engaging and important class. It's also very chill in class. You learn a lot while having a good time discussing in class."
