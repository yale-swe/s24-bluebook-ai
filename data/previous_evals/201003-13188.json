    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "It's not that Dr. Grewal isn't good with much of the material; on the contrary, she, as a philosopher, brings a new perspective to the works that might not be explored in other sections. On the other hand, it was her first semester teaching Directed Studies, and it showed in the way she managed the class.In-class discussion was stifled for the first few weeks since she dominate everything that arose. After a while, she did let up, but by then, the damage was done and few students read the material for the section or cared enough about it to comment on it. The lack of direction encountered in some of the classes was due to this inexperience and, as with all DS courses, the massive amounts of information available in these rich works.Despite this, Grewal is great to interact with and bounce ideas off of one-on-one, but this class truly showed the importance of building a positive class atmosphere where everyone is interested in the material, and Grewal's 9:00 class, plagued by early-morning fatigue, was not suited for this kind of environment.That said, the papers were a great deal of fun to write, and the works are amazing. They really help you understand the underlying historical traditions at hand in recording the events of the ancient world, and, paraphrasing Polybius, no one could be so engaged in other forms of contemplation that he wouldn't be interested in learning about this history.",
    "I would summarize this course as having been the first semester of a crash course in the development of Western Historical and Political philosophy, necessarily focused a good deal on the Greek and Roman classics. I would definitely recommend the course, and the Directed studies program in general, to those students who are interested in becoming well read and knowledgeable on the evolution of western thought and culture -- here from a study of its political works.",
    "You're unfortunate if you end up in her section. Your understanding of the reading will come out of your own time with the book, her class is mostly a time to do other classes' homework. It's easy to contribute abstract, ungrounded points without reading the book though.",
    "No I would not recommend to a fellow student because I did not think that my section was really a history\/politics course.",
    "Professor Grewal is knowledgeable and curious about all sorts of topics. She is supportive, gracious, and approachable.But there simply wasn'tenough class participation (though admittedly this is expected when most people do not do the reading). If you want to talk extensively in a class, this probably isn't for you. There was also too much emphasis on subtopics and (perhaps irrelevant) details, which can be frustrating when you have read so much more!",
    "DS is a great way to approach hard history books that everyone should read at some point in their life. It is very fast paced and has a lot of work, but is completely worth wile. I would recommend all the DS classes because DS is an amazing program, but I would not recommend Grewal as a professor.",
    "I would recommend Prof. Grewal's section if you're looking for a more \"academic\" approach to the texts akin to what you might find (from what I've heard) in a classics course and NOT a broad summary of the texts.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to fellow students as the best insight into classical historical and political thinking because the sheer scope of reading allows one to gain important context and perspective. In addition, I learned foundation knowledge on from where many modern political theories are derived. In addition, the discussions and papers allows students to form and be accountable for their own opinions."
