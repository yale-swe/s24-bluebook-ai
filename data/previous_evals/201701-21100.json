   "comments": [
    "Learned more about how to approached contemporary social theory, how it relates to other social theory (Marx, Weber, Durkheim), and how to apply that theory to relatable experiences.",
    "Interesting introduction to a complex field of study.",
    "I really enjoyed taking the class - I was really engaged with all the material and I definitely feel more comfortable tackling difficult theory and readings. Prof Eyerman was really encouraging and I had an easier time with my reading responses over the semester. Social theory is super interesting and relevant and helped me think of the world differently",
    "This course was a great overview of the types of texts that we always encounter in the humanities. Foucault, Arendt, Goffman, etc.it helped me understand the opinions and agendas of a lot of often-quoted figures in Western theory. Beyond the writers, though, this class helped me understand a deeper layer of societal analysisthe relationship between the individual and institutions, \"reflexivity,\" characteristics of modernity. I also loved Professor Eyerman's attitude towards the class: he was a good seminar leader and a supportive presence, and while he clearly respects the writers we read, he doesn't frame them as definitively correct.",
    "This course was the first theory course I've ever taken, and it has inspired me to continue learning about social theory. I learned to read, write and talk about social theories and ideas.",
    "My writing and reading skills have not improved this much in any other class at Yale. We read consistently difficult texts, anaylzed them carefully, and wrote about them each week.",
    "frameworks that help me think about life in more interesting ways.",
    "This course helped me develop a strong foundational understanding of contemporary social theory and many of the principle texts therein. I feel significantly more prepared to tackle topics such as modern and post-modern cultural theories through a variety of lenses.",
    "I learned the key ideas in some foundational texts of sociology since World War II. I learned some methods for evaluating social theory."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "We were assigned a book a week usually which is typical. However, in class, we very rarely closely read from the book. Thus, conversations tended to be more general and less text-specific. I'm not sure of this is typical of soci\/theory classes, but I would have liked it more if we looked at specific passages and understood how authors formulated their arguments\/logics.",
    "i like how there are weekly reading responses that are graded fairly; wish there was more guidance on how to write the papers. the responses to the reading responses were positive while it was hard to write a good paper without expectations outlined",
    "The readings and responses are a great way of understanding the core concepts of the course. Prof. Eyerman is incredible and made me feel welcome and heard during class.",
    "Perhaps we could have discussed the final paper more in class.",
    "strengths: incredible prof and TF who made theory interesting and applicable to our lives. really appreciated ways in which Eyerman led the discussion.",
    "This course has a very strong reading list and Eyerman does a fantastic job of guiding free and open discussion. The format can get a bit repetitive but if you have a strong class, each discussion will be different and interesting.",
    "Discussion is generally engaged and interesting, texts are great. Reading response model is a good way to make sure students have foundations down, in particular the summary part. More critical feedback on writing would greatly improve the course.",
    "I liked we had weekly reading responses. It helped me stay on top of my readings and engage with them critically. Reading through all students' reading responses must have been a lot of work with Professor Eyerman and the TA and I really appreciate it. I wish there was more feedback with our midterm and final papers though. Jean-Baptiste graded our midterm papers, but it would have been nice to also receive feedback from Professor Eyerman or have a peer-editing session, especially since this class is a writing seminar."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Great introductory reading list. Tends to be Eurocentric which is its only fault (no real discussion of postcolonial theory\/feminism\/etc). But the class gives you the tools to explore these other disciplines\/theories and Professor Eyerman is very quick to give reading suggestions, books to students, and include these in class discussions.",
    "Engaging course, the seminar I was in had incredibly intellectual people in it. I learnt a great deal from the readings, weekly responses and Professor Eyerman. I also learnt from everyone in the class and their approach to contemporary sociological problems.",
    "Yes! Weekly reading and responses can be a lot of work but I found it pretty rewarding and overall enjoyable. Social theory is really interesting and relevant, so even non-socy majors should take it if they're interested!",
    "Yes, if you want to get a good foundation of [insert title of class here]!",
    "Amazing course, whether or not you're taking it for a requirement or for fun. The readings and responses can be daunting some weeks, but Prof. Eyerman makes each class insightful and entertaining.",
    "Yes, this is the kind of class in which the two hour seminar flies by.",
    "definitely, and especially if you take the course with Eyerman. he is very good at leading discussion, and always makes the theory interesting. I think it's a good deal more interesting that classical social theory (marx weber durkheim), as the theory you learn in this course may be more applicable to contemporary life. I came in pretty skeptical about learning social theory before this course, but give it a shot! (even if you don't have to take this for your major) the things I've learned, and more importantly, the things that this course has inspired me to learn and explore on my own, has added another layer of depth to how I live and think about the experience",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interesting in developing their understanding of social theory and how modern society is evolving. This class is consistently interesting and will inform the way you understand culture.",
    "Yes, the texts are so important and long discussion approach with some lecture content makes it compelling and fun.",
    "This was my first Sociology class and I enjoyed it quite a lot. I went into the class knowing nearly nothing about what we will be learning, other than the fact that it deals with the more contemporary social theories (compared to the theory class that opens in the fall). We read and discussed topics including critical theory, social interaction, punishment, and the characteristics of modern society. I found most readings interesting and engaging. I feel the theories I learned in this class will be a good background knowledge when I take more Sociology classes in the future. I think anyone who enjoys finding broad explanations to human social interaction and the nature of modern society will find this class interesting."
