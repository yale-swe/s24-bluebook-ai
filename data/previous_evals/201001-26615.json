    "Not a requirement, but I think the work and theory of VSBA should be integrated into the curriculum. Especially in our theory courses.",
    "Yes, it did",

   "comments": [
    "Very nicely assembled.",
    "It was a well organized class.",
    "we took many class trips to look at buildings and exhibitions. This was highly educational, even though it sometimes disrupted the course sequence.",
    "All content presented in the class followed the syllabus. Yet,the readings were non-prescriptive and very open to each student's formulation of ideas and investigations.",
    "Material is very interesting and great talk about, especially with all the resources the university has t offer on the subject of the Venturi's. Great use of resources available.",
    "VSBA in context was just that: an intense survey of the work of Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi, far beyond Learning from Las Vegas. The history of the two architects was explored in depth, including their early relationships with artists and social researchers in London, Rome and Philadelphia.",
    "I appreciated the varied structure - from class fiedl trips to guest speakers, etc. I thought the menu for the course was properly planned for.",
    "A very interesting and unique glimpse into the lives and practice of VSBA. Great readings, great trips and interesting assignments. Stanislaus encourages students to choose topics according to their interests and allows the students freedom to create and interpret a presentation based on these interests with his guidance."

   "comments": [
    "I expected to familiarize myself with an area I had little knowledge on. I felt I gained that plus much more about the general time period and ideas therein.",
    "I had set myself to work hard from the very beginning, knowing that beyond writing the paper, the discussions were going to be very demanding.I feel I was able to produce the paper I wanted to. I also believe that my participation in the discussion sessions was active and constant all throughout the semester, meeting all requirements to pass the course in a satisfactory way.",
    "I did not expect to take this course, but was presently surprised by the deep formal complexity, intellectual rigor and activism exuded by Scott Brown and Venturi through their writings and their work. The student presentations were well-researched and some of the best parts of the class. As well, the visits to Princeton and around Yale's campus took the course to level not many have the chance to reach: actually visiting the buildings which one is studying.",
    "I expected to learn alot about the Venturi's and this course exceeded my expectations."

   "comments": [
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the course. Stanislaus is a great professor. I'm glad he is here at Yale.",
    "This was by far the most valuable course I took this semester. Especially the trip to Princeton was very informative.",
    "This course provided an opportunity to study Venturi and learn about other architecture and work which might be related to them. This course helped me to learn different side of architecture which I was not exposed to before.",
    "This course allowed me to explore a variety subjects that had been of fond interest to me for a long time. In addition, reading and writing, which I had performed constantly throughout this semester, will always have great value for my career as an architect.",
    "High value, as a history and theory course. Truly in-depth and its conversations made for a deepening understanding of what architecture was and still can be.",
    "A broad new respect for the prose of Scott Brown.",
    "I really enjoyed this course along with taking the FAT studio (a contemporary analogue). I think the course material presented was broad and enriching, and along with the symposium, my knowledge of the venturi's expanded trifold.",
    "very valuable. I think all architects should be familiar with this material."

    "Jimmy Stamp was a great TA. Enthusiastic, helpful, and vocal in class when necessary.",
    "Stanislaus was excellent in teaching the course, Jimmy as a TA was also extremely helpful.",
    "Professor Von Moos is a very straight-forward and knowledgeable person, who has been always available for mentoring and advice. I feel glad I was able to be exposed to her during my first year at Yale.",
    "Jimmy and Stanislaus were full of anecdotes and commentary throughout every session. They were an excellent match...sometimes quite funny.",
    "Stanislaus is very approachable and a great resource for the VSBA as well as having a broader historical understanding of architecture. He has a unique historian's understanding of architecture which enriches conversations though at times his interpretations seem difficult to identify with. He was a real pleasure to have as a professor and was a wonderful addition to Yale.Jimmy Stamp offered good insight and interesting comments."

   "comments": [
    "There should be more in-depth character\/firm courses like this at YSOA.While at first it seems too narrow a focus compared to other survey-like seminars, throughout the semester you're able to learn about so so many other ideas, architects, eras, places, etc. all tied together by your subject's narrative. Very enjoyable, and I feel like I actually learned something.",
    "make the course more about taking trips. I think Stanislaus should be allowed to take students on a longer single trip perhaps. He is good at provoking discussion and inspiring students to think outside the classroom.",
    "Maybe a visit to VSBA office would had been great.",
    "Required readings should be presented by students.Thursday morning prior to studio is a tough slot for any course.A new lecture on Koolhaas and Venturi: the definition of capital for each architect, and how each manipulates the market or is manipulated by it.",
    "Students should of presented course readings to encourage reading and discussion in class."
