    "Everyone appreciates music to some degree, even if they have very little musical background. This was the case for me. I found that this course really helped me put music into context and better understand my feelings about it and how it has developed with time.",
    "I developed a whole host of listening skills, as well as appreciation for Western art music.",
    "We learned some music history",
    "better understanding of music history and music as product of various innovations and movements in both music itself and culture",
    "I learned about how \"high\" music has transformed over the last two hundred years. There was less listening than I'd have liked and than I'd been expecting based on other reviews. I don't think that reading the book was very helpful, and since I was taking the class Cr\/D (you need to read the book for the pop quizzes if you care about your grade), I didn't. But I don't feel like that significantly detracted from my learning.",
    "Excellent course! I knew very little about music history and found this course wonderful. Both Josh and Prof. Kreutzer were so knowledgeable and willing to help. One of my favorite courses for sure.",
    "I learned about music and history. I learned musical terms as well as facts about how and why western art music has changed over time. I learned a general timeline of music history over the past two hundred years as well as specific information about important figures and pieces. I developed the skill of listening to music, being able to focus on different parts and hear many different things, from the different kinds of instruments to other categorizations and patterns.",
    "I learned a ton about Western Art music history, as well as about general techniques for listening to art music.",
    "Vastly improved my listening skills. Learned how to appreciate gestures in western music and what they meant. Increased my understanding of the history of art greatly.",
    "Learned so much about not only Western music history but also art, culture, and history in general.",
    "I gained a vast knowledge of Western music from the 19th century to our current day. I also learned a lot about overall artistic trends and political climates of the time periods.",
    "How to listen to music and identify sections and themes.",
    "Enjoyable, comprehensive overview of 200 years of music history. Developed listening skills, really enjoyed analyzing each major composer's compositional characteristics and the fact that we listened to music examples rather than just talking in a bunch of esoteric terms. Great class that gives historical context and ties everything together.",
    "I've developed listening skills to recognize certain kinds of pieces and have gained the knowledge of which elements of music are emblematic of which era of music. I've also gained an understanding of how musicians frame their work as developments of and responses to previous music."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Kreuzer is wonderful and engaging, the readings are manageable and largely interesting, the assignments, quizzes, and exams are fair. I don't think I would change it.",
    "I think this class does well to develop skills that one might not have gained elsewhere: namely, how to listen to art music and understand it as a product of history as well as to understand how music affects culture in turn. However, I thought the description was a little misleading. Though a non music Major can take this class, it is for sure difficult to succeed in this class without prior exposure to music. I think additional sections as well as a slightly slower pace at the beginning could make this class better.",
    "Strength: some of the parables involving composers can be humorous Weakness: the grading was draconian. I know music theory, we all know music theory, we're not here for music theory. We're here for the history. Tell us more about the composers lives and the situations around them rather than going deep into the music theory. I know I know, you'll say the music theory IS the history, but no. Also get rid of the stupid quizzes. If you were to tell us WHEN the quizzes were, we'd actually read and learn the information. But by making the quizzes on random days, all you achieve is worse grades and making students hate the class.",
    "great teaching, wish grading was more clear - expectations are vague.",
    "Prof. Kreuzer is brilliant, lovely, and so nice. She really cares about her students and wants all of them to succeed. The course was very comprehensive, though I personally wish it had focused a bit more on listening, though I understand it's a history course. I was a bit misled because during shopping period, we spent a lot of time discussing instruments, musical forms, theory, sonata form, etc., so I was expecting the rest of the course to look like that, but it became much more history focused as time went on. I wish there had been some sort of concrete guide on V2 of each type of form (ternary, etc.) so that I could have had a slightly easier time studying it. I wish the lecture slides had been posted on V2 so I could have reviewed some of the things a bit better than I could with just my own notes.",
    "Excellent job, fair exams. Soemtimes the course got a bit technical musically, but I don't think that was really a problem. I find the earlier music period (pre-Schoenberg) more interesting than the later modern period, so maybe would have preferred and bit more focus on the earlier period? But I think the organization is fine as is.",
    "The strengths of this course are in the lectures, the teachers (professor and TA), and the assignments. I think the lectures were incredible because the professor is an amazing teacher who engaged us in the lecture by telling interesting things and making sure to involve us and make us think. Another strength was the listening sections, I felt those were really helpful and fun. I think the assignments were structured really well, I felt the exams were fair and the listening assignments were a great way to help me learn. Another strength was the pop quizzes, because they really made me do the reading and I felt they were good questions. However, one weakness from the pop quizzes is that they made me feel really stressed out. I really appreciated the forgiveness they had at the end with making the first quiz worth a bit less. Maybe there could be forgiveness built into the pop quizzes, so you can pick one to drop (but then maybe there could be more quizzes also). Another weakness is that I felt it was sometimes hard to review from my notes, so I wish I had a second resource to go to. The book was helpful for the first half of class but didn't have very much on modern stuff.",
    "This course was incredibly interesting and covered a ton of material. Loved every lecture!",
    "Great class overall, butI thought some of the listening assignments were poorly designed for example, mapping a piece's structure was a great exercise for Tchaikovsky, but it seemed like a less important way to understand Schoenberg. I also wish we had been permitted to use scores for those assignments I think it would have helped me dig deeper into the pieces.",
    "Very well-taught, interesting, engaging course that effectively taught non-music majors about western art music. The final few lectures were a tad rushed.",
    "Strengths: Amazing teacher, extremely well organized, amazing lectures, great subject manner. Weaknesses: towards the end of the year, the listening got a little long. There was one assignment where the listening was over an hour. Also, it was not always super clear where to find the readings and listenings.",
    "Gundula Kreuzer's incredible lectures are the best part of the course and an excellent reason to take it. The workload is manageable and the material is quite interesting, especially in the manner that she presents it.",
    "The course is very interesting and well-taught, just very dense.",
    "The strength and weakness of the course is breadth. I liked that there was a historical narrative moving forward through the material. However, I felt like a lot fo it fell into \"general knowledge\" we already had (about Romantic period, totalitarian regimes, etc)",
    "Strengths: i could tell the course was planned out very carefully. Everything was there for a reason and I really enjoyed nearly everything about the class. Weakness: some readings were redundant or too long",
    "I think the content of the course and the breadth it covers it a major strength of the course. The lectures were always well-delivered and chock full of material. One weakness was the pop quizzes. There are many better ways of evaluating students on the completion of the reading assignments, e.g. writing papers or even short reading responses. These kind of assignments require more thinking on part of the students and really require comprehension of the reading material as well as synthesis of ideas. Pop quizzes add an unnecessary amount of stress on students and don't allow students to expand their analytical and expository writing skills.",
    "Stengths: Goes very in depth. The big connections were made and it overall stayed on course. Weaknesses: Some parts dry, especially in the second half of the course.",
    "Though this class is taught as a lecture, Prof. Kreuzer still found ample ways to engage the class and make each student feel excited and personally invested in the material. All assessments were interesting and felt fairly graded and aided in the learning process. I really enjoyed the written listening assignments and felt that they very much elevated my own understanding of the material. I appreciated how the sections were divided up by previous musical experience, and felt that this division helped me get the most out of the meetings. Overall, I really loved this course!"

   "comments": [
    "An absolute must-take, whether or not you've had any previous exposure to music",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another students- there's something in it for everyone (regardless of experience with music).",
    "Yes, Professor Kreuzer is amazing.",
    "Would not recommend. Try to get another history class.",
    "sure, if you're interested in music history. this is not an easy class, however.",
    "This course is fun, but be careful: unlike some other reviews say, it's not especially easy\/gutty: if you don't have any music background, it will be a bit of a learning curve, and in general, you should only take it if you think you'll actually like music history; if you don't, you'll probably find the 75 minutes twice a week exceedingly boring (not at all because of the professor, just because music history is one of those things that it's really hard to get into if you aren't a fan of it). The listening assignments are pretty tough, especially if you have no music background whatsoever, and the exams were graded very precisely, though there was a decent curve as a result. I would recommend this course, but it is not a gut HU. It is not exceedingly difficult to succeed, and if you like music history, go for it, but if you don't, you will probably be really bored and struggle to gather the motivation to do the work. And you have to do the reading (pop quizzes) and come to class, which could be tiring at 2:30 pm.",
    "Excellent course! I knew very little about music history and found this course wonderful. Students had a wide range of musical background, but taking this course with no music theory background and little history knowledge did not affect my performance or enjoyment of the course at all. Both Josh and Prof. Kreutzer were so knowledgeable and willing to help. One of my favorite courses for sure.",
    "This was an AMAZING class. I had such a great time and I do not consider myself a \"humanities\" person and I REALLY do not consider myself a \"music\" person. I had little to no experience with the material, but I was still able to do well. The listening was a bit challenging but they are forgiving when you show that you tried, and the optional sections are really helpful for practicing that part. I learned a ton of interesting material that really helped fill in some cultural gaps. I feel like I have a solid sense of music and western art music now, which is nice. Of course there is a lot of emphasis on old white men, but I think the professor and TA do a great job of acknowledging that, especially when we started talking about the influence of jazz we spent a while discussing where jazz came from and the ways it was appropriated from the black musicians who invented it. This is a wonderful humanities credit that engaged me in a different way from a normal history class. Highly, highly recommend.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "This is the best class I've ever taken at Yale!",
    "Good class! A great way to learn basics of music history, and this course is definitely a low key option for those who don't want to take the higher level version of this course required for music majors.",
    "Terrific survey of post Mozart classical music. Prof Kreuzer is makes every lecture interesting and engaging .",
    "Absolutely take this class. I took it partly to fulfill my HU credit and it was one of my favorite classes ever. It does help enormously if you have some experience reading music. If you have any interest in music as an art, definitely take it.",
    "Absolutely! One of the best courses I've taken at Yale -- recommended for everyone, not just the musically-inclined.",
    "Yes, most definitely. It was incredibly insightful.",
    "The material taught in this class is very interesting, although the readings can be pretty long at times. The course claims that no previous musical experience is necessary, but it definitely is difficult if you don't.",
    "Yes! I would note that the strength and weakness of the course is breadth. I liked that there was a historical narrative moving forward through the material. However, I felt like a lot fo it fell into \"general knowledge\" we already had (about Romantic period, totalitarian regimes, etc)",
    "Yes! This was an incredible class that taught me more than I thought I'd learn, and probably the first lecture class where I was actually fully engaged the entire time, every single class. The music listening examples and readings are carefully chosen, plus the professor and TA really care about the students and are willing to help in any way possible so that we can learn and enjoy the class. The final's listening portion was a little bit unrealistic though--memorizing the year, composer, and full title of 69 different pieces and having to be able to ID all that based on a 20-second clip played during the final. I usually enjoy memorization but that was overwhelming for even me. Also the pop quizzes probably ruined my grade because some of the reading was dense so I didn't do it.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who's interested in learning about the historical and musical developments of some of the most exciting musical periods in history. I took this course as a sophomore STEM major with no other purpose besides enriching my own knowledge of music history, and it was a phenomenal learning experience. In high school, I had played the piano seriously, but this course really doesn't require much knowledge about music to be enriching. After taking the course, I've learned why music from a certain era is played a certain way, how the western canon of music has changed and developed since 1800, and how social and political movements, viewed in with a wide historical lens, influenced the western art music world. The workload is manageable, and you should complete all readings to get the most out of the course. Tests really only require you to memorize facts, but it's a lot of information to know, and this ultimately benefits you if you're interested in learning the material. I wouldn't take this course if you're not interested in the material.",
    "If you don't have prior music knowledge, this probably isn't the best class for you unless you plan on taking it credit\/d\/fail. Overall, it's a solid course, but lectures can be tedious at times. There's not that much work though, but the pop quizzes are annoying.",
    "Absolutely would recommend. The workload is more than manageable and all assignments are a joy to complete. The course is very much a history course, but feels so much more engaging and fun because a large part of both class time and homework is listening. Professor Kreuzer couldn't be more excited about what she's teaching, and makes the lectures engaging and fascinating. Take it!"
