    "Cool class, a lot of interesting information, and a very interesting culture to study.Unfortunately, the information from the readings and lecture was a little broad and somewhat unorganized, making it hard to prepare for the exams.However, the essay for the class is great; you can write about whatever you want. The weekly quizzes are fair, and not too tricky.As this was easily one of the most fascinating cultures I have ever studied, I would recommend the course for sure.",
    "This class requires a strong interest in Maya history, archaeology, and architecture. I found this class a boring, but that may be because I am not deeply interested in the Maya. I found there was a lot of focus on the specifics - types of architecture, pottery, and other artifacts found - and less discussion of the society as a whole. I thought there would be a little more anthropology involved, but it was really mostly just going over the various artifacts found. If you are very interested in Archaeology and the Maya, then take it (you might enjoy it), but if not, I would avoid this class.",
    "A class that will expose you to lots of history and a new culture and it is very well taught.",
    "It's a good class, but a bit awkward being in a lecture with only seven people. The weekly quizzes got old, too, even though they weren't particularly hard. Still, the material was really interesting and the tests and paper weren't that bad, so go for it!",
    "You read various chapters from two books each week to prepare for the lectures. You also read additional essays that relate to the theme of the week's readings. I would recommend this course to students who have great interest in the ancient Maya and who do not have a problem with taking a history-type class because when it comes to the exams, memorization is necessary - not everyone enjoys this type of course."
