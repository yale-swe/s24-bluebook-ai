   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class if you are interested in the material. If you are not, this class can be a lot of work, and you need to be prepared for each class to truly get the most out of it.",
    "You read a small book a week, and write 3 essays and 1 final oral. It is not an overwhelming amount of work at all. I would definitely recommend it, although at points, because we weren't working on grammar, it felt like I lost some of my skills.",
    "Yes, great class!",
    "Go for it! Especially with Pinzka. If you need that last language credit, or just like French and want to read some lit, this is a great way to get it. Pinzka is a great prof and makes the class enjoyable. There's a decent amount of work but it's totally doable and not stressful at all.",
    "Yes! This is a great introduction to French Literature and Madame Pinzka is super sweet and helpful. You will get to read some great works and although class is long, it really goes by much more quickly than other hour and 15 min classes.",
    "Good class to take after 150 or 160. Word of warning -- there is a lot of reading. Taking this as a fifth class was a challenge. I did not get to all of the reading and it made the class much more stressful, and I probably would've read a lot more in a four course semester.",
    "definitely take it with pinzka! a good 5th class I thought.",
    "Definitely recommended. Probably a bit easier and a bit less work than 160 (I took it with Schneider). Helps you a lot especially with your reading. Madame Pinzka is really great!",
    "I encourage students interested in improving their argumentative French to take this course. Keep in mind, however, that the course reading, which spans for the Middle Ages to the 20th century, can be difficult in terms of quantity (depending on your proficiency, of course) especially when you factor in coursework from your other classes--we read one book per week on average. It's frustrating then for those who like to look up extra vocabulary and prepare answers to discussion questions etc. The three essays therefore allow you to meditate on selected works longer while improving your written french. (Except for the final essay, you can submit revisions.) That having been said, my spoken french suffered quite a bit. Professor Pinzka does a wonderful job of encouraging everyone's participation, but the class only meets twice per week for 75 minutes--and no one person speaks for that long. Furthermore, students didn't foster a french-speaking culture--speaking french only when they HAD too making it harder, I think, to transition into conversational french during class time--I found this disappointing after a full-immersion experience the previous summer.",
    "A very good course if you are interested in French literature. The books and novels we read in class are all very interesting and cover a variety of topics, and the professor explains ideas pretty well. The workload is manageable, and remember to go to Pinzka\u0092s office hours for help with anything. She is a very nice person and really cares about helping you improve your writing. Overall I would recommend this course to another student."
