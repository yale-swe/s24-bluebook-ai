    "It's an introduction to the scroll with a focus on the theoretical and methodological problems that result in editing, naming, and categorizing unknown fragmentary works. I would absolutely recommend it. The theoretical questions are so often just assumptions that we make, and this class is a good place to think about how those assumptions are made, and whether they should be repeated.",
    "It serves as an excellent introduction to all aspects of the Scrolls.",
    "Really productive class. I would absolutely recommend to anyone wishing to hone their linguistic skills on, and general familiarity with the Scrolls."

    "It was, for me, an introduction to a number of concepts and conversations that were happening around a number of the scrolls. The extend to which it contributes to my research is yet to be seen, though I am confident that it will.",
    "I was exposed to a lot of material in the Dead Sea Scrolls, and many scholars in the field. This class was epic.",
    "This course was very helpful in depending my understanding of the Scrolls while also challenging my assumptions for biblical studies in general. I think that this course will have a considerable impact on the work in do in my dissertation.",
    "This class was incredibly formative for me as I think about my dissertation project. It opened me up to a series of approaches to the material aspects of ancient texts that I had not yet been exposed to. I have no doubt that the work that I did for this class will form the basis for a larger project down the line."
