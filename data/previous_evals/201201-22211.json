    "Worth it if you read all the books, and really care about the material",
    "A very very good class. You will learn a lot about an issue that a lot of people pretend to know a lot about. The issues are complex and the recurring questions just mindblowing and almost frustrating. You come out with more questions than answers, definitely don't miss it if you're EP&E or PLSC.",
    "It's a fair amount of reading, but the guest lecturers were absolutely worth all the reading (you have about 5 in the last weeks of the course), so you can speak intelligently about these topics by the time important guests come in.",
    "Class hit on very emotionally arousing topics which made for great class discussion. Super relavant for equal opportunity rights in many fields especially education and employment. Also had some high profile guest lectures which made conversation even richer and well founded.",
    "Yes, great course which talks about affirmative action broadly. It makes you think about the crux of issues of equality and diversity. The class discusses affirmative action from philosophical, legal, and policy perspectives.",
    "The class is a look at the history and modern interpretation of preferential treatment, particularly in college admissions and employment."
