    "Very useful course if you are intending on pursuing a career involving research.",
    "it was good but not geared towards specific grants which made it a bit hard",
    "Good",
    "This was a great course, very practical and useful. I can't think of any weakeness.",
    "Very practical course for anyone who is planning on going into academic research. Unfortunately there were no examples of different types of NIH grants according to the new standards.",
    "Great course, especially for those who will be submitting grants in the near future!",
    "I feel like this class should only be taken by those who have preliminary results or who are needing to actually submit the grant.",
    "Excellent opportunity to write an NIH-style grant and to learn about the granting process. Adrienne is flexible about letting students write different types of grants besides R01s. My only suggestion for improvement would be that there were times when it seemed a bit disorganized (wrong syllabus was posted to the website initially, people therefore weren't clear on exactly which sections of the grants were due) but when this happened Adrienne was flexible and fixed the problem.",
    "Useful course in theory, but not immediately useful in my case, as I will not be in a position to write an R01 grant for another 8-10 years."

    "This course provided very comprehensive instructions on the development of high-quality NIH grant proposals. I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning more about the grant writing process.",
    "Course provides many useful skills. I have had opportunity to think more carefully about my research and I've got feedback at class.",
    "Good opportunity to write a grant, particularly if it's one that you're actually going to submit.",
    "Useful, but best to go in with a draft of a grant already in the works, otherwise too much work for payoff that is far removed."
