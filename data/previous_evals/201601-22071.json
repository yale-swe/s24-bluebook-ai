   "comments": [
    "If you're at all interested in drugs, then this is a great class to take. While it certainly isn't a gut class for a science credit, it's incredibly interesting, and you'll leave the class really feeling that you've learned something important from it.",
    "Great course, but definitely not a gut. You will have to work hard and really learn the material, but there are opportunities for extra credit. Would absolutely recommend the class to another student. Still worth it to audit or Cr\/D\/F if you don't want to worry about your grade so much. HOWEVER, I would have dropped it if Prof. Kober hadn't been teaching it.",
    "High recommend, must be taught again. Important subject to know, especially since we all use drugs. Better know what you're doing to yourself and putting in your body and make sure you're okay with that first.",
    "Would recommend, you'll learn a ton and Prof. Kober is a fantastic lecturer. Not necessarily an easy class, though -- lots of content. Exams are fair.",
    "Great course! Absolutely necessary and everyone should take it. Not only do drugs and the people around you who choose to consume them affect you, but policies on drugs have shaped our entire criminal justice system, perpetuated mass incarceration and resulted in a prolonged series of injustices that you can only fully appreciate if you take this class. In one word: excellent.",
    "Would highly recommend. Be prepared to 1) come to class and 2) log some hours studying for the exams. Overall though workload totally reasonable, just heavier during the exam weeks, and you learn a lot of cool stuff.",
    "This is a fantastic course. As for difficulty, the exams take a while to study for because there is so much material, but I would not say that the material itself is difficult, even for a non-science major. As for content, the first third of the class is background science that you need to know to understand the rest, the second third is fantastic info about drugs, and the final third is really interesting and important stuff about treatment and prevention that everyone should know. As for teaching, professor Kober is a wonderful person and honestly a really great lecturer.",
    "Fun class with interesting subject matter, but there is a lot to memorize. Be warned that this isn't a gut class and you will have to study a lot for it. I liked studying for it though because of how interesting and relevant it is to my life. There was also an amazing guest lecture that really changed my view on drugs.",
    "PLEASE TAKE PSYC 161 BEFORE YOU GRADUATE (OR AFTER YOU GRADUATE). It was the perfect balance of a social science (psychology) and biological stuff (neuroscience). All of the information I learned in class was so relevant to life, and I talked about the class pretty much every day (to the point that I think my friends and family were annoyed). And Professor Kober is AMAZING and super engaging! She goes really fast and there's a ton of material --- so DON'T go into this class thinking it's going to be easy. If you're willing to put in the time and studying, you'll get so much out of the class!",
    "Definitely not a gut science, but can be done without science background if you put in the work! The tests are really hard and require a ton of studying but it can be done, and is worth it because the information is genuinely interesting!",
    "! Awesome class that starts in neuroanatomy and how the brain works. Then it covers drugs and how they work. Then it finally discusses drug policy, and addiction recovery\/treatment. If you're at all curious about neuroscience and how drugs actually work and you want to work for it, take this class.",
    "A really good, practical, applicable class. I think the key to doing well is constantly reviewing the material, because it all builds on top of each other. A friend and I would review the previous lecture before class each time, and that really helped. Tests have questions that she mentioned maybe once in class (I never did the reading, so didn't know if it was emphasized there) but you can choose out of questions on the test which to answer, which was good. Final paper was easy but felt a bit pointless and fill in the blank. Overall, Professor Kober really cares, and likes talking about the material. She's a really engaging lecturer (this is the only class where I never worried about falling asleep, unless the TAs were lecturing), and I learned a lot about safe drug habits.",
    "I would!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! You probably have never had a lecturer as great as Dr. Kober. She is engaging and clearly puts a TON of thought into each lecture. She wants nothing more than for each of her students to succeed, and her dedication to that is more than evident. The material is the class is challenging at times, but fascinating and extraordinarily relevant. There is a lot of information presented in each lecture, but the slides are posted online, so if you listen carefully and take studious notes, you should be fine. The exams are challenging, but very fair. On each exam there was a lot of freedom as to which questions you answered (i.e. you could eliminate a certain number of questions). We live in the era of the War on Drugs, and this class is a perfect introduction to all the science behind it. This class has made me a significantly more well-informed person, and I am forever grateful to Dr. Kober for this experience.",
    "PSYC 161 is a great course if you are interested in biology, the science of drugs, or psychology. Just know that the second midterm and the final are very difficult, and it does take a lot of work to do well in the course.",
    "All I would say is take this class and do the readings. I would recommend it to anyone.",
    "Psyc 161 is very much about drugs and the brain, but not so much about behavior. I wanted to learn more about the social aspects of drug use, but this class was very much focussed on the neurological components of drug action. It was very interesting, and very well taught (professor Kober is amazing) but make sure this class is what you want before you sign up. The concepts are not that difficult but there is A LOT of memorization. If you take this class, pay attention in lecture, read the studies, and don't fall behind.",
    "If you don't already have a grasp on some neuroscience or haven't taken other psychology classes, you will struggle, all alone, because everyone else has. Hard tests and a lot of material to remember. It's all about memorization. TAs aren't helpful and are prone to making mistakes so double check your grades.",
    "A class that makes you think about drugs in a new way",
    "Loved it! Take this class if you have any interest in drugs and the brain, or if you like memorization.",
    "A great introduction to neuroscience through an interesting topic. I would definitely recommend it to any one interested in how psychoactive drugs affect the brain on the molecular level.",
    "It's a lot of information and it feels hard, but if you just go to lecture and make sure you don't fall behind, you'll be fine. Take the class. You'll learn a lot and it's a great SC credit.",
    "Absolutely. This is definitely not the easiest course, and if you are taking it for a grade I would definitely recommend taking PSYC 160 first or preparing to do about double the amount of study as you would for other Psych classes to get an A, but at the end of the day I'm not sure I've learned as much from a single class at Yale. Plus, I know more about one of the most interesting subjects out there, Drugs!",
    "A good class that is a must-take because of all the useful information taught in the class. However, it is not an easy class and requires a lot of studying.",
    "One of the most difficult yet most interesting classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Kober talks very very fast but does stop often to see if you have questions and to let you catch up. You'll have to put in the work to understand the basic neural processes in order to be prepared for each specific drug process later on, but she does make the class accessible for everyone, even if you have no neuroscience\/psych background. I honestly feel like anyone who takes drugs (even caffeine) should take this class because you'll learn so much that you never thought of\/never knew and come out knowing how to make better decisions for yourself and your friends. Would definitely recommend this class, but be prepared to work hard!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Its material covers a range of psychoactive drugs from both a neurobiological and social perspective. I think the strongest aspect of this course is its discussion of the neurobiological mechanisms of actions of drugs, and the pharmacological mechanisms of their short-term and long-term effects. The lectures move very quickly and you end up being responsible for quite a large amount of information, but besides that it's a very manageable class. The material is both very interesting and (probably) immediately relevant to your personal life.",
    "Psyc 161 was a great class, but you have to be dedicated to learning the material.",
    "I loved this class. It's not a gut, but it's really not that hard if you're good at memorizing things. The lectures were super interesting, and the wider scope of the class (from biological mechanisms to US drug policy) make it really fun. I would recommend this class to anyone who has any interest in the area. I came in somewhat interested, and left super interested.",
    "I recommend this course to non-science majors who are looking for something that is within their abilities, but also something that offers somewhat of a challenge.",
    "Drugs class was simply incredible. Professor Kober is a brilliant and engaging lecturer, and I cannot even comprehend how this class has already begun to shape and change the way I approach daily decisions. How alcohol impacts sleep and memory, when to drink coffee, what the consequences will be of experimenting with this or that... honestly, aside from probably being one of the most engaging and relevant Sc lectures out there, this course is as valuable to take as a life-advice experience than the other classic Yale courses that are viewed the same way. As an interdisciplinary student and thinker, I loved how this class combined very comprehensive science material with a contextual framework that is, above all else, human. Prof. Kober's mantra is real: there has never been a drug free society. So why not invest one credit to change the way you look at the world forever? (Also, mastering neurotransmission unlocks plenty of other areas of study...a nice bonus.) Professor Kober is hip, relatable, open, and has plenty of incredible life experience under her belt to boot. Yes, she does speak quickly. The result? You stay awake. Yes, she does give a few surprise quizzes. The result? You learn more. Prof. Kober literally studies the process of learning and she knows how to hit home with a whole heap of information and have it stick. TAKE IT",
    "GREAT course! NOT a gut, so if thats what your looking for dont take it. But if youre interested in actually learning something for an SC credit, definitely take it!",
    "This class is definitely not a gut, but an interesting science credit.",
    "Drugs, Brain and Behavior is a very interesting class. You'll leave with a very thorough understanding of how drugs effect the body. However, it is not a gut. The class doesn't move extremely fast; I never felt lost or overwhelmed, but you do cover a massive amount of material which can make exams a little daunting. If you took Psych 160 Human Brain, you will have a much easier time during the first half of the semester, but it is not necessary to have that background.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who are genuinely interested in psychopharmacology (Not just any drugs, but psychoactive drugs). This class reviews many basic neuroscience principles. Students who have a strong background in neuroscience will not feel adequately challenged by this course; this is especially true for the first few weeks.",
    "Absolutely. Put in the work, and the class will be incredibly rewarding.",
    "The class was a good introduction to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of various psychoactive drugs. I would recommend this class to fellow psychology majors but do not expect it to focus on psychiatric treatments. Rather, it deals more with neurotransmission and how mostly recreational drugs affect synapses and ultimately behavior."
