   "comments": [
    "Take English 114! If you can, take Everything Is a Remix with Emily Hayman! It is a great small and friendly environment where you get to read interesting texts and learn writing skills that will help in writing your papers.",
    "I think that your enjoyment in this course depends largely on the students in your class -- the students in my class were not engaged and it bothered me tremendously.",
    "Take this class to get a good foundation in writing. Otherwise, I'd recommend taking a higher level writing credit. The material was interesting, but the writing assignments very closely guide your way through writing a paper, so it feels like you're constantly writing throughout the course--whether it be draft zero or a final draft. I think that aspect of the course was a bit draining on me, since writing is not a strong point for me, but again it might be more beneficial for others.",
    "Everything is a Remix. Original thought is always comprised of other ideas and it is questionable whether it is actually original, but through this \"remix\", a new creation is made. This course explores just about everything and it is definitely a course people should take.",
    "I definitely would recommend it. Even though there was a lot of work it improved my writing skills tremendously and it was a very fun class.",
    "Each section of English 114 is on a different topic (mine was \"Everything is a Remix\"), but all are writing seminars designed to get you into college writing. It's a valuable course to take, and you will probably bond with the ~12 other people taking it with you. I don't think Everything is a Remix will be offered again, or at least not with Emily, but it is very interesting and presents a number of topics I hadn't considered before. Be warned that the description of a section's theme may differ from what the course is like, so you may want to shop multiple 114 seminars if possible.",
    "A great introductory writing course that challenges you to really think about originality and its value.",
    "An amazing and fun introductory writing class."
