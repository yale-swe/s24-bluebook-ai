    "Chinese 150 is a very good Chinese class at Yale. While your speaking fluency will definitely decrease after a summer in China, you will get a good understanding of grammar, learn more characters, and explore a wide variety of cultural topics. Characters and grammar are heavily stressed in this course. All of the laoshis are fantastic!",
    "This course is a lot of work, but you learn a lot about Chinese language and culture. You have a 600 character essay every week, which is really helpful. The classes are pretty small, so everybody gets a decent amount of practice time.",
    "It depends. If you're just looking to continue your Chinese and learn more things, then go on and do it, but remember if you went to China ever summer, then this might be a rather frustrating start to the term, it might seem slower and as if you are not learning as much, but then grit your teeth for a while and you will get back into the flow of it all."
