    "It would be useful if we got our problem sets back so we know if we answered the questions right or wrong. It would also help if a practice midterm and practice final was posted on canvas, as I was unsure what the questions were going to be like on the actual exam.",
    "The material is tough, and the professor did not help with that. The lectures could be confusing and convoluted, and the homework relies heavily on programming because the equations are too hard to solve analytically. We only got one homework back because there was no TF.",
    "This course NEEDS to have a TA or TF or someone other than the professor to help explain topics and hold extra office hours when the multiple explanations of the professor ultimately do not make sense no matter how many times they try.",
    "The content covered in this course was very theoretical and I think I will have difficulty applying it to real engineering problems in the future.I suggest the curriculum be switched to solving more practical problems. We also only received a single homework back, so there was a significant lack of good feedback.",
    "The class is pretty disorganized and random in terms of the general outline of concepts. We seemed to jump around a lot and it just wasnt really structured too well.",
    "More application",
    "This course was much too theoretical. Additionally, it assumed an unreasonable level of previous knowledge.",
    "A different professor might more successfully organize the class and convey the material.",
    "Overall an engaging, well structured class. My suggestion would be to more slowly go through the more difficult sections and spend less time in review.",
    "Very poorly organized class with an intensive workload that is so difficult homework assignments were frequently extended."
