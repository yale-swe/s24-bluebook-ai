    "I honestly have very little criticism of this course. Chris has been a professor at Yale for over 50 years, and it really shows. The assignments are structured (this is more of a design course rather than an art course), but I liked being able to solve a specific problem. The assignments were interesting and it is helpful to see your classmates' projects too. Maybe a little more specific criticism from Chris himself would be helpful, but then again I appreciate how he allows each student to develop his or her own style, but overall extremely approachable and helpful professor"
