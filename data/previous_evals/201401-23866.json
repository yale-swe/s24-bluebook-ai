   "comments": [
    "good class, pretty straightforward in terms of math, definitely review some of your basic concepts beforehand if you havent done math in a while, like now im doing well but the beginning was a struggle. one pset a week, a midterm and a final, just go to lecture and youll do fine on everything. (sometimes its hard because its so early but just do it and thank me later). frame is really an amazing person and its great to be in class and just receive his wisdom. good class for nonsci\/math people because its kinda interesting and he says a lot of existential stuff that you get to mull over.",
    "Exploring different mathematical patterns in nature. Some calculus knowledge required.",
    "Take the class you want to know about math you won't learn in any other math class. Even if you are a mathy or sciency person, if you haven't really taught of how math can be used to understand the natural world, take the class!",
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale, and Prof. Frame is one of the best teachers I've ever had. Wouldn't change a thing! Take it if you can get in.",
    "Professor Frame described the course to me as \"Stuff Michael Frame Finds Interesting.\" Fortunately, that stuff is pretty interesting too. This course is definitely harder than Fractal Geo but not too hard. It's probably about an hour of work a week and the midterm and final are open note. It's a very good fifth class. Professor Frame is passionate and delightful and the topics are usually interesting, though mostly not really about the natural world just related to it.",
    "Math 170 covers a wide range of topics from fractals to population growth to relativity. The math in the class ranges from basic euclidian geometry to single-variable calculus The class has a p set due every thursday, one midterm, and one final both open note. The professor is amazing!! I highly recommend it to everyone no matter what your area of interest is.",
    "Fractals, spacetime, non-Euclidean geometries, fun algebra. Good course.",
    "YES.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone with some calculus and who wants to take a weird and interesting math course",
    "Yes, not particularly hard and Michael Frame is awesome",
    "I would recommend this class to non-math majors who are interested in the subject matter. The class itself is not too difficult, with short weekly problem sets and open-note exams. And, if you commit to staying engaged, the material is fascinating.",
    "Take this class. The material is so interesting and workload is pretty minimal. The tests are fair and open notes, and the concepts are not overly difficult, but super cool. You get to learn things that you really wouldn't be exposed to elsewhere, from fractals to chaos theory to black holes. Frame manages to touch on some awesome concepts without going into too much mathematical detail.",
    "Great course to take to get used to college mathematics",
    "I would definitely recommend this class--although sometimes the material was difficult, it was always really interesting, and Professor Frame is a great teacher.",
    "I recommend Math 170 with Michael Frame wholeheartedly. It was an easy way to fulfill a QR requirement, but not too easy, and you wind up learning a lot of interesting things about math in the natural world.",
    "A wonderful history of the world of man through the perspective of a brilliant kind man.",
    "Take this course if you want to take a semi-serious math course that isn't pure math. This is a math applications course that uses mathematical methods to calculate interesting things about our natural world.",
    "I would summarize it as a different mathematics course focusing on natural patterns that are oftentimes overlooked. It was easily one of my favorite classes I've taken thus far, and I highly recommend this class to anyone with a decent grasp on mathematics. Seriously, take this class!",
    "Math 170 is a terrific course if you are looking for a QR credit but want to learn interesting material. The work for the course itself is not difficult\u2014the weekly psets will not take too long. However, the class is never boring because the material, though not difficult, is conceptually fascinating",
    "I took this course to fulfill my Quantitative Reasoning distributional requirement. At first, the course seemed reasonable, however, by the end of the semester it became the most difficult and frustrating course I have taken at Yale. Although the material was fascinating and Professor Frame was supportive, by the end of the semester I did not feel I had the tools or the understanding to solve the problems I was presented with. I would recommend this course to students who have a very strong grounding in calculus and who have not taken a break from mathematics while at Yale. Despite the interesting subject matter and kind professor, I would not recommend this class to students who are looking for a QR credit or have not spent their time at Yale studying mathematics."
